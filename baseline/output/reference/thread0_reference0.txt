We are trying to do advanced planning for a F2F in September. 
 Because of the membership overlap with the OASIS BPEL TC, we would like to try and co-locate with their meetings.  This is not a joint meeting, and is being proposed purely to ease travel logistics and members' costs. 
 The OASIS TC is proposing to meet 17 (afternoon), 18, and 19 September, either in Seattle or Germany.  Thus it makes sense to try and meet on 15, 16, and 17 (Morning) September. 
 SAP is in Waldorf not far from Heidelberg 
 if its in germany those that want to attend both meetings get a weekend in Heidelburg. 
 If BPEl decides to meet in Seattle I'm not sure many would have such a weekend stayover.
