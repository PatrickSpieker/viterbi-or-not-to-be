<intro>
Welcome to the first issue of KC GNUe! Thanks (I think!) to Jeff Bailey
for persuading me to volunteer for this, and to Zack Brown for his help
and patience in sorting out my first draft. This Cousin will cover
the IRC channel for GNUe (and some mailing lists as well). For more
information about the GNU Enterprise project, see their home page at 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org">http://www.gnuenterprise.org</a>.

<p>Michael Dean (mdean) said that <quote who="Michael Dean">a new release 
(feature wise) is probably about 3 or 4 weeks away,</quote> since the 
database upgrade was going to be huge. As of this writing, he may make an 
interim bug fix/small feature release to get some of the email support 
down.</p>

   title="GNUe Common vs. GNU Comm project"

<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) pointed out that 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">this abstraction thingy GComm</quote> could be 
confused with the GNU Comm project. But as far as Jason Cater (jcater) was 
concerned, <quote who="Jason Cater">GComm is our internal package name... 
to the external world, it's GNUe Common,</quote> but said that was a good 
point. Later, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) explained that pyro was an object 
system like GComm would be, written <quote who="Derek Neighbors">by the same 
guys that wrote pygmy, the python email client.</quote></p>

<p>Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) needed <quote who="Charles Rouzer">a production 
quality GNUe web shopping cart ;-)</quote>. Instead, he was looking to 
customize Interchange to provide a web shopping cart using PHP. Jason Cater 
(jcater) said that, although GNUe Inventory was not yet completed, you should be 
able to access another inventory package via GNUe Applications Server. 
However, the web interface for GNUe Forms was still in the works, as 
Michael Maluck (madlocke) had been quite ill.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.28Oct2001">
Four days later</a>, Charles asked if anyone had seen Michael Maluck
(madlocke). Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) wanted to know 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">did he ever give up the code for this web forms 
stuff? Or it still a mystical imaginary animal?</quote></p>
