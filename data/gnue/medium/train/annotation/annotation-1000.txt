<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>Peter Sullivan (psu) said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">I have added a 
"<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/community/involve.php">Get 
Involved</a>" page to the website - mainly for 
a link to a good external article</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) 
wondered <quote who="Jason Cater">does it involve "Send 
donuts"?</quote> Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we need a 
HOW DO I HELP PAGE - as that is number one question we get at 
info@gnue.org - hmmm this page might do the trick :)</quote>. 
He asked for the contact address for documentation bugs/patches 
to be changed to docs-support@gnuenterprise.org rather than 
info@gnue.org, so they would feed directly into DCL via the 
e-mail gateway. The <quote who="Derek Neighbors">other thing we need 
if it doesnt exist is either a 'license page' or better yet right on 
the home page - add somethign that says gnue tools/packages are GPL
- as i know my pet peeve in getting new software is hunting down what 
license its under before downloading. We make lots of reference to 
freesoftware and even fsf, but i dont see clarification where we state 
we are GPL</quote> Peter agreed - <quote who="Peter Sullivan">most 
people should hopefully be able to guess that GNU* == GPL, but why not 
tell 'em outright?</quote> He would add it to the front page.</p>
 
<p>Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) suggested <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">you 
may want to reassure people that using GNUe doesn't make their stuff 
GPL - as i've heard people worry about that before (interesting problem 
there)</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">true... maybe 
point to gpl faq as well</quote>. Andrew asked 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">applications that hook into GNUe common, 
what license would they fall under?</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if you used common via 'import type 
statements and such' i think your resulting application would need to 
be GPL - if you used it via RPC it could be anything you 
like</quote> as you were simply using rather than linking to the code.</p>
