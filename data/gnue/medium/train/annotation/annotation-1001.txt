<topic>Forms</topic>
<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) suggested that the Debian packages 
should eventually be structured with a 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">gnue-forms-base</quote>, with a 
seperate gnue-forms package for each user interface - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">gnue-forms-gtk2, gnue-forms-curses, 
gnue-forms-wx, gnue-forms-html etc</quote>, each with their 
own dependencies. Likewise, there could be a 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">gnue-common-base</quote> and 
then seperate packages for each database driver - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">to give people finer grain control 
of the install</quote>. Jeff Bailey (jbailey) agreed -
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">I think that's the plan.
certainly for forms anyway. The hard part with doing it too much 
is that people will never figure out what to install.</quote>
Derek suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">couldnt we do 
something like task-gnue - for the people that dont want 
control</quote>.</p>
