<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) continued to make progress on the 
item maintenance screen for GNUE-SB. He needed format masks, 
but according to the Developers' Documentation, it 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">looks like masks arent quite there 
yet</quote>. He <quote who="Derek Neighbors">just committed the 
item_maint.gfd that actually manages the items - so item management 
is now officially in gnue-sb cvs - its basic but its a 
start</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, he said he had worked around not having format masks for 
the moment, but wondered where this fitted in the Feature Plans -
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we need to add number/currency 
format/input masks - and documentation of masks :)</quote>. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">input masks are 
a BIG todo - we are very close - but no cigar quite yet (that 
should be in 0.5.0 plans, if not, I'll add)</quote>, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">although most of the backend is in 
there</quote>.</p>
