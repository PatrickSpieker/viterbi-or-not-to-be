<topic>Forms</topic>
<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbors) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we 
need an easy way to do transaction stamping i.e. createdon/by, 
modifiedon/by</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said there was 
<quote who="Jason Cater">a REAL easy way to do transaction 
stamping - they're called Pre-Update and Pre-Insert triggers</quote>
- <quote who="Jason Cater">same principle as setting the sequence 
value on an insert</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) said 
<quote who="James Thompson">no, we need a real, real way :)</quote> 
- just like the getSequence function, <quote who="James Thompson">you 
also have getTimestamp</quote>.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, Derek then came up against a case where he 
needed to use getSequence - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the classic
'the parent needs to create its id in order to store in the child' 
problem - do you have a sample form that this works in 
currently?</quote> Jason asked <quote who="Jason Cater">are they 
set up as master/detail? as it does all that behind the scenes if 
so</quote>. Otherwise, <quote who="Jason Cater">check the recipe's 
chapter in the dev guide</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.17Nov2002">
The next day</a>, Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">we have 
a createdon recipe - but createdby - who is "by" ?</quote> 
James said <quote who="James Thompson">i think he wants the 
username of the logged in user</quote>. Derek agreed - he
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">wasnt sure how to get that info 
via trigger</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I 
know we can do that via triggers - but we probably need to add 
a convenience method</quote>. Derek asked 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">what if you are using a custom 
'authenicator'</quote>? He had <quote who="Derek Neighbors">had 
to make all my 'transactional' stuff like that nullable for now 
in gnue-sb - until i get good trigger way to do it (or a 
convenience method) - then i will add it back in. /me thinks 
the date part is taken care of - if the db is setup properly</quote>
then the "created on" field <quote who="Derek Neighbors">should 
use function that posts timestamp if null else 
nothing if there - and the modified should use function that 
posts timestamp no matter what - though it would be better to 
amke it in application i think</quote>.</p>
