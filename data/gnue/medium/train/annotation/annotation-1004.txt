<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said he was trying to get a 
form to work - <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">like automagically 
inserting sequence numbers for master/detail</quote>. 
James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">that 
should be in the docs as a recipe IIRC</quote>. Andrew noted 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">mysql's auto_increment doesn't 
work for master/detail, nor is it friendly :)</quote>. James 
suggested <quote who="James Thompson">i think if you implenet 
sequenceNumber in the mysql driver then you'd have them - i 
_think_</quote>. Andrew said <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">all 
i want is for the primary key (id) to be set for each record 
:) - and the value being set to be visible to the detail 
portion</quote>. James said <quote who="James Thompson">that's 
automatic on a commit in common - however getting the initial 
value from the db isn't IIRC - if you do the assignment on the 
database side then you have issues IIRC</quote>. He suggested 
<quote who="James Thompson">a db side trigger or a default 
value set to a function</quote>. Andrew pointed out 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">triggers? what's that? this is 
mysql i'm using :)</quote> James asked how the primary keys 
were being generated. Andrew said 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">at the moment, i have the primary 
key field set to auto_increment in the db - which sucks</quote>.
James said <quote who="James Thompson">hey! auto_increement == 
db side trigger! see, it's more advance than i give it 
credit</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) asked 
<quote who="Jason Cater">do you know the name of the sequence 
it created?</quote> Andrew did not think that sequences had 
names that could be referenced in mySQL. Jason went 
<quote who="Jason Cater">googling for the answer</quote>.</p>

<p>Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">the 
lesson here kiddies - mysql sucks ass</quote>. Andrew said he did 
not have much choice as he was <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">developing 
something for systems already with mysql</quote>. Daniel suggested 
using the GNUe Schema Definition (.gsd) format to migrate to another 
database.</p>

<p>Andrew suggested that it <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">would probably 
be easier for me to get the current id value, increment it, and save it 
back</quote> - this would work with even simpler databases like sqlite 
and gadfly. James said the only sensible solution might be to get the 
GNUe triggers to handle assigning the primary keys - 
<quote who="James Thompson">create a table gnue_seed</quote>. Jason 
suggested <quote who="Jason Cater">that, or  select max(id)+1 from 
table;</quote> James added <quote who="James Thompson">then make the 
getSequence in the db driver read the seed via a select for update, 
update it, then have it print to the debug log "compensating for the 
lack of a sane database"</quote>. Andrew commented that he 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">would have thought this would be a 
2-minute thing with mysql, at most</quote>.</p>
