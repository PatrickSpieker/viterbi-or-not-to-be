<p>James Thompson (jamest) warned 
<quote who="James Thompson">stay away from cvs head - 
it should still work but jcater has commited the start of 
changes for 0.5.0. I will be branching 0.4.1 tomorrow to 
apply some patches and will be releasing 0.4.2 of at least 
forms later in the week</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Derek Neighbors (derek) asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">is 
new gnue in sid?</quote> Jeff said <quote who="Jeff Bailey">No - 
Maybe tommorow or the day after</quote>, or maybe a bit longer 
for technical reasons to do with marking it as suitable for 
all/any of the Debian architectures - as a python application, it 
did not have to be recompiled from the i386 version of Debian to 
other versions. James Thompson (jamest) said 
<quote who="James Thompson">i hope to have a 0.4.2 out later in the 
week or early next - to address some issues and include some of the 
Papo stuff</quote>. Jeff noted <quote who="Jeff Bailey">That will 
solve the versioning problem nicely, then.</quote> He asked 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">Are the versions in CVS now going to be 
lexically sane</quote> from then on?</p>
