<topic>Forms</topic>
<topic>Reports</topic>

<p>It was asked whether GNUe would be a suitable replacement
for Access for someone desperately trying to break their M$ 
habit. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">we are not an access replacement, per 
se - but could definitely be a substitute - we are comparable 
to the Forms and Reports parts of access (only with a lot more 
power, imho) - we don't have a database, so you'd use PostgreSQL, 
for example, as the database backend (or SAP-DB, ....)</quote>. 
On the programming side, he said <quote who="Jason Cater">we use 
Python for any triggers/events... it's a VERY newbie-friendly 
language - it would be a small step from</quote> Visual Basic 
for Applications (VBA) to Python.</p>

<p>Later, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) added 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">always someone coming from msaccess
- suggest that pgadmin has a MIGRATION tool - that will migrate 
all tables + data for them</quote> from Microsoft Access to 
PostgreSQL - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">which is a huge part of 
the work if they have not done anything too 'fancy' code wise 
(standard vb forms) - designer will putty in their hands especially 
with wizards. /me has half considered writing a vb forms (and delphi 
forms) conversion tool.</quote> He added 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">the biggest thing we are missing (and 
so is pgadmin) is a 'query designer' - i think eventually it would 
be nice to have that in designer(schema tools). If you all add the 
quick table view stuff (what someone was calling grid view) - the 
'query designer' would be about only thing we are missing to be 
close to access replacement (imho) - and unfortunately i have seen 
a LOT of access ;)</quote></p>
