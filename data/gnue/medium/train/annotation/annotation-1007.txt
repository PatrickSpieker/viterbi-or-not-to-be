<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) noted that <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">encoding 
param in gnue.conf is only relevant for postgresql - so it understand 
specific pgsql names - encoding is the client encoding</quote> and could 
have various values for normal ASCII or other specific character sets. 
Jason Cater (jcater) thought <quote who="Jason Cater">that belongs in 
connections.conf if its specific to postgres - actually I thought it was 
already there?</quote> Dmitry said this dated back to before there was a 
separate connections.conf file, and agreed it should be moved. So did 
Arturas Kriukovas, who said <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">i 
would like to believe there was some reason why i did put it here, but 
i don't remember :\</quote> - he would fix <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">it 
in a few days</quote>.</p>
