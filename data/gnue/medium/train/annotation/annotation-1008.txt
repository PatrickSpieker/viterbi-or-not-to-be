<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) asked <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">what 
is caption attribute for page?</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">for notebook pages, that can be the notebook 
tab caption/label - if missing, and you have a notebook page, caption 
defaults to the name value</quote>. Dmitry asked 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">what does transparentBlock attribute 
mean?</quote> Jason explained this controlled the behaviour of the 
tab key - <quote who="Jason Cater">If you are on the last field of a 
block and there is another block in the form then if transparentBlock 
is true a tab will take you to the next block - if false it will take 
you to the first field of the same block</quote>. Dmitry asked how you 
could get to the other notebook tab in this case. Jason said the Page 
Down key always took you to the next tab - for triggers, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I think you can do a 
form.setFocus(otherBlock)</quote>.</p>
