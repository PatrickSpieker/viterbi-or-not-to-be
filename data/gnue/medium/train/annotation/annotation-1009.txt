<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) asked <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">how 
to set scrollbar over myltirow entry?</quote> James Thompson 
(jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">our code doesn't support 
scrollbar's yet - papo guys seem to have it as part of their patch 
- if time permits I'll be going into the 0.4.1 branch - and then 
into head</quote>. Dmitry asked <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">it 
seemed to me you did some work on scrollbar already?</quote> James 
admitted <quote who="James Thompson">i added the code it display it 
but never tied it into the event system</quote> so it would respond 
to mouse clicks or key presses like a "proper" scrollbar.</p>
