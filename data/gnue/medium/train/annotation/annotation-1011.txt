<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Bill Gribble (grib) asked <quote who="Bill Gribble">have you guys 
thought about working with twisted?  seems like there 
could be a lot of redundancy between gnue and wtisted.</quote> 
Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think 
we existed long before twisted so one should ask why isnt 
twisted working with us :) - specifically they iirc are much more web 
oriented. Likely the appserver team would be the best to address 'twisted' 
stuff</quote>. Bill said <quote who="Bill Gribble">seems like there's 
mission overlap but not enough to point a finger and say somebody's 
wasting time.  they don't handle any of the forms/reports/etc, just the 
wiring and app-service.</quote> Derek agreed - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think they are more similar to our 
appserver than gnue as a whole - i think jan or jcater mentioned offering 
an appserver provider for them or something</quote>. Bill said 
<quote who="Bill Gribble">anyway their stuff looks pretty interesting.  
it is sort of kitchen-sinky and the code/doc ration is a little high but 
I think there's useful stuff.</quote></p>
