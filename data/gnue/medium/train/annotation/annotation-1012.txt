<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>
<topic>Small Business</topic>

<p>John Lenton (Chipaca) asked why Derek Neighbors (revDeke) 
had started gnue-sb as a seperate project, rather than working 
with project papo. Derek said he had understood that papo was 
aimed specifically at the Argentinan market and was in Spanish. 
John explained <quote who="John Lenton">the PAPO team's medium-term 
objective is to replace an Argentine-specific ERP. There is, as 
far as we know, nothing in the design of PAPO that's 
Argentina-specific - the screens are in spanish because that is 
_our_ target audience, but</quote> internationalisation was planned 
for after November. Derek said that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">when 
i looked at papo it wasnt what i was after - specifically you 
appeared to be making what we want final GNUe to be</quote> - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">with gnue-sb we plan to be much simpler 
than what official end game gnue would be - specifically there is no 
intention to use appserver with it - if you think we can work together 
great</quote>. John said that papo had been started as a seperate 
project, as the GNUe tools were mostly there, but the packages were 
<quote who="John Lenton">a *long* way away of what we need</quote>. 
Derek agreed - that was why he had started gnue-sb.</p>

<p>John said that papo was <quote who="John Lenton">pointed more 
towards small-to-medium organizations, while gnue (as it name implies) 
is aimed at fully fledged enterprise-level stuff, that is, IOHO, over 
papo's head - which is why gnue-sb called our attention... it seems to 
be more or less what papo is getting to be</quote>. Peter Sullivan 
(psu) said that some of the discussions about adding functionality 
to the Tools had indicated <quote who="Peter Sullivan">that papo has 
compatible but different way of approaching things</quote> - 
this wmight have been even worse on the Packages, and lead to a fork. 
He asked whether papo's long-term goals included AppServer. 
John said <quote who="John Lenton">long term appserver is by far the 
cleaner approach, but there is nothing wrong with 2-tier if the needed 
functionality is hidden away in dbsig, for example</quote>. Peter 
felt that the overlap, if there was one, was between the GNUe Packages 
and papo rather than between gnue-sb and papo - but this had always 
been recognised. John felt <quote who="John Lenton">there are some 
rough edges between what papo aims to do and what gnue seems to aim 
to do, mostly related to who the intended users are, but those are all 
confined to the UI AFAIR</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said that papo appeared <quote who="Derek Neighbors">much more 
geared to 'manufacturing' - my needs are more on wherehouse management 
than assembly line</quote>, which was the focus of gnue-sb. But he had 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">no problem working together</quote>. 
John said that papo's entity relationship diagram (ERD) 
<quote who="John Lenton">tries to contamplate SB product mangling, but 
that's about it</quote> - he was going to set 
<quote who="John Lenton">up a friendly web thingie to browse our ERD, 
as it is rather huge</quote>. He used Zot for ERD documentation, and 
was even considering writing a zot2gsd to enable GNUe Schema 
Defintion Files (.gsd) to be automatically converted from Zot.</p>

<p>Derek said that the point of gnue-sb was to ramp something up 
quickly - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">/me doesnt have time to debate 
argue and make things feature complete for the world - but rather 
something that is usable and shippable and easily extensible - 
so while i have no problems working papo or other projects, very much 
gnue-sb is a [no] nonsense 'get it done' application</quote>. 
The alternative approach - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">long toying 
with trying to incorporate a ton of varying opinions - that is what 
GNUe official packages will tackle :)</quote></p>
