<p>It was asked if the GNUe project was still active - the last entry on 
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnue/">Free Software Foundation</a>'s 
website for the project was in 2002. 
Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) explained that the current website was 
at <a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org">www.gnuenterprise.org</a>.  
He asked if it would be possible to get the FSF website to redirect to 
the current one. James Thompson (jamest) said he would see what he could 
do.</p>
