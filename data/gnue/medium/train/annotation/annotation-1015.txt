<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 21 Sep 2006" title="Changing attributes of a form from within a trigger" />, 
Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) explained that he had not been talking 
about Application Server objects - just objects (fields, blocks, 
etc) within a Form. <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">The point is that 
it is (was) possible to change all kinds of properties of, say, a block 
object - but it is not possible to create a new block object - so it 
will never be possible to create new forms at runtime - but only to 
change behaviour of existing forms in limited manner</quote>. 
Jason Cater (jcater) commented that <quote who="Jason Cater">come to 
think of it, if someone really needed to create a form completely at 
runtime, they could create their own .py file that imports the GNUe 
Forms Objects, and create a form that way, then activate it :)
- and a startup trigger could just import that .py file - but I can't 
imagine real-world situations where that'd really be necessary</quote>. 
Reinhard said <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">seriously, I already 
considered something like a gnue-forms --auto &lt;connectionname&gt; 
&lt;tablename&gt; - to get some kind of "raw database editor" 
- it could use db introspection to get the schema of the table, and 
then create a form on the fly containing all fields</quote>.</p>
