<p>It was asked how feasible it would be to put a GNUe implementation 
into production. Nick Rusnov (nickr) noted that 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">People are using it in production - well 
components of it</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) explained 
<quote who="Jason Cater">most gnue implementations right now are using 
the form builder/interface components</quote>. 
<quote who="Jason Cater">if you are looking for a complete financials 
package, then GNUe is not ready for you</quote> as of time of writing. 
However, <quote who="Jason Cater">if you were looking for tools to 
easily build an interface to your own database, then gnue</quote> 
might be suitable. It was more a framework for business/database 
application development rather than a shrink-wrapped package of 
applications as of time of writing.</p>
