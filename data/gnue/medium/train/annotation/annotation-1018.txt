<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) asked Jason Cater (jcater) how on-activation 
trigger differs from on-startup. Jason offered asking James Thompson 
(jamest) for specifications. He thought that on-startup
runned when form was loaded; and <quote who="Jason Cater">on-activation 
is fired once each time a form (dialog) is called</quote>, on activation 
runs each time a form is displayed - it is convenient
<quote who="Jason Cater">to clear the fields from the last time it was 
called</quote>.</p>
