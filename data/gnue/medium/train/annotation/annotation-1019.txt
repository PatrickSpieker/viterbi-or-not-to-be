<p>Perry Lorier (IsoosI) asked <quote who="Perry Lorier">can gnue 
use a ldap backend</quote> to access the Lighweight Directory Access 
Protocol (LDAP)? It was noted that Jan Ischebeck (siesel) had committed 
some code to CVS in gnue/common/src/datasources/drivers/ldap. Perry went
<quote who="Perry Lorier">off to code some gnue forms for 
ldap :)</quote> He asked <quote who="Perry Lorier">how up to date is 
the version of gnue in sid?</quote> Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch), refering to 
the IRC topic, said that the <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">old one in sid, 
new one on</quote> Jeff Bailey's (jbailey) section of the 
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~jbailey/">http://people.debian.org</a> 
website. Perry said he would report back once he had got LDAP working.</p>
