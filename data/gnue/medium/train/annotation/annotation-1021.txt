<p>Several people noted problems trying to access the www.gnuenterprise.org 
website. James Thompson (jamest) explained that 
<quote who="James Thompson">i host www.gnuenterprise.org on a machine I own 
at a local ISP in Manhattan, KS. That ISP got purchased - the new owners sent 
mail saying I'd probably have to start paying for the machine hosting - 
but not right away - they wanted to think about it</quote>. He had not 
heard from them for a while, and in the context of other things going on,

at short notice. So <quote who="James Thompson">i asked jcater to put up mirror 
of us so I can pull that machine out ASAP</quote>. This had now been done, 
but there were some Domain Name Server (DNS) config issues that meant people 
might have seen some odd stuff, as the mirror was 
<quote who="James Thompson">on the same machine he hosts other stuff, like 
that sample site you're seeing</quote>.</p>
