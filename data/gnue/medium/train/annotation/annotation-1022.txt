<p>Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) pointed to a comment added to his code 
about peer review - <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">i thought that 
something like that is going here (on #gnuenterprise) - do i have email 
change proposition or something else?</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) 
suggested <quote who="Jason Cater">as a general rule, anything outside 
of your normal realm should be sent as a patch to info@gnue.org</quote>. 
Arturas asked <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">how do i know what changes 
i can simply commit and what to send as a patch?</quote> James Thompson 
(jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">on the db drivers I almost always 
ask jcater personally before I change them - as some of that code hurts my 
brain - and I got sick of breaking the drivers :)</quote> From his 
experience, <quote who="James Thompson">in the db driver section just asking 
him up front will save you a ton of time - as I didn't know about _toSqlString 
until I talked to him - and it saved a ton of code digging. Now if it's my 
code you are working on, good luck as even I don't know whats going on in 
there :)</quote>.</p>
