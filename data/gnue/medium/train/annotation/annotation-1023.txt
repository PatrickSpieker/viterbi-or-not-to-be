<p>Ariel Cal&#242; (ariel_) asked <quote who="Ariel Cal&#242;">when reports will 
support conditions?</quote> Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">um it supports conditions right now 
today</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) confirmed this -
<quote who="Jason Cater">conditions were written FOR reports</quote> but, 
as the code was in GNUe Common, they could be used in Forms as well. 
Ariel posted the code he was having a problem with, and compared it to 
a working sample of Derek's - <quote who="Ariel Cal&#242;">there &lt;condition&gt; 
is not inside &lt;conditions&gt; - may be this is the problem, if so the dtd 
of reports is wrong.</quote> He confirmed <quote who="Ariel Cal&#242;">without 
&lt;conditions&gt; works fine.</quote></p>
