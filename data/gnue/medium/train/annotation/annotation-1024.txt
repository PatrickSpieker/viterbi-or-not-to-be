<mention>Bajusz Tam&#225;s</mention>

<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) noted that Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">is the one writing the drivers for 
firebird/interbase</quote>. He thought <quote who="Derek Neighbors">interbase 
is a good database, but not enough mind share/market penetration. 
I used interbase a LOT when doing delphi work - its a good database and they 
used to have local Interbase which was nice for access 
replacement.</quote></p>

<p>He felt <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if you want to do real work and want 
freedom - use SAP-DB</quote>. It used to have a proprietary build system, 
but <quote who="Derek Neighbors">within a week of asking they released 
under the LGPL and provided us with sources</quote>. He admitted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">it aint a point and click setup</quote> and 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">it needs loving from a good DBA</quote>. 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if you want to do reasonable work but lower 
administration and still have freedom - i would say use postgres. if you 
want easy admin, lots of penetration, high speed but a slew of other problems 
- use mysql</quote>. He felt SAP-DB was in a similar position to Debian as 
a GNU/Linux distribution or python as a languague - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">it has a little higher hump than mysql or 
postgres and you wont find as many folks to aid you bouncing over that hump
- but you will be well rewarded if you do so</quote>. However, he noted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">right now, there is about 4 to 5 times the 
traffic on SAP-DB list than there is on all postgres lists combined - 
and most of them are answered by SAP employees. Contrary to FUD they didnt 
drop SAP-DB on the communities lap, they claim to have about 100 folks still 
working on it (i know for certain at least 4 are active in the list)</quote>. 
He noted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">1. I know several hundred to thousands 
of folks use SAP-DB for SAP R/3 in production.  The best mysql example I am 
pointed to is um SLASHDOT. - 2. There are about 100 paid employees pounding 
on SAP-DB.  I dont think postgres or mysql now even have 'real' paid employees 
now, with mysqlAB and greatbridge having so many issues. btw: this is from 
'corporate' prospective not my personal use - i.e. SAP-DB i think will be MUCH 
easier for me to bring into enterprises than mysql</quote>. He cut and pasted 
a list of current and planned SAP-DB features <a href="http://www.sapdb.org">from 
the website</a> - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">basically best i can tell the 
mandate SAP AG has given the SAPDB team is stay compatiable (feature wise) with 
oracle - if someone can point me to postgres/mysql feature sets</quote> he would 
do a document setting out the comparisons. 
Nick Rusnov (nickr) did not think much of the SAP-DB build script - 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">it'd be nice if they had a script in the top directory 
called 'build'</quote>. Derek felt <quote who="Derek Neighbors">they have a 
good <a href="http://sapdb.2scale.net/moin.cgi/VmakeCritique">right up</a> as 
to WHY they dont use make</quote>, noting <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think 
jbailey is looking to make it work with make</quote>. Once the Debian packages 
were official, he thought that the ability to install SAP-DB using apt-get 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">will be the turning point</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.02Aug2002">
The next day</a>, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo_) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">well i couldnt handle the mysql vs postgres 
debate so i posted a story to 
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/08/02/1830245">slashdot</a></quote>, 
asking <quote who="Derek Neighbors">why exactly people arent using SAP-DB? 
It clearly is on par with Oracle, is GPL and frankly has an awesome support 
team in SAP AG.</quote>. He had included a link to the GNUe website. He 
admitted the timing was not ideal - as Jason Cater (jcater) pointed 
out, the temporary mirror <quote who="Jason Cater">can't handle 
slashdotting!!!!</quote> Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if i 
was THINKING i would have put our url as the gnu.org site (i just forget 
we have it at times)</quote>.</p>

<p>Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) felt <quote who="Charles Rouzer">SAPD-DB has 
little community support.. which may be more important to an open-source 
product than anything else...</quote> Derek said he understood, but 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">from a DEVELOPER standpoint they have the 
largest community i have seen - in sense they are only one with a boat 
load of PAID developers</quote>. Jason agreed - <quote who="Jason Cater">The 
mailing list has so much traffic I can't keep up</quote>. Derek agreed 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">that the USER community is pretty much non 
existent - but its chicken vs egg. I think most of folks using SAP-DB 
currently are SAP R/3 customers - so they belong to SAP R/3 communities 
not Free Software communities - not until more free/open projects start 
to use SAP-DB will you see the user community spring up more. There is 
finally a good <a href="http://sapdb.2scale.net/moin.cgi">portal</a> site 
in place to help breed this</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) asked 
<quote who="James Thompson">does our sap/db support work ? er, I mean, 
does it work as well as our postgresql?</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">not entirely - but the SAP-DB is installing 
it and testing it for us and has committed to fix the python SAP-DB 
driver to suit if problems arise - jbailey is workign on debian packages 
as well for SAP-DB</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.05Aug2002">
Some days later</a>, James noted <quote who="James Thompson">derek 
got his question posted to slashdot - last week we were on a nice fat 
pipe to the net - this week we're on a small dsl line mirror machine 
while our main server gets</quote> shipped <quote who="James Thompson">across 
the US</quote>, as referred to in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 01 Aug 2002" title="Problems with GNU Enterprise website" />. 
Jason reported <quote who="Jason Cater">actually, my DSL line is holding 
up - as well as monsoon</quote>. He commented 
<quote who="Jason Cater">man, what I find really odd about most of the 
slashdot posts re SAP-DB are they basically ask "but why would you want 
something that big for web apps?" - who the fsck said anything about web 
apps?</quote> Stuart Bain (stbain) said <quote who="Stuart Bain">I've 
used PostgreSQL for web apps in the past and it hauls butt once you have 
the connection open - performance difference between it and MySQL was 
negligble</quote>. Derek noted several comments that basically implied 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if sap-db is so good and free why are 
people paying top dollar for oracle</quote>? - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">of course my gut reaction is "so why do 
you run linux again?" I mean most fortune 500 wont touch it and they 
would rather pay for windows</quote>, but this did not make Microsoft 
Windows "better."</p>

<p>Stuart pointed out that the SAP-DB website was clear that 
<quote who="Stuart Bain">If you use SAP DB as a database system for SAP 
solutions, a maintenance contract is required</quote>, which meant that 
using SAP-DB with SAP's own ERP systems was not free of charge anyway.
Derek clarified that this was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">not violation 
of GPL BECAUSE sap owns the copy right - just like mozilla and open office 
are owned by parent companies that do DUAL LICENSE so SAP can choose to 
release SAP-DB under the GPL and yet offer other licensing to it as 
well</quote>. Stuart asked <quote who="Stuart Bain">so I can release my 
code as GPL and w/ a stipulation that in order to use it, you have to pay 
me a support contract</quote>? Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">no - 
you could however release your code and say version A is available under 
the GPL - version B is available under the STBAIN license - if you want to u
se stu's crazy app it only works with version B</quote>. He felt the 
confusion was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">because they are trying to be 
HONEST i.e. they arent restricting a GPL app - they are just putting notice 
on the GPL one that hey dont download this and expect to use it with SAP/R3 
w/o paying maintenance</quote>. Stuart suggested <quote who="Stuart Bain">they 
should tie the contract to the SAP product, not the database</quote>. Derek 
agreed - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">its not a stipulation i think in the 
GPL license of SAP-DB but probably clauses in SAP R/3 that do the 
'enforcing' of this</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.06Aug2002">
The next day</a>, Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i had sent 
sap a list of 'gripes' from slashdot postings - they posted a great 
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=37305&amp;threshold=-1&amp;commentsort=1&amp;tid=99&amp;mode=flat&amp;cid=4016958">response</a></quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.07Aug2002">
The next day</a>, Derek said he had been talking to SAP-DB about 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">the oracle 7 compatiablity mode and 
some features in the python driver? That it sounded like a cheap 
way to do some query compatiablity testing</quote>. Stuart Bain 
(stbain) asked <quote who="Stuart Bain">sapdb really that 
good?</quote> Peter Sullivan (psu) said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">it's all about position in the db food 
chain - you start at the bottom w/ your M$ Access, then move up to 
MySQL, then to postgreSQL. But after that, next step up is the 
industrial-strength databases - where Oracle is the 800-pound 
gorilla but SAP-DB has aspirations to be the Pepsi</quote>. 
Also, <quote who="Peter Sullivan">also it is always significant 
when a big co puts something that was non-free under GPL - 
"more joy in heaven over one sinner repented" etc</quote>. 
James suggested that, if Oracle was a gorilla, then 
<quote who="James Thompson">access = slime mold ; mysql = dolphin?
; postgres = elephant ; GNUE = the goat that wants to jiggy with 
all of 'um</quote>.</p>

<p>Stuart asked about <quote who="Stuart Bain">python/perl drivers 
for SAP-DB</quote>. Peter suggested <quote who="Peter Sullivan">python 
drivers I think are high-profile with the SAP-DB developers now - 
'cause there's this weird GPL enterprise project out there keeps 
asking about them ;-)</quote> For PHP, Stuart confirmed
<quote who="Stuart Bain">From version 4.0.3, PHP 4 accesses SAP DB 
via PHP's Unified ODBC and the SAP DB ODBC-driver. Similar to Perl, 
this can be performed using a driver manager. so you have to load unix 
odbc</quote>.</p>

<p>Earlier, Stuart asked about Microsoft MSSQL. Derek said that, as 
a database, he would rate it above MySQL and 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">probably even postgres - BUT its a single 
platform and has bad license so i rule it out for anything</quote>. 
It was definantly not a <quote who="Derek Neighbors">mickey mouse</quote> 
database, but <quote who="Derek Neighbors">it ties your rump to mickey 
soft and thats just bad news</quote>. By contrast, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">SAP-DB is comparable to Oracle and in some 
ways looks like it might be better than DB2 - and is GPL. It has an Oracle 
7 compatiablity mode to try to get people off oracle, but its not always 
a 'clean' switch</quote>. He confirmed that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">PHP support is till through ODBC - 
i think its just more official and you can compile --with-sapdb 
or such and it does the odbc stuff for you or something</quote>. 
He <quote who="Derek Neighbors">love that all python interfaces are native 
(and might i add BEST supported) - in fact it is only binding that has 
full api to things outside querying and such - like the database manager 
and the replication manager</quote>.</p>
