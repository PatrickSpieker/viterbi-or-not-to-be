<topic>Bayonne</topic>

<p>It was asked what was in the bayonne downloads directory on the website, 
and if it was needed for the rest of GNUe. 
James said this was just a mirror of <quote who="James Thompson">the offical 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bayonne/bayonne.html">bayonne</a> sources.</quote>
Bayonne at its simplest could be used to program voice-mail systems, 
<quote who="James Thompson">but it's more powerfull than just that - 
you can have systems phone home, interface w/ voice mail systems, create 
interactive applications</quote> and so on. <quote who="James Thompson">eventually 
we want our forms client to work w/ it so that users can input data via a phone 
interface</quote>.</p>

<p>James explained that <quote who="James Thompson">most GNUe tools can stand 
alone - so if you want to use just forms or just reports then are you free to 
do so - however all the gnue tools, except bayonne and dcl, will require GNUe 
Common as it's our core library</quote> As well as python, 
<quote who="James Thompson">you only need db drivers for dbs you use - 
you will need the wxpython installed if you want to use forms as it's the only 
UI driver currently working</quote>. He later explained 
<quote who="James Thompson">the UI system is designed to take</quote> other 
user interface <quote who="James Thompson">drivers but needs cleaned up and 
refined</quote>. He admitted <quote who="James Thompson">wx 
is love/hate for us - love it as it gives us win32, *nix, Mac OS/X gui in one 
package - hate it as it's quirky as hell</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Peter Sullivan (psu) said he <quote who="Peter Sullivan">was 
trying to write a short "What you need to run GNUe" piece - 
&amp; started with a fairly safe "you need a computer" - but of 
course even that's not true ;-) thanks to bayonne</quote>. 
Nick Rusnov felt <quote who="Nick Rusnov">well you're not *running* 
beyonne on your phone, just accessing it via beyonne</quote>. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo_) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">but 
one could say that a computer is not necessary for a gnue client - 
as just a plain telephone could be a client. Certainly to have a gnue 
application you need a computer somewhere :)</quote>. He added 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think some day support for ipaqs, yopy 
and zaurus and such woudl be a possibility</quote>.</p>
