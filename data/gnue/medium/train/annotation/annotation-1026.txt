<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) asked <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">about 
i18n date format</quote>. He would like <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">to 
add something like dateFormatMaskView &amp; dateFormatMaskEdit to 
gnue.conf</quote> to handle this. Jason Cater (jcater) confirmed 
<quote who="Jason Cater">the intent is to use the FormatMask system
and set a default DateMask in gnue.conf</quote>. Arturas said that the 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">files in common/src/FormatMasks are 
practically unused</quote>, but he had <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">found 
some code</quote> and <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">corrected it to take 
format masks from gnue.conf</quote>. Jason explained that the code 
Arturas had corrected had been just <quote who="Jason Cater">a place 
holder until we could get DateMasks working - but for the time being, moving 
to gnue.conf will work I suppose</quote>. He would prefer the config 
option to be called something other than formatMask, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">because we may want a default number mask too - 
so formatMask=  wouldn't look right when we added the number one 
too</quote>. Arturas agreed - <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">dateFormatMaskView 
&amp; dateFormatMaskEdit variables in gnue.conf</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason emphasised <quote who="Jason Cater">I just don't want to spend too 
much time on that solution as it'll be replaced</quote>. James Thompson 
(jamest) asked <quote who="James Thompson">how hard would it be to use this 
as first case to get formatmasks working?</quote> Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">actually, for the most part, format masks do work
- I just needed a way to hook them into forms. That was the intention of 
GFDisplayHandler -- to provide hooks for FormatMasks</quote>. James suggested 
<quote who="James Thompson">Arturas: If you have already done the date work in 
the format mask code then rather than change to the temporary solution we might 
want to just finish tying the format mask code into forms</quote>.</p>
