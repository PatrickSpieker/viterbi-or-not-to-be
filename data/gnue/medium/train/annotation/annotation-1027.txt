<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>Stan Klein (stan) noted that <quote who="Stan Klein">There is a 
<a href="http://www.egovos.org/oscfp.html">conference</a> in Washington 
DC in October that we should be at in force - It is on e-government 
and free/open-source software</quote>. 
He said <quote who="Stan Klein">We could do it jointly with myself and 
others - And I could fill in if others couldn't make it</quote>. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">we'll have brochures 
and pamplets by early next week</quote> for Linux World Expo in San 
Fransisco <quote who="Jason Cater">and derek has been preparing a demo 
for that show - so he should have notes, etc</quote>. He felt
<quote who="Jason Cater">I think we should plan to have a booth if stbain 
could possibly make it - (and others too)</quote>. Stuart Bain (stbain) 
noted that the website implied that it was more a panel-based event - 
<quote who="Stuart Bain">unless they have a small number in the lobby or 
something</quote>. Stan suggested three main themes - 
<quote who="Stan Klein">an overall business case for free/open-source 
s/w</quote>, then <quote who="Stan Klein">a demo of GNUe</quote>, 
followed by <quote who="Stan Klein">a presentation on using GNUe for 
e-government</quote>. Stuart suggested <quote who="Stuart Bain">fourth 
should be a call for developers of similar projects to 
feel their frustration and come to the light side of the force... joining us to 
become invincible and rule the universe ;)</quote> Stan said 
<quote who="Stan Klein">Well, it makes sense to suggest that big 
organizations pay their people to contribute to GNUe and join the "Innovation 
Commons" (Lessig's term)</quote>.</p>
