<p>Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said he was <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">just 
setting up dcl from your debs</quote>, as developed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 05 Jul 2002" title="Debian packages for DCL" /> 
- he <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">found a couple of issues that i should 
report - like wrong path in the apache.conf</quote>. Jeff Bailey (jbailey) 
said <quote who="Jeff Bailey">I need to upload a new version today.  
File a bug in the BTS please?</quote> Andrew noted 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">reportbug is picking up debconf 
stuff... didn't think you had debconf stuff for dcl tho?</quote>
Jeff said <quote who="Jeff Bailey">I don't =) - The previous dcl 
package might've had some though</quote>. He added 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">I really try to discourage bug reports 
through anything other than the BTS.  When I sit down to do a new 
release, I open up the BTS page and work through as many as 
I feel like, and then I upload.</quote> Andrew agreed, and 
suggested <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">think you could provide some 
nice defaults for priorities, severities, etc ;) - /me won't bother 
putting that as a wishlist bug yet</quote>. Jeff said he would 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">probably forward it upstream for comment. 
=) - Since I'm not a regular user of DCL, I would have trouble being 
certain of 'sensible defaults'</quote>. Andrew agreed - 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">derek would probably be best for 
that</quote>. Later, Andrew <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">grabs 
dcl source to check that the bug wasn't local brokenness</quote>, 
and confirmed <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">it appears to be from 
an earlier dcl version</quote> - <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">looks 
like the bug was a false alarm :)</quote>.</p>
