<topic>DCL</topic>

<p>Stuart Bain (stbain) asked <quote who="Stuart Bain">is DCL 
usable for a helpdesk tracking system? like... straight out of 
the box?</quote> He downloaded and installed it, changing the 
master password. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo_) said that the next stage 
was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">go to the admin portion and setup 
the tables - tehre should be like a 10 step list of things to do.
The trickiest one (that kills 9 out of 10 folks) is the setting 
defaults for products</quote>. Stuart noted that he could 
<quote who="Stuart Bain">set up my own priorities</quote> - he 
asked <quote who="Stuart Bain">what's weight? higher == more 
important or lower ?</quote> Derek said he could not remember - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think lower is higher :)</quote>.</p>

<p>Stuart asked <quote who="Stuart Bain">how do I dumb it down to be 
able to tell my users "if you have a problem, goto this web address 
and type it in"</quote>? Derek said that the 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">easiest way is to setup the email gateway
then users simple emails to productname-support@yourdomain.com
and a ticket is auto generated for them - using subject as short 
desc</quote>. Stuart said he might have some problems with this, as 
<quote who="Stuart Bain">I'm not through w/ our email conversion 
yet</quote>. Derek said this could be resolved - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">you can have the product-support@domain.com 
come in and be 'forwarded' to the server DCL is on (running its own mail 
daemon) to do the processing</quote>. He added 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">in the mean time i keep meaning to make 
an easy 'web form' to submit tickets</quote> - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">its on my todo list to have a 'ticket' 
entry screen (as others are asking for it)</quote>.</p>

<p>Stuart noted that, as of time of writing, all users could see each 
other's tickets. Derek said that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">RBAC 
(role based access control) is coming soon</quote>. You could use 
different accounts to keep track of different areas of an 
organisation for reporting purposes - alternatively, these could 
be set up as departments. He said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i 
think dcl works nicely for things other than TECH support ;)
as a general 'project management tool' - i.e. ticket side woudl be 
mostly tech support but the work order side you could offer to management 
for other tasks :) specifically its GREAT for reporting to management 
what IT is doing :)</quote> as <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the boss 
can be autonotified as statuses change and such - and cutesy little 
management reports can be done for staff meetings</quote>. 
E-mail notifications were done <quote who="Derek Neighbors">via 'watches'
- you can setup 'watches' by a myriad of things - specifically if there 
are projects or products you can set them up to alwasys get 
notified</quote>.</p>

<p>Stuart asked about <quote who="Stuart Bain">the difference between 
the priorities and the severities</quote>. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">priority is how quick it needs to be 
done</quote> - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">severity is how it affects 
the product</quote>. These might be different depending on who was having 
the problem - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">of course if the CEO has the 
problem it probably doesnt matter, cause your peon butt will probably fix 
it before you even consider opening DCL to give it a priority. 
;)</quote> Stuart asked <quote who="Stuart Bain">any SMS notification for 
emergency type problems that get submitted? e.g. send a short message to 
my mobile phone whenever someone opens up a ticket labeled "Emergency" in 
priority and "Critical" in type</quote>? Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">you could easily add that - 
especially if your phone takes email messages</quote>.</p>

The next day</a>, Stuart said <quote who="Stuart Bain">I just showed 
DCL to my Operations Officer (handles building maintenance and 
whatnot) and he seemed pretty enthused about getting everything up 
and running w/ it</quote>. He would also be using it for IT Helpdesk 
support - <quote who="Stuart Bain">just have to figure out how I want 
to lay out my "Products"</quote> - <quote who="Stuart Bain">probably 
Email, Hardware, Software, Network, Alarm Systems, Telephony, HVAC, 
Plumbing, Building Maintenance, etc.</quote>. He would probably
<quote who="Stuart Bain">work w/ dneighbo to create a custom form for 
them to submit trouble calls without having to have a user 
login</quote> - or <quote who="Stuart Bain">I might rip the mail gateway 
code off and slap a web frontend on it</quote>. Andrew noted 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">ah right, someone was looking at that a 
week or so ago</quote>, as referred to in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 25 Jul 2002" title="Using the DCL e-mail gateway to accept tickets from other applications" />.</p>
