<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) reported a problem starting the CVS version 
of Forms - <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">BadWindow (invalid Window 
parameter)</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) suggested 
<quote who="James Thompson">shut off the splashscreen</quote>. 
Andrew confirmed <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">well, whaddaya know? it 
works!</quote> Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i get that a lot (espeically with a few 
themes)</quote> but <quote who="Derek Neighbors">what is odd is it seems 
to happen more with certain themes or larger prequeries</quote>. 
James explained <quote who="James Thompson">it's when the splashscreen 
timeout causes the spashscreen to be removed before the login window is 
up - on a loaded down machine or click to place window manager this 
happens alot - i'm pretty sure others have looked at it other than me 
and nothing obvious is wrong in our code</quote>.</p>
