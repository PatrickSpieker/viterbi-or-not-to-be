<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Malek Hadj-Ali asked <quote who="Malek Hadj-Ali">why 
aren't you guys using Zope as an application server?  
It has a lot of features that could be reused (ZCatalog, 
ZSQLCatalog, ...), it's written in python, it has a big 
community of developper, and so on...</quote> 
Stan Klein noted that, according to their web page, 
<quote who="Stan Klein">Zope has a standalone persietent 
object database</quote> and <quote who="Stan Klein">They 
can evidently use other databases as backends, although I
didn't see reference to any of the ones GNUe is 
using.</quote> Jason Cater said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">Several of the core developers 
use Zope as web/portal servers at their places of work. 
GNUe is even switching to a Zope backend for our 
website.</quote> But his perception was that Zope was more 
<quote who="Jason Cater">targeted at serving web applications 
/ content</quote> than the sort of Application Server 
that GNUe needed for GEAS. Todd Boyle 
said that he didn't seen Zope as incompatible 
with <quote who="Todd Boyle">any of the higher goals of 
GNUE</quote> and GNUe could tap into the 
<quote who="Todd Boyle">huge amount of work</quote> 
already done on Zope. As they were aware of Zope, he 
wondered <quote who="Todd Boyle">WHY the GNUe developers 
rejected Zope</quote>, guessing at some possible 
reasons.</p>

<p>Jason said that GNUe was not primarily 
<quote who="Jason Cater">a web-based application</quote>.
However, <quote who="Jason Cater">it would be possible to have 
a web-based application server as the backend. We've toyed 
with the idea of supporting JBoss and (somewhat) Zope as 
backends, but nothing has come of this as our resources 
are very limited.</quote>. 
He felt that <quote who="Jason Cater">Application 
Server is very much an over-used term that has little 
meaning these days</quote>, describing 
<quote who="Jason Cater">anything from a web portal to a
business rules server to a database proxy.</quote> Zope 
was <quote who="Jason Cater">a type of application server, 
but I don't see too much overlap in goals</quote> with 
GEAS, which was a <quote who="Jason Cater">a business 
rules + data server.</quote> He felt that GNUe Common 
already provided <quote who="Jason Cater">pretty much 
what the "core" of Zope would provide</quote>. He 
concluded <quote who="Jason Cater">My toilet paper dispenser 
is an application server.  So is my refrigerator.  I try 
not to confuse the two, though.</quote> There had been 
some discussions with <quote who="Jason Cater">the DotGNU 
folks about them reusing parts of our Application Server 
for their .NET replacement</quote>, but once again he had 
some concerns that <quote who="Jason Cater">the "Application 
Server" phrase around is causing the same confusion in
this case.</quote> He re-emphasised that 
<quote who="Jason Cater">several of us use Zope in our professional
settings</quote> and <quote who="Jason Cater">absolutely love
it; but, I love it for what it is -- a web-based content 
server.</quote> Zope as <quote who="Jason Cater">the leading
example of python programming for some time now</quote> had 
directly benefited python-based projects like GNUe 
<quote who="Jason Cater">from any contributions they've made 
back to the python language and python's extensive standard 
library.</quote>.</p>

<p>Todd asked <quote who="Todd Boyle">how would you
advise somebody already committed to Zope to achieve some
basic accounting needs?</quote> Peter Sullivan said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">Theoretically, you could 
re-write the existing Forms client in Zope</quote> as
they were both python applications. This would give Zope
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">the ability to use 
GNUe Common to talk to multiple databases</quote> and 
later, to use GNUe Application Server. However, he 
was not sure this was sensible.</p>

<p>Earlier, Jorge Lehner said he was currently using Zope for a
<quote who="Jorge Lehner">Practice Managment Tool</quote>, 
and listed some of the problems he had with it, 
concluding <quote who="Jorge Lehner">That is, why I'm waiting 
(silently) for Gnue to come up with a stronger and more generic 
framework for business programming.</quote> He added that he, 
too, liked Zope a lot <quote who="Jorge Lehner">for what it 
is.</quote> Abdul Hafiz Abdullah noted that Zope's license 
was <quote who="Abdul Hafiz Abdullah">GPL compatible but its 
too generous ala BSD, X11.</quote> He preferred the GNUe 
Public License, as used by GNUe, 
<quote who="Abdul Hafiz Abdullah">that will protect our 
freedom.</quote></p>
