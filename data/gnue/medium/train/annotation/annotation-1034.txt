<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Harald Meyer (Harald1) asked <quote who="Harald Meyer">where 
are the methods of business objects stored</quote> in GNUe 
Application Server version 2. Reinhard M&#252;ller 
(reinhard) said <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">along 
with the class definitions - we haven't set it in stone but 
i strongly believe it will be in the database</quote>. 
Yurii Rashkovskii (Yurik) asked <quote who="Yurii Rashkovskii">you 
mean you'll store code in db?</quote>. Reinhard confirmed 
this - <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">gcd or xml will only 
be a means to trasport it - but at runtime all this will 
come from the db</quote>.</p>

<p>Harald asked <quote who="Harald Meyer">are the set of 
language for methods implementation a limited one?</quote>
Reinhard said that support for methods written in languagues 
other than python <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">is very low on 
priority - and i'm still not sure if it makes sense to support 
compiled languages for methods</quote>. Yurii suggested this 
might be important <quote who="Yurii Rashkovskii">for 
the time-critical methods at least</quote>. 
Reinhard said that <quote who="Reinhard Mueller">two appservers
(with load balancing)</quote> could have different operating 
systems or processors, which would make compiled method code 
impractical, and <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">i don't think 
compiling method code gains much performance - as opposed to 
for example optimization of db access</quote>.</p>

<p>Harald asked if thie meant <quote who="Harald Meyer">that 
if two business objects have some methods which are identical, 
these have to be stored twice?</quote> Reinhard said yes, 
but <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">this won't be the case very 
often (imho)</quote>. Yurii said that, on his project, 
<quote who="Yurii Rashkovskii">attributes &amp; methods 
are separated. methods are just reffered from the database to 
their location at services that run that methods - so method 
could be implemented in any language - the only one thing is 
that this method wrapper must be able to talk w/ its 
service</quote> He felt <quote who="Yurii Rashkovskii">that 
storing code in db is a bad idea</quote>.
Harald said he did not <quote who="Harald Meyer">have 
anything against storing the code in the db. but what I 
think would be better: don't store the methods with the 
objects, but just referr to them</quote>.</p>

<p>Yurii asked whether GNUe Application Server would 
<quote who="Yurii Rashkovskii">start method code on each 
request for this method execution?</quote> Reinhard said he 
was not sure, but 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">i <cite>think</cite> we 
should aim at something like - method code can be dynamically 
changed while server is running and on next invocation new code 
is active - but appserver caches method code and if not changed  
then it can use (precompiled) version in cache</quote>.</p>

<p>Reinhard said that a lot of these issues could be 
reviewed once they had some working code, and could see the 
impact of different ways of working - 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">we can discuss about the best way 
to store methods for 3 years and not write a single line of code -
i know it because the gnu enterprise project worked like this for 3 
years until derek came and kicked our butts :)</quote>. Different 
people had different ideas about how things would work as of time 
of writing.</p>

<p>Harald asked <quote who="Harald Meyer">can/will business 
objects run automatically or only if the are controlled by a 
user?</quote> For example, automatic re-ordering of products 
that fall below minium stock levels. Reinhard said that business
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">objects do not act, they are 
acted upon</quote> but <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">invoked 
by the user or invoked by cron doesn't make much 
difference</quote>. Harald said he hadn't been clear about 
what a  business object was from Reinhard's whitepaper. 
He asked whether <quote who="Harald Meyer">the data itself is 
part of the business object, or is it just the definition of 
the data?</quote>. Reinhard said that 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">business object can actually mean 
both</quote> - he preferred the terms 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">a business object class or 
a business object instance</quote> where a distinction was 
needed.</p>
