<p>John Lenton (Chipaca) reported <quote who="John Lenton">we've 
been fighting with datasources, cursing that you can't 
make one access two table at the same time...  ...only that when 
we were over at my place last night talking about stuff we realized 
that no, datasources *should* be stupid, because it's the 
appserver where the intelligence belongs</quote>. 
Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) said that 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">some basic functions will be 
usable</quote> in GNUe Application Server (GEAS) in about a week. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i 
dont think geas is your answer - if the datasources dont do something 
you need let jamest or jcater know - as GEAS is SUPPOSED to use the 
common data level - which means datasources and such would be the 
same</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">I 
think that in a 3-tier environement the client=forms should as light 
as possible. i.e. in 3-tier env. forms don't need views or something 
like that. views would live in the middleware = geasV2</quote>. 
However, <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">if views could be added to the 
db abstraction layer in common, to make 2-tier support this too. would 
be great.</quote> John felt <quote who="John Lenton">nobody 
should be building 2-tier apps :)</quote> Jan said 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">gnue will give you the choice. ;)</quote>. 
However, <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">There will be a point where some 
features, f.e. views, transactions, locking... will be quite difficult 
to add to the db abstraction in common, and where its more praticable 
to move it up one layer. just because of programming issues.</quote></p>

<p>John suggested <quote who="John Lenton">in a 3-tier app, i.e. 
with geas, all i have to do is define the 'view' or whatever and i'll 
be able to access it from the forms as if it were a table? and this 
will work even if geas is using a db that doesn't support views?
and the view will be defined in some xml format?</quote> Jan 
agreed - <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">but don't expect that feature 
for geas v.0.1 or 0.2</quote> John said <quote who="John Lenton">we're 
willing to make them happen :) i.e. code them ourselves</quote>.</p>
