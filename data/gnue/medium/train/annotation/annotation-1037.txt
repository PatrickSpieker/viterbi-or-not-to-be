<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>Joe Konecny asked <quote who="Joe Konecny">Is the 
GNUe project actively being worked on?  I looked at the
IRC logs and it really looked like a joke.</quote> 
Chad Walstrom said that CVS commits were probably a 
better guide to the level of development activity. 
He added that the mailing lists were 
<quote who="Chad Walstrom">usually less "off-topic" 
than an IRC chat room or log file</quote>, and also 
recommended <a href="http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/">Kernel 
Cousins</a>. Derek Neighbors agreed that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">IRC is 90% joke and 10% 
development, but still the majority of the development 
design work is done there. One thing you will find with 
GNUe is that there are a lot of 'professionals' who
quite frankly started GNUe to work in an environment 
other than whatthey get paid to work in.  (read there 
is great enjoyment in the community)  So yes IRC might 
seem childish and full of mindless banter, but it is 
fun. :)</quote> He also noted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">CVS commits happen daily 
in volumes larger than most Free Software 
packages.</quote></p>
