<p>It was asked if Designer could be used to change the table 
structure in the underlying database. 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">if you want 
to change your database structure, you can't use designer for that 
task (yet :)</quote>. For large applications, 
he said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">currently, we are all waiting 
for the application server, which sits between the forms and the 
database - when it is usable, we can write big applications on top 
of the gnu enterprise tools - but you can use current gnue as a ms 
access replacement very well - there are some in-house applications 
written by some core team people</quote>. He explained that 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">gnue reports makes heavy use of sablotron, 
which is an xsl transformation processor. it processes xml-&gt;text and 
xml-&gt;xml - thus, you have to install PySablot (the python binding for 
sablotron) to make Reports work.</quote>. He confirmed that the 
GNUe tools were all written in python - <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">it's 
a really fine language</quote>. He confirmed that 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">XML made by Designer is stored in files, but 
there will be facilities to let it reside on the server as well</quote>. 
The validation code <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">doesn't have to be copied 
into every forms definition file</quote>, as it was part of the Forms 
client.</p>
