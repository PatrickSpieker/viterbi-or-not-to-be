<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Marcos Dione (StyXman) said he had added <quote who="Marcos Dione">a 
new widget. I modify GFParser. I modify UIdriver. what's next? I mean, 
*how* do I say that this new GFj uses UIj as visual 
representation?</quote>
Later, he suggested <quote who="Marcos Dione">could it be the WIDGETS 
hash @ the end of UIdriver? says it's for designer...</quote> 
Jason Cater (jcater) arrived and said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">UIwxpython</quote>. Marcos felt 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">it's incredible how a word, a simple word, 
can change you whole mood.</quote> Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">dare I ask what you've added?</quote> 
Marcos said it was just an icon he had taken 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">off the maintoolbar</quote> 
as <quote who="Marcos Dione">we think it may be confusing to inexpert 
users.</quote></p>

<p>John Lenton (Chipaca) asked <quote who="John Lenton">btw, 
is there any reason the widgets all require x and y attribs?</quote> 
Jason Cater (jcater) said this was for positioning. John asked 
<quote who="John Lenton">can't that be done automatically?</quote>. 
Jason agreed,but said <quote who="Jason Cater">we have better / more 
important stuff to do than layout management</quote> as of time of 
writing <quote who="Jason Cater">and we get the most bang for the buck 
w/ x,y</quote> in the meantime.</p>

<p>Marcos explained in detail the changes he had made to support 
his new widget. Jason said there was nothing obvious he had missed. 
Marcos said he was getting an error, which he pasted. John 
felt it was a parser problem, but Marcos was not so sure 
- <quote who="Marcos Dione">if it would be a parsing problem, it 
should die saying so.</quote> He pasted some more information 
in the #flood channel.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.28May2002">
Some days later</a>, Marcos asked <quote who="Marcos Dione">if I 
develop a new widget, what exactly should I do in 
forms/uidrivers/_base/UIdriver.py?</quote> Derek said that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if its a widget that will be fully 
supported by GNUe long haul it would go same place as others</quote>. 
If it was an 'unofficial' widget as discuseed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 21 May 2002" title="Multi-platform GNUe Applications" />,
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think it will be handled 
differently</quote>.</p>

<p>Marcos said he was <quote who="Marcos Dione">trying to 
understand a  GFUserInterfaceBase - it has the _formToUI and 
_formToUIWidget hashes, along with widgetConstructorFunction.
The latter seems what I need, but I'm not sure.</quote>
James Thompson (jamest) explained <quote who="James Thompson">_formToUI 
is the form tag to UIfoo mapping - _formToUIWidget is the mapping to the 
numerous widgets that can be created by a single UIfoo instance</quote>. 
Marcos said he was almost there. James went on to explain 
<quote who="James Thompson">right now the entire ui system is created 
from the gfobject tree built by the parser</quote>. However, 
<quote who="James Thompson">this sounds different though</quote>. He 
suggested <quote who="James Thompson">i'd think you could easily add 
a another phased init stage in the form itself</quote> but quickly 
changed his mind. Marcos said he could not work out why the container 
for his new widget <quote who="Marcos Dione">is a wxPanel...</quote>
He explained <quote who="Marcos Dione">_createWindow is called with a 
container param. the one passed to my _cW is a wxPanel. should be a 
sxForm, I gues...</quote> James said <quote who="James Thompson">IIRC 
the wxForm contains a pannel...i think this is some kind of 
wx'ism</quote> but he was not sure.</p>
