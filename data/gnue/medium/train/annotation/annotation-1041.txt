<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Jan Ischebeck noted that <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">At 
the moment the commdrivers directory is not added if a new
release is created with common/setup.py.</quote> He 
suggested that, now the comm drivers were alpha status, 
they <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">should be added to common 
to make the use of appserver etc. possible.</quote> 
Jason Cater said <quote who="Jason Cater">It was merely 
an oversight that setup.py doesn't install 
commdrivers</quote>, and applied Jan's patch.</p>
