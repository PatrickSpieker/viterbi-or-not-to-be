<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) said Firebird was his favourite database -
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">becouse it's better then mysql, and have 
native win32 version</quote>. It was, if anything, easier to 
administer than MySQL, and was only a 2.5 MB download from 
<a href="http://firebird.sf.net">Sourceforge</a>.</p>

<p>Later, Jan Ischebeck said he had <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">had 
a look at btami's patch for dbdriver/interbase. It just adds trigger 
functions (similar to the ones in dbdriver/_pgsql) and won't 
make the basic driver getting unstable or something like that</quote>, 
so he would prefer to apply it now rather than after the current 
codefreeze. Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">I've 
already added it - like 4 minutes ago :)</quote></p>

<p>Jan asked what still needed <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">to be 
done before the release of common?</quote> James Thompson (jamest) 
said <quote who="James Thompson">i'd like to look into some issues 
w/ number fields (common/forms interaction) - but honestly that's 
looking like next weekend and I want to release so badly</quote>. 
He wondered if claiming that <quote who="James Thompson">now that 
we're known for working on GNUe our lives have become one non-stop 
party</quote> might <quote who="James Thompson">help us attract more 
developers :)</quote>.</p>
