<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Alejandro Pronotti (aprono) asked <quote who="Alejandro Pronotti">How 
do I do to add an image in a button?</quote> James Thompson (jamest) said 
that <quote who="James Thompson">that isn't supported</quote> for Forms 
buttons - Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) suggested that the toolbar buttons 
were <quote who="Daniel Baumann">hardcoded I think</quote> by wxPython. 
Alejandro also asked about binding <quote who="Alejandro Pronotti">a 
keypress to a trigger?</quote> James said <quote who="James Thompson">at 
one time this was possible but i'd have to look in the code to see if it still 
is</quote>. He appreciated that there were a lot of things hard coded in 
Forms, but this was <quote who="James Thompson">to fit the design goal of 
forms - we are not building a</quote> more generic tool like 
<quote who="James Thompson">glade</quote>.</p>
