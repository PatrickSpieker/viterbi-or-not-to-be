<topic>Reports</topic>

<p>Christian Selig (lupo_) said he was <quote who="Christian Selig">searching 
the web for "raw data"-&gt;"graph" progs - what are the current output 
formats of reports?</quote> Perry Lorier (Remosi) suggested 
<quote who="Perry Lorier">gnuplot</quote>, but Christian pointed out that 
it <quote who="Christian Selig">doesn't speak svg :-/</quote>. Perry 
said <quote who="Perry Lorier">it does speak png</quote>, although 
<quote who="Perry Lorier">it would be nice if it output something 
vector like</quote>. Christian said it could 
<quote who="Christian Selig">output eps</quote>.</p>

<p>Batik, from Apache.org was suggested as an alternative, but 
Christian noted it was <quote who="Christian Selig">written in Java</quote>. 
He noted that 
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/software/plotutils/plotutils.html">plotutils</a> 
<quote who="Christian Selig">sounds nice</quote>, and had not one but 
<cite>two</cite> python interfaces - 
<quote who="Christian Selig">
<a href="http://biggles.sourceforge.net/libplot/">
http://biggles.sourceforge.net/libplot/</a> is the URL for a python libplot 
interface - and it looks quite human</quote>.</p>
