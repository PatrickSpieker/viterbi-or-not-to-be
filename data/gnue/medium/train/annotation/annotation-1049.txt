<p>Christian Selig (sledge_) asked <quote who="Christian Selig">btw, 
whatz the release plan?</quote> Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said they 
had hoped to do a release <quote who="Derek Neighbors">last week</quote> 
for <quote who="Derek Neighbors">forms, reports, designer, common</quote>, 
but this had not been possible due to other commitments for team members. 
He thought <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if i could find a windows tester
we could probably bundle some stuff and check it out - i.e. test it - if 
it works well we release</quote>. Otherwise, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think the best course of action is to 
probably create a branch for the release - and go ahead and have at 
head - and when life becomes sane then tackle a release</quote>. He 
noted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">generally the things that hurt us 
release wise are getting docs updated and getting things tested - we 
have a lot more people with installed systems so it should be easier to 
get 'testers' :) - early releases im not too worried about docs, but 
they are nice to have - we definitely need to get road maps rolling for 
all products - with feature lists by release
- and use the power of cvs to branch/merge as necessary to not 
kill release cycles</quote>. Previously, this had not been an issue, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">as not many developers so we could safely 
not hurt releases</quote>. Although documentation was important, 
for <quote who="Derek Neighbors">this release i would suffer with minimal 
docs to get somethign out the door</quote>.</p>

<p>Also, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we DESPERATELY need debian 
packages</quote> and RPM (Red Hat Package Management) packages 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">to gain critical mass and get over the 'hard 
to install' hump</quote>. He would like to see seperate packages for 
Forms, Application Server, Common and Reports at first, possibly with 
seperate GNUe Common packages for each supported database later. 
There were no technical issues with making debian packages - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i need to lock andrew, jeff and nick in a 
room with some caffiene and computers and not let them out until its 
packaged :)</quote>.</p>
