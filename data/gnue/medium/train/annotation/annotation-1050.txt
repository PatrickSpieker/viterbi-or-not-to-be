<p>Marcos Dione (StyXman) suggested a patch to add a textbox 
widget to GNUe Forms. Jason Cater (jcater) said he would be worried with 
<quote who="Jason Cater">the direction this is heading</quote> if the 
intention was to <quote who="Jason Cater">display html markup</quote>. 
After clarification, Jason confirmed that the existing text widget 
could be made into a text box - <quote who="Jason Cater">set the 
height="5" - and you get a 5-line text widget</quote>.</p>
