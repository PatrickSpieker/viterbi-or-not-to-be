<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) volunteered to do some testing of the GNUe
Application Server (GEAS). Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">if the installer is working 
without problems, we can do a release of appserver 0.0.1 soon.</quote>
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">not really as it relies on common - 
or at least it should require common - which means we have to have a 
release of common in conjunction with it</quote>. Jan clarified 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">soon = after the release of common. :)</quote></p>

<p>Derek tried <quote who="Derek Neighbors">playing stupid user</quote> 
and tried to install using the instructions in  the INSTALL.cvs file. He asked 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">does your setup.py in appserver directory 
check for a VALID rpc driver installed?</quote> Jan confirmed this. 
Derek asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if you run appserver and no rpc 
driver is available what happens?  do you get a good error message telling 
you wehre to get it?</quote> Jan said this was the same as trying to use 
an unavailable database driver - it <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">raises an 
error with an url</quote> of the location of the driver. Derek liked
this idea.</p> 

<p>Derek noted that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the install file</quote> 
did not mention the changes needed to the connections.conf file to define 
a connection for GEAS. He got the various GEAS tests working on his system, 
with just a few minor problems that had already been fixed since the 
CVS snapshots had been run at midnight (Central Standard Time). He 
wondered how it managed to <quote who="Derek Neighbors">access postgres 
w/o me giving some sort of credentials</quote>? Jan said 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">its reinhard's code. It just takes your 
LOGNAME and set a bogus password.</quote> Derek said, based on his 
testing, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i give it a green light 
success</quote> - it might make sense to release this as 
Application Server 0.0.1 along with the 0.2.0 Forms/Designer/Common
releases. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) did a round of 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">hi fives</quote> for the GEAS team, 
and added <quote who="Daniel Baumann">wait until it does cool 
things like objects ;)</quote>.</p>

<p>There was some discussion about adding support for 
GConditions before the 0.0.1 release. Derek re-emphasised his 
point from 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 29 May 2002" title="Planning for next release - and beyond" />, 
saying it was important to start getting disciplined about 
roadmaps, and using CVS branches for items which were not 
due until a later release. Jan felt that 
creating a CVS branch at 0.0.1 was a little excessive. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said that <quote who="Jason Cater">imho, we 
need a damn good reason to branch cvs and then remerge - 'cause 
despite what anyone says, that's a bitch to manage :)</quote> 
Derek said it was more a case of making 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">changes twice</quote>. He was open 
to suggestions, but the overall GNUe project was beginning to 
get too big - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">too many developers - 
too many itches - too many products</quote> - to manage on the 
informal basis that had worked fine until now. He said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">some of it is we need good packaging 
and testers - so we can better automate the release process - so 
developers dont have to devote a week to 'releasing' - as that 
would help a lot of the problems</quote>.</p>
