<p>Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked <quote who="Daniel Baumann">what's 
the issues with the win32 interface?</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) 
suggested <quote who="Jason Cater">well, the underlying OS would suck - 
that would be issue #1</quote>. More specifically, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">wx on</quote> Microsoft Windows 
<quote who="Jason Cater">isn't letting us intercept all 
the events that wx under gtk does - so the interaction with the form 
ends up being inconsistent</quote> between the two interfaces. He was not 
sure why, but as a result of this <quote who="Jason Cater">a native Win32 
interface is HIGH on our list for forms</quote>. Daniel asked 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">are there python bindings to the win32 
api?</quote>. Jason confirmed this - it was in win32all, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">the same package that provides our ODBC support 
in windows</quote>.</p>
