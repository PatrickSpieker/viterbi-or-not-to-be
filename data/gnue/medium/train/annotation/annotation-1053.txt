<mention>Jason Cater</mention>

<p>Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) noted that Jason Cater (jcater) had done 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">a bugfix 0.4.3 designer</quote> to 
resolve the problems discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 29 Jan 2003" title="Problems with wxPython 2.4 and Designer" />.
This was version <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">0.4.3 - since designer 
was previously at 0.4.2 :) - now it matches forms, iirc - forms &amp; 
common got bumped to 0.4.3 in december iirc, due to a couple of 
buglets</quote>, but had not been affected by the wxPython problem.</p>

<p>Andrew also wondered if <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">jcater might be 
planning another 0.5.0 prerelease</quote> but James Thompson (jamest) 
said there would be <quote who="James Thompson">no more prereleases 
for a while - i don't think anyone tried out the last ones :( - and 
so we moved on</quote>. In any case, <quote who="James Thompson">i 
think i'll be happier w/ the upcomming 0.5.0 release if it has more 
of the 0.5.x features in it at the beginning anyway</quote>. 
Peter Sullivan (psu) agreed - <quote who="Peter Sullivan">I would 
guess that people aren;t beating down the door for 0.5.0 as the main 
change is that it breaks backwards compatability - for a good reason, 
natch - but still a breakage. All the "goodies" in 0.5.x come later - 
native UIs, etc</quote>.</p>
