<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>It was asked if GNUe was usable for accounting yet. Jason Cater 
(jcater) explained <quote who="Jason Cater">if you are looking for an 
out of the box solution today, then GNUe is not ready for what you 
need - to date, we have been focusing on the underlying tools - 
so the actual accounting packages are still very early - most still 
in planning stages</quote>. It was noted that 
<a href="http://www.compiere.org/">Compiere</a> 
(as previously discussed in 
<kcref subject="19 Aug 2002" title="GNUe as a fully free alternative to Compiere" /> 
and other threads) was open source, but required proprietary Oracle 
database software and a reasonable sized server. Jason Cater (jcater) 
noted <quote who="Jason Cater">I tried compiere at one point - and I 
have oracle installed - I never did get it working :-/ though it 
appears to be a pretty complete accounting solution</quote>. 
Peter Sullivan (psu) said that the <quote who="Peter Sullivan">problem 
is that by the time you;ve installed oracle &amp; java, you 
wonder whether this really counts as "free" (in both liberty &amp; 
cash senses)</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">unfortunately 
there are no good free solutions :( - there are several available that, 
if you cross your fingers, they may handle your specific case</quote>. 
Peter speculated <quote who="Peter Sullivan">maybe some day SAP will 
decide to put R/3 under a free license, same as SAP-DB</quote>, but he 
thought this was unlikely. 
<a href="http://www.wyatt-erp.com/">http://www.wyatt-erp.com</a> was 
mentioned - Jason noted <quote who="Jason Cater">wow, they've come 
along pretty well</quote>.</p>
