<p>Keith Jagrs (KeithJagrs) said he needed to develop an intranet in python 
that had ERP-style functionality - <quote who="Keith Jagrs">I am evaluating 
Twisted, Webware and GNUe</quote>. He was <quote who="Keith Jagrs">inclined 
to use web interface - but it could be other  GUI , if it's easier</quote>. 
He needed to develop <quote who="Keith Jagrs">modules on inventory, crm, 
production and management - and also interacts with an existing accounting 
package</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">the 
other two tools you mentioned are designed to help simplify the creation 
of web-based applications - gnue is designed to simplify the creation of 
database-based applications. If you go with the former then you will be 
stuck with a web app (which if that's what you want, then that's not a big 
deal) but you will have to hand-code a lot of the database routines. Gnue 
does not have a strong web-based mentality - so you won't get that aspect 
that you are looking for</quote>. Keith said his coworkers 
<quote who="Keith Jagrs">want to develop in delphi</quote>. Jason had not 
realised that <quote who="Jason Cater">delphi does web-based</quote> but 
said <quote who="Jason Cater">there's a lot of similarities between delphi 
and gnue, or so I've been told - /me has never used it - derek was a big 
delphi fan</quote>. Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">delphi does web - BUT its FUGLY web. Basically 
it makes a .dll (or cgi) - and just passes crap through. Its really rather 
horrid - but if you believe in being a one tool guy - then if your hammer 
is delphi - you can use that hammer to saw wood just fine. Just dont expect 
exact cuts ;)</quote></p>
