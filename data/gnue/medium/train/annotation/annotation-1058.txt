   <p>It was asked why to build AppServer. It's good for OSS to build ERP, but AppServers already exist. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) explained that <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">althought its called appserver you can't compare it with jboss f.e. because it is much more specialized. It focuses on business method + data access only and will bring a new method of defining business modules and combining them.</quote> It was asked what GNUe AppServer does better than other AppServers, for example, zope - it's also written in python, as other AppServers, it's capable to latch onto whatever format or protocol is needed with minimum hassle. Jan noticed that <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">GNUe is older than zope</quote>, <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">its web based</quote>, <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">is way too big and it uses a ODBMS as backend, while we mostly use RDBMS</quote>.</p>
<p>Earlier discussion about zope and AppServer can be found in <a href="http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/gnue20020601_31.html#1">GNUe Traffic #31</a>.</p>
<p>Then the discussion turned to main issues with GNUe. James Thompson (jamest) listed them:
<ul>
<li><quote who="James Thompson">we need people willing to work on solutions using gnue</quote></li>
<li><quote who="James Thompson">we need appserver a bit further along</quote></li>
<li><quote who="James Thompson">the ui system needs expanded</quote></li>
<li><quote who="James Thompson">then polish and a little tlc</quote></li>
<li><quote who="James Thompson">the tools that exist work well enough but projects like gnue-sb are going slow</quote></li>
</ul></p>
<p>GNUe website also recieved its critique - its visual design is suboptimal. Jason Cater (jcater) explained - <quote who="Jason Cater">we're not web designers</quote>, <quote who="Jason Cater">but then again, it works</quote>.</p>
