<p>In 
<kcref posts="3" startdate="22 Apr 2002 21:18:02 -0800" title="GNUe for plant nursery management" />,
Patrick Baaker had asked for <quote who="Patrick Baaker">a list
of people using GNUe in production</quote>. Derek Neighbors 
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">I will give you this offlist 
as not all entities publicly are willing to admit to using free 
software.  Kind of silly huh.</quote>.</p>

<p>Patrick said he was concerned <quote who="Patrick Baaker">forms 
may be too limiting from what I've seen(but I would have to take a 
closer look before I would decide).</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">If you let us know where forms is too 
limiting we might be able to help.</quote></p>

<p>Patrick said <quote who="Patrick Baaker">I was thinking in terms 
of having layers of definitions in a report</quote> to split things 
like headers/footers, the data itself, and 
<quote who="Patrick Baaker">a pull-quote style summary of some 
portion of the data</quote>. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">We plan to support leveling in this 
fashion.</quote></p>

<p>Patrick had not seen any mention of 
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/fop">FOP</a>, although 
<quote who="Patrick Baaker">since it is part of Apache, its in 
Java.</quote> Derek said that GNUe Reports would support FO
(formatted objects). As GNUe was pluggable, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">you could even use FOP from apache 
if you so like to go from our FO to PDF. I imagine if an 
FO-&gt;ps,pdf,etc isnt ready for python by the time we get there, 
that we will either use a java one until a python one 
becomes ready or consider converting a java one to python.
