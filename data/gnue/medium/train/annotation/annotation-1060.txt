<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Harald Meyer had reported a <quote who="Harald Meyer">problem to 
the mysqldb guys and it seems that they are arguing whether this 
is a mysqldb fault or a gnue fault, because we call fetchmany 
without doing</quote> a check as to whether the rowsadded were 
less than the maxrows. However, they had provided him with a 
patch. Derek Neighbors said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">Im not 
sure I follow.  The first reply seems to say we are wrong 
we need to use =None (which is what we had and it gave us type 
errors) Then the next guy says you cant do None as it will give 
you type errors (which is what we experienced and why we changed 
it).  He then goes to say the bug lies with them and submitted a 
patch.</quote>. He asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">Have you 
applied this patch and verified if you problem went away?  
If so we know its a bug in their stuff.</quote></p>
