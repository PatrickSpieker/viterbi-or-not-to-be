<p>Jens M&#252;ller asked <quote who="Jens M&#252;ller">What is the 
difference between geas and appserver?</quote> 
Reinhard M&#252;ller explained <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">
"geas" was an application server that was contributed to us by a
company. After trying for some time to adapt it to our needs, we decided
to not use it (except as a source for ideas) and write our own.
We called the directory for the "new" one "appserver" to be consistent
with "forms", "reports", "designer" etc. 
The "geas" directory is obsolete and is kept only to look up how the old
application server did things.</quote></p>
