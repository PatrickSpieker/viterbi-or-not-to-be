<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Jens M&#252;ller supplied a <quote who="Jens M&#252;ller">patch for</quote> 
the documentation about business objects for GEAS.</p>

<p>Later, <a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.02May2002">
on IRC</a>, Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) noted 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">IMHO it's *** urgent that the old 
obsolete docs are removed from our web page</quote>. Jason Cater
(jcater) had <quote who="Jason Cater">no issues with that - 
or at least write a sed script to add a header to each "THIS IS 
OBSOLETE DOCUMENTATION" or something</quote>. Later,
Reinhard told Jens (ICJ) <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">I'm 
highly sorry to tell you that this doc is outdated and obsolete - 
because it was aimed at GEAS v1 - however we appreciate your 
effort anyway - our docs suck real hard :(</quote>. Jens 
suggested <quote who="Jens M&#252;ller">oops ... Could you put that 
on the first page? and could you move it to the /docbook/old 
directory?</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Jens suggested <quote who="Jens M&#252;ller">Can you checkin anyway? 
I believe these documents will serve as a guideline for the creation of</quote> 
the new version of the Application Server.</p>
