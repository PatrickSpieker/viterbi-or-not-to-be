<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>
<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>It was asked if there were any reference sites for GNU 
Enterprise. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) said that 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">dneighbo, jcater and jamest use GNUe 
Forms, Reports and Designer in production for projects they are 
involved in</quote>. It was noted that GNUe had been considered 
for a project to replace a Microsoft Access database, but the 
designers had eventually gone with phpgroupware instead, as 
web-based access was a priority. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo), remembering 
<kcref startdate="05 Apr 2002 23:00:00 -0800" title="GNUe as a free alternative to Microsoft Access - and more" />
noted that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">gnue right now is PRIME 
for replacing access applications - i.e. i think that would be the 
#1 use as it sits today</quote>.</p>

<p>He said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the 'need web' is 
interesting</quote> - although thin client might be a 
requirement, he didn't think that typical web 
browsers such as Mozilla or Internet Explorer were particularly 
"thin," and <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if you are making people 
use lynx for a production application i pity your users :)</quote>. 
He admitted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the correct answer is 
mozilla,i.e. might be thick thin clients - BUT in our case they 
are already on the machine</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek admitted that they had not pushed the web interface for 
GNUe, saying <quote who="Derek Neighbors">there is phpclient in cvs 
now (iirc) - also a webware one (though it might not be in cvs)</quote>. 
However, the core GNUe developers were not personally that 
interested in web applications - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we 
fully want gnue to support them</quote> but were leaving the coding 
effort in this area to others. They personally tended to use other 
thin-client solutions such as LTSP (Linux Terminal Server Project). 
Gontran Zepeda (gontran) quoted somone from another channel who 
had said <quote who="Gontran Zepeda">heterogenous os environs 
demand a web-based solution</quote>. Derek disagreed strongly - 
GNUe clients could <quote who="Derek Neighbors">run on any 
O/S that there is a browser for</quote>.</p>

<p>Concern was expressed about having to install a GNUe 
Forms client on a large number of distributed desktops. Gontran 
suggested <quote who="Gontran Zepeda">create a nice installer?</quote>. 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the only time i see web 
app having a real advantage is if you have LOTS of clients you are 
not in any control of i.e. CLASSIC web applications</quote>. 
But in practice, most companies would not want standard ERP 
functions such as <quote who="Derek Neighbors">inventory, financials 
etc shared by the masses of the internet - most of those applications 
are behind firewalls</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said the negatives to web-based applications were that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">a. the widgets are not conduvice to high 
volume entry/validation - b. statelessness sucks :)</quote>. However, 
he recognised that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">its EXTREMELY important 
for gnue to have a webclient :)</quote> for use where it was appropriate. 
James Thompson (jamest) said that GNUe's web clients would not use java -
they would be <quote who="James Thompson">server side for now</quote> 
with <quote who="James Thomspon">the browser only</quote> on the client 
side. Derek pointed out <quote who="Derek Neighbors">btw: an applet is 
not a web application - as you have to download .java files to your 
computer - so your argument of 'distribution' to lots of users over the 
world is then lost - as every time you upgrade they will have to redownload 
applet etc.... (iirc)</quote>. However, it was felt that a java 
download was fairly painless for the end-user.</p>

<p>Derek noted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">with geas i think we can have 
something similar to applets - you download (via good installer) the 
client - and have it point back to a GEAS server - and you are off 
to the races</quote>.</p>
