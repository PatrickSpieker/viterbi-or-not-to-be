<topic>Designer</topic>

<p>Marcos Dione (StyXman) reported a bug running 
GNUe Designer - <quote who="Marcos Dione">NameError: 
global name '_' is not defined</quote>. He wondered 
if this was because <quote who="Marcos Dione">it can't 
find the messages for gettext</quote>. He was 
installing CVS in his own directory, not as root. Jason Cater 
(jcater) wasn't having the same problem, but 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I bet he has a locale setting
whereas I don't - so mine is falling back to the dummy 
_</quote>. He asked <quote who="Jason Cater">did you run 
./setup-cvs.py - or the individual ./setup.py scripts in 
each tool?</quote>. Marcos said he had 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">run setup-cvs.py, but it doesn't 
install designer.</quote>. Jason said it should. Looking 
at the source, he spotted <quote who="Jason Cater">a bug 
in setup-cvs.py</quote>, which he fixed and then asked 
<quote who="Jason Cater">Anyone running CVS copy of tools:
Please update your CVS checkout, do a rm -f ~/gnue/translations,
and then rerun setup-cvs.py</quote>. He said
<quote who="Jason Cater">StyXman: btw, this may not solve 
your problem - but then again it may :)</quote>. Marcos 
said that Designer was generating a warning 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">
'Unable to load locale information falling back to dummy 
_()' - but it loaded..</quote>. Jason explained 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I didn't actually change anything 
in there -  but the way it was - each time you ran 
./setup-cvs.py, it would create another level of "translations"
i.e., after 4 runs you'd have 
translations/translations/translations/translations/</quote>.</p>

<p>Marcos asked <quote who="Marcos Dione">what's _() used 
for?</quote>. Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) explained 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">when you have string in English
it shows, that this string has translations</quote>. 
Marcos asked <quote who="Marcos Dione">from Desugner.py, 
I realize that it can handle several instances. I think 
an instance is like the representation and handler of a 
form?</quote> Jason explained <quote who="Jason Cater">well,
technically, it's an instance of a designer object - with 
FormsInstances being the only currently implemented type - 
but we'll also have report instances, biz rules instances, 
etc</quote>.</p>
