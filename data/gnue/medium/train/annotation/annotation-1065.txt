<topic>Doc Store</topic>

<p>Further to 
<kcref startdate="26 Apr 2002 23:00:00 -0800" title="GNUe Document Store" />, 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">nickr: 
i want to get you moving on docustore if you are still interested</quote>.
Nick Rusnov (nickr) said he had <quote who="Nick Rusnov">layed out a 
good schema for it</quote> on a recent trip. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i am seeing a need for us internally to 
have a way to manage our documentation - it is out of hand right now - 
so why not eat our own doggie food</quote>. He said the 
project needed <quote who="Derek Neighbors">a nice web interface 
(or forms interface) to our documentation - so it can be stored 
'physically' all over the server (if so desired) - but have a 
unified way to get at it</quote>. He <quote who="Derek Neighbors">was 
really thinking of trying to make it like a library in a sense - i.e. 
categorized, searchable etc etc - and then i started thinking hey 
wait some of this stuff is the same thing a lawyer or doctor or xxx 
might need to get at their 'documents' - maybe i should be thinking 
about document management here</quote>. This was without 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">even getting into versioning and 
such</quote>.</p>

<p>Nick said his current plan was to allow 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">youto store a notional docgument as a 
URL/md5 sum or thhe actual data</quote>. He would 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">do a dia of the schema I havwe in 
mind</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">even a 
database that does meta data and just stores a url would be a huge 
win :)</quote>. Nick said <quote who="Nick Rusnov">the metadatabase 
and actual storage thing are pretty independent - and so is the 
libarary which is a layer on top of metadatabase. I'll start laying 
out the metadatabase componant when I get the chance. Its actually 
kind of neat - you recall before that I had a fixed sort of 
versiniong relationship? I changed that so there are 'relationship 
objects' which define various classes of relationships between 
documents - eg version-of, derivative-of, etc - each would be well 
defined so you could track the genaelogy of a particular document  
these rel/ationships could also provide heuristics for inheriting 
metadata</quote>.</p>
