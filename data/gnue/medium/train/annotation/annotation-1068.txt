<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">is 
information available about the status of every driver of the db 
abstraction layer? like x has feature x,y (i.e. introspection) and #
y is rather instable....</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">um - we have common/README.datases - it 
will need to be updated before our release</quote>. Later, Jan noted 
that, <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">although its quite complete, i still 
think their are some informations missing for example, if the database 
adapter supports introspection</quote> - the ability to query the 
database to discover what tables and fields it had. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">we will add that before the next release - 
which, for the record, we are targeting at next weekend. From memory, 
though, introspection is well tested for all the postgresql and oracle 
drivers and has been used (but not sure to what extent) for mysql, db2, 
firebird/interbase</quote>. He added <quote who="Jason Cater">I know it 
exists for (but not well tested with) SAP-DB</quote>.</p>
