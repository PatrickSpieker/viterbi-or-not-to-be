<topic>Application Server</topic>
<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">does 
anybody knows if database fields with spaces or special 
characters are supported?</quote>. Peter Sullivan (psu) remembered 
<kcref startdate="06 Jan 2002 12:20:05 -0800" title="Old and new parser for GNUe Class Definitions" />, 
saying <quote who="Peter Sullivan">GEAS will use double 
underscores in places</quote>. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) 
said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">I don't think GEAS is totally 
defined...I see nowhere where a object-relational mapping is 
specified (yet) ;)</quote> Jan said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">it 
would be great to have a definition soon.. I would like to test how  
common/dbdrivers and appserver can be connected.</quote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.06May2002">
The next day</a>, Jan said he had <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">made 
some changes to setup-cvs.py</quote> and asked for comments. he 
said there <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">is still one problem with the 
gtestcvs command now. You have to be into common/src/commdrivers/_test 
to test the rpc server. So if it doesn't work, you know why.</quote>
He also noted <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">dbdriver/popy introspection 
support is broken. I have a "bit" dirty fix, and am not shure if i 
should commit it</quote>, as <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">my patch is 
dirty, because I patch it in the _pqsql directory and not in the popy 
code itself.</quote>. James Thompson (jamest_) said 
<quote who="James Thompson">what we've typically done is copy the 
non-std function from _pqsql into the driver and patch there</quote>. 
Jan said this could be done, <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">I've just 
been too lasy.</quote>. He confirmed <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">server.py 
is fixed. now the whole test case should work.</quote> 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">GTest.py outputs a menu and you can choose 
which testcase you like to run (f.e. donut rpc test client, test 
server, geasRpcClient, or the appserver/test</quote>.</p>  

<p>Jan also asked <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">about quoting of table 
and row identifiers? To my knowledge this is not  done at the moment.</quote>
James said <quote who="James Thompson">we probably should</quote>. Jan 
said he like to include spaces in table and field names for improved
readability. James wondered <quote who="James Thompson">if all db's 
support that? - mysql&lt;cough&gt;</quote>. Jan said he would expect 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">that every db use a different quoteing style. 
so there should be a function "quote_identifier" in GDataobjects which 
can be overwritten by the drivers code</quote>. James suggested putting 
it <quote who="James Thompson">in _dbsig</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) reported 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">appserver basic data access works
(read only)</quote>. He had had to make some changes to 
Jan's code - <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">the interface of 
geasSession has changed - should be no biggie to fix it 
again. If i can help you please let me know - 
however RPC doesn't work here (missing packages) so it'd be 
cool if you could fix it :)</quote>.</p>

<p>On coding standards, he asked for confirmation that 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">most of our objects have the 
same name as the module?</quote> - <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">this 
is because we have a source file per class, right?</quote> Jason 
Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">not necessarily - 
but there was enough code for Datasources to justify their own 
module. We don't have strict rules governing what's in a module - 
other than neither of us like 1000+ line files</quote>. 
He explained <quote who="Jason Cater">a module is either - 
1) a directory with an __init__.py file or 2) a .py file</quote>. 
Reinhard noted that <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">and 1) consists 
of a lot of 2)'s ?</quote>. He concluded 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">i think after a week of python 
programming i start to understand the basic concepts of the 
language ;)</quote>.</p>
