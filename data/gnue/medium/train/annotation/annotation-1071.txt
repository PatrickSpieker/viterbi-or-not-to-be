<p>Nicholas Lee (esands) asked <quote who="Nicholas Lee">Is 
there a quick 'howto' for building all the binaries within an alt-root. 
ie /home/foo/src/gnue/ rather than /usr/local/ from cvs</quote>. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) suggested <quote who="Daniel Baumann">check 
out cvs and run setup-cvs.py - it will install things in /home/username/ 
for you</quote>. Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">Ok.  Now just a matter 
of figuring out the db setup and trying some of the samples. Thanks.</quote>.
Daniel noted <quote who="Daniel Baumann">btw, I think there's going to be 
a new release soon ;)</quote>. Nicholas felt 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">Isn't every cvs commit a new release? ;)</quote>. 
Daniel said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">in the sense that there should be 
better and more upt to date documentation ;) - and it will be an officially 
supported version ;) - not that you can't get support here though :)</quote>. 
Nicholas thought that documentation was <quote who="Nicholas Lee">certainly 
worthy of a release. I was trying to figure if some of the stuff at 
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/ was really "Updated: 14 Jul 00"</quote>. 
Daniel noted <quote who="Daniel Baumann">the Forms API will be in the new 
technical reference ;) - instead of having to grok it form examples, 
etc.</quote>. Nicholas suggested <quote who="Nicholas Lee">a nice 
article/howto for one of the linux site going into the step-by-step 
mechanics of setting up a first stage gnue installation. (ie. for doing 
form development work.)</quote>. Daniel said that a brief outline 
would be:</p>

<quote who="Daniel Baumann">
<ol>
<li>setup database</li>
<li>use designer ;)</li>
<li>make some forms</li>
<li>write some triggers</li>
<li>deploy</li>
</ol>
</quote>

<p>Nicholas said that was a good start - <quote who="Nicholas Lee">now add 1000 
words. ;)</quote>. He asked <quote who="Nicholas Lee">Is there a man describing 
the *.conf files?</quote>. Daniel said he wasn't aware of anything other 
than the comments in the *.conf files themselves. Nicholas suggested 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">Another thing you guys should setup is a CPAN like place 
where outside developers can contrib applications so others can see what can 
be done</quote>. Daniel said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">I am not too familiar 
with CPAN but we plan to have an arhcive of packages built with the tools - 
and our core packages</quote>. Nicholas felt that 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">CPAN stregth is i. its search/archive mechanism, ii. 
its easy of install using the Makefile.PL system</quote>.</p>

Three days later</a>, Peter Sullivan (psu) asked if there was 
any useful distinction between User Documentation and Developer 
Documentation, as the current web site had two 
seperate hyperlinks that pointed to the same place. 
He asked <quote who="Peter Sullivan">what are our working 
definitions of "user" and "developer"?</quote> 
Perry Lorier (Isomer) suggested <quote who="Perry Lorier">user 
someone that doesn't know python - developer someone that 
wishes they didn't know python</quote>. Daniel Baumann 
(chillywilly) said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">all internal 
and hacking guides would be in</quote> the Developers' 
section, but <quote who="Daniel Baumann">there isn't much right
now</quote> of that.</p>

<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">notice
the developers one says coming someday :) - the idea was 'developer' 
documentation belonged in one place and user documentation in another - 
at this point i would say we have very little 'user' documentation - 
and even then its not 100% crystal clear - as we have 'development' 
tools - so should the docs on how to use the development tools be user 
or developer docs :)</quote>? He would like <quote who="Derek Neighbors">to 
see documentation by product - so say there is a FORMS documentation 
page - and a DESIGNER documentation page etc - and then in each one of 
those pages there is developer and end user sections - same for the 
packages - but then there is global doc page - that shows all developer 
or end user</quote>.</p>

<p>He felt the biggest problem was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we wont 
standardize on doing docs a single way</quote>. He said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">the original idea was to have compendiums 
built - i.e. books built off the smaller documents - so one could say 
i want every document from gnue - and get a fat old pdf file</quote>. 
Peter wasn't sure this was necessary. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">it gets asked for ALL the time - 
most people dont like going all over the world trying to get information 
(our current state is REALLY bad) and downloading lots of little tidbits 
of information - especially those that like to kill trees and read 
later</quote>. He felt <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if you do indexing 
properly and chapters correctly - when it rolls up - its still relatively 
easy to find things</quote>. In a typical IRC topic drift, the 
conversation then mutated to the similarities between accountancy 
and Marxism.</p>
