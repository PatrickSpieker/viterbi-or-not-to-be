<p><a href="http://www.compiere.org">Compiere</a>
was referred to again as a possible altenative to GNUe. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) summed up previous discussions from
<kcref startdate="14 Apr 2002 07:08:33 -0800" subject="Compiere" /> and 
<kcref startdate="07 Nov 2001 18:06:33 -0800" subject="[gnue-discuss] Kantor" />,
saying <quote who="Daniel Baumann">I 
have heard some peope talking crap about it in here before ;) - 
only because it has nasty dependencies or something</quote>. 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said it needed non-free software, notably 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">Oracle</quote>. 
Daniel said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">we support Oracle - 
but we also support a LOT more ;)</quote>. Robert Dean (rdean) 
confirmed that Compiere's wesbite mentioned 
<quote who="Robert Dean">they're working on pgsql support</quote>, 
later adding that the <quote who="Robert Dean">oracle specificity 
is derived from using Oracle extensions to SQL</quote>. 
Andrew noted <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">compiere also requires 
jdk 1.4 from sun :)</quote>, which was not free software either. 
On licensing, Andrew noted that the 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">compiere public license is 
MPL with only a couple of modifications</quote>, which would 
mean <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">Compiere, Inc can roll your changes 
into a proprietary product</quote>.</p>
