<p>Alexander Brill (kiOwA) asked <quote who="Alexander Brill">about 
available packages/templates</quote> for GNUe. Peter Sullivan (psu)
said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">the website is out of date - we have 
a redesign in the works</quote>. He explained 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">at the moment, the tools are pretty much 
all we have (Forms, Reports, etc) - if by "package" you mean Financials, 
HR, Payroll, SCM etc - then all of those are stalled at the moment - some 
we have proposals for, some we don;t. The sticking point has been 
that although we *could* write packages using two-tier - ie forms talking 
direct to database - we don;t really want to - we really want to use n-tier - 
ie forms talks to appserver talks to database.</quote> The project had 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">ju7st started an appserver re-write - 
once that is bearing fruit - we can start on the packages for real. 
In the meantime, 2 tier (forms to database) is *very* usable for people 
who want to write their own apps</quote>, noting 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">several of the guys here use Forms in 
production</quote>.</p>

<p>Alexander said <quote who="Alexander Brill">I program in python, so your 
project seemed like my best bet ;)</quote>. Peter confimed 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">we live &amp; breathe python here - 
even I've become infected</quote>. He said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">The 
other benefit of hopping onto GNUe now is that if you write an app in 
2-tier (i.e. forms talks to d/b) - once the appserver is ready to rumble - 
moving to 3-tier (forms talks to appserver talks to d/b) should be an easy 
conversion - basically take all your triggers and business logic out of 
forms - and put it into appserver</quote>. This might even be possible to 
automate.</p>

<p>He concluded <quote who="Peter Sullivan">basically, if you need 
an off the shelf ERP package to go live tomorrow - then no, we're not that - 
If you need a convenient toolkit to write database apps of simple to mid 
complexity - we're here already</quote>. Alexander said 
<quote who="Alexander Brill">I was looking for something that I could 
customize the hell out of... And shrink-wrapped isn't my kind of style.</quote>
Peter said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">We like customisation - 
as GNUe packages will be GPL, nothing to stop you re-writing source. But 
even beyond that, we already have concept of "templates" which you can apply 
to packages</quote> to apply country-specific or site-specific functionality.</p>
