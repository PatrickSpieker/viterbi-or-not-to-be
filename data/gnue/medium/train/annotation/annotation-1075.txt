<p>Alexander Brill (kiOwA) said he <quote who="Alexander Brill">Was 
thinking about creating a customers-base with everything that 
evolves around. We were already thinking about starting that work 
using webware (python-wrapper for web).</quote> Peter Sullivan (psu) said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">we have a PHP-based web client in CVS</quote>.
Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) said there was <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">also 
forms driver for webware</quote> but this was not in CVS. Rather than 
use web-based applications, Peter said that the main Forms client in 
python <quote who="Peter Sullivan">works on both GNU/Linux and 
Windows</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Jan Ischebeck (siesel) confirmed that 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">PHP is working great in combination with 
postgresql.</quote>. As of time of writing, <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">its 
standalone. just copy the two php files into your web directory and it 
should work - but i've planned to use python common over RPC. so I begann 
to add an modular database adapter system, and worked a bit on the RPC 
stuff... RPC is now running, but it makes not much sense to use the actual 
common/dbadapters per RPC in the phpclient. I.e. phpclient will just work 
with postgres for a while.</quote></p>
