<p>Calum Morrell (drochaid) asked about building support for 
biometrics into GNUe. Peter Sullivan said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">I 
guess I would perceive it as an add-on - main issue is that most 
clients today are PCs and have no biometric support - unless you buy the 
&#163;50 fingerprint detector. I know sklein is the main player on security 
issues - but he rarely shows up in IRC - he obviously has a life 
;-)</quote>. He felt <quote who="Peter Sullivan">biometrics are a 
possible solution to a real problem - in that some orgs have a culture 
of password sharing - which can't be allowed if you are going to make the 
best use of ERP - becuase you have to be able to depend on login being 
who they say they are.</quote> Calum said that many people used easily 
guessable passwords. Peter felt <quote who="Peter Sullivan">things like 
LDAP &amp; single log-in can make things worse - as people don;t think 
thru - that giving your secretary your p/w to print off that word file
also gives her access to the requistion screen in Purchasr Order 
Processing - for that luxury cruise s/he always wanted</quote>. 
Calum said he <quote who="Calum Morrell">firmly believe a person should 
be identified by who they are, and not what they know</quote>.</p>
