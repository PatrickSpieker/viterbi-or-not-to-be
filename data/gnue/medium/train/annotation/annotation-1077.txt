<p>Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) asked <quote who="Charles Rouzer">ya'll seen 
the <a href="http://www.hr-xml.org">HR-XML</a> stuff?</quote> He 
was <quote who="Charles Rouzer">not sure about the licensing</quote>. 
Gontran Zepeda (gontran) cut &amp; pasted some of the copyright notice, which 
suggested that <quote who="Gontran Zepeda">if gnue documents how to use 
their markup, the copyright for that documentation has to be assigned 
to hr-xml.org?</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Derek Neighbors (derek) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">as 
long as we have permission 'technically' we could use a definition - as 
its not code - but i dont know if its a good thing to do per say</quote>. 
He noted that Richard Stallman or FSF general counsel Eben Moglen
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">woudl be the authority to ask - 
but at this point unless someone is pursuing an HR package and jumping 
on it -  would rather not go there</quote>. Charles said 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">it looks pretty GPL compatible to me but I 
just glanced</quote>. Derek noted that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">GPL 
compatiablity is pretty tough - free software is pretty easy to obtain, 
just follow the rules to freedom - GPL compatiable is more tough as it 
requires something to be more copyleft and any thing that 'demands' 
acknowledgement or has odd verbiage is usually tossed - i.e. many a 
licenses deemed non compatiable because the authors wanted some 
attribution or logo dispersed with code - BSD/Zope are two that come to 
mind</quote>.</p>

<p>Charles said that if these issues could be resolved, 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">it seems to me.. that hr-xml could be our 
HR package</quote>. Derek said the last time he had looked, it had 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">ONLY had hiring portion spec'ed i.e. 
they had format for resumes</quote>. Charles said 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">they have a bunch now [...] version numbers 
and all</quote>. He was <quote who="Charles Rouzer">just bringing it 
up</quote> as <quote who="Charles Rouzer">I imagine some biz will want 
it in the future - or will require it per interfacing with Manpower, 
etc, etc if XML becomes what everyone wants it to be</quote>.</p>
