<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Further to
<kcref startdate="28 Apr 2002 23:00:00 -0800" title="Curses implementation of Forms for non-GUI clients" />,
Gontran Zepeda (gontran) asked <quote who="Gontran Zepeda">is 
nstti dusty?  would you mind if i mucked about adding doc strings 
(for happydoc:) and cleaning up</quote>? Jason Cater (jcater)
felt <quote who="Jason Cater">dusty is the wrong word... 
perhaps "is nstti still swimming in embryonic juices?"</quote>.
Gontran said he had <quote who="Gontran Zepeda">dloaded from 
viewcvs the tarball and have been cleaning up -- in order to 
understand and document. From there i'd like to , you know, 
fix it. :)</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) said 
<quote who="James Thompson">that would be wonderfull</quote>. 
Gontran confirmed he was using the version of nstti in 
GNUe's own CVS. James explained <quote who="James Thompson">the 
author let me put in our cvs as he doesn't have time to work 
on - i started looking at what it would take to make an nstti 
driver for forms - nstti is going to need work before it'll 
work properly</quote>. Gontran said 
<quote who="Gontran Zepeda">that's what i figured</quote> but 
<quote who="Gontran Zepeda">/me ADORES curses - um, as a 
user.:)</quote>. He <quote who="Gontran Zepeda">just wanted 
to make sure i wasn't duplicating work</quote>. James said 
<quote who="James Thompson">we'd love the help</quote>. 
Gontran said <quote who="Gontran Zepeda">i'll send you 
patches as soon as things starts getting fixed. :)</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.07May2002">
The next day</a>, Gontran announced his 
<quote who="Gontran Zepeda">nstti tests are starting to work 
:)</quote> and posted a screenshot 
<a href="http://gontran.net/pub/gnue/no_swearing.jpg">on the web</a>. 
Later, he said <quote who="Gontran Zepeda">I'm working out some 
probs with the test script -- it mostly works now ... still more to 
test and fix in the base classes by excercising there. Once that's 
cleaned up -- next couple days (hopefully) I'll have a look at 
tying in the standard? UI hooks.</quote>. James said 
<quote who="James Thompson">why don't we get you an account setup 
on ash - so you can check stuff into the cvs</quote>? Gontran felt 
he was <quote who="Gontran Zepeda">not worthy :)</quote>.</p>
