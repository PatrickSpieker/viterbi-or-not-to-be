<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>Peter Sullivan (psu) said that GNUe was <quote who="Peter Sullivan">that 
bizarre thing, f ree s/w project with a biz model that actually works - 
as a typical ERP project will be, like, half a million for licenses, 
two million for consultancy - well, I'm perfectly happy to forgo the 
1/2 million and just collect the rest, thanks - since I'm not having 
to pay VAR fees for the s/ w anyway</quote>. Also, access to the 
source code was also important, as ERP projects often required 
customisation.</p>

<p>Nicholas Lee (esands) asked if GNUe saw itself as an alternative to 
full ERP systems <quote who="Nicholas Lee">like SAP?</quote> Peter said he 
did not <quote who="Peter Sullivan">see why GNUe shouldn't be going 
head to head with the JBOPS</quote> (JD Edwards, Baan, Oracle, 
PeopleSoft, SAP) <quote who="Peter Sullivan">&amp; winning wherever 
people care about freedom and/or free beer</quote>. Nicholas 
said that <quote who="Nicholas Lee">In a sense every ERP has to be 
customised somewhat. Since no business process is exactly the same 
across entities.</quote></p>
