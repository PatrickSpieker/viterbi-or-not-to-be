<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) noted that <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">for 
the appserver test program you have to set up pgsql so that 
your unix username is known to postgres and you need no password 
for your username</quote> as of time of writing. Andrew Mitchell 
(ajmitch) suggested that it should 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">pick it up from gnue.conf?
or is it connections.conf that it should be in</quote>? Reinhard 
was <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">not sure if that is a good idea</quote>.
He said <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">we actually need to decide what 
user the appserver will use to connect to the database</quote>. 
When a user logged into the Application Server, 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">should the appserver log into the db</quote> 
using that user's username, or a generic login such as 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">geas</quote>?</p>

<p>Andrew asked <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">so where should 
the password be stored? the appserver will need to be able to access 
it to connect</quote>. Reinhard noted it was one of the principles 
of the <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">3-tier setup</quote> that 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">security must be handeled by appserver 
not by database</quote>. This meant that the Application Server 
"user" on the database needed <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">a very 
secret password</quote>. Andrew jokingly suggested 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">i know! we can build in an "override" 
password so it can be used in the movies! :)</quote> 
Reinhard suggested <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">i see only one 
chance - store the password in a file where only the user "gnue" 
has read access - and start the appserver with suid flag</quote>. 
Andrew said <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">that may work - but how 
do we start the appserver with suid flag since it's a python 
app?</quote> Reinhard said it might be necessary to 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">write a "wrapper" binary?</quote> - 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">one that exec's appserver.py and dies 
immediately (so it doesn't use resources all the time)</quote>. 
However, he wondered if the <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">file 
with the password in it</quote> should be referenced from 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">connections.conf</quote>.</p>
