<p>Peter Sullivan (psu) queried <quote who="Peter Sullivan">In 
the dependancies download section of the website, presumably 
we would only ever include things that were not just freely 
redistributable but also free (as otherwise they would not 
be a GNUe dependancy) but not necess GPL?</quote>. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) emphasised that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we should not depend on anything 
that is not free</quote> as an ethical requirement. 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">in the dependencies section i 
think we should be mirroring binaries of current dependencies 
of gnue so say rpm's or .exe's for wxPython/wxGTK, python, etc 
etc. It helps for 'tech support' to not have to point people 
all over to get stuff imho. I think i made stuff under my home 
dir for python2.1 and redhat that had most of the rpms - 
we really need to do it for others as well</quote>. Peter 
said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">I was just working on basis 
that the boilerplate for that directory could assume all s/w was 
free (for reasons you state) but not necess GPL</quote>. 
Derek agreed - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think all software 
we offer for download should be 'free software' - but correct, 
not necessarily GPL or GPL compatiable</quote>.</p>
