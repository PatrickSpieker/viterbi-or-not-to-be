<p>Todd Boyle asked <quote who="Todd Boyle">Would your projects be 
willing to provide documentation of your transaction ledger or journal 
data schema, and if available, your GL interface, to this collection, 
at <a href="http://www.arapxml.net/research.htm">
http://www.arapxml.net/research.htm</a>?</quote> Peter Sullivan said 
that, as GNUe and all its documentation was under the GNU Public 
License (GPL), <quote who="Peter Sullivan">you don't even need to ask.
</quote>. He noted <quote who="Peter Sullivan">It looks as if the main 
focus of your site is trying to get some kind of standard XML 
definitions for General Ledger data</quote>, and noted that GNUe used 
XML extensively, for forms definitions, report output and data 
integration, but not for data storage.</p>
