<p>Jens M&#252;ller noted that a new law in Germany 
<quote who="Jens M&#252;ller">requires that the user agrees in
processing and storing of his personal data. But not only 
that - this agreement has to be electronically documented.
</quote> This would impact on areas of GNUe like CRM.
Todd Boyle thought that privacy laws existed 
primarily for the benefit of governments and 
<quote who="Todd Boyle">Corporations which they invented
</quote> and said <quote who="Todd Boyle">Give us secure 
platforms, and authentication.  That's all we 
need.</quote></p>

<p>Jon Guiton added <quote who="Jon Guiton">This is also true in the
UK under the Data Protection Act.</quote> Neil Tiffin said
<quote who="Neil Tiffin">I see this a easily accomplishable. If someone 
would write a concise description of the requirement we
will add it into our requirements.  We expect to have several
specific country adaptions and have allowed for these in the design
(we have not started the implementations yet).</quote> Jens M&#252;ller
outlined the requirements, and Neil added this to the 
documents.</p>

<p>Stan Klein said <quote who="Stan Klein">
Take a look at the draft security proposal I developed.  It is posted on
Neil Tiffin's page.  One issue I began to try to address is the information
security infrastructure required for meeting European Community (EC)
privacy requirements.  (BTW, the privacy requirements in Europe have been
much more stringent than those in the USA for many years.  I remember
reading articles about the issue in the early-to-mid 1970's.)</quote>. 
He felt <quote who="Stan Klein">The best GNUE can do in the area of
information security and access control is to enable a user to apply the
functionality that the operating system and other infrastructure elements
provide. To that end, my draft proposal tries to begin identifying how to
do that and to simplify the user's task in applying the 
functionality.</quote> He thought <quote who="Stan Klein">
The tricky part for GNUE will likely come from any mandated test and
compliance demonstration/certification requirements included in the
legislation.</quote>.</p>

Earlier, on IRC</a>, Peter Sullivan (psu) said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">I don't think it's a major issue, 
basically just good data protection. The UK has already 
implemented the directive - and the sky hasn't yet fallen.
Of course, US data protection laws are much weaker
- hence the need for "safe harbour" provisions
for companies wanting to share data from EU to US arms</quote>
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) commented <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
looks as though you are saying Europe is going gungho privacy -
while US is going gungho let corporate intellectuall 'property' 
override everything - with addition of 'terrorist' legislation.
/me fears soon we will see following: in Europe its against the 
law for software to easily get at customer data or transmit - 
and - in US its MANDATORY for software to easily get at customer 
data and transmist it :)</quote>.</p>
