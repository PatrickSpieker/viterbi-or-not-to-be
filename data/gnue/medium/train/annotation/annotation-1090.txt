<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) welcomed Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas). Arturas said
he was <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">fluent in Delphi</quote>. Derek said that,
as an ex-Delphi programmer himself, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">python is a VERY
easy transition from delphi</quote>. Arturas said he was keen to help anywhere and 
everywhere! Derek said possible areas to start were:</p>

<quote who="Derek Neighbors">
<ul>
<li>clean up/refactoring of gnue forms (probably best introductory stuff)</li>
<li>extending/finishing gnue-common rpc abstraction</li>
<li>doing work on report engine</li>
<li>doing work on designer</li>
</ul>
</quote>

<p>He suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think we should talk to jcater and
jamest and see if they have some stuff in forms or designer that we can start you
with that will allow you get a better understanding of the internals of gnue, but
while doing something useful :)</quote> He <quote who="Derek Neighbors">was looking
for our current TODO but i can not find it so we can discuss tomorrow</quote>. 
He wished Arturas <quote who="Derek Neighbors">Labanaktis</quote> ('Goodnight' in
Lithuanian).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.22Feb2002">
The next day</a>, Derek suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
specifically we think you could help a lot with internationalization
</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) said they had a 
<quote who="James Thompson">a patch that allows for unicode 
in forms</quote> that needed testing and applying. He said 
Arturas could <quote who="James Thompson">take the existing 
tools - and make with work w/ unicode and/or localization 
features - so that you could write a form in russian - have 
the menus and such appear in russian - store russian in the 
backend. It's as much a design job as a coding job as we can
do some of this now - it's just doing it correctly that 
needs attention :)</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.25Feb2002">
A few days later</a>, Derek asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
jcater / jamest can one of you update the TODO (and 
roadmap) for forms, common, designer? -  this way when 
arturas stops by i can give him something definitive to work on
</quote>.</p>
