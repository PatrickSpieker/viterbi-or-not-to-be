<p>Derek Neighbors said that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">my mission this weekend is
to get gnue debs that work</quote>. He wasn't keen on doing 
Debian packages with autoconf - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i dont want ot do 
it the C way - i want to do it the python way :)</quote>. Daniel Baumann 
(chillywilly) said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">it's justa  macro language - nothing 
tlang specific about it</quote>. Derek said he didn't want to make autoconf a 
dependancy for GNUe in general, but he <quote who="Derek Neighbors">WOULD accept 
having to have autoconf to make debian packages</quote>.</p>

<p>Jeff Bailey (jbailey) said he would do some Debian packages - 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">I just need to get a working copy of GnuE on my system 
so that I can make sure I don't break anything.</quote> Derek said that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">to make a debian shouldnt require changing the 
source code of a program (or so i would think)</quote>. Jeff said 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">It depends on if any locations are hardcoded.  Some of
Debian's filesystem rules are a little twisted.</quote> Derek said this shouldn't 
be a problem. He was keen to get <quote who="Derek Neighbors">working debs in the
pool by sunday night</quote> for 'political' reasons. He asked 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">do you know how to get the source that made those
debs? i.e. if apt-get source gnue-forms works and gets the files necessary to 
actually create the .deb file we are 90% done - all we have to do is find out WHAT
is breaking when you apt-get install gnue-forms for example and fix that</quote>. 
Daniel did a quick apt-get and reported <quote who="Daniel Baumann">looks like it
installs for me home billy</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">it may
INSTALL - does it WORK</quote>? He said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we have 
gotten NUMEROUS reports that it doesnt 'work' -  however we DID have people file 
bugs in debian</quote>. Jeff said there was nothing shown in the Debian bug 
tracking system. He said <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Your reason for not being in 
woody so far is that you're not building on all the arch's. That should be trivial
to fix.</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) wondered why - <quote who="Jason Cater">
could it be a dependency that doesn't build that's keeping us back?</quote>. 
Jeff confirmed that, although he wasn't the package maintainer, he had access to 
maintain them as a <quote who="Jeff Bailey">NMU - Non-maintainer 
upload.</quote>.</p>

<p>Jeff later reported that he got the gnue-forms debian package installed - 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">Incidentally, the only install problem I experiences was
a conflict with pyxml - That's a broken python dependancy, not a gnue 
problem</quote>. This did not install the demo forms, however. He noted 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">Ah, joy.  gnue-forms failed to compile on *every* arch.
That's almost certainly a build-deps problem.</quote> Digging further, he noted 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">I think that he didn't reazlie that Depends aren't
necessarily filled for build-deps.</quote>. He posted a python traceback error 
message he got trying to start Forms with the sample intro.gfd. However, there 
were no Forms experts on hand to take it further.</p>

The next day</a>, Jason apologised for disappearing - <quote who="Jason Cater">
my crappy cable connection went down</quote>.</p>
