<topic>Financials (Accounting)</topic>


<p>Ke Deng asked <quote who="Ke Deng">How do you think of the ERP 
Standards(such as MRPII standard written by Oliver Wight)? Is it 
important for GNUe?</quote>. Derek Neighbors said standards were 
important for GNUe, but many standards <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
a. require a fee for membership to give input</quote> or 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">b. are vendor creator or used by vendors 
to neutralize a market</quote>. However, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
GNUe is highly flexible so it could be made to support almost any 
'standard' you so desire.</quote>.</p>

<p>Todd Boyle referred to <quote who="Todd Boyle">the ARAP project, 
which is free, and is not in any way vendor-specific. It is a 
completely open attempt to observe, or perceive, the needs of every 
GL in the world, and see what can be done towards an 
application-neutral standard for general ledger interfaces.</quote>
He felt <quote who="Todd Boyle">that GNUE does not study or comply 
with any standards, because it takes more time and research, and does 
not provide the software developer with a positive return on their
additional time invested, in most circumstances.</quote>. However, 
this was a reasonable way forward for an open-source project. Neil 
Tiffin disagreed - <quote who="Neil Tiffin">Having worked with GNUE 
for almost 2 years I think the issue is NOT the lack of desire to use 
standards.  I for one would much rather use someone else's prior work 
in the form of standards instead of trying to create a beast from 
scratch.</quote> However, <quote who="Neil Tiffin">I have not found 
an accounting standard that applies to GNUe.  There are all sorts of 
standard that are vying for control of how accounting is done.  But I 
have not found one that is geared for internal systems.  Most of the 
ones mentioned, so far, have been for data interchange and they are 
not currently practical for high volume transactions internal to a 
company.</quote>. However, he was willing to be enlightened on 
this.</p>

<p>Todd felt this was fair comment. There were three different areas 
where standards were being developed:</p>

<p><quote who="Todd Boyle">1. General Ledger standards</quote></p>

<p>The three groups working on General Ledger standards were:</p>

<quote who="Todd Boyle">
<ul>
<li>Eric Cohen and his group at the XBRL Consortium,</li>
<li>Robert Lemense and the D14 domain committee of EDIFACT, and,</li>
<li>our group at ArapXML who produced the OMG GL and OMG AR/AP models,
and are members of the OMG and the Core Components workgroup of
UN/CEFACT.</li>
</ul>
</quote>

<p>He felt the other two groups were not being open enough about 
their work, given that <quote who="Todd Boyle">the world is not 
beating down the doors looking for a GL specification</quote>.</p>

<p><quote who="Todd Boyle">2. e-business integration standards.</quote></p>

<p>There were a large <quote who="Todd Boyle">number of industry 
specific semantic models</quote> being developed. XML-based ones 
were covered <quote who="Todd Boyle">on 
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/">Robin Cover</a> pages</quote>.</p>

<p><quote who="Todd Boyle">3.  The Core Components framework.</quote></p>

<p>This was <quote who="Todd Boyle">the common metadata architecture 
that applies the principles of ISO 11179 to the business 
domain.</quote> This was about getting a <quote who="Todd Boyle">a 
single language</quote> of business terms to provide the semantic 
basis (in terms of natural language) for XML schemas or other 
computer representations of business data.</p>

<p>Zachary Coffin felt that Todd's criticism of XBRL was unfair, 
and noted that <quote who="Zachary Coffin">XBRL International has 
released the *DRAFT* GL taxonomy for public review and comment 
several times.  That's why we have offered it to the world for 
comment.</quote> They had also been co-operating for a year with the 
UN/CEFACT group. They had tried to work with Todd's group as well, 
but to no avail. There was more information on XBRL 
<a href="http://www.xbrl.org/gl/gl.htm">on the web</a>. 
A wide range of organisations <quote who="Zachary Coffin">
including SMEs, government agencies, non-profit
organizations, etc.</quote> were members, and they were
<quote who="Zachary Coffin">even opening up a new category of 
membership, for academics or individuals non-affiliated with a 
company</quote>.</p>

<p>Robert Lemense refuted Todd's comments about him, 
saying he was <quote who="Robert Lemense">
not only a champion of ENTREC</quote> but 
<quote who="Robert Lemense">a champion of all
UN-Standard Messages developed by D14 since 1997</quote>. 
Todd replied that he didn't see <quote who="Todd Boyle">
why anybody needing a GL interface to their
Peachhree or Quickbooks or AccPac should adopt XML Schema
</quote> just to comply with XBRL's notional standard. 
Standards like UN CEFACT would become de facto or 
de jure mandatory for <quote who="Todd Boyle">
external B2B transactions</quote>, which meant that the
process of arriving at the standard needed to be as open 
as possible. The issues were political and economic, not
personal.</p>

<p>Later, he returned to the issue of consultation 
on drafts, and criticised the existing work of Robert's 
group, and the collaberation with XBRL. He didn't see 
<quote who="Todd Boyle">why we need government involvement 
to facilitate semantic standards.</quote> Many of the standards 
already issued by Robert's group were not being used, or irrelevant
to real users. He didn't feel  that there was an 
<quote who="Todd Boyle">authentic "accounting domain" 
in the whole entire domain of computer technology, or 
telecommunications</quote> that needed a single international 
standard anyway. <quote who="Todd Boyle">
There is an internal integration "domain" perhaps.  
That is EAI, and more recently, BP standards.</quote>. He added 
<quote who="Todd Boyle">All of accounting and payments come after 
the fact of business transactions. They are deterministic.  There 
is no need for today's labor force of at least 20 million people 
working in accounting and payments.</quote> He felt that control 
of the standards for business semantics <quote who="Todd Boyle">
by accountants and banks</quote> would enable them to perpetuate 
their role as intermediaries.</p>

<p>Earlier, Derek Neighbors re-iterated his concerns about standards 
bodies that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">requires a lofty membership 
fee to participate and is created by 'vendors'</quote> which 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">hurts the little guy ESPECIALLY 'FREE 
SOFTWARE' developers.</quote>. Kenneth Reiszner said 
<quote who="Kenneth Reiszner">These fees can be as high as $65,000/yr 
[...] None of these fee schedules goes below $5000/yr. even with 
reduced member participation. The high figures are for big buck firms 
that probably can spare the change. The more you pay the more 
"rights" you get</quote>. Stan Klein said that 
<quote who="Stan Klein">Most standards developing organizations 
(SDO's) require some kind of fee (in addition to the cost of 
attending meetings) for participation.</quote> This could vary from 
a notional $10 to thousands of dollars, with different grades of 
membership and influence. There could also be substantial charges for 
copies of standards documents. He thought that 
<quote who="Stan Klein">Trying to completely avoid participation fees
will likely mean avoiding all standards.</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek also asked whether the XBRL standards would cover 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">things for peformance metrics or things 
like balanced scorecard? Also, are you strictly commericial oriented 
or will you delve into the Public Sector and do things similar to 
GASBY?</quote>. Christopher Brown pointed out that <quote who="Christopher Brown">
XBRL is all about <cite>reporting</cite> standards.  It doesn't 
say what fields there ought to be in particular accounting 
transactions; it instead speaks to how the summary report 
at the end of the year should get reported.</quote> There was also
scope for standards on EDI (Electronic Data Interchange), though. 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">I think even EDI 
specifications for data transfers will be similar as we will have an 
EAI tool or even our reporting tool for that matter than can adapt to 
virtually ANY XML format.  The only issue woudl be if GNUe (the ERP) 
not the tools didnt have the proper fields necessary for the 
specification.</quote> Stan Klein said <quote who="Stan Klein">Most, 
if not all, standards define behavior as viewed from outside across 
some kind of interface.  The typical approach is that internal 
implementation is left to the individual implementer.  Sometimes it 
turns out to be easier to implement the external behavior internally, 
but the ability to provide the external behavior by some kind of 
translator is almost always maintained.</quote></p>

<p>He concluded <quote who="Stan Klein">the wonderful thing 
about standards is that there are often so many competing ones to 
choose from.  :-)</quote>. Peter Dabrowki said that 
<quote who="Peter Dabrowki">Technology is changing so qickly</quote>
that applications like <quote who="Peter Dabrowki">
SQL-ledger.org</quote> could end up as a de facto standard anyway - 
certainly for small businesses.</p>
