<p>Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked <quote who="Daniel Baumann">
what the diff is between an inner and outer join</quote> as 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">the one postgres guide I was reading 
was damn confusing</quote>. Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">an inner join only includes rows 
where BOTH tables are the same - and outer join includes all of 
either the left or right table and only the matching of the other
</quote>. Derek gave an example. Jason Cater (jcater) suggested 
<quote who="Jason Cater">come back tomorrow for "Fun 
with Unions!"</quote>. Daniel supposed that SQL 
included <quote who="Daniel Baumann">any set operations right
- as thats the basis - you have a set with relations, iirc
</quote>? Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">union is a distint 
join -  intersect is the common stuff - minus is what's in #1 
and not in #2</quote>. He <quote who="Jason Cater">uses oracle's 
flavor of unions - I'm not sure if their union keywords are SQL92
</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Derek confirmed that 'tuple' was non-standard 
terminology that postgresql used for 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">a 'row' or a 'record' ;)
</quote>. Daniel read on and came across concepts like 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">a cross join - inner join on
true - does anybody use this shit?</quote>. James Thompson 
(jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">i dont - 
i use where clauses - i'm oldskool</quote>.</p>
