<p>Malek Hadj-Ali asked <quote who="Malek Hadj-Ali">
where can I get the packages (financial, sales, ...) and how do I install
them ?</quote>. Derek noted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
We do not have them completed only some proposals for them.  You could 
author packages like these with the framework today, but currently dont 
have 'pre-packaged' ones.  We are working on them.</quote>. 
Elsewhere, Neil Tiffin noted <quote who="Neil Tiffin">
I would just like to point out that the GNUe Packages screenshot has 
a significant lead in hits from all other screen shots,  I would 
interpret this to mean that people want packages.  Its too bad we 
cant find a way to get preliminary packages working with the starts 
that we have.</quote></p>
