<p>Arjen Runsink (Suit) asked whether GNUe <quote who="Arjen Runsink">
preferred wxGTK 2.2.9 or 2.3.2 ?</quote>. James Thompson
(jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">we work w/ either
</quote>, but he personally felt 2.3 was <quote who="James Thompson">
a bit nicer</quote>. The main reason for still supporting 2.2
was that the major GNU/Linux distributions didn't have 2.3 yet. 
Arjen asked <quote who="Arjen Runsink">shoul wxPython match the 
subversion number too, or just the minor?</quote> James said 
<quote who="James Thompson">i had the best luck matching both
</quote>, although <quote who="James Thompson">it's hard to find 
older copies - IIRC you have to go to sourceforge</quote>, as the 
wxpython website only had current versions.</p>
