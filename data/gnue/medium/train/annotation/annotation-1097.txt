<kcref enddate="25 Feb 2002 17:59:19 -0800" subject="[Gnue-dev] GEAS Version 2.0 Meeting" />, 
Reinhard announced he had <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">
prepared a little document summarizing my thoughts and some of the
already discussed points at 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~reinhard">
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~reinhard</a></quote>, and suggested 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">Maybe this document can serve as a 
starting point for our discussion on thursday, and can be updated 
after the discussion to be the authoritive documentation on the 
agreements we reached.</quote>. Neil said he thought the technical 
goal of GEAS was to be a <quote who="Neil Tiffin">
central repository for defining business rules, methods and data 
that does not require a software developer to adapt to the business.
</quote> he felt that the suggested <quote who="Neil Tiffin">
GNUe Object Access Translator (GOAT)</quote> should be responsible 
for row security (e.g. a user can only see orders for their own 
division), but not for form-level security (i.e. users being able to 
view or enter orders at all). It would <quote who="Neil Tiffin"> 
also provide object transparency. Meaning that there will 
not necessarily be a direct relationship between business objects and 
tables.</quote> He wasn't keen on some of the acronyms, and felt that 
there were several other modules that needed including as well. 
He also asked <quote who="Neil Tiffin">Any chance of getting a 
written or pictorial overview of common prior to the meeting?</quote>.</p>

<p>Reinhard said he wasn't keen on the acronyms either and 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">would use them only for internals 
(e.g. function prefixes or the like).</quote> He asked whether 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">we should also name the new incarnation 
"GEAS" or if we should find another name.</quote> 
This would make it <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">clear that it's a 
complete rewrite, and it will be clear that previous documents that 
mention "GEAS" don't relate to that what we are doing 
now.</quote>. However, he couldn't think <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">
of another name. Maybe only GNUe Appserver</quote>.
Derek Neighbors commented <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
The name has always been GNUe Application Server, I say we keep that.  
</quote>. The best way to avoid confusion was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
just REMOVE the old documentation or archive it off in a hard to find 
spot. :)</quote>. This was a branding issue.</p>
