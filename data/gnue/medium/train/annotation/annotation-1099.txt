<topic>Forms</topic>


<p>James Thompson (jamest) asked <quote who="James Thompson">if forms 
highlighted the current field being edited....would this be a bad 
thing?</quote> He said <quote who="James Thomspon">my users are 
complaining about finding the cursor</quote>. Possible solutions 
were <quote who="James Thompson">block cursor - highlighting - 
bolding current fields text - enlarging current field a small amount
</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) suggested <quote who="Jason Cater">
changing background color of current field to a pale yellow???
- ala my label editor in designer</quote>. James was worried that 
<quote who="James Thompson">color blind people might not notice it
</quote>. He suggested <quote who="James Thompson">we can make the 
highlighting an option in gnue.conf - highlighting=none, colored, 
bold, foo</quote> and so on. Derek supported this, and suggested 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think the 'proper' way to denote 
field of focus is to bold highlight the border of the field with 
focus - this way text or background isnt 'altered' which can be 
hard on eyes - but the field appears 'elevated' to distinguish it
</quote> Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I think we can't do 
that in wx - or that would've been our primary approach :(</quote>.
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">that is why optoin in 
gnue.conf is great - so when you have pyGTK and pyQT working someday
you can make it right easy :)</quote>.</p>
