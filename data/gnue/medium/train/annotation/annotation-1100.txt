<topic>Financials (Accounting)</topic>

<p>Sacha Schlegel (Sacha) offered cheking 
<a href="http://www.fisterra.org">www.fisterra.org</a> for another GPL 
ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) quoted 
a bit: <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">"Current release number is 1.4, this 
is NOT a general solution for all kind of business. It's a public release 
of an system used to manage an automotive glass replacement and repair 
company. If you want to use it to manage your business you should check if 
the present features fit your requirements."</quote> It was gnome-based, 
only 2 tier as of time of writing, and <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">looks 
like a much less flexible system but has some good stuff in it :)</quote>. 
Sacha noted that writing business applications 
<quote who="Sacha Schlegel">needs lots of thinking. Business logic is 
difficult, different countries, taxes, systems, different accounting ... 
a lot is different and we the ideal of having a lot generic makes the 
task even more difficult.</quote> He noted that Fisterra was 
<quote who="Sacha Schlegel">from a glass replacement company. They might 
have a clear requirement. We want point of sale with this, this, this 
available then you can go off and do it. But without clear requirements 
and the ideal to have everything generic its much harder.</quote></p>
