<p>Jason Cater (jcater) said some remarks to Derek Neighbors: 
<quote who="Jason Cater">1. In .gsd files, why name primary keys? Why not 
let the schema scripter do it? 2. What on earth are "account"s under 
contact/schema? Organization/companies? 3. For the contact_&lt;phone|addr|url&gt; 
tables, are the contact_id + &lt;phone|addr|url&gt;_type_id fields unique? 
I assume it is unique, but am not 100% sure. (I.e., if you have "Home 
Phone" as a phone_type, can a contact have multiple "Home Phone" entries, 
without defining "Home Phone #1", "Home Phone #2", ... phone_types?)</quote>. 
He didn't like contact management in gnue-sb, but promised to 
<quote who="Jason Cater">try my damnest to make it work for me</quote>. 
Jason was also trying to <quote who="Jason Cater">decide what to do about a 
financials package</quote>. He was trying to force himself to use 
nola/arias/acclite, and had converted their schema to .gsd files. 
Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) asked whether the arias guys had restructured it as 
they were going to and Jason had to admit - <quote who="Jason Cater">it's 
hosted on SourceForge and they've taken anon cvs down. So I can't work 
against their tree or see what they've done. Very frustrating.</quote></p> 

<p>Jason said he would probably use arias, despite his preference not to 
<quote who="Jason Cater">use a web-based accounting package - until gnue-sb 
is ready</quote>. If this was going to take some time, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I'd rather use SQL-Ledger and write conversion 
scripts later on</quote> - he also needed payroll functionality as well 
now - <quote who="Jason Cater">I may outsource that though</quote>.</p>
