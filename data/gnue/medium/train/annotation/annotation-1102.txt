<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Vinay Pawar (zoyd) said he had been <quote who="Vinay Pawar">toying 
with the semantic web. it's a concept that suggests the use of standardised 
markup formats for use in apps. more on the line of web services.</quote> 
<quote who="Vinay Pawar">the idea is simply to use RDF/XML, which will 
help to rope together apps.</quote> He thought that GNUe Common, with its 
XML parser and RPC (remote procedure call) functionality, could be used to 
help with this.  He felt that <quote who="Vinay Pawar">if all GNUe 
Packages could use HTTP(REST'ically) as it's underlying app. protocol, 
their design could be significantly simplified.</quote> Andrew Mitchell 
(ajmitch) did not <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">see how it would 
help</quote>. Vinay said that <quote who="Vinay Pawar">the current arch. 
seems to be inclined towards RPC/SOAP</quote> which 
<quote who="Vinay Pawar">SOAP complicates matters w/o any sufficient 
advantage.</quote> Andrew noted that GNUe applications were mainly written 
in two-tier (Forms/Reports talks to database) rather than three-tier 
(Forms/Reports talks to App Server talks to database), and he was not 
aware that even App Server was using SOAP yet. Any references to "GEAS", 
the predecessor to the current Application Server, were probably out of 
date.</p>
