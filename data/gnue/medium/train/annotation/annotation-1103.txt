<topic>Small Business</topic>

<p>Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) had been thinking more about assemblies, where 
multiple inventory items could be combined to form one saleable product. 
Chan Min Wai (dcmwai) noted that <quote who="Chan Min Wai">assemblies

<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnue-sb/features/">expecpected 
features</a> of gnue-sb</quote> - he had not <quote who="Mike Vincent">had
