<topic>Forms</topic>

<mention>Jason Pattie</mention>

<p>Jason Pattie (pattieja) was having problems with the Python 
dependancy for GNUe Forms. James Thompson (jamest) said that GNUe 
Forms needed a specific version of Python. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) 
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we created an 'ugly' but good 
dependency in moving to pyhton &gt; 2.0</quote>. If you already had 
python 1.x, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">then when installing things 
invariably they go in wrong places :) - i solved this on red hat by 
just instalilng everything from source</quote> using the 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">actual tarballs - though you SHOULDNT 
have to do that</quote>. There was some general discussion about the 
relative merits of Red Hat rpm and Debian apt-get. James said he had 
<quote who="James Thompson">installed as may python requirements as 
binary - then the last few things missing as source</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.17Dec2001">
Four days later</a>, Phil Cole (fil_c) asked <quote who="Phil Cole">Could 
Python2 use Python-1.5 PyXML libs?</quote>
James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">you 
could copy the precompiled files but you'll get lots of 
warnings about differences in the API IIRC</quote>
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) suggested 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i would grab pyxml tar from sourceforge</quote>, 
as Red Hat RPMs for python were not very stable at the 
time of writing, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">as python is in a state 
of moving from 1.5.2 to 2.x as official</quote> release within Red Hat - 
there had been similar issues with Debian the previous month. Phil went 
<quote who="Phil Cole">off to sourceforge</quote>. 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i 
REALLY apologize for the inconvience, i know it 'pisses me off' when 
stuff has dependencies or is a pain to install - we made the choice to 
go python 2.x because it brought us some much desired functionality and
we dont expect gnue to ship with any distros until 1.5.2 has been moved
and 2.x replaces in the distro's anyhow - 'unfortunately' it means a 
little rougher first time experience in the interim :(</quote>
He normally did the RedHat testing, but had actually upgraded 
python to 2.x by using source code. He felt often RedHat rpms 
tended to ask for unecessary upgrades - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">they 
'try' to understand 'dependencies' but what they 
really mean are what was on the 'authors' machine</quote>.
He said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">believe me the long term of GNUe 
is that no one has to fight like this to install things :)
- the windows installer is a good example of this
- i think my 3 year old might be able to handle the windows 
install</quote>. He said that the setup.py file 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">bitches hey python 2.x isnt installed</quote>, 
but could be made more sophisticated and check other possible python problems. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">the 
whole thing needs reworking and I've started some stuff wrt that</quote></p>
