<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said free software did not have to be 
non-commercial - <quote who="Daniel Baumann">I think some ppl plan on 
selling GNUe solutions </quote>. Peter Sullivan (psu) said GNUe's 
motto could be <quote who="Peter Sullivan">we don't sell software, we 
sell solutions</quote> but felt that <quote who="Peter Sullivan">sounds 
awfully like a prop ERP vendor's tagline - except that a GNUe 
consultant actually means it...</quote> Ulrich Ech (jack-e) said 
<quote who="Ulrich Ech">i like the idea to share work on the basics 
(gnue for example) but i cannot see any way to keep on my business if 
i cannot sell an app that is build on these basics ..</quote> 
Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) said <quote who="Charles Rouzer">I believe 
any/every company has a right to charge for their work for 
compensation (people gots ta eat), but greatly appreciate those 
companies that "free" their software after reasonable 
compensation.</quote> He added <quote who="Charles Rouzer"> I 
believe you will find higher profits focusing on services versus a 
packaged product - software is and should be a commodity</quote>
James Thompson (jamest) said the way he worked was that 
<quote who="James Thompson">they get a cut rate as long as anything I 
do for them goes back to gnue [...] so lots of work I do in forms 
that's generic doesn't cost them a dime - however screens created in 
forms that they use they are charged for</quote>.</p>

<p>Ulrich explained he was planning to use GNUe for an Account 
Management package, and asked <quote who="Ulrich Ech">can i sell this 
app (giving sources to my customers .. python won't let me another 
choice) to a number of companies ????</quote> He was willing to 
contribute back things that could be usefully generically
like <quote who="Ulrich Ech">the sapdb-driver</quote> and enhancements 
to GNUe Common. Jason Cater (jcater) said, based on how Ulrich had 
described it, <quote who="Jason Cater">AFAIK, all that is within the 
bounds of GPL wrt GNUe</quote> but pointed out that GNUe was looking 
at Account Management too - <quote who="Jason Cater">I'm not saying 
"Don't do it"... I'm just making sure you are aware that we 
will do similar stuff</quote></p>

<p>James said <quote who="James Thompson">i see no problem with you 
making "closed" .gfd and .gcd files</quote> - people could 
even <quote who="James Thompson">modify our parsers to only accept 
digitally encrypted/signed gfd files and donate that code back [...] 
then you could distribute encrypted/closed gfd's that your customer 
couldn't read via normal means</quote>. Charles clarified 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">any modification of source code must 
follow GPL, applications written using GNUe Designer (.gfd, .gcd) can 
have their own license and be commercial/proprietary if you 
want</quote>.</p>
