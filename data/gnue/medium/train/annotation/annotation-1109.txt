<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>James Thompson (jamest) confirmed that <quote who="James Thompson">the 
UI rewrite is underway</quote> for GNUe Forms. However, he was 
trying to keep it simple - <quote who="James Thompson">I really don't 
want to see a widgetfest in forms</quote>. He said 
<quote who="James Thompson">one of my major complaints about widget 
sets is that 20% of what they give you can do 80% of your needs</quote>. 
The rest just increased complexity and encouraged designers to play. 
So he wanted <quote who="James Thompson">to keep the forms UI lean and 
very focused on making data aware apps very very easy to write</quote>.
Ulrich Ech (jack-e) suggested <quote who="Ulrich Ech">but perhaps one 
could write forms it in a way that the it is easy to include into more 
"advanced" applications than just data-in/output ...</quote>. 
James said he wouldn't object to this, 
<quote who="James Thompson">I'm just saying that we'll (hopefully) 
keep the focus on making the basic business tasks (writing interfaces 
to get data into the system) very very easy and the other stuff may 
make you work a bit harder</quote>. Even as of writing, 
<quote who="James Thompson">you can make a forms trigger do anything 
python can do</quote>. Another benefit of <quote who="James Thompson">keeping 
the UI simple - the same file worked seemlessly on text and 
gui platforms</quote> and <quote who="James Thompson">with madlockes 
work with html clients we'll soon (hopefully) have a web interface as 
well</quote>, all using the same forms definitions.</p>
