<p>Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) asked <quote who="Charles Rouzer">does 
anyone have any problems with storing GNUe definition files inside
a database?</quote>. This would help security. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) said he personally wasn't keen. 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think we all agreed that would be an 
'option' - perhaps even the default - but we would never remove the 
ability to have .gfd, .gcd, etc be files</quote>. He felt having them 
as files made remote maintenance via a secure shell much easier 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">when im on the beach in hawaii</quote>.
Charles said he thought in any case <quote who="Charles Rouzer">that 
password encryption of the GEAS user's password inside the geas 
config file should be encryptable [...] thats your first line of 
defense against a box that has been rooted</quote>. Neil Tiffin agreed,
and asked Charles to <quote who="Neil Tiffin"> send some 
code</quote>.</p>
