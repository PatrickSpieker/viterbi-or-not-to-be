<mention>Peter Sullivan</mention>

<p>Stuart Quimby (ToyMan) asked <quote who="Stuart Quimby">anybody here use the 
zope cmf stuff much?</quote> He said <quote who="Stuart Quimby">i 
REALLY need a content mngmnt interface</quote>, but tools like 
<quote who="Stuart Quimby">phpnuke and postnuke and, OpenACS</quote> 
looked <quote who="Stuart Quimby">pretty functional 'out of the box'</quote> 
but not particularly extensible. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">you plan on doing 
ecommerce on this thing too?</quote> He had been looking for an 
e-commerce partner for GNUe, and had looked at zope, which 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">fits the 'python' mold</quote>
but didn't seem to have much substance to it. 
James Thompson (jamest) suggested <quote who="James Thompson">midgard</quote>. 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">they were looking 
at maybe working with us at one time</quote>. GNUe needed a partner
for :</p>

<quote who="Derek Neighbors">
<ol>
<li>portal tool kit (for intranet things)</li>
<li>content management (for internet marketing type stuff)</li>
<li>ecommerce store front (extension of 2 for products)</li>
</ol>
</quote>

<p>Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">I'd 
say content management is 70% workflow and workflow is important 
to us so it might be a natural extension</quote>. Derek clarified that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i dont necessarily see GNUe writing this 
stuff from scratch but rather picking 'good partners' just like 
SAP/Peoplesoft/Baan etc do ;)</quote> He admitted that he hadn't 
looked at Zope for a while, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">so 
maybe its grown a lot</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">zope 
supports practically every db now</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said he wanted GNUe to be able to have 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">a 'home' page feature</quote> 
with <quote who="Derek Neighbors">executive 'summaries</quote>. However, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">it would be 'highly' customizable
so you could do 'purdy' charts and graphs etc in addition to just 
plain numbers</quote>. 
<editorialize who="Peter Sullivan">I've seen this sort of 
functionality referred to as 'Balanced Scorecard'.</editorialize>
Stuart said he had worked on systems that had something like this 
in the 1980s. Derek said he preferred webware for GNUe's web 
interface <quote who="Derek Neighbors">but zope is worth lookign at 
and supporting</quote>. However, he wasn't sure 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if they are GPL compatiable</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.17Dec2001">
Two days later</a>, James confessed that <quote who="James Thompson">zope 
rocks my socks - it's come a long way since I lasted looked at it</quote>. 
However, it wasn't a potential replacement for GNUe Application
Server, just <quote who="James Thompson">a pretty powerfull web site 
builder</quote> Bill Gribble (grib) flame-baited that 
<quote who="Bill Gribble">zope is cool despite the fact of its 
python-ness</quote>, but Derek pointed out that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">python-ness == good thing (tm)</quote> 
on this channel.</p>

<p>Later, Stuart said <quote who="Stuart Quimby">i've been looking at the zope cmf stuff - 
fairly nice stuff for 0 $$</quote>. James said <quote who="James Thompson">i 
haven't played with the cmf stuff yet but the core zope seems realy nice</quote>, 
although he didn't think much of the documentation. Stuart said 
<quote who="Stuart Quimby">zope book helps - and zope developers guide is kept 
up to date now.</quote></p>

<p>Bill said <quote who="Bill Gribble">I just wish it played a little nicer with 
php.</quote>. Stuart said <quote who="Stuart Quimby">there's almost always a way to do it... 
you just have to know how ;)</quote> Derek said there probably wasn't enough demand 
at the moment for a conversion tool - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">you will see it 
the first time someone needs to convert a large site and does so in an automated 
fashion and then relesaes the code for others</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said he had <quote who="Derek Neighbors">a theory that php can create apps to 
a certain celiing but then became unmaintainable</quote>, although 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">that ceiling is fairly hihg (read not many people will 
hit it)</quote> Stuart noted <quote who="Stuart Quimby">i'm doing my new site in zope, 
because it's going to get very large, very quick and I need to admin that</quote>.
Derek said the benefit of <quote who="Derek Neighbors">zope's approach is regardless 
of size it tries to do things that ENFORCE maintainability</quote>. He added
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think it is like the python vs C argument in some 
ways</quote> - you could write good code in C if you were disciplined, but python tended 
to <strong>enforce</strong> good coding habits. This was partly why GNUe developers 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">were preferring python more and more</quote>.</p>
