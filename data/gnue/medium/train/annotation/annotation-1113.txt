<topic>Inventory</topic>

<p>Bill Gribble (grib) asked <quote who="Bill Gribble">any of you gnue 
folks used the current tools to do inventory/asset lifetime 
management?</quote>. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) 
said these were two different things - asset management 
was more to do with capital assets, as <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
opposed to 'on hand' type inventory used in production 
or for sale</quote>. Bill said <quote who="Bill Gribble">
just looking for info to file away.  I'm working on 
a asset lifetime tracker (using some of our tools) for a client and 
wondering if gnue had some insight to offer</quote>
Derek said there was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
some inventory info</quote> on the 
<a href="http://gnuenterprise.org/~neilt/packages/supply-chain/package-doc/SupplyChain/inventory.html">
website</a>, as was information about 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">the 
<a href="http://gnuenterprise.org/~neilt/packages/supply-chain/package-doc/SupplyChain/equipment.html">
capital management</a> (or assest stuff)</quote>. 
He added <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
financials are coming slowly, we havent really 
focused on them - 
still playing a lot with the tools - 
it looks like our 'manufacturing' stuff and 'wholesale 
distribution' stuff will be the first to come
as there are people asking for them</quote>.</p>
