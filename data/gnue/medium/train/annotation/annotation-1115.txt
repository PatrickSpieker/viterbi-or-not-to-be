<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) reported back on the 
problems compiling GNUe Application Server. 
He said the <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">easiest way to get around this is 
to configure (autogen.sh) with --disable-python-methods.
Other way is to set the environment variable LDFLAGS to the 
directory of libpython2.1.a while configuring (autogen.shing)</quote>.
The python check macro had been <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">
stolen from some other project IIRC</quote> but wasn't ideal. 
If it could be improved, <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">
we can contribute it to automake IMHO</quote></p>
