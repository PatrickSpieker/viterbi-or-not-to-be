<topic>Financials (Accounting)</topic>

<p>Phil Cole (fil_c) said <quote who="Phil Cole">One of the major areas that causes 
issues in ERP vendors software seems to be reconciling invoices received 
against purchase receipts made</quote>. This was because 
<quote who="Phil Cole">there are partial receipts, partial invoices and differing 
financial periods.</quote> He explained <quote who="Phil Cole">In our system 
when a purchase receipt is made a financial posting is made an accural 
account... then when the invoice is recieved posted into a received invoices 
account</quote>. Stuart Quimby(ToyMan) said <quote who="Stuart Quimby">matching to the PO 
shoud be straight ahead if you use PO #'s</quote>. Phil added 
<quote who="Phil Cole">... then the invoices need to be matched to the purchase 
receipts... and the purchase receipt account matched against the registered 
invoices account...  .. this is where we have problems.</quote>.
Stuart said this was <quote who="Stuart Quimby">one of the messier aspects of things, 
no matter what sf you use... but good software makes it better</quote>.
Phil said <quote who="Phil Cole">... we should be able to reconcile recieved 
invoices account ledger account balance by looking through the logistical postings..
 .. and this hasn't been working for us</quote>. He explained 
<quote who="Phil Cole">we use a single supplier creditor account and a single 
recieved invoices account which <strong>shouldn't</strong> be an issue</quote>.
Stuart agreed - <quote who="Stuart Quimby">you'd only have to have more if you needed 
to break it out</quote> - for instance, to split <quote who="Stuart Quimby">office 
supplies from raw materials</quote>. Phil said <quote who="Phil Cole">we would 
probably do that via statistics codes on the items purchased</quote>
or by posting to different General Ledger account codes based 
<quote who="Phil Cole">on something in that purchase receipt (e.g. item code of 
purchased item)</quote>.</p>
