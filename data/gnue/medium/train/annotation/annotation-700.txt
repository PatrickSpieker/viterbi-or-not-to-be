<p>Andrew Markley (AnDarkon) asked whether<quote who="Andrew Markley">
for the class currency, the default_decimals is set to whatever the 
company wants it to be and in the event of a change in management 
and/or accounting procedures they want to change the decimal position
</quote>? Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) said this was fixed - 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">the default_decimals is specific for 
the currency not to the management - like us dollar will always have 
2</quote>, whereas Egyptian currency values were always stored to 
three decimal places. He added that <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">
the precision of the values can differ from default_decimals for 
certain cases</quote>, such as reporting.</p>
