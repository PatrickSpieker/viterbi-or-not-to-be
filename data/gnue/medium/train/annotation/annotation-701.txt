<topic>Application Server</topic>
<topic>Reports</topic>
<topic>Forms</topic>
<topic>Designer</topic>


<p>Kenny Flegal (soulstompp) said he had downloaded and 
installed GNUe and wanted <quote who="Kenny Flegal">
to start toying with the forms portion to see if I can use this for 
some practice management software I am working on</quote>. Derek
Neighbors (derek) clarified <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
i am going to assume 'practice management' == some sort of 
doctor/lawyer ERP?</quote>. Kenny confirmed 
<quote who="Kenny Flegal">yeah we have an interested cardiologist and 
dentist</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
GNUe is several things but its core things are :
a. a framework for rapid business application development
b. a prebuilt system using the framework that is highly extensible
</quote>. The framework could be either client/server (2-tier) or 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">multi tier (application server)</quote>.</p>

<p>He said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the biggest issue we face is 
that we have only build 'custom' solutions</quote> so there were no 
working applications available under the GNU Public License yet. 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we do have a lot of supply chain and some
accounting with specificaitions (read business requirements) - HOWEVER
those specs were built with our application server in mind</quote>.
However, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the upside to this is we want 
gnue success stories - and we want them bad - which means im sure you 
would get more than one of us to help you on practice management 
software IF you were willing to give them back to gnue for others 
to enjoy</quote>. Kenny said <quote who="Kenny Flegal">
this is a new business and all of us are in agreement that GNU is the 
way to go - so I would happily contribute everything back to the 
community - that is good</quote>. 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think that if they have 
NOTHING at all currently other than paper you could give them USEFUL 
applications by weeks end - when i say USEFUL, it might not have all 
bells and whistles but they will be capturing some stuff in a real 
database so when more features come on line they can easily start 
absorbing them</quote>.</p>

<p>Kenny asked about reporting. Derek said that, in the interim,
you could just use a non-free reporting tool like Crystal Reports to 
access the data directly from the SQL database. However, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">our report server i think kicks MAJOR ass
- but its not production ready yet. It generates all XML output for 
maximum flexibility - and it works liek a SERVER i.e. i can run in 
server mode so that you can 'cache' reports like monthly financials 
and things</quote>. Also, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
one VERY useful thing it does is document merges :) which is VERY 
important for practice management as they have to write lots of 
patient and insurance 'letters' or 'form' letters</quote>. This meant
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">you can use ms office, star office, abiword 
etc to make document and run it against server to poplulate 
it</quote>.</p>

<p>James Thompson (jamest) then spent some time walking Kenny
<quote who="James Thompson">thru building a ui so you can see how 
easy it is :)</quote> using GNUe Forms.</p>

<p>Later, Kenny thanked <quote who="Kenny Flegal">jamest 
and derek for all of your help - I have a GPL fistfight I gotta 
finish with the founders :) - I am glad to see that this project has 
a community that is so helpful - it is going a long way in my 
argument - well that and that the product is so cool</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.11Feb2002">
The next day</a>, Kenny had some initial problems getting GNUe to talk 
to his database, which Derek and James helped with. 
He confirmed <quote who="Kenny Flegal">I got connected and I am playing 
with the wizard</quote> in Designer. He said <quote who="Kenny Flegal">
I went through the wizard and got the form set up and I added a button
</quote>. James said that, for simple forms, 
<quote who="James Thompson">you don't need buttons on a form for 
anything - you get queries and commits for free - via the menu, toolbar,
or keyboard shortcuts</quote>. Kenny was impressed, but reported 
<quote who="Kenny Flegal">I am getting a segmentation fault everytime 
that I try to delete this button off of my form</quote>. James said
that was a known bug. Kenny said he had <quote who="Kenny Flegal">
deleted it from the XML doc</quote> manually. James said 
<quote who="James Thompson">at this point in time i find myself doing 
1/2 in designer 1/2 in vi|emacs - a month ago I was doing 1/4 designer
so were getting there :)</quote>. Derek claimed his ratio was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">3/4 1/4 - the trick is dont make mistakes
</quote>.</p>
 
<p>Kenny asked whether he should <quote who="Kenny Flegal">
do the database in an OODB or relational design</quote>. Derek 
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">um use what works for you - 
relational will be easier for two tier - when we get geas (appserver) 
up to speed we will probably make a 'conversion' tool so you write 
your objects in geas and map your relational tables to them or 
somethng similar</quote>. James said <quote who="James Thompson">
i do relational - the form can do master/detail but designer can't 
auto set it up - what I do is make forms for each table, put the 
blocks together and hand modify the datasource entries</quote>. 
Kenny said he would play with Designer more later, and 
<quote who="Kenny Flegal">give you some feedback tommorow - hopefully 
it will be useful</quote></p>
