<topic>Common</topic>


<p>Derek Neighbors suggested a cure for boisterous children - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we could use an ADO driver for 
common - m$ says they require a 'first' born</quote>. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) suggested <quote who="Daniel Baumann">
we'll use yours then - you have children to spare - /me 
only has one</quote>. Derek suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
we need find someone with a kid so bad that m$ will give 
them back :)</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) suggested 
<quote who="James Thompson">heck, chillywilly how old are you?  
think you could pass as a kid ? if so then it'd be like a trojan 
horse</quote>. Daniel replied <quote who="Daniel Baumann">
but I would die inside if I worked for the beast - 
chillywilly would be no more</quote>.</p>
