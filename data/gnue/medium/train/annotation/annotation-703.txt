<topic>Common</topic>


<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) reported that GNUe Common 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">appears to be IGNORING port</quote> in 
the connections.conf file when accessing pypgsql. James Thompson 
(jamest) said that the port parameter was not documented. Jason Cater 
(jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">I thought port= was documented
</quote>, and asked when Derek had last updated from CVS. James noted 
that the connect string code supported <quote who="James Thompson">
'host=%s dbname=%s user=%s password=%s'</quote> only. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">we need to modify connections.txt to say 
"look in README.databases" to see all supported parameters
as each database driver supports different parameters - most either 
support the (host, port) pair or (service) string</quote>. Everyone 
was sure this had been discussed before, but no-one could find a 
record of it. James suggested <quote who="James Thompson">you might be 
able to do host=foo.bar.com:port</quote> as a workaround in the 
meantime.</p>
