<p>Andrew Markley (AnDarkon) asked <quote who="Andrew Markley">
how was the decision to use python made? I made the same decision 
before I found GNU enterprise. I'm curious about the thinking 
process that came to that point :-)</quote>. James Thompson 
(jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">i'd used tcl in the past 
and wasn't happy with it - lots of people on the list either already 
liked python or didn't object to it</quote>. Andrew said he had
been <quote who="Andrew Markley">deliberating between Python and Java. 
I had already concluded that perl, while being very veristale (sp), 
would get too spaghettiy in large projects - what cinched is was 
Jython heh; the fact that I could run Python code on top of java 
machines cinched Python as the winner</quote>. James said he 
<quote who="James Thompson">dislikes java with a passion</quote>. 
He said <quote who="James Thompson">a major problem with java is the 
inconsistancies in the java VM</quote>, meaning you often had to use 
specific versions of browsers for specific applications. Sometimes 
you ended up <quote who="James Thompson">redoing the systems to run 
java on the web server</quote> using jsp <quote who="James Thompson">
which makes the whole cross platform benefit of java kinda moot
</quote>. However, he hadn't used Java recently. He concluded 
<quote who="James Thompson">I used to be able to get GCC to run on far 
more platforms that a JVM - which I always found somewhat amusing :)
</quote>. Andrew said <quote who="Andrew Markley">I haven't 
encountered a system yet that didn't have gcc</quote>.</p>
