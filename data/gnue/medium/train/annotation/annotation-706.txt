<p>Andrew Markley (AnDarkon) asked why everyone seemed so impressed 
that he was an 'Andrew M.' Peter Sullivan (psu) explained 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">Andrew Murie did the original code for 
GEAS - which reinhard &amp; neilt are now re-hacking</quote>. Andrew 
asked <quote who="Andrew Markley">am I to infer that the original 
GEAS is somewhat a hairball?</quote>. Peter said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">I think it would be fairer to say that it 
was written by/for a company for its own purposes and then contibuted 
back to the community and thus did what they wanted rather better
than what the project wanted/needed - plus everyone's ideas about what 
an App Server should be has evoleved somewhat</quote> since then. 
Reinard M&#252;ller (reinhard) reminisced that <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">
his boss (who also was here very often was also named andrew</quote>.
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
at one time there were 3 andrews on this project all from new zealand
within like 150km of one another</quote>. He said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">the joke was - to live in new zealand 
must you have andr in your name?</quote> Reinhard said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">some days we entered irc and said 
something like "hi andr*" :)</quote>.</p>
