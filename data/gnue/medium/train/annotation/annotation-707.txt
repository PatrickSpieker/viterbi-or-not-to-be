<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
next phase will get serious and i think will do press release on the 
usage for a site i do work for, they are a recruitment firm - they have 
online candidate/employer databases</quote>, which was web-based.
However, he didn't want to use web-based forms for administrative tasks,
so <quote who="Derek Neighbors">in about 30 minutes i wrote two nice 
forms to do the management - and i am pleased as punch - getting ready 
to add new billing features that i hope to NOT make any web screens for.
i also hope to give them some READONLY forms for 'searching' - currently
i have some pretty kick arse web search forms but i dont like them 
cause they are web based :) i hope to get mail merge wizards for them 
and other things - all in all its a start</quote>.</p>
