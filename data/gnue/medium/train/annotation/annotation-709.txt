<p>James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">
i need forms to do dynamic menus - now</quote>. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) suggested using GNUe Process 
Definition (.gpd) files <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
and integrate them into the menu structure - 
that woudl be my vote. Or do you mean REALLY dynamic menus - 
like triggers editing them</quote>? James said yes. 
Derek replied <quote who="Derek Neighbors">well i still 
vote read gpd into menu structure then allow for its manipulation
</quote>. James said he was up against a deadline, and gave a 
list of parameters for his new GMenu object. This would allow  
the GNUe Forms parser to read &lt;menu&gt; tags, nesting them if 
required. However, he wasn't sure if this was a good 
idea, <quote who="James Thompson">as I'm allowing gfd people to 
override menus</quote>.</p>

<p>He explained <quote who="James Thompson">
the entire menu structure for forms will be in a file in gnue/etc
so you can do site customizations to the menu</quote>. 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
i thought that is a large part of what .gpd was</quote>.
James said that gpds were more for process-based menu 
entries - a custom menu entry like a modified  
<quote who="James Thompson">file - save isn't a biz 
process</quote>. Derek suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
if i want it in the framework (on EVERY form) it shoudl go 
in gnue/etc - if i want it on only SOME forms it should be 
in a gpd</quote>. James added that <quote who="James Thompson">
a single entry in gnue/etc/forms-menu</quote> would 
determine whether the gpd file was used in the menu system 
or not.</p>

<p>James noted that, in some cases, he might need to 
replace standard menu options with bespoke ones - 
<quote who="James Thompson">this doesn't really lend 
itself to a nested &lt;menu&gt; structure</quote>, as 
he would have to re-create all the existing menu structure
in the gpd file. Instead, he was wondering about allowing 
developers to specify a location within the existing 
menu structure to attatch a new menu item to. Derek 
disagreed, saying <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
i dont think menu structures belong in forms</quote> - he 
still preferred doing this in the gpd file. 
James said <quote who="James Thompson">it's like a custom 
menu for an app</quote>, whereas <quote who="James Thompson">
gpd is the basis of workflow</quote>. Derek said that was 
part of it, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">but its made to do 
what you are saying - it can call outside apps, reports, 
other forms etc etc</quote>. James said all he wanted to do 
was <quote who="James Thompson">to call custom triggers 
defined in this one form</quote>. Derek said that James' 
proposal was tantermount to <quote who="James Thompson">
lets throw gpd away</quote>, as this was always the sort of 
thing it was intended for. He suggested talking to Jason 
Cater.</p>

<p>Later, James clarified <quote who="James Thompson">
i'm making a menu system that can be dynamically defined and 
exposable to triggers that any gnue app could use</quote>.
Derek agreed, but said that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
most of the time you arent going to want to define things 
dynamically 100% - that is where you use gpd</quote>. He
added <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i hate irc - i think face 
to face adn white board would have this solved in minutes
</quote>. James looked for <quote who="James Thompson">
docs on gpd's</quote> but couldn't find them. He thought he 
<quote who="James Thompson">may just hack a custom gfclient 
w/ extra menu entires</quote> to meet his immediate deadline
<quote who="James Thompson">as this is turning into something 
well beyond anything I can do in the time alloted</quote>.</p>
