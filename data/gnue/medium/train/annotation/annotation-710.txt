<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>


<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
i think we see an IT trend - shops are sick of paying high dollar 
levies to be treated like crap - so the higher the price tag and 
more shit you are treated more likely you are to come in search 
of FS</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">
well, it's no secret that IT budgets have been slashed, yet the 
technological needs have not shrunken at all</quote>. He said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">it trips me out the consultants who we 
bring in who think the products they supply should be supplied 
at a cost relative to the about of money we save over the long 
run - instead of how much the product is actually worth</quote>.
Derek thought it might be interesting if, say, toilet paper was
priced that way - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">lets face it you 
would be buying a lot more underwear</quote> without it.</p>

<p>However, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">toilet paper is bad example 
as its really not REUSABLE</quote>. A better example 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">woudl be a tooth brush</quote> - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">as brushing your teeth saves on average 
2 cavities a year - and cavities cost 800 to fill - so 200 for a 
brush that saves you 1600 is an INCREDIBLE deal. Then the 500 for 
the toothpaste contract - thats where the REAL value is - i mean 
for 700 you will have your money back in less than 6 mos - how 
incredible is that?</quote> He noted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
what is funny is anyone reading this would probably die laughing
- but this is common thing in IT industry</quote>. 
Of course, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the vendor just makes sure 
his toothpaste is incompatiable with other vendors brushes
so you are locked into that toothpaste contract - or forced to 
buy a new brush</quote>. Jason said that <quote who="Jason Cater">
their toothbrushes require their own special "holder" - 
custom installed, of course. You can't reuse your existing holders 
("I know the slots are the same size; but ours it calibrated 
especially for our toothbrushes.  Also, who's to say your holder can 
withstand the extra load")</quote>. Derek added 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">yeah crest's holders just dont 'scale' 
well - i mean a family of 5 or 6 and your screwed</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">let's not forget "user 
training"</quote>. <quote who="Derek Neighbors">and floss</quote>,
added Derek, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">thats high performance dental 
care - you pay top dollar for floss</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">one member of the family will need to be 
flown to our "flossing seminar" - BUT it's in Miami this year
</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">for only 4,500 i can 
get crest 'reach' toothbrush certified - with that cert i am like 80% 
less likely to have ginvitis which is a huge value - peridontial disease
 is SO costly</quote>. He noted that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the 
toothbrush vendor regularly is able to sell brush, paste and floss to 
folks with dentures :)</quote>. Jason suggested that maybe 
<quote who="Jason Cater">the vendor has a 20% stake in the Denture 
company - "to spread his risk"</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek thought he should perhaps <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
make a small list of things that are 'cheap' but highly useful - 
then see if they have some 'money saving' value like the toothbrush -
"what if the rest of the world operated like a software 
company..." we ahvent even relaly touched on the 'monoply' 
implications here :) just on the no value ones :)</quote>. 
He said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">people wouldnt buy a 200 dollar 
tooth brush and a 500 toothpaste contract - they will buy millions 
of dollars in software license fees - though i think slowly people are 
stopping the trend - whether it be because of reduced budgets or 
waking up and smelling the coffee</quote>.</p>
