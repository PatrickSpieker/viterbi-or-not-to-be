<p>James Thompson (jamest) asked <quote who="James Thompson">
navigator - how official is it?</quote>. He wanted
<quote who="James Thompson">to make win setup.exe of it
</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said he thought it was very
useful, but <quote who="Jason Cater">wonders if he shouldn't 
add a "tree-style" interface first</quote>. 
James suggested <quote who="James Thompson">
you might be able to rip the event handler (unused) in forms UIwxpython
to possibly grab those events you're missing in UIwxweb</quote>.
He would have to prioritise getting <quote who="James Thompson">
windows support polished up tonight in there</quote> and try to 
work out why the CVS version of Forms was not working on 
Windows. Later, Derek Neighbors (derek) confirmed that he 
regarded Navigator as 'official' even though it needed more 
things adding and hadn't been part of a release yet.</p>
