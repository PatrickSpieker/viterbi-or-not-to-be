<p>Lawrence asked <quote who="Lawrence">Where does gnue need 
the most help? I am looking for a project to get invovled 
in</quote> and would have some spare time soon.</p>

<p>Louis Charbonneau said <quote who="Louis Charbonneau">A year 
ago , I made a proposal for the Financial part of GNUE.
But I had to quit for personnal reasons. Now , I am back to 
this project. I could team up with Lawrence, and start working 
on GL module for example. What do you think ?</quote> 
James Thompson welcomed Louis back, and said 
<quote who="James Thompson">I'd presonally like to see something 
we could implement in both a traditional client/server setup 
(like us old timers use :) and something that we could also 
implement in appserver (the replacement for GEAS).</quote>. 
Derek Neighbors said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">I think this 
is great news.  Louis I loved your original proposal and
writing style.  It will be good to see you hard at work. :)  
We are ramping up some major stuff with regards to 'packages'.  
I would like to coordinate these efforts.  In relation to 
financials.  We have a based built from NOLA web accounting 
called AccLite.  It would be great to have a business 
analyst/accountant give it a good testing and evaluate if its a
good base to start from or if we should start from 
scratch</quote> - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">it looked like 
its structures were somewhat decent and that we could probably 
build rather quickly forms screens to match them and have a 
GNUe Application from that base.  I have oodles of manufacturing 
and CRM type stuff Im working on and Jason has several 
applications that he is working on.  We would like to get these 
into the populous and coordinate efforts on building.</quote> 
He suggested discussing further in IRC, if possible.</p>

<p>Todd Boyle also offered to help - 
<quote who="Todd Boyle">requirements must be observed at several 
levels. Goals and requirements at a business or "enterprise" 
level, and at technical and infrastructure levels.   I would 
like to contribute to definitions of ledgers and their various 
methods, elements of the content such as charts of accounts, etc.
XBRL taxonomy for GLs has not done a bad job of enumerating
most of these things now, let's help them out with an implementation.
An implementation that understands and embraces not just
"mapping the content", but interoperability of GLs.   Let's
build a GL that is compatible and interoperable with *every*
reasonable GL in the world, commercial or otherwise.</quote></p>
