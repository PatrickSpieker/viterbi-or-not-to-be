<topic>Common</topic>

<p>It was asked how to connect GNUe to Oracle 9i. Jason Cater 
said <quote who="Jason Cater">You will need to install 
<a href="http://www.zope.org/Members/matt/dco2/DCOracle2-1.2.tgz">DCOracle2</a>
(a Python Oracle driver) on your</quote> client 
<quote who="Jason Cater">machine in order to access 
Oracle.</quote> <quote who="Jason Cater">Untar this file 
and run "python setup.py".  Be sure your $ORACLE_HOME
variable is properly set.</quote> This assumed that the 
(proprietary) <quote who="Jason Cater">Oracle OCI8 client 
libraries</quote> were already on the client.</p>

On IRC</a>, Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">my question is people looking for 
ERP that love oracle, why not looking at compiere ;)</quote> 
as previously discussed in 
<kcref archive="http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue/2002-May/003102.html" subject="Compiere now #1 on sourceforge" /> 
 - personally, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">even if i had 
oracle i would want gnue :) - but most people dont care about 
doing it right - they just want instant gratification</quote>. 
He explained that Compiere was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">an 
'open source' ERP built on oracle 9i and java - it isnt a 
framework like gnue but its packages are far more 
complete</quote>. However, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">long 
term you are better off with gnue (and we do work with 
oracle)</quote></p>

<p>Jason (jcater) cut and pasted his connections.conf file to 
show how an Oracle connection should be defined for GNUe - 
Oracle used the concept of a "service" rather than a host 
name and database name. The service then had to be defined 
in Oracle's tnsnames.ora file on each client.</p>
