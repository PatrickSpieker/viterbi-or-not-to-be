<p>Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) reported <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">one 
bug remained in event rework - CreateWidget is missing from 
GFEvent.py</quote> now that the event handling code had been 
moved to GNUe Common. (This had been done so that other tools, 
notably Reports, could re-use it.)
James Thompson (jamest) asked for someone 
<quote who="James Thompson">with a working copy of cvs 
gnue-forms</quote> to <quote who="James Thompson">test the 
forms/sample/intro/intro.gfd form - enter a year, click the 
button and tell me if the fortune only blinks on the screen 
for a second or if it stays up - /me is trying to figure out 
if he broke something</quote>. Later, Ariel Cal&#242; (ariel_) 
reported <quote who="Ariel Cal&#242;">fortune stays well and 
alive</quote>. This was with <quote who="Ariel Cal&#242;">today 
download from cvs but may be stup-cvs yesterday</quote> - 
but still worked even when he 
<quote who="Ariel Cal&#242;">rebuilded</quote>.</p>
