<kcref archive="http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue-announce/2002-October/000048.html" subject="[Gnue-announce] Re-packaging of Microsoft Windows setup.exe for GNUe Tools 0.4.0" />, 
Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) asked 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">psu: have you got my e-mail?</quote>
Peter Sullivan (psu) said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">not yet. 
If it's what I think it is, it could easily take an hour to 
download</quote> on dial-up. He said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">well, KeithJagrs will be pleased 
;-)</quote> He explained <quote who="Peter Sullivan">I managed 
to "persuade" btami to do us a Win .exe without the debug 
window as well</quote>. Bajusz explained this was just 
a case of setting <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">console=0 in 
*.conf files</quote> for McMillan, the package GNUe used to 
convert python into stand-alone Microsoft Windows executables.
Keith Jagrs (KeithJagrs) said <quote who="Keith Jagrs">Maybe 
its better to have the debugging console. Specially in this 
early stages of gnue tools. so you can point  out the 
bugs</quote>. Peter said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">I think 
it depends. If, like you, you want to put it in front of 
end-users</quote>, debug probably needed to be off. 
Keith said <quote who="Keith Jagrs">yes. but until now I've 
been just playing with forms or designer.</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.25Oct2002">
The next day</a>, Peter Sullivan (psu) announced
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">for the record, both the 
downloads/current and downloads/releases dirs now have 
both a debug-on.exe and debug-off.exe for Win 32 of the 
Tools 0.4.0a releases - thanks to</quote> Bajusz 
Tam&#225;s (btami) <quote who="Peter Sullivan">for all 
the hard work</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) queried 
the <quote who="Jason Cater">0.4.0a</quote> designation. 
Peter explained <quote who="Peter Sullivan">well, release 
0.4.0, package a - i.e. still based on the 0.4.0 release 
tarball - but with "no wonder jcater hated mcmillan, but 
we finally got it working" packaging</quote>. Jason 
said <quote who="Jason Cater">it's a love/hate 
relationship</quote>...</p>
