<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) noted that the web page for 
Application Server <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">seems to refer 
to old geas</quote>. He suggested <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">a) 
rename the page to appserver.php and b) take the text from 
appserver/README</quote>. Peter Sullivan confirmed 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">the filename is wrong - same for 
/tools/gnurpc.php -&gt; common.php</quote> but he had not realised 
that the text was wrong too. Reinhard also suggested that the 
whitepaper and API documentation for the new Application Server 
should be added to the docs page. <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">IMHO 
it would make sense if</quote> at least 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">the html version was online</quote>. 
HTML, Postscript and PDF versions could all be created using make.</p>

<p>Also, Reinhard <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">would like to see the 
"GNU Enterprise: Module Design Proposal" marked as "obsoleted"</quote>. 
Derek Neighbors (revDeke) thought <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i 
think its still pertinent - it needs updating but i plan to 
revive it very soon as i plan on pumping out a lot of modules - 
and i want something as my template... though i might replace it 
with an open office version</quote>.</p>

<p>Reinhard said that <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">if i can help 
you with the text (for appserver.php) or the docs please tell me. 
not sure if there is a possibility that i could update the docs 
on the web page myself as often as i change them</quote>. 
Peter said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">we should have the web 
site in CVS real soon now</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.26Oct2002">
Two days later</a>, Peter said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">I have now uploaded the whitepaper 
and api docs to the website. Had a bit of trouble, as I couldn't 
find texi2pdf in my woody distro - so in the end I did the pdf 
and ps versions from the html using htmldoc instead. They don't 
look too bad that way</quote>. Later, Reinhard noted that 
texi2pdf was in the 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">tetex-bin</quote> package.</p>
