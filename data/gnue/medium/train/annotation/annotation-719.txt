<mention>Keith</mention>

<p>Keith Jagrs (KeithJagrs) said <quote who="Keith Jagrs">I'd like 
to help in the definition of roadmap. I think it's essential</quote>. 
Peter Sullivan (psu) agreed, but said that the 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">Biggest problem will be that we can't 
realistically put dates on</quote> but <quote who="Peter Sullivan">we 
have cross-dependancies.</quote> For instance, 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">we didn't really want to start on apps 
until we have a prototype app server</quote>. Although this particular 
issue was resolved, further ones would occour as features in the 
packages became dependant on features in the tools.</p>

<p>Keith suggested <quote who="Keith Jagrs">Maybe it is better to put 
efforts on tools first, then in packages</quote>. Peter said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">that's sort of what we've done, I guess - 
the Tools are not pefect, but I think they belie their 0.x.0 or 0.0.x 
version numbers in terms of kick-ass functionality</quote>. 
Keith said <quote who="Keith Jagrs">so in terms of commercial apps, 
what would be some more accurate version numbers for the current 
releases?</quote> Derek Neighbors (revDeke) felt 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if windows is on 2000 forms is at least 
at version 10.0 - compared to other opensource (sic) stuff we are 
probably somewhere between 1.0 and 2.0 - it all depends</quote>. 
However, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">apache, gtk and the likes were 
good about version numbering and so i think 0.4.0 is realistic if you 
use them as a baseline - if you use other projects claiming to be 
version 8.0 and such we are probably similar</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i have been screaming 
roadmap for a bit - its not that simple though</quote>. 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we have multiple things going on 
- so its hard to compile a road map - as things are 
interdependent - so you need to do all roadmaps in a cohesive 
manner</quote>. Keith felt that a <quote who="Keith Jagrs">roadmap 
should be done on concensus. not one persons effort</quote>. 
Derek agreed, but <quote who="Derek Neighbors">thats huge task :)
with lots of players - i suspect someone will have to compile the 
TODOs of the tools and such - and make a draft roadmap and solicit 
feedback - and modify the feedback into the roadmaps, rinse and 
repeat a few times - and there is something go by. The other issue 
is getting a road map might not be too bad for the 'next' release 
but a good roadmap will include 2 to 3 releases out</quote>.</p>

<p>Keith, reprising 
<kcref archive="http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue/2002-October/003300.html" subject="wiki [Was Re: The trick to build PySablot and an updated SuSE-GNUe-HOWTO]" />, 
asked <quote who="Keith Jagrs">what about setting up a 
Wiki?</quote> Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think wiki 
is good for user driven content that needs minimal controls -
but official documentation, guides, roadmaps and such - that need 
tighter review and control are not good for wiki IMHO</quote>. 
Nick Rusnov (nickr) noted <quote who="Nick Rusnov">most wikis 
these days allow you to have at least access control.</quote> 
Peter said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">we already have 10 
channels of communication</quote> such as mailing lists and IRC 
- <quote who="Peter Sullivan">/me would support a wiki if it 
replaced some of those - rather than just became number 
11</quote>.</p>

<p>Keith said <quote who="Keith Jagrs">I favor a webforum for 
instance, instead of a mailing list. (but thats is just my 
opinion)</quote>. Peter said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">we 
tried that for about a year - I was responsible for killing it
as no-one was using it</quote>. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) 
said that was <quote who="Daniel Baumann">not exatly the same 
thing - PHPNuke is like a news site - PHPBB or something 
similar would be a forum</quote>. Peter said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">the real focus of this project 
for good or ill is IRC - mostly for good, IMHO</quote>. 
Daniel agreed - <quote who="Daniel Baumann">we have IRC so 
this is our support system ;)</quote>. Keith felt that 
<quote who="Keith Jagrs">as the user base or contributors grow, 
a forum is better suited than a mailing list</quote>. 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">webforums suck for 
developers - i have no problem people making what works best 
for them - but dont expect developers (those most capable of 
helping) to spread accross 15 different mediums</quote>. 
Nick Rusnov (nickr) felt that <quote who="Nick Rusnov">mailing 
lists are great because they are easy to ignore - it takes no 
effort</quote>. Keith said <quote who="Keith Jagrs">not for 
developers then. but for discussions on features an such.
and roadmaps</quote>. Web forums were 
<quote who="Keith Jagrs">easier to browse than a mailing lists 
archive</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) said 
<quote who="James Thompson">we did forums, long long ago at 
peoples insistance (is that a word? :) - anyway, we set them 
up and they got used exactly ZERO times - kinda ticked me off 
to be honest :)</quote> Peter suggested 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">the best way is to hard-wire our 
brains together in a neural net - then we'd all finally 
understand chillywilly</quote>. James said 
<quote who="James Thompson">no way I want to know what goes 
on in chillywilly's brain man - i barely can keep track of 
the voices in my head let alone his</quote>.</p>
