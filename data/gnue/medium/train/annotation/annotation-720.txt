<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 18 Oct 2002" title="Free Entity Relationship Diagram tools" />, 
Nicholas Lee (esands) asked <quote who="Nicholas Lee">Anyone suggest a 
good data modeller? There doesn't seem to much free stuff</quote>. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) suggested <quote who="Daniel Baumann">dia 
;)</quote>. Nicholas said this <quote who="Nicholas Lee">doesn't generate 
sql though.  I just managed to get 
<a href="http://www.hardgeus.com/projects/pgdesigner/">pgdesigner</a> 
compiled. Simple but looks useful</quote> He had also looked at 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee"><a href="http://www.alzabo.org/">http://www.alzabo.org/</a> 
(perl nightmare to install, needs mason)</quote>. Charles Rouzer 
(Mr_You) wondered <quote who="Charles Rouzer">if you could build that 
into GNUe. maybe one day ;-) maybe GNUe Designer could have "New-&gt;Form" 
and "New-&gt;Schema" or somethin.</quote> Nicholas said 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">I guess someone could - pgdesigner is in 
c++ - Problem is with SQL is that different DBs have different 
requirements</quote>. Charles said <quote who="Charles Rouzer">well, 
I guess it would only be useful for designer. unless you wanted to be 
able to create tables from a Form</quote>. Nicholas was concerned 
about the security implications of this. Charles said 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">well.. to create/edit Forms it requires 
you have some sort of ability to build a database table.. as things 
get complicated a schema designer is a good addition to Form 
building. it would fit right in with Designer. right now I think it 
reads schemas</quote> - <quote who="Charles Rouszer">actually I 
guess it just reads individual tables. I believe the wizard will 
query your datasource (db table) and help build a form</quote>.
Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">I guess in that sense, 
doesn't help you put together then schema though</quote>. 
Charles agreed - <quote who="Charles Rouzer">the schema would mean 
multiple tables.. so now we have another wish list item 
;-)</quote>. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">there's multi-datasource in the works 
already</quote> - he had seen some commits to CVS about this.</p>

Some days later</a>, 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked <quote who="Daniel Baumann">does 
designer do db schemas yet?</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">not well - it still has a ways to 
go</quote>. Nicholas Lee (esands) said 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">supposely with some xsl and dia you can.  
pgdesigner can do the job as well</quote>. Daniel said 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">we have an xml schema format and</quote>
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) <quote who="Daniel Baumann">was working on 
integrating things - it is borrowed from dcl I believe</quote>.</p>
