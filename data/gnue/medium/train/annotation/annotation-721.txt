<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Lawrence (lawrence) reported <quote who="Lawrence">still geting 
a Segmentation fault with gnue-forms - Splash screen comes up; then 
font chooser; then segv - gnue-designer is fine</quote>. 
Jason Cater (jacter) asked <quote who="Jason Cater">can you try 
running with the -s option, and seeing if it still segfaults?</quote>. 
Lawrence confirmed <quote who="Lawrence">looks like -s option did the 
trick!</quote> Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">you probably 
want to modify your gnue.conf file with:<br />
[forms]<br />
disableSplash = 1<br />
- then you won't have to use the -s option all the time</quote>. 
He added <quote who="Jason Cater">we are having some issues 
with timeouts on our splash screen - it rears it's ugly head on 
slower machines. I guess we either need to find a solution, or 
disable the splashscreen by default :(</quote> He explained
<quote who="Jason Cater">the problem is, if the splashscreen 
tries to disappear before the main screen is completely drawn
it segfaults. We can increase the timer more - but that's 
avoiding the problem, not fixing it :)</quote> Lawrence said 
<quote who="Lawrence">slow machine? 1.4 athalon with 
a gig of memory not fast enough?</quote> Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">wow - this is the first time we've seen 
this problem on any thing faster than a 266Mhz</quote>.</p>
