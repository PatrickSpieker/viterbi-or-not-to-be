<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) pasted some code he had added to 
his <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">sitecustomize.py</quote> 
file to avoid having <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">to set 
different encodings</quote>. Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) asked 
if this meant <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">offering final user 
to modify his/her sitecustomize.py to enable GNUe work with 
his/her encoding?</quote> Bajusz said 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">no and yes :) - i imagine that 
setup process puts sitecustomize.py into some right 
place</quote> normally, rather than the user setting it every 
time. Arturas noted that <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">one 
linux guru noticed, that forcing users to modify 
sutecustomize.py is no good for several reasons - the most 
simpliest case would be some other software that needs current 
sitecustomize and it can't work with other sitecustomize and 
GNUe, that can't work with current sitecustomize - it's good 
for us as developers - it's good for some users - but we can't 
enforce this - and we should be able to support encodings as 
well as possible with current sitecustomize.py</quote>. 
Bajusz said <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">maybe we can offer 
this if there isn't any sitecustomize.py</quote> existing 
already. Arturas said <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">[i _think_ 
(i don't know this for sure) that installing python installs 
sitecustomize.py]</quote> automatically. Bajusz said 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">in win32 and python 2.1 2.2 the 
file doesn't exist per default - and i think forcing enduser to 
make this file then write somethong into it</quote> was not very 
user-friendly - <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">plus he have to 
know what is your encoding name</quote>. Arturas said 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">the idea is pretty good</quote>
but at the moment, his priority was getting a 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">working setup-cvs.py for windows 
:) :) :)</quote>, as discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 10 Oct 2002" title="Running CVS version of GNUe on Windows and DOS" /> and previous threads.</p>
