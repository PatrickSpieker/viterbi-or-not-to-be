<p>It was reported that the GNUe Debian packages did not seem 
to work - the error message (a python Tracebabck) was pasted. 
Nick Rusnov (nickr) said <quote who="Nick Rusnov">that indicates 
serious package breakage.</quote> Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) 
asked <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">you have all the dependencies, 
don't you?</quote> but Nick thought it was something more 
serious - <quote who="Nick Rusnov">I don't think that error would 
occur if there were missing dependencies</quote>. Later, the 
solution was uncovered. A previous version of GNUe, installed 
directly rather than using the Debian packages, was already 
on the system - removing this first solved the problem.</p>
