<topic>Forms</topic>
<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Derek Neighbors (revDeke) asked about adding support for 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">the realtime updating of dropdown 
boxes</quote>, as discussed previously in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 04 Jun 2002" title="Look-up combo boxes in Forms" />. 
He explained <quote who="Derek Neighbors">what i have is a case 
of product categories that can have parents - the parents are 
in combo boxes - so if i add a new one - then add a second and 
want what i added as the first to be a parent, i have 
to shut the form down and restart it to get it to show in the 
dropdown</quote>. He would not object if the solution involved
doing <quote who="Derek Neighbors">it via triggers</quote>.
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">I'm adding a 
resetForeignKey, but do note that you are programming for 
specific UI features if using a combo that way</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">I've tried to build a testcase for 
that resetForeignKey() statement, but there are some issues, 
which need to change a bit of code in common</quote> - 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">its the parameter stuff which made 
me changing stuff. i've made a form with two dropdowns. The 
user can choose a state in the first, and should choose a city 
in the next and will get displayed the zipcode in an style=label 
entry. The second dropdown is using a parameter in a condition 
to display just the cities from the state chosen in the first 
dropdown. So I added a setParameter function. But that didn't 
work because of caching parameters values in the cparam class 
and because of the dbsig dbdriver replacing the staticCondidition 
by a preparsed string :( - which is also the reason of passing 
a parameter in the command line is not working at the 
moment.</quote> Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">hmm - 
I had intended on runtime parameters to be read only - /me is 
trying to think through your example</quote>. He said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I guess they don't have to be - 
I suppose we can add a setParameter and get rid of the caching 
code</quote>. Jan said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">other 
possibilities would be to have a 'populateForeignKey' or a 
'add/change staticConditions'</quote>. Jason doubted that 
<quote who="Jason Cater">the caching code speeded things 
up much anyway</quote>.</p> 

<p>Jan pointed to the problem line of code he wanted to change - 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">This will change the GObj tree.</quote>
Jason wondered <quote who="Jason Cater">should we NOT modify the 
GObj tree in _dbsig - but still create the static condition - 
but add an invalidateCachedConditions() method</quote>. He 
explained <quote who="Jason Cater">it recursively changes stuff 
until you are left with a single string - so that it only has to 
do that once</quote> - <quote who="Jason Cater">in the end, 
there's only one node</quote>. This meant that 
<quote who="Jason Cater">there's not a clean solution to</quote> 
adding support for <quote who="Jason Cater">changable runtime 
parameters</quote>.</p>

<p>Jan said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">the other possibility 
would be to change the staticConditions using a trigger.</quote> 
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">so you are thinking we could 
add a setCondition(&lt;GCondition tree&gt;) method to GDataSource?
or something like that</quote>? Jan agreed - 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">its just a bit OVERKILL for just 
changing a parameter - I mean, I would like to have both 
possibilities.</quote> Jason agreed, but 
<quote who="Jason Cater">what you are describing is not</quote>
the <quote who="Jason Cater">typical use of a parameter - 
although I'm not opposed to having a setParameter - 
as long as we don't add much more overhead to 
datasources</quote>. He gave a specific example - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I have one report using GNUe Reports 
right now that's a master/detail report - there's approx 1,800 
records in the master datasource - so that's 1,800 times the 
child datasource is run</quote> - and 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I have much more complex reports to 
do</quote>.</p>

<p>Jan said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">my actual patch to have 
parameter working is just to NOT cache the static part of the 
parameters - If reports is getting too slow we still can add 
caching, and probably in a better way :)</quote> Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">so, the plans are to add a 
DataSource.setCondition() and a Form.setParameter() and remove 
parameter caching? We can see how that works. I may be worried 
about nothing :) - but you do understand my worry about reports, 
right?</quote> Jan said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">I fully 
understand. And I finally know why you add that caching line to 
parameters</quote>.</p>

Some days later</a>, Jason said he was
<quote who="Jason Cater">almost ready for a 0.4.1 release of 
stuff</quote>. Derek asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">did 
we come up with a way to update lu comboboxes? we had 
discussed using triggers or the likes</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">it's not fully tested - but we 
have an Entry.resetForeignKey()</quote>. Derek said he had 
a form he wanted to test it with - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">and if it works for me you 
can probably put in 0.4.1 ;)</quote>. Jason 
asked <quote who="Jason Cater">how does this form work?
as that determines where you'd put it</quote>. Derek said 
the table had <quote who="Derek Neighbors">id, description, 
parent</quote> but some ids were also parents - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">basically the category table is a 
foreign key to its self</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">we can do this - BUT any new "childs" 
will need to be committed to the database before we can get 
the dropdown to update</quote>. Derek agreed - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i was going to put the resetFK
in the postcommit</quote> trigger.</p>

<p>He tried it, and reported <quote who="Derek Neighbors">didnt 
work, BUT didnt get a bunch of errors :)</quote> Looking at 
the debug messages, Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">the 
trigger is working - wx is just not refreshing 
properly</quote> because of <quote who="Jason Cater">the way 
we use it</quote>. However, <quote who="Jason Cater">this is 
good though - you now have the form the way it needs to be - 
it's just we have to get forms</quote> client
<quote who="Jason Cater"> p to par w/the</quote> 
GNUe Forms Definition (.gfd). Derek asked 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">how hard would 
it be to fix the resetkey to update widget</quote>? Jason 
said he could <quote who="Jason Cater">probably do tomorrow
- if I have a sample form to play with</quote>.</p>
