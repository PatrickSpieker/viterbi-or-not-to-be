<topic>Common</topic>
<topic>Navigator</topic>

<p>Lawrence (lawrence) asked <quote who="Lawrence">is there a gnue 
reference database used for demos?</quote> Derek Neighbors (revDeke) 
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">most of the samples have sql create 
scripts to create teh database to run the demos - currently they 
are for postgres BUT i plan (or someone else could) convert them 
to use GNUe Schema Definition - in which case all dbs woudl be 
supported :)</quote> He added <quote who="Derek Neighbors">im 
thinking maybe we make gear files and navigator files - and one 
of the launchers on the navigator runs the actual db create 
scripts?</quote></p>

<p>Later, Lawrence asked <quote who="Lawrence">Does 
any know of a good reference database that would work well with 
gnue? MS uses Northwind</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">we need one - I was thinking about that 
when writing the developer's guidfe - it would make samples much 
easier</quote>. Lawrence asked <quote who="Lawrence">does 
SAP-DB come with one?</quote>. Derek replied 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">yes i believe it does</quote>. 
Lawrence said the scott tiger sample database used by Oracle 
<quote who="Lawrence">is not that complete last time i 
looked</quote>. Jason said that 
<quote who="Jason Cater">scott/tiger is a good start - that's 
one thing I liked about Oracle's books - every one of their 
manuals (and boy did they have a LOT of manuals) all used examples 
based on the scott/tiger db - I'd like to see us do something 
similar</quote>. Lawrence said <quote who="Lawrence">I'll 
work on one - does any one have suggestions</quote>? Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">well, if possible, it shouldn't be 
country-specific - like "zip codes" etc - (that's the example I 
used in the developer's guide, but I need a better one)</quote>. 
Lawrence noted that <quote who="Lawrence">date and times 
are all country specific</quote>.</p>
