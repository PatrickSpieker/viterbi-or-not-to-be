<mention>Lawrence</mention>

<p>Jason Cater (jcater) pointed to the 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/Developers-Guide.pdf">PDF</a>
version of the Developer's Guide - the source was in CVS, but he asked
people not to submit any changes yet as it was a binary file 
(OpenOffice .sxw) and he had uncommitted changes, which CVS would not 
be able to merge properly. Derek Neighbors (revDeke) asked 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">did you get the link i sent about filter 
to always use uncompressed xml</quote> when saving OpenOffice files, 
so that they could be maintained properly in CVS? Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">yeah - I need to look at that</quote> - he 
had not had an opportunity to yet.</p>

<p>Derek dug up an old document on 
<a href="http://gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/release_notes/gnuereleaseprocedures.html">GNUe 
release procedures</a> which he would 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">like to revamp</quote> and 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">make it so we can hand a release 
checkoff to non developers</quote>. Jason suggested a 
revised version involving lots of vodka, setup.py files, rum, 
the mcmillan packager, headache tablets and tequila. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">rofl - no wonder we never release - 
its too expensive :)</quote>.</p>

<p>Jan Ischebeck (siesel) noted that <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">the 
new openoffice developer version should support docbook 
import+export</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">not 
really - they say that - but that's what I'm using - and it 
doesn't have it. I think you need Java 1.4 installed - plus a 
few other things</quote>.</p> 

<p>Jan also asked <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">what 
about the next release? will it be 0.4.1 (i.e. bugfixing) or 
a 0.5.0 ?</quote> Jason suggested 
<quote who="Jason Cater">if I get curses working well in 
short time 0.5.0 - if not, 0.4.1</quote>. Also, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I don't want to go 0.5.0 without a 
good developer's guide finished - well, finished is a bad 
word - usable :)</quote> Jan said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">btw. 
the developers guide is great. finally I know how to add 
timestamps, etc. :)</quote></p>

<p>Derek <quote who="Derek Neighbors">STRONGLY warns all those silly 
people thinking this developers guide is a good thing - that jamest 
and jcater plot to torture users - you see if you make a really great 
user guide and release it - and people find it useful - then when you 
release 0.5.0 and half the implementation is different - it makes for 
great luser torture :)</quote>. Jan agreed - 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">that's the problem with documentation: 
you have to update it. :)</quote></p>

<p>Derek reported some problems with spacing when printing out the 
Developer's Guide from a non-free PDF viewer - all he had 
available at his current location. Jason said there appeared to be 
no problem with <quote who="Jason Cater">acroreader</quote> and 
Lawrence confirmed it was fine with ghostview. However, Jason warned 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I'm having to use ps2pdf (after printing 
to PS within openoffice) - and ps2pdf is known for crappy, crappy 
font handling</quote>. <quote who="Jason Cater">OpenOffice 643 
has an "Export to PDF" menu option - but she segfaults every single 
time I try it - so as soon as OO gets that working - I'm sure it'll 
be irrelevant</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.28Oct2002">
Some days later</a>, Jason said he had put an 
<quote who="Jason Cater">updated developer's guide at 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/Developers-Guide.pdf">
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/Developers-Guide.pdf</a>
(for those reviewing it) - I'm at 598 pages now</quote> 
before correcting this to <quote who="Jason Cater">58 - 
maybe 598 if you try to print the PS to a non-PS printer</quote>. 
Nicholas Lee (esands) said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">damn 598 
pages would be a book.  So who's going to write the GNue book?  
I hear if you are an author with Oreilly you get all their other books 
for free. ;)</quote>. Jason said he <quote who="Jason Cater">expects 
the Developer's Intro to be over 200 pages</quote> by the 
time he had finished - <quote who="Jason Cater">not that 
I'm counting pages or anything :)</quote>. He was especially 
pleased that <quote who="Jason Cater">the entire Appendix B
was created with a python script which reads the stuff in 
GFParser.py</quote> and automatically documented it. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">what format does OO use, just 
it's own thing?</quote> Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">yeah, it's own XML format</quote>.
Daniel asked if <quote who="Daniel Baumann">it lets you save 
as pdf?</quote> Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">no, but 
ps2pdf does :)</quote> The latest version of Open Office
<quote who="Jason Cater">actually has an Export As PDF</quote> 
but <quote who="Jason Cater">it doesn't work - but that 
means they plan to have it on the next stable 
release.</quote></p>

<p>Later, Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">in all seriousness a gnue book 
is in the works not from oreilly - oreilly doesnt match our 
principles - we deal with a real publisher that respects the 
GFDL :)</quote> However, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">until 
its more official we generally dont discuss - i believe our 
very own peter sullivan will be the primary author</quote>.</p>
