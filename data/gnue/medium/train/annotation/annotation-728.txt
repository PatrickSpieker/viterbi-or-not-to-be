<topic>Designer</topic>

<p>Stan Klein reported several issues trying to learn how to use the 
GNUe Tools, including <quote who="Stan Klein">The only way I have been 
able to get Designer to work is using the wizard.</quote> Trying to 
place widgets directly or via the menus did not seem to work. He had 
read both the documentation and parts of the source code to resolve 
some of his problems, but was not much further forward. 
<quote who="Stan Klein">If someone can help me with understanding 
these issues, I will try to find the time to help improve the relevant 
documentation.</quote>.</p>

<p>Robert Jenkins said that Designer <quote who="Robert Jenkins">seems 
to have a lot of capabilities that are not obvious, but also a few 
missing functions (or at least I can't find ways of making some 
things work).</quote> He said <quote who="Robert Jenkins">If you 
click a button on the toolbar, you then need to click &amp; drag on
the form to set the location and size of the widget. 
It seems that you can directly drag widgets about after placement,
either individually or in groups, but not re-size by dragging so far.
Some things such as blocks don't seem to be visible, but exist and have
properties. Others such as dropdowns don't seem to work yet. 
The only way I've found of editing some items is to select 'object
navigator' from the Tools menu, then double-click an item in that to get
it's properties. The object navigator gives a tree view of the complete
form structure with all items on it, &amp; is an excellent 
feature!</quote></p>

<p>Stan tried dragging in both 0.4.0 and CVS versions of GNUe, and 
reported that this <quote who="Stan Klein">worked most of the time in 
both versions.</quote> He had been able to get a dialog box to set 
up a static datasource, <quote who="Stan Klein">but it didn't create 
it properly in the gfd file.</quote> <quote who="Stan Klein">I also 
tried dragging widgets to move them.  I found that the moving was
very inexact</quote> - it was easier to use <quote who="Stan Klein">the 
controls at the bottom of the Designer window.</quote> 
He had also tried the object navigator and 
properties window, but these seemed to be read-only at the moment. 
He noted <quote who="Stan Klein">One other thing I noticed is that 
the Designer dialogues all look similar to the wizard dialogues 
based on the templates.  If this is true, it might provide a means 
for spreading some of the gruntwork in Designer development.</quote></p>

<p>Jason Cater advised that Static datasources were <quote who="Jason Cater">very, 
very new. They work in CVS, but did not work in 0.4.0. The Combo Box 
wizard that was in 0.4.0 incorrectly had that as an option... that was 
an oversight on my part.</quote> <quote who="Jason Cater">Now that static 
datasources are a reality, I need to go back and enable this in the 
wizard, and properly code it to create them.</quote>  
He agreed that the "dragging" of widgets was not ideal - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">This is one of those "I wish wx would do ...." 
situations. This was the best  we could get wx to do up until now and 
we thought it better than nothing.</quote> However, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">the WX team has frozen the 2.3 development 
branch in anticipation of a 2.4 stable release within the next few 
weeks.</quote> GNUe was currently using the 2.2, the last stable 
release. <quote who="Jason Cater">we will give the major distros a little 
time to upgrade their packages, then we will switch to their 2.4 API.  
There are quite a few additions/improvements that will help us 
tremendously.</quote></p>

<p>Jason also explained that the similarity between the Designer 
dialogs and the wizards was <quote who="Jason Cater">not by chance.  
The major change in Designer that bumped it up to 0.4.0 was the move 
to a plug-in architecture.</quote> Even the basic dialogs were now 
implemented as plug-ins. <quote who="Jason Cater">The beauty of this 
system is very little about the internals of Designer is needed to 
write plugins, so practically anyone who understands forms
and basic Python programming can do one.</quote> They could 
even replace existing dialogs/wizards with their own, without 
<quote who="Jason Cater">modifying any of Designer's source 
code.</quote> However, <quote who="Jason Cater">Since this was the 
first release under the new plugin system, we still need quite a few 
important plugins. Notably missing are AddButton, AddCheckbox, 
etc.</quote> Plug-ins were not very well documented yet, 
but <quote who="Jason Cater">There are some technotes in 
designer/doc/technotes/</quote> He concluded 
<quote who="Jason Cater">All in all, the 0.4.0 release of Designer 
was a stepping stone from being a "hack" to being an all-purpose 
design tool for GNUe.  Consider 0.4.0 to be "puberty" for Designer.  
Obviously it has a lot of polishing ahead of it, but I think we 
have the "core" exactly where we need it to move forward.</quote></p>
