<p>Lawrence (lawrence) felt that, in Jason Cater's 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/goats/anothergoat.jpg">goat</a>
cartoon, the <quote who="Lawrence">goat needs a hat, 
holster and gun - his name would be Wyatt Erp, background will 
need $AP, People $oft  tombstones</quote>. Derek Neighbors 
(derek) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i would agree but i 
sadly have respect for sap now :( - such a shame - but doing a 
SAP-DB as GPL and the amount they are putting into the community 
in that area just blows me away</quote>. Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) 
suggested <quote who="Charles Rouzer">I'm sure they would love 
the market share like Apache has.</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">right now i would rather see 
navision, peachtree, quickbooks, greatplains - in the background 
as we will replace them first</quote>. Lawrence felt that SAP's 
decision to place SAP-DB under the GNU General Public License 
(GPL) had <quote who="Lawrence">ulterior motives -- 
consulting</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">no 
doubt they have motives and im not saying i stand behind r/3 or 
mysap - just saying i have some respect for them, which i didnt 
before getting involved with sap-db</quote>. Peter Sullivan 
(psu) said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">in a way, people like SAP 
grokking free s/w is more important than volunteer projects like 
this - as in "more joy in heaven over one sinner repenteth" etc - 
of course, w/o the volunteer projects, free s/w would never have 
even got started</quote>. Derek agreed - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">that is my 'amazement' - 
that they chose the GPL instead of making the SAP Open License - 
some lawyer somewhere at SAP gets it. I am also amazed that they 
have about 10 people full time just answering community questions 
and interfacing with community for SAP-DB and about 100 person 
team total for SAP-DB</quote>.</p>
