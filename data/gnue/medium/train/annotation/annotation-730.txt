<p>Lawrence said <quote who="Lawrence">A general sales tax solution in US 
is a very complicated thing.  Best to have it configurable.</quote> 
Some states allowed taxes to be set <quote who="Lawrence">by what 
every geographic area  suits their ends -- usually by county.</quote> 
He pointed to a link <quote who="Lawrence">to 
<a href="http://www.vertexinc.com/">read more</a> about US taxes</quote>
from a company that provided a software solution, using "geocodes" 
based on US Postal Zip Codes. <quote who="Lawrence">Even though geocodes 
and zipcodes are not an exact mapping of  tax rates to a tribes defined 
taxing area,  tribe elders are happy when you send them tax money. For 
they themselves cannot figure out how to verify that taxes are being 
collected accurately.</quote> Inevitably, some people tried tax 
avoidance by moving <quote who="Lawrence">their postoffice boxes to  
a lesser taxed area.</quote> He warned <quote who="Lawrence">This 
information may be quite dated as I have not looked into this for a 
while.</quote> He also pointed to a very good detailed 
discussion on USENET (in the comp.databases.ms-access newsgroup)
which had been archived on Google Groups.</p>

<p>Stan Klein said <quote who="Stan Klein">There is also the issue of 
what is taxable</quote>, giving several examples from states local to him, 
including <quote who="Stan Klein">A few years ago, Maryland had a one-time 
"sales tax holiday" on clothing and school supplies the month before 
school started.  What is taxable can change any time the Legislature 
meets.</quote>  However, <quote who="Stan Klein">an enterprise does not 
need to collect sales taxes unless there is a legal "nexus" between the 
enterprise and the state.  I think that means the enterprise has to have 
a bricks-and-mortar presence in the state.</quote> There were also 
excise taxes on goods like liquor, and other local taxes on services 
like entertainment and hotels. Local taxes would often not co-incide with 
Zip code boundaries, especially since some municipalities had specific 
purpose taxes (such as business improvement) that only applied to part 
of their area. Enterprises with employees might also have to deal with 
local income tax "piggybacked" onto the state or federal income tax.</p>

<p>Todd Boyle felt that the <quote who="Todd Boyle">automation of sales 
taxes are now held up by at least two fundamental problems.</quote> 
The first was the requirement for <quote who="Todd Boyle">very big
geographical/mapping technology, i.e. expensvie and commercial</quote> 
to map physical location to tax regime. Also, there was not even 
<quote who="Todd Boyle">any standardization of the semantics for
naming or describing a tax or its tax rate, the bases of what is taxable
and the bases and units of measure used for taxation (by the gallon,
by value, etc.)</quote> He felt this complex situation suited only 
<quote who="Todd Boyle">commercial vendors who sell solutions in
this market</quote>. Any attempts by politicians to simplify, automate 
or standardise this was opposed by those who imagined 
<quote who="Todd Boyle">that by blocking funding for the IRS or 
anything associated with automation of transaction systems, they might 
someday reduce the power of the state.  sigh.  Instead all they 
achieve is concentration of power in financial services corporations 
and software companies, and wasting the time of millions of workers 
in the economy...</quote>.</p>

<p>Lawrence said that <quote who="Lawrence">Some enterprises use a 
zipcode for geo classification. Though not accurate -- maybe not even 
legal. But so far it has been considered good enough. As long as the 
taxing jurisdictions get some tax money.  In some cases questioning 
where or not taxes are collected accurately is not technically feasible. 
Consider, a telco like WCom. One of their billing systems runs at 
4,000,000+ sales transactions per second.  A phone call may have a  
"sales tax". Who has the resources to determine  where or 
not the billing system is calculating taxes to the letter?</quote>.</p>

<p>Stan felt that Todd was overstating his case somewhat, but said this 
was <quote who="Stan Klein">an issue that has been around for many 
years but only became important because of the Internet.</quote>
Previously, only <quote who="Stan Klein">small, mail-order companies
that sold niche products by catalog or magazine advertisement</quote> 
had avoided sales tax - larger catalogue firms 
<quote who="Stan Klein">also had brick-and-mortar presence, so they 
collected the sales tax on each order</quote>. But 
<quote who="Stan Klein">The Internet and e-commerce have created what 
is essentially an enormous number of catalog merchants</quote>, 
and this was beginning to have an impact on sales tax revenues for 
states and localities, who had been lobbying Congress about this. 
<quote who="Stan Klein">A few years ago, we discussed this issue in 
the IEEE-USA Committee on Communications and Information Policy.  At 
that time I suggested that it should be possible to create a simplified 
collection of data that could be used by catalog merchants for 
collecting state sales/use taxes.</quote> <quote who="Stan Klein">This 
could reduce the number of variations to perhaps a few hundred, which
is manageable for computing purposes. If a state wanted to participate 
and have its use taxes collected, it would have to modify its sales/use 
tax structure to comply with the standard.</quote> He had been 
<quote who="Stan Klein">told that there was a proposal similar to what 
I had described either being discussed</quote>, but had not 
<quote who="Stan Klein">heard anything about it since</quote>. 
Although <quote who="Stan Klein">Congress would need
to be involved because of the interstate commerce aspects</quote>, 
the onus was ultimately on the states <quote who="Stan Klein">to compromise
out their individual ideosyncrasies to get a usable standard.</quote></p>
