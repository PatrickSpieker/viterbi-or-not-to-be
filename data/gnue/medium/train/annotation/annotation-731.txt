<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 21 Oct 2002" title="New Developer's Guide to Forms" />, 
Stan Klein offered <quote who="Stan Klein">some comments on the draft 
Developers Guide</quote>. He felt that the form tags list needed to 
be up-to-date - it <quote who="Stan Klein">looks to me like they are 
intended to go into Appendix B.</quote> He also felt some general 
SQL linking discussion would help people's understanding of 
master-detail relationships - <quote who="Stan Klein">You did some 
of this in the discussion of conditions, and it helped</quote>.
He would also like some information early in the guide on 
<quote who="Stan Klein">how to configure a button to bring up another 
form</quote> as an alternative to the drop-down. 
<quote who="Stan Klein">Of course, someone could also get there using 
Navigator.  :-)</quote>.</p>
