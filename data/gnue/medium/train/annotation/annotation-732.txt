<p>Stan Klein had looked <quote who="Stan Klein">at the GNUe Security 
Framework proposal that I last updated in May 2001.  I think most of 
the ideas there are still valid, mainly (1) that GNUe can't provide 
any security by itself but needs to use the security capabilities of 
the operating system and database on which it runs, and (2) that 
different enterprises will have different security requirements that 
GNUe will need to be able to accommodate.</quote> He was now going 
to re-work the document and re-release it for further comments.</p>
