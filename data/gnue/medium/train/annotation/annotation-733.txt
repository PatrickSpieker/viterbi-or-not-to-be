<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 22 Oct 2002" title="GNUe Developers meeting in Germany" />, 
Christian Selig (lupo) confirmed that the 
<quote who="Christian Selig">european GNUe devel meeting is 
organized - there will be a separate room, sponsored by 
reinhard - jan and I will bring laptops with us and keep 
everyone on track via IRC</quote>, unless
<quote who="Christian Selig">we have no net access, which I 
doubt). I will try to make some dia drawings when it makes 
sense. Main topic will be appserver design. I think that's 
the piece of GNUe which currently needs the most work.
When I understand appserver, I can try to write a crash-course 
for developers who want to use it, because it was an opaque 
technology to me</quote>.</p>
