<p>Thinking further about some of the issues from 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 21 Oct 2002" title="Javascript forms client" />, 
Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) asked <quote who="Charles Rouzer">does 
trigger code get executed on clients and appserver or 
both?</quote>. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">mostly clients, depends on the form - 
not sure how well appserver does triggers at the moment, would 
have to ask siesel or reinhard</quote>. Charles noted that 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) had said that <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">the 
important trigger/business logic/consitence checking etc. should
be done in appserver, in case of javascript AND python 
clients.</quote> Andrew agreed - <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">so 
that'd be remote triggers in appserver - there might be some stub 
code for calling that within the forms - i am not certain - just 
requires a simple xml-rpc call, i guess.</quote> However, 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">it depends on the forms - most forms 
now have inline python triggers - but hopefully they'll move away 
from that</quote>. Charles said that <quote who="Charles Rouzer">the 
best route for the javascript client will be XMLRPC only</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">that's going to 
be sooo damn much overhead - having remote-only triggers - can you 
imagine the communications between client and server for every 
single keystroke, etc</quote>. Charles said 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">X has high overhead  but people still 
use it ;-)</quote>. Jason said that, where an X server was 
shared among many clients, it was normal to have multiple/back-up
servers to avoid <quote who="Jason Cater">a SINGLE point of 
failure</quote>. Charles asked <quote who="Charles Rouzer">so how 
do you propose high avaibility appserver?  ;-)</quote> Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">why do you assume I'd ever use appserver?
I think it's great people are wanting it and writing it - 
but that doesn't translate into me ever using it</quote>. 
Using an application server simply added another point of failure 
to the system. The same argument could in extremis be applied to 
the database server as well, but database servers added more value 
and there were hardware and software solutions for high-availablity 
of database servers already. He <quote who="Jason Cater">went the 
route of having middleware and my</quote> High Availability (HA) 
<quote who="Jason Cater">went &lt;poop&gt; :)</quote>. 
He was <quote who="Jason Cater">not thrilled about GNUe requiring 
an appserver for all the accounting stuff - not thrilled at all
but that's not my call</quote>. Charles said 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">ahh well you just use triggers for 
business logic?</quote> Jason felt this was part of what triggers 
were for in the first place. Charles said that 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">appserver could provide HA capabilities 
at some point</quote>, but that was not the point - high-availability 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">is expensive and not normally available 
to small biz</quote>, so avoiding Application Server to maintain 
HA was unnecessary. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">for a small 
business, you are adding yet one more layer that can, and at some 
point will, go wrong - /me works for a small biz - it's a statistics 
game - the more layers you add that can go down, the more often you 
go down. In my mind - until you have multiple database servers - 
something like an application server isn't gaining you anyhing
but rather costing you</quote>. He felt that the 
<quote who="Jason Cater">current trend toward middleware</quote> 
was not <quote who="Jason Cater">looking at historical evidence
and case studies. For some, middleware makes sense. But I see more 
times than not these days, "if it's not N-tier, how on earth am I 
supposed to use it" - Enterprises were successfully doing 2-tier 
(and even 1-tier) long before n-tier</quote>.</p>

<p>Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">appserver should only have 
object/business rules in it not "triggers" as in ui events 
imho</quote> - <quote who="Daniel Baumann">triggers for forms is 
not necessarily methods/triggers for the appserver - as I agree 
with jcater you don't want frelling rpc calls for every little ui 
interaction</quote>. <quote who="Daniel Baumann">then again how 
often does a form hit the db? not on every single trigger does 
it? I don't think it works that way...</quote>.</p>
