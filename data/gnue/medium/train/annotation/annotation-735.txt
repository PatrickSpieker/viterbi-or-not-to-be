<topic>DCL</topic>

<p>Jan Ischebeck proposed <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">a seperate 
mailing list for new tickets</quote> in DCL, GNUe's bug and 
task tracking system. This would provide 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">Notification about new tickets for 
NON dcl users</quote>, allow tickets to be 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">browsable/searchable by google ( 
through mailing list archives)</quote> and provide an 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">easy way to link to tickets from the 
web</quote>. Derek was not convinced - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">Anyone that wants to watch tickets 
can email me and I will set them up a DCL account and they can 
put watches on what they like.  SOON, DCL will notify the 
'contact' of a ticket on all work done for their item.
Regardless if they are a DCL user.</quote> Also, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">The tickets should be
readily searchable already with the guest account.</quote> 
The ability to click on a DCL URL in a notification e-mail to 
log in and see the ticket had already been suggested in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 16 Sep 2002" title="Opening referred tickets in DCL" /> 
- it had been added to the CVS version of DCL and would be in 
the next official release. Overall, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">If others think this is a good 
idea we can certainly do it.  I am not sold 100%, but if others 
find it useful, I cant say I think its damaging.</quote> 
Jason Cater was also not sure, although he had assumed people 
were receiving notifications from DCL when tickets were 
closed anyway. He wondered <quote who="Jason Cater">if DCL should 
support native "guest" accounts.</quote> 
<quote who="Jason Cater">Anyone clicking on a direct link into 
a DCL ticket, if they weren't already logged in, would be taken 
to the ticket, but as the "guest" user.</quote> Installtions that 
did not want a guest user could just not set one up.</p>
