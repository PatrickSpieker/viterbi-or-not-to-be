<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>A problem was reporting when trying to build a very simple 
GNUe Form Definition with just two labels - this generated 
an error message 'There are no navigable widgets in this form.  
Unable to display.' Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) said 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">it's a known error IIRC</quote> - 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">try to add some field</quote>. 
The way that the Forms parser currently worked, a form 
required at least one field (as opposed to labels) in order 
to parse. <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">it was ok before, 
but things changed :) i don't know the real reason</quote>.</p>
