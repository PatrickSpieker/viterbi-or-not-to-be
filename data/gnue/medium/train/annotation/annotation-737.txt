<topic>Forms</topic>
<topic>Designer</topic>

<p>Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">does 
anybody knows if gnue-forms runs on python1.5 too? Or why it 
doesn't work anymore.</quote> Jason Cater (jcater)
said <quote who="Jason Cater">it will not - it requires 2.0
- we use 2.0 features such as +=</quote>. Jan said he needed 
to get <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">gnue running on a WIN CE 
2.11 device - and python2.2 for CE just runs on CE 3.0 
:( The third choice would be using WABA (java for palmtops) 
but the jclient is very very preliminary</quote>. Jason said 
he was not keen on reviving the Java Forms client. 
James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">i 
don't think going back to 1.5.2 is very feasible - 
we had quite a few 1.5.2 hacks that eventually drove us to 
2.0 - putting those hacks back in would be ugly</quote>. 
Jan emphasised that he was not proposing 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">changing cvs, just thought of a 
private patch :)</quote>. James still thought 
<quote who="James Thompson">it would be rough - very 
rough - we had to do wierd class hacks to get cetain things 
to function</quote>. Jan asked which earlier versions of 
GNUe Forms had supported python 1.5 - 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">so the switch to 2.0 was short 
before gnue forms 0.3.0, I think</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek Neighbors (revDeke) asked Jan why he was 
restricted to Windows CE 2.2. Jan said 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">I have no money for a new PDA 
:(</quote>. Derek <quote who="Derek Neighbors">thinks 
perhaps you need to flash it and install something new on 
it :)</quote> He explained <quote who="Derek Neighbors">gnue 
should be focused on architectures to where its going more 
than where it is - that was a large part of the python 2.x 
decision. We figured by the time GNUe 1.0 ships - 2.x will 
be OLD - and 1.5.2 probably about unsupported</quote>. 
Jan said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">if I get forms 0.1.0 
working, its ok. The main aim is to present a working gnue 
on a PDA to a customer. If I get the project, they can use 
a Linux PDA. i.e. no porting needed.</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">python should work no problem
- but we will likely need another UI client - qtopia more 
than likely - or something similar</quote>. He would 
recommend <quote who="Derek Neighbors">going to 
#handhelds.org and seeing if anyone there has any tips/hints 
suggestions to getting linux in some form working</quote> 
on Jan's existing PDA - this might be easier than 
re-writing GNUe. Also, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">what 
about curses version of gnue? give another 3 months and we 
can probably proof it on an iPAQ for you</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek discovered that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">familiarOS for iPAQ has
Integrated Python v2.0 w/ PyGtk and PyGDKImlib. - 
time to test out that gnue pygtk driver :)</quote>
Jason pointed out that the GNUe UI driver was for 
GTK2, not GTK, but Jan said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">it 
can be easily modified to work with GTK. - but Its 
possibly better to just install debian unstable on the 
iPAQ</quote>. Jason agreed - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">otherwise, how else do you get 
frozenbubbles easily?</quote> Derek noted that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">familiar provides 100% 
binary compatiablity to debian dpkg w/ ipkg - er the arm 
distribution - so in theroy if arm supports 
pygtk2</quote>.</p>

<p>He was very enthusiastic about the prospect of getting 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">designer to run on an ipaq - 
/me can see techie meetings.... no more need to fall alseep 
one can design forms while in meetings, literally can have 
things DONE before you leave a meeting :) - instead of 
saying... "that would only take five minutes" and end 
of meeting give it to them and say "that only took 5 
minutes" ;)</quote>. Jason asked about the screen 
resolution, and <quote who="Jason Cater">cringes at the 
thought of designing w/in 320x200 :)</quote>. Derek 
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if you used 'virtual 
desktops' and a tabbed windows manager (like fluxbox) - 
it might be doable if you were designing forms for the 
iPAQ</quote>.</p>

<p>He had <quote who="Derek Neighbors">tried VERY hard to 
get some zaurus' on loan for development but sharp was 
really bad about it - stating they are only 200 thats cheap 
enough to 'buy'. i kept stating this is for FREE not 
PROPRIETARY software - and that likely more FREE software 
would only HELP Zaurus sales not HURT them - but the marketing 
drones i had to deal with basically were clueless :( 
HP/COMPAQ on the other hand is much more savvy - 
and understands the concept of symbiotic relationships - 
which is most odd as it should really be reversed seeing 
how zaurus is the linux pda and ipaq the pocketpc one....
go figure :)</quote></p>
