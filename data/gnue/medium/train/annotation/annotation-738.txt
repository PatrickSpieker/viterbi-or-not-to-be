<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<mention>Keith</mention>

<p>Keith Jagrs (KeithJagrs) asked <quote who="Keith Jagrs">have 
you checked out <a href="http://www.erp5.org">erp5.org</a>?</quote>
Derek Neighbors (derek) said it <quote who="Derek Neighbors">is what 
i had hoped the gnue.org community site could be like</quote>. He 
explained <quote who="Derek Neighbors">at one time i wanted to do 
somethign similar to erp5 - as it was needed - and we caught major 
crap for posting non gnue stuff - and it was confusing - it really 
needed to be a separate site</quote>. This was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">our old phpnuke site for gnue.org - 
i had hoped to do more an ERP community tyep of thing - but we 
needed to make it a second site - as to not confuse people - 
i.e. i agree with decisions we have made - and honestly we dont 
have resources to do a community site like that plus our 
project</quote>.</p>

<p>Keith asked <quote who="Keith Jagrs">taking its site aside, 
or its community, what do you think of their project, or their 
technical approach?</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i only saw it as an erp portal - 
and them trying to collect best of breed together. btw: this 
is one of the things gnue was supposed to do - compile stuff 
together in a sense - but i digress</quote>. He 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">didnt see that they were actively 
'coding' anything - but rather consolidating/packaging existing 
things - i could be wrong i only looked for 10 seconds</quote>. 
Keith said <quote who="Keith Jagrs">it seems to me a peer 
project - they are based on Zope as the core for the app 
server</quote>.</p>
