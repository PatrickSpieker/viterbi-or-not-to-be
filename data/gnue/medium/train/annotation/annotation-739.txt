<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">where 
to put packages :) for gnue</quote>. He had to get some work for a 
client started <quote who="Derek Neighbors">asap - i have the stuff 
in private cvs - i would like to address what to do with that stuff
- as well as get mroe information on gear stuff</quote>. He wanted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">to spend minimal time talking (yeah 
amazing eh) and roll up sleeves and get a hacking - but im to point 
i need good place to put this stuff as im going to encourage others 
to contribute ASAP. acclite fits in that mix as well - a little 
clean up and really i think the base of 'stuff' is done -
i.e. product categories and product maintenance - which is the start 
of ordering/inventory/invoicing etc - i.e. partnumbers woot!</quote>. 
He <quote who="Derek Neighbors">was going to consider revamping the 
module writers guide or such - and start creating two tier module 
docs - and merging in louis accounting stuff and comparing to nola 
and such - /me is gung ho - ready for some public announcements and 
website updates and code committing</quote>. His main question was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">mainly where to put the work</quote>. 
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I'd like to see this be the 
start of using separate modules - i.e., I'd like to see 
gnue-accounting - (or whatever you want to call it)</quote></p>

<p>Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">long term i want to know 
where we put on website (as discussed) - and package management.
i would like to see this be the start of packages on the website
i.e. official packages so to speak. I am down with modules but it 
gets shaky on data dictionaries - as if i make say CRM and Inovicing
- both use the contact database - so where do i put contact data 
dictionary stuff? If i put in crm then invoicing now depends on crm
- /me doesnt expect easy answer here or a instant solution as i 
think its MUCH more complicated than that</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">um - just put it somewhere - we'll move 
it around later :)</quote> Derek agreed - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i wouldnt be opposed to saying X depends 
on Y for NOW - as having usable stuff will make folks so happy it 
shouldnt matter much - as long as we have an eye for a better solution 
long term. i also considered putting data dictionary all in one place
and loading all tables regardless of what you install - 
but then you only have to get the forms, reports etc of what you 
want</quote>. Jason agreed.</p>

<p>Jason asked <quote who="Jason Cater">what is the official stance 
on what you're doing? these are stepping stone packages? thesse 
are unofficial, but working solutions?</quote>. Derek said he did 
not mind - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">you know what i have to make
- about 3 or 4 folks are wanting identical thing - whether we make 
this an unofficial soslution using the framework and put in speical 
cvs and special website - or whether we put on gnue as official 
'starter' packages to be replaced later - or whether we say these 
are official packages that will grow over time - makes no difference 
to me. I just want to be able to advertise to solict 'help'</quote>.
He thought <quote who="Derek Neighbors">making them officially gnue 
likely will help gnue's image - look at our website, its apparent we 
want to offer working systems :)</quote>. Jason had no strong views
either, <quote who="Jason Cater">but for political reasons, it may 
be best to have this as an unofficial solution using the framework - 
it's a tricky situation :) I can tell you now, it'll be "damned if 
you do, damned if you don't" - so choose your poison now and move 
on.</quote></p>

<p>Jason <quote who="Jason Cater">would probably lean towards "usable, 
but not quite official" solution in a separate cvs (but on 
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org">savannah</a>)</quote> (the FSF's 
free software alternative to sourceforge) <quote who="Jason Cater">but 
still advertise on our website</quote>. Derek wondered 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">why not just use existing</quote> 
CVS on GNUe's own server <quote who="Derek Neighbors">where we have 
acclite and/or UE stuff</quote> as of time of writing. Jason said 
he <quote who="Jason Cater">would like to see anon cvs</quote> 
but <quote who="Jason Cater">neither jamest or I are ready to open 
up</quote> GNUe's own server <quote who="Jason Cater">like that 
:)</quote>. Derek remembered <quote who="Derek Neighbors">thats 
right no pserver there - ok i will start a project then on savannah
- make a little web page and such</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I would name it gnue-????? and put on gnue 
website - just be careful with wording :) - so it's "associated 
with" GNue even if not in our main cvs repos</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.29Oct2002">
After midnight</a>, Peter Sullivan (psu) said
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">I would still rather we 
did the back-office stuff packages + acclite rewrite
as "real" GNUe packages if at all possible - even if 
0.0.1 or 0.1.0 versions</quote> from 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">a webmaster/PR point of 
view</quote>. He felt <quote who="Peter Sullivan">people 
would rather have packages that meet someone's need - 
and can be used as a basis for something more general - 
than get stuck in Proposal Hell for another 12-18 
months</quote> - if the problem was 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">just the need to be seen 
to follow the proposal process - I would say change 
the process.</quote> Nicholas Lee (esands) asked 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">WHat is the actually plan for 
acclite at the moment?  Current having hacked around 
the code somewhat it just seems to be a modified 
version of nola to work _somewhat_ with postgresql.  
Is someone working on forms for it?</quote> 
Peter said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">I believe that 
a couple of screens have been converted to GNUe Forms
- but that it has been a bit on back burner</quote> 
until now.</p>

<p>Later on, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo_) asked whether the 
new CVS for GNUe Applications had been set up on savannah 
yet. He explained <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we have some 
'small biz' stuff getting ramped up and ready - there was 
concern about putting in place of 'official' gnue packaging
- and we definitely didnt want in the gnue tools cvs</quote>. 
He said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i have product management 
basics ready - and contact management stuff is nearly ready - 
those two things are the BASE for ordering/invoicing/inventory 
and the likes - as you have to have product and customers 
:)</quote> Nicholas Lee (esands) said 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">Hopefully when I get this</quote> 
Foreign Exchange (FX) <quote who="Nicholas Lee">management 
stuff sort, its something you might put in there.</quote> 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i also plan serious 
ramp up and extension of pieces of acclite</quote>. Nicholas 
asked <quote who="Nicholas Lee">What is the roadmap for 
acclite?  You going to work with the php base at all? Or 
develop the form/gnue side of things?</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">originally i had planned on 
keeping the php side up - but more i look at it its likely 
i will not - but others could - /me suspects it will depend 
on how much we start modifying the underlying structures - 
if its minor tweaks there are reasons to keep the php up
if its more major or new stuff its probably not worth the 
core's time</quote>. Nicholas asked <quote who="Nicholas Lee">if 
the schema is worth using</quote>. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if the schema isnt worth using 
we will modify as necessary</quote>. Nicholas said 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">Main thing I'd need fix in order 
to use it, is sales tax on the vendors side</quote>. 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i already have own 
product structure and own contact structure - /me has not 
compared how that looks to acclite - at first gander i suspect 
(hope) to rip</quote> Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable 
and General Ledger <quote who="Derek Neighbors">from acclite
- likely might not use anything else</quote>. Nicholas 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">wonders if its worth using the nola 
base at all, or starting for scratch</quote>. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">looks like it has some docmanagement 
stuff - but the ui of forms might not be good for that</quote>. 
Nicholas said this was <quote who="Nicholas Lee">nothing to do 
with core accounting stuff though. Doesn't dcl handle some doc 
management stuff? I think though that doc management is an 
important part of contract/CR management</quote>. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">doc managment has about 10 different 
sdies - i think ulitmately we will need another 'tool' for this
- one that forms can interact with</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek emphasised that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">one of the 
pluses i saw in not doing official gnue is no hold ups - i.e. this 
isnt design by committee :) muhahaha - input definitely wanted - 
but things will be moving faster than making the right decision the 
first time :) When you get 300 people on a mailing list and design 
software - you get no where quick :) - as there are a million well 
if you do this you get X - and basically every sanctuary has its 
price - there is rarely a definitively right answer</quote>. 
Nicholas agreed - <quote who="Nicholas Lee">develop something that 
works for people. Either i) people will come and improve your work, 
ii) people will come see your work and have that flash and see 
how they can complete rewrite to to work for them and you - 
Either way its good for you and your got something working</quote>.
Derek agreed - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">just stating that the 
small biz stuff (because of outside requirements) will likely be 
very much do, refactor, do, refactor, do - we have 2 or 3 'customers' 
that are really driving the development - originally we were going 
to do in a more private cvs and wait until release to open cvs - 
but we feel that is not the free software way - we would rather let 
people play interactively - even if sometimes we have to say too 
bad</quote> as the needs of the paying customer had to take first 
priority. It was about <quote who="Derek Neighbors">baby steps - 
being able to catalog your products on a computer is better than 
not being able to even if you dont have inventory of them</quote>. 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">so one might say products w/o inventory 
module is dumb - i say products is base for inventory so its progress 
:)</quote> He felt <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the two things i 
have seen 'drag down' projects  - a. bickering to decide on decisions 
for so long that you could have implemented in all proposed ways in 
the amount of time you spent arguing about it. - b. not starting 
anything until you have decided on EVERY possible feature and/or 
scenario</quote>. Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">b) never 
works though. Prefection is impossible to get. Afterall who's prefection 
is it? Obviously its the person actually writing the code, thus 
you are back at some form of a) again.  Anyway it'll be good to see 
what you guys have got so far and what your roadmap is.  I can 
provide input on how that would work for the business enviroment
here</quote> in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Responding to Derek's original question, Jason Cater (jcater) 
said he had applied to the savannah-hackers mailing list to set up 
a new CVS, but had not heard back from them yet. He asked 
<quote who="Jason Cater">what's the typical turn-around to requests 
like mine?</quote> Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">it's a project submission, so could be 
2 days if you're _really_ unlucky - usually a few hours, depends 
who's evaluating</quote>. Derek let off some steam that GNUe had had 
some problems with support requests from savannah and the FSF 
generally recently but added <quote who="Derek Neighbors">its really 
not fair to complain after all its volunteers - sometimes i think 
they could structure better though</quote>. </p>
