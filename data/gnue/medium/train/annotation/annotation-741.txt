Nicholas Lee (esands) said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">I don't 
really have the server spacem, but I can set a (t)wiki up 
easily enough. The question might be though, if erp5.org are 
doing it. Is it worth doing repeating?</quote>. 
Peter Sullivan (psu) said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">if 
people really want a wiki, I would rather host it as 
wiki.gnuenterprise.org</quote> but 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">At the moment, I would say
anything that people might want on a wiki e-mail it to</quote> 
him <quote who="Peter Sullivan">as I'm sure I can find a 
sensible place to slot it</quote> on the main web site.</p>

<p>Peter said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">The front page still 
concerns me - The "What is GNUe?" needs to be up front for 
newcomers - but for old hands, we really want the news to be 
first up</quote>. He wondered about using cookies to 
manipulate this, but Nicholas suggested 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">Just have two different entry 
points - People bookmark the page they want. Otherwise the 
server is making decisions for the client</quote>.</p>

<p>Peter said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">The big issues on 
the website at the moment are - a) Docs need updating - I just 
need to get around to recompiling them from CVS - b) FAQ needs 
updating really badly - A lot of the material is already on the 
website - just needs folding back into FAQ. But then, as always, 
we accept patches ;-)</quote>. Nicholas said 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">wikis tend to make that process a 
little easier. (provision of patches)</quote>. Peter said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">Actually, #1 priority is to get 
website into CVS so other people can touch site w/o</quote> 
having to let him know what they had done - he 
would pursue this further.</p>
