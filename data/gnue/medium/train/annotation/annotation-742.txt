<topic>Forms</topic>
<topic>Designer</topic>

<p>Bill Gribble (grib) asked <quote who="Bill Gribble">can 
anybody here comment on the use of the designer and other 
tools with Guile?  are they totally tied to python or 
somewhat language neutral?</quote> James Thompson (jamest)
said <quote who="James Thompson">right now they are tied 
to python - we have plans to support triggers in other 
languages - but no code exists yet to take advantage of 
it</quote>. Derek agreed that GNUe was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">tied to python - designer 
will likely always be unless there is a port (me sees 
little value in a port) - as to the forms client (forms 
is a spec, there already are php and javascript and java 
implemenations in cvs) ableit far from complete. i would 
say there is LITTLE need to make an implementation in a 
separate langaguage - as they are TOOLS not applications
i.e. we plan to support business logic in ANY language
so people writing gnue applications should be able to write 
applications only knowing their favorite language</quote>. 
However, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">creating an 'alternate' 
implementation of the tool is a lot of maintainance and 
duplication (but as stated we have samples in cvs so its 
doable). Python is about as portable as it gets - i.e. 
from handhelds to mainframes</quote>. He also noted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">there is a native gtk2 
version</quote> of Forms <quote who="Derek Neighbors">in 
cvs in case wxpython is one of your concerns</quote>.</p>

<p>Bill said <quote who="Bill Gribble">I am using a similar 
designer via glade that's tied to scheme in the same way; 
I just happen to like scheme more :) The nice thing about 
the gnue designer is the twist you guys put on it to support 
character cell layout. I am pretty likely to be doing a 
significant chunk of ERP type stuff for some car dealerships 
and I was hoping to give/take some with gnue, but I don't 
think I'm ready to switch the tools over to python.</quote> 
He did not <quote who="Bill Gribble">have anything against 
python, I just like lispy languages better.  guile has its 
limitations but at least I know what they are.</quote> 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">guile/scheme looks 
very cool - problem is it has a big learning curve compared 
to python for business programmers. I dont think that makes 
it bad, just we tried to pick something closer to our target 
market plus larger programmer base</quote>. He suggested 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">the 'right' thing to do if you 
wanted to do this and not loose scheme is adopt the formats
i.e. keep own designer - just make it write out gfd's and 
grd's - then make a forms client in scheme. This shouldnt be 
overly difficult - and it woudl actually give you 
compatiability to GNUE - i.e. a form you write should be 
usable by python clients as long as you are in spec - 
especially once we have cross language trigger support</quote>.
He noted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we are getting ready 
to rollout quite a bit of application base very soon - 
geared towards manufacturing - but most of it would be 
relevant to car dealerships too - as keeping books and paying 
bills is pretty universal :)</quote>.</p>

<p>Nick Rusnov (nickr) said <quote who="Nick Rusnov">Seems 
like the gfds should allow you to say 'this trigger uses this 
interpreter'</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">we have that functionality, just no 
sublanguages - all triggers support a language="" attribute -
just right now, "python" is the only valid answer :)</quote>. 
Nick asked <quote who="Nick Rusnov">does the forms client 
really have to be written in the same lanugage as the 
triggers?</quote> Derek said not - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">the idea is that python version 
will support triggers in ANY language</quote> that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">someone writes a wrapper 
for</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek asked whether <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we 
could make designer work same way for plugins? i.e. could we 
make the plugin architecture support other languages</quote>? 
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I suppose so - but that's 
a slightly different audience - /me isn't sure of the benefits
- but it is certainly doable</quote>. Derek said that
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if we make a concession for 
business applications to be outside of python (the biz 
logic/triggers) - would it make sense to offer this 
flexibiltiy for designer plugins</quote> as well. As Designer 
evolved, so that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">everything 
almost is done via plugin - we might get more stuff written 
if we offer to let poeple write in language of choice
- or at least python/scheme/perl</quote>.</p>
