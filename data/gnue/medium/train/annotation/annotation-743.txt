<topic>DCL</topic>

<p>Nick Rusnov (nickr) noted <quote who="Nick Rusnov">hmm, 
all the official gnue packages in debian</quote>, dating back to 
<kcref startdate="11 Jan 2002 03:37:07 -0800" subject="gnue in debian pool" />, 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">have been orphaned</quote>. 
Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">good 
we need a maintainer to submit what we have</quote> from
<kcref subject="[IRC] 05 Oct 2002" title="Debian packages for GNUe" />  
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">to official :)</quote>. Nick said 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">I'd be willing to do that if they don't 
suck.</quote> Derek asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">any chance 
you could review them for 'suckage' - and if they dont suck take 
over the packages and get what we have uploaded to debian?</quote>
Nick said he would <quote who="Nick Rusnov">look em over</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Nicholas Lee (esands) noted that the old packages for 
gnue-common, gnue-designer and gnue-forms all had outstanding bugs
in the Debian bug tracking system. James said people could 
<quote who="James Thompson">add a line to their sources.list 
and just apt-get the new stuff - deb http://www.gnuenterprise.org/debian 
woody main</quote>. These were the Debian packages that Jason 
Cater (jcater) had prepared, based on those for Zope. Jeff Bailey 
(jbailey) asked <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Are they going into unstable 
at all?</quote> James said <quote who="James Thompson">we don't have 
a clue how to make it happen</quote>. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">they probably will if you spruce them up 
:)</quote>. Jeff said <quote who="Jeff Bailey">I can make that happen 
easily enough. Especially since we might start using gnue here. 
=)</quote> James said <quote who="James Thompson">i'd love to see them 
in</quote> the Debian testing distribution (as of time of writing, 
sarge) <quote who="James Thompson">as well - but I know they have to 
play nice in unstable for a while</quote>. Jeff said that, at the 
moment, Debian <quote who="Jeff Bailey">unstable is still suffering 
with the glibc 2.3 transition and the perl transition</quote>, 
although this should not affect python-based packages like GNUe.</p>

<p>Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">whatever you do - PLEASE keep 
the changes in CVS - I have all my debian files in our cvs 
structure</quote>. James agreed - <quote who="James Thompson">we 
tried time and time again to get the files and a simple how-to in 
cvs - but people treated us like we were derek and just ignored 
us :)</quote> Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">we can maintain 
them - I don't mind that - we just need a sponsor</quote>. 
James agreed - <quote who="James Thompson">we just need someone 
wise to tell us what hoops to jump thru - personally I'd like to 
see the maintainer listed as the project itself - as the orphan 
problem seems to haunt debian projects</quote>. Nicholas said 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">No rush though to get the debs back in.  
Can always do maintain it external and pass it to a debian 
maintainer to commit to the rep.</quote> James agreed - 
<quote who="James Thompson">we have external repository now - 
i set that up about a month ago using jcater's debs</quote>.</p>

<p>Jeff suggested setting up a small mailing list at 
lists.debian.org to do the bug tracking for the packages. 
Nicholas suggested <quote who="Nicholas Lee">WHy not just 
debian@gnue.org ?</quote> Derek suggested 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if debian bug tracker has 
to email something - howabout debian-support@gnuenterprise.org
- thsi way it will file bugs automagically into DCL - and 
we can have one 'official' person in charge - but certainly 
others can put on watches or the likes</quote>. Jeff said 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">That's probably suboptimal, since 
then you'd have two bug tracking systems.</quote> Derek 
said he wanted to let people use the Debian bug 
tracker system <quote who="Derek Neighbors">to log the bug
- and we just do something clever to have DCL report back 
to BTS on things - this way our developers have a single 
system but people can still file bugs via BTS. i.e. im not 
against BTS - but we need to have bugs in one place for us
- and dcl is that place</quote>. Jeff said it was 
normally <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Debian Developpers job to 
handle bugs and file them upstream when needed.</quote> 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">well i would 
consider this no different - just our debian developer is 
a 'collective borg' - and so it auto forwards everything 
upstream :)</quote> since the GNUe project would have 
committed to also maintain the debian package for itself.
Jeff said <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Tell you what - I'll upload 
it at first sending the bugs to me.  When you get it wired 
up, lemme know. =)</quote>.</p>

<p>Jeff reviewed the new packages before uploading them - 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">it looks like baux orphaned all of 
the gnue stuff. So it won't be a problem for me to pick it 
up</quote>. He asked whether <quote who="Jeff Bailey">gnue 
uses zope?</quote> Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">nope - not at all - 
jcater</quote> just <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">based the 
debs off zope's packaging :)</quote>. Jeff pointed out 
that the README still mentioned Zope. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">the README was one of the things 
i needed to touch up - as well as our description: 
fields</quote>. He also wondered <quote who="Jason Cater">what 
kind of bribe it'd take to get him (or someone) to get 
nickr's pysablot debs</quote>, as discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 15 Apr 2002" title="Using pysablot as an XML transformation tool with GNUe Reports" />, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">in unstable? I do know those need 
to be renamed to python's standard (which I guess would 
be python2.2-sablotron) ??</quote> Since sablotron/pysablot 
was a dependancy for GNUe Reports, this 
<quote who="Jason Cater">would be ultracool at some point. 
Or was nickr waiting on something from upstream? I guess we 
should ask him :)</quote>.</p>
