<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) reported problems starting Designer 
- <quote who="Derek Neighbors">ImportError: No module named 
wxPython.wx</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) asked 
<quote who="Jason Cater">did you upgrade to unstable's 
python?</quote>. The Debian sid (unstable) distribution now 
used python 2.2 as its standard instead of 2.1 - he 
suggested that Derek should <quote who="Jason Cater">apt-get 
install wxgtk2.3-python</quote>. Derek asked 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">why didnt the DEPENDENCIES pick 
up something</quote> - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i.e. why 
did it switch my python to 2.2 but not fricken grab its 
dependencies</quote>? He noted that most python-based 
packages in Debian used python 2.3 now. Jason said that, 
according to the python website, 2.3 was not out yet - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">and they say debian is behind - 
bullshit! - unstable is so damn current, it has software that 
hasn't been written yet!</quote> Derek wondered if someone 
had packaged python 2.3 from python's CVS rather than an 
official release.</p>

<p>Jason noted that the plans for python 2.3 included 
<quote who="Jason Cater">a lot of changes</quote> - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">they have a bool() datatype, 
generators, enumerators</quote> and other extra functionality 
that would be useful in GNUe. Derek 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">wonders what you get if you 
apt-get install python2.3 :)</quote> Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I would be afraid</quote>. 
Derek said <quote who="Jason Cater">if you have to PORT
- shouldnt it be 3.0</quote>? Jason said that the 
<quote who="Jason Cater">thing is it's ALWAYS that the new 
version enforces a language rule that they were lax in before.
So the code, once "ported", still works in the older 2.x 
version :) e.g., 2.2 really enforced namespace scope rules
that they spelled out for a long time but didn't enforce - 
that broke some people's python. But that's because they 
were writing broken python :) - we don't ever do that
&lt;cough&gt;</quote>.</p>
