<topic>Designer</topic>
<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) said the <quote who="Derek Neighbors">designer 
schema wizard kicks some arse</quote>. He asked whether the .gsd 
(GNUe Schema Definition) output file should be 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">ONE giant schema? or one per 
table?</quote> Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">we've had this 
debate before</quote>, in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 10 Jul 2002" title="Including data in GNUe Application Server schema definitions" />.
He said <quote who="Jason Cater">I *think* the outcome is we should 
support some kidn of &lt;import&gt; mechanism</quote>. Derek 
agreed - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if we coudl 'include' (or 
import)</quote> then <quote who="Derek Neighbors">single was probably 
better</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said he was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">SO impressed to 
see you could pick table listings - only thing missing is it needs 
to pop a dialog when done - saying 'done' - i just noticed that 
the term window stopped spitting out debug messages :)</quote>
Jason said that this would not be an issue 
<quote who="Jason Cater">once we have an editor :)</quote>. 
Derek noted that the wizard had translated a postgreSQL field 
of type numeric(12,2) to <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
&lt;field name="amount" size="786438" type="number"/&gt;</quote>.
Jason suggested <quote who="Jason Cater">somethings screwy with 
the introspection</quote>. Derek did some poking around 
inside PostgreSQL and discovered that the data dictionary 
had a field "atttypmod" which contained the mystery 
786438 value - obviously a look-up to another table of 
valid numeric types - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">guess 
we need to learn 'conversion magic'</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">ah, crap... we are obviously 
misinterpreting what atttypmod means</quote> - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">postgres catalog table doesn't 
store like I expected</quote>. Derek was convinced he 
was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">a walking light bulb 
(fricken bugs are attracted to me)</quote>.</p>
