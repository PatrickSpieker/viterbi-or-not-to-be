<p>Nicholas Lee (esands) pointed to 
<a href="http://www.mustardandrelish.com/ledger/">Gnu Ledger</a>.
Derek Neighbors (derek) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">you 
seem to research this stuff like mad - i used to but ran out of 
time - ANY chance as you find this stuff you could make a 
database/spreadsheet/textfile that has projectname - category - 
maincontact - maincontact email</quote> Nicholas said 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">Sure, I could probably do something like 
that. However 
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/browse/76/?topic_id=76">freshmeats</a>
pretty good</quote>. Derek explained <quote who="Derek Neighbors">one 
thing i used to do is contact the projects - if it was something that 
was complimentary i invite them to work with us</quote> - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we at one time consolidated about 10 
projects into us</quote>.</p>

<p>Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">This is an interesting 
under the radar project I just discovered there: 
<a href="http://www.redrocketconsortium.com/zbc/index.html">
http://www.redrocketconsortium.com/zbc/index.html</a></quote>. 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i have see the redrocket 
one before</quote> - he noted it was written in ADA. 
Ndicholas said it <quote who="Nicholas Lee">Has some nice 
screenshots. Although it looks like it suffers from 
the same us-centric issue of only dealing with sales tax on 
sales</quote>. Derek felt that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the 
problem with ADA is finding otehr developers will be murder - 
if this guy decides to stop finding someone to maintain it could 
be impossible or (costly)</quote>. Nicholas suggested 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">Probably defense industry 
retirees</quote>.</p>

<p>Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">Anyway, of all the 
oss/free-type accounting projects I've looked at so far.  None of 
them are quite there, in terms of being solid mature and 
robust.</quote> <quote who="Nicholas Lee">The only three I've 
keep coming back to are sql-ledger, nola and gnucash (cvs sb 
version) - Nothing else I've tried is still on my machine.  
Nola/acclite is still there only because you guys are working on 
it. Given its broken for the NZ tax enviroment its not very 
function for me</quote> until this was fixed.</p>
