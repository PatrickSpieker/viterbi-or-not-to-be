<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Johannes Vetter (johannesV) asked what <quote who="Johannes Vetter">block-level 
focus-triggers</quote> were for in Forms. James Thompson (jamest) replied 
that <quote who="James Thompson">they provide a higher level trigger than per 
entry level - so you could define a trigger that validates that fields x,y,z match 
a specific combo of values - and block navigation if they did</quote> not. In 
other words, <quote who="James Thompson">they fire on any focus change in that 
block</quote>, not just on movement into or out of the block. This meant that, 
if you moved from one entry field to another in the same block, you would fire 
four triggers all at once - the focus-out trigger for the field and block and 
the focus-out trigger for the field and the block. Even if you were moving 
from one field within the block to another field still within the block. This 
was intended to match a similar feature in a proprietary database forms 
software package.</p>
