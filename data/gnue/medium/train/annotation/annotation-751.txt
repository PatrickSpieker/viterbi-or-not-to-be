<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Johannes Vetter (johannesV) had <quote who="Johannes Vetter">fixed a 
bug in the wx26-uidriver of the released version</quote> of GNUe Forms, 
and released the source-code version of this as an 'interim' 0.5.14a 
release. Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) packaged this up as a setup.exe 
release for Microsoft Windows, and made it available for download, noting 
that it <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">doesn't contains wx26</quote>. Normally, 
the Microsoft Windows setup.exe releases would contain as many of the 
dependencies that it legally could. But wx version 2.6 had not been 
included in the last setup.exe release. GNUe Forms with wx 2.6 
was a significant improvement on using it with wx 2.4. But at the time of 
the last release, GNUe Designer had not been <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">wx26 
ready</quote>. So the Microsoft Windows setup.exe version of that 
release had remained on wx version 2.4. This was still the case with this 
new interim 0.5.14a release. But if people wanted, they could manually 
configure GNUe to use wx 2.6 with Forms and wx 2.4 with Designer.</p>
