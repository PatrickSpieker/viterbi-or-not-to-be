<topic>Application Server</topic>
<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>Henry Mason (deprogram) asked <quote who="Henry Mason">how much is 
actually being done to the appserver? it seems like everyone is 
working on a 2-tier arrangement</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) 
felt <quote who="James Thompson">that's not quite true - us 2 tier 
losers have less of a life than the appserver people</quote> and 
<quote who="James Thompson">the goal is that forms/reports/designer 
just work w/ 3 tier</quote>. Henry said he was a potential user 
for Application server as <quote who="Henry Mason">i have a massive 
legacy application that needs to be reworked into a modern architecture
- i'd like to put as much as possible into a middle tier</quote>. 
Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) admitted that 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">appserver unfortunately has much less 
progress than i would want it to have</quote> but James said 
<quote who="James Thompson">one thing that would help though is having 
someone like you using it - I know forms/reports/common are driven by 
jcater and my needs - and sometimes even a user request</quote>.
Reinhard agreed - <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">one thing that would 
help though is somebody that kicks my ass on a daily basis</quote>.
Henry volunteered to help, saying <quote who="Henry Mason">i have to 
get more familiar w. python - :&gt; it seems pretty transparent</quote>.
James explained the principles behind the copyright assignment of all 
GNUe code to the Free Software Foundation. Henry understood, but 
warned <quote who="Henry Mason">it may be difficult to persuade my boss 
that he needs to pay me to hack open src</quote> - on the other hand, 
<quote who="Henry Mason">if i write a closed package he will be faced 
with maintaining it after i quit</quote>.</p>
