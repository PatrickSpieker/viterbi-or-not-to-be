<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 01 Apr 2003" title="New pre-releases available for testing" />, 
Derek Neighbors (derek) noted that the 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">commit enabled bug</quote> now 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">appears to be fixed, the only possible 
problem would be that if you had something with only one value.
that is the 'commit' doesnt enable until you exit a field on the 
new record (which is way better than it not enabling until you exit 
the record itself)</quote>. He personally considered 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">it fixed, but wanted that side 
note</quote>. The other bug - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">foreign 
key populating all lookups is _not_ fixed - instead of it populating 
with the value being committed on commit, it now populates with the 
previous record on commit</quote>. This was with the 9th set of 
pre-releases. Later, Derek (revDeke) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if 
you can solve the foriegn key one and do a pre10 (along with your fixes 
to designer i see committed) i can try to give all the tools a nice 
thorough butt whooping when i get home</quote> - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i hope to at a minimum tonight test 
some navigator stuff and the 'schema scripts'</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.05Apr2003">
Two days later</a>, James Thompson (jamest) said that he was
<quote who="James Thompson">99% certain it'll be this 
weekend</quote> that version 0.5.0 would be officially released - 
he and Jason Cater (jcater) had done some final bug-squishing the 
day before. There was still one outstanding bug, 
<quote who="James Thompson">and docs need updated</quote>. 
Jeff Bailey (jbailey) asked whether GNUe Small Business (gnue-sb) 
had been updated to use the 0.5.0 GNUe tools yet. James confirmed
<quote who="James Thompson">they ported it</quote>. He had hoped 
that the 0.5.0 release of the tools would have included 
<quote who="James Thompson">a stable win32 ui dirver in there too
- but we won't hold up release on that - it's been too long</quote>. 
As it was, he was <quote who="James Thompson">really happy with 0.5.0
- i was worried about stability -  but i think we're at or above 
0.4.x</quote>.</p>
