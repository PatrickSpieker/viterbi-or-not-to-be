<p>Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">are you 
ok with releaseing appserver 0.0.3?</quote> Reinhard M&#252;ller
(reinhard) was - <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">we haven't had a 
release for a long time</quote> and, as Jan pointed out, 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">its important to have a release which 
works with the newest "gnue-Common"</quote>. Jan asked 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">should we have documentation for the 
api of the language interface?</quote> Reinhard agreed -
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">maybe as a part of a "guide to 
writing applications with appserver"</quote>. Jan noted that he 
had <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">updated the jsclient to use the 
new appserver api and I'm thinking about building the 
language interface for javascript</quote> This was already 
working, but <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">I just think about moving 
to a language interface like API, to provide an appserver 
language interface in another programming language.</quote></p>
