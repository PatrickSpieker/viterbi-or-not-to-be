<p>Christian Selig (lupo) asked how to set up
<quote who="Christian Selig">master / detail forms - 
i have a list of customers and a list of countries.
there is a customer.country_id and a countries.id which are linked.
In the customer form, the country shall be choosable with a dropdown 
menu</quote>. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said that if 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">you just want to choose one country  and 
store its id into  customer.country_id</quote> this did not 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">need master detail. you just need to define 
the countries datasource, and create a dropdown entry</quote>. 
There was an example of this in the connection.gfd (GNUe Forms 
Definition) - you just had to specify the datasource for the foreign 
key, the foreign key field itself and any fk_description - this 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">is the part which is shown to the user 
(i.e. in your case country name)</quote>. Christian confirmed 
<quote who="Christian Selig">now it works :)</quote></p>
