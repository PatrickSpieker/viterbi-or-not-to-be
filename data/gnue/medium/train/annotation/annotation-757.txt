<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">when releasing 
last night the new common I bundled up a appserver too and put up as a 
release - but I didn't know the stat (notice no official announcements 
of the release :) IIRC you guys were ready for a release to match the new 
common - should I leave it up or pull it?</quote> Reinhard M&#252;ller
(reinhard) said <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">we haven't reached a 
specific milestone yet with appserver - but it's been a long time since 
the last release and a lot of incompatible changes - so the release is 
good for 0.0.3</quote>. He thanked James <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">for 
the effort of doing it</quote>. Jeff Bailey (jbailey) asked about the 
status of the release. James said <quote who="James Thompson">released -
just not announced</quote>,and he encouraged Jeff, as the project's Debian 
package maintainer to <quote who="James Thompson">bundle her up and slap 
her in sid</quote>. Jeff asked whether he should do a first Debian 
package for Application Server - <quote who="Jeff Bailey">I'm guessing no.
(since he told me not to bother before)</quote> Reinhard said not yet - 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">i think we if we package the next release 
for appserver - we will still be early enough for sarge :)</quote>.</p>
