<p>Jason Cater (jcater) said he had not done any further work on the 
Forms qt GUI client recently, as he had been working on the 0.5.0 
release - <quote who="Jason Cater">but it was *really* close - combo 
boxes weren't working right and the initial form size wasn't quite right.
I hadn't looked at check boxes yet, so I know they don't work - 
but basic entry stuff was good. I hit a serious limitation with the 
QT3 library and mouse support though - so I'm having issues when a user 
clicks inside a text box to move the cursor</quote>.</p>
