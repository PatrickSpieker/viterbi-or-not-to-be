<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Ariel Cal&#242; (ariel_) asked <quote who="Ariel Cal&#242;">do you 
want that i put the trigger stuff in the digrams</quote> for 
Application Server <quote who="Ariel Cal&#242;">or is it a 
temporary hack that will eventually disappear?</quote> 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">I 
think that GTrigger will stay, its likely to change a bit. 
(like much of the rest of appserver) The only thing which is 
really a hack is [...] the way triggers are called, and the way 
methods are implemented (methods are using triggers at the 
moment)</quote>.</p>
