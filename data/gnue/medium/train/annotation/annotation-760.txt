<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) reported problems with the 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">idea to assign trigger to first 
field of the form</quote> as a work-around for the lack of 
a trigger on opening a form, as discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 09 Jul 2002" title="Referencing named triggers to avoid coding multiple event triggers" />. 
Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) said <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">i 
don't know why the trigger isn't fired when the form is opened - 
the focus is set in that field</quote> regardless of whether 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">you get there from another tab or 
from form start</quote>. Dmitry <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">tested 
again with all PRE POST FOCUSIN FOCUSOUT combinations, all</quote> 
of which were not triggering properly when the form was opened.</p>
