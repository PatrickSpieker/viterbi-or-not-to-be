<topic>DCL</topic>

<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 05 Jul 2002" title="Debian packages for DCL" />, 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said he was going to post the Debian packages 
that Jeff Bailey (jbailey) had done. He pointed Jeff 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">to two bugs submitted on the old ones to 
see if you addressed in yours</quote>. Jeff said <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Those 
bugs don't apply because I don't automatically setup the database. =) - I 
want feedback first whether the basic setup is right before I start coding in 
extra stuff like that.</quote> Derek reported that setting the packages 
up with dpkg generated a dependancy error - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">Package 
wwwconfig-common is not installed.</quote> Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) 
suggested <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">that's why you use apt-get to install 
:)</quote> Jeff said he had <quote who="Jeff Bailey">thought of removing that 
dep, but I'll use it when I start putting in the automatic-virutal-host-creation 
stuff.</quote>.</p>

<p>He confirmed that the Debian package did not set up the database as of 
time of writing - <quote who="Jeff Bailey">There's a whole lot of work 
I'll have to do with debconf to do that right.</quote> If Derek was 
happy with these packages as a first draft, <quote who="Jeff Bailey">then 
I'll upload it to Debian. and slowly add features and such.</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">deb seems to work for me, get it in sid :) - 
we should work on it configuring the db</quote>, possibly with a separate
Debian package for each supported database. Jeff said that, when he had 
written it, <quote who="Jeff Bailey">The debconf page will give you the choice 
of what database (with some sanity checks, like needing the libraries 
installed)</quote>.</p>

Some days later</a>, further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 15 Apr 2002" title="Using pysablot as an XML transformation tool with GNUe Reports" />, 
Nick Rusnov (nickr) asked <quote who="Nick Rusnov">did you ever make any 
progress with the pysablot author?</quote> Derek Neighbors (dneighbo_) 
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">um yeah he said he isnt killing it</quote> 
and <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think he takes packages and are cool with 
us packaging and putting in sid</quote>. Nick said he would 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">need a version on sourceforge with a readme and a 
copying</quote> in order to be able to submit an official Debian package 
for it. Jeff Bailey (jbailey) confirmed that the Debian packages for DCL were now
in the Debian sid distribution - <quote who="Jeff Bailey">so anything you want 
on it, please file wishlist bugs. That way I can keep track of it using 
the </quote> normal Debian Bug Tracking System.</p>
