<p>Responding to 
<kcref startdate="06 Jul 2002 13:40:47 -0800" subject="[Gnue-announce] DCL 20020706 (stable) Released" />, 
Jason Cater (jcater) felt <quote who="Jason Cater">that statements 
like dneighbo's should be qualified - i.e., "It is HIGHLY suggested that 
you update." --&gt; "..if you run DCL on an untrusted network"</quote>. He 
<quote who="Jason Cater">imagines we are one of the few ppl running 
a "public" dcl instance</quote>. There were similar issues around 
<quote who="Jason Cater">that NOLA notice last week - 
if you are running on an untrusted network, then the package has issues
but of course the question then has to be raised, why are you running 
it on an untrusted network??</quote> especially for mission-critical 
systems like accounting.</p>
