<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 15 Jun 2002" title="Branching CVS to split bug fixes and new features" />, 
Jason Cater noted <quote who="Jason Cater">The cvs version of designer 
is undergoing some needed restructuring... if cvs is broken and you are 
relying on cvs designer to get your work done, then you might want to 
tag your gnue/designer module as the 0.3.x branch - That branch is only 
for bug-fixes</quote>. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said he 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">will probably still play with cvs designer, 
but keep an old copy around :)</quote> Jason felt 
<quote who="Jason Cater">that would be advisable - /me tries not to break 
designer when he commits - but sometimes they slip by me</quote>.</p>
