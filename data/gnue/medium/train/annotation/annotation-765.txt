<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) reported 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">i have found that in 
common/src/FormatMasks we have at least 3 files (DateMask.py, 
NumberMask.py, TextMask.py) that each of them defines 
things like monthNames, weekdayNames over and over - wouldn't it be 
simplier to define all them once in BaseMask.py?</quote> 
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">NumberMask and 
TextMask aren't even implemented - so the code you see there is
a cut and paste from DateMask - and DateMask isn't even 
finished</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Arturas noted that <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">in 
common/src/dbdrivers/_dbsig/DBdriver.py - found - 
return value.strftime(self._dateTimeFormat). As far as i 
understand 'strftime' function gives date\time string formatted  
according to locale settings. But do i need localized SQL queries 
for database? I guess it shouldn't be there</quote> - he would 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">correct it and commit into cvs</quote> 
if no-one disagreed. Later, Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">self.
_dateTimeFormat should be set to whatever postgresql needs - 
apparently, it is currently set with the "locale" mask</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.15Jul2002">
Some days later</a>, Arturas advised <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">I have 
just changed common/src/dbdrivers/_dbsig/DBdriver.py file - could
someone please review change - maybe you'll have some ideas how to 
improve source - it's a bit problematic now</quote>, but was converting 
dates by droping the decimals after the seconds. Jason Cater (jcater) 
warned <quote who="Jason Cater">you shouldn't be making postgres-specific 
changes in _dbsig or you'll break all the other drivers</quote>. He 
understood the problem, in that localised month names in queries were 
causing errors, <quote who="Jason Cater">I just don't agree with the 
solution - that was the purpose of _dateTimeFormat</quote>. If it was not 
working properly, it needed to be changed, not by-passed. Arturas agreed - 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">i changed it so that now it gives fixed 
'YEAR-MONTH-DAY HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND' format not the localised one</quote>. 
The dropping of the decimals for seconds was a slightly different issue, 
in that PostgreSQL <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">holds date\time with 
...,99 but it does not accept such format in queries :/</quote> He 
guessed this might be better fixed elsewhere.</p>
