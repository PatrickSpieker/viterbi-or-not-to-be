<p>Perry Lorier (Remosi), reading
<kcref subject="[IRC] 08 Jul 2002" title="International date formats in Forms" />, 
<quote who="Perry Lorier">discovers that you guys suggest the worst 
possible solution "mm/dd/yy" for internal representation - /me 
goes and finds a shotgun to preform some reeducation</quote>. He 
declared that <quote who="Perry Lorier">the one true date format is 
"YYYY-MM-DD"</quote> and noted that the proposed format was
<quote who="Perry Lorier">not y2k compliant, it's ambigious with the 
european "dd/mm/yy"</quote>' John Lenton (Chipaca) said that dd/mm/yy 
was not so much European as 
<quote who="John Lenton">non-USAean</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.14Jul2002">
Two days later</a>, Perry asked <quote who="Perry Lorier">can anyone tell me 
why (At least in the KC) it was agreed to use "mm/dd/yy"? for internal date 
formats?</quote> Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) suggested 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">probably because of the unhealthy american 
influence</quote>. Perry said <quote who="Perry Lorier">yyyy-mm-dd seems 
to be a much more logical system to use - theres even a ISO standard about 
it</quote>. Andrew <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">certainly prefers it - 
makes sorting in a list much simpler</quote>. Perry suggested 
<quote who="Perry Lorier">well, if american's persist to use their silly 
systems we'll have to buy a few plane tickets and go and beat them around the 
head with a large, wet, and slightly smelly trout.</quote> Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) vigorously countered <quote who="Derek Neighbors">um cause americans 
are the best - and we dont want your puking metric system or messed up concept 
of date formatting - you can even take your stinking celsius too.</quote> 
Perry <quote who="Perry Lorier">goes and prepares the fish</quote>, before 
Derek quickly clarified <quote who="Derek Neighbors">btw im completely 
kidding - only the french would use that as a reason ;) I mean after the 
dateline was stolen from them, who would blame them for their ire</quote>.</p>
