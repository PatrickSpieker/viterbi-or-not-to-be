<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) asked how the Forms client 
written in PHP was <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">coming along?</quote> 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">I hope to bring 
phpforms to a stable state soon, but there are too many small problems, 
and I don't have a good debugger :( - and after using python I don't 
like PHP anymore ;)</quote> Andrew said <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">i'd 
imagine handling python triggers in php would have been fun</quote>. 
Jan said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">this is the reason for using phpforms 
with appserver, so triggers can be moved into appserver</quote>.</p>
