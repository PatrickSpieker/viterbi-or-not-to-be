<p>Perry Lorier (Remosi) reprised his 
<quote who="Perry Lorier">amazing .so-&gt;idl idea</quote>, as previously 
discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 28 Jun 2002" title="Using .grpc files to support remote procedures in different languagues" />.
<quote who="Perry Lorier">You know how nm can tell you all the symbols in 
a .so (or .o for that matter) right? and how "stabs" can tell you the type 
of a symbol if it was compiled with -g, or, alternatively, c++filt will tell 
you if it was compiled using gcc, right? :)</quote> Daniel Baumann 
(chillywilly) said he had <quote who="Daniel Baumann">never used that 
before</quote> - he asked <quote who="Daniel Baumann">is c++filt 
apt-gettable?</quote> Perry said <quote who="Perry Lorier">it's in 
binutils</quote>. <quote who="Perry Lorier">givin that type information you 
should be able to write an idl file (for gnurpc for instance)</quote>.
He recognised that <quote who="Perry Lorier">you need to of course figure 
out which symbols are actually defined in the .so/.a/.o that you're linking - 
but it could be a really easy way to automatically load, say, openssl into 
python. You could take the openssl.so file generate some idl for it, then use 
gnurpc to use openssl as if it was a python module without having to spend 
ages defining all the normal glue logic. If you did it right python could 
catch the import function and do all of that automatically - so you could 
have a .so (eg openssl.so) and then just go "import openssl" in python and 
have it do all the work for you ;)</quote>. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) felt
this <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">also may open up licensing holes :)</quote>
Perry agreed - <quote who="Perry Lorier">but so does allowing multiple .c 
files in a gcc invocation :)</quote>.</p>

The next day</a> Perry said he had <quote who="Perry Lorier">been 
experimenting with my idea</quote>. It <quote who="Perry Lorier">needs 
some hand hacking at the moment - and I'm only doing c&lt;-&gt;c and no 
RPC inbetween - but proof-of-concept is functional :)</quote>.</p>
