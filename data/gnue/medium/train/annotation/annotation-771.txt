<p>Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">about the 
differences between german and american accounting.</quote> 
Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) said he did not know - 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">from what i understand american accounting 
serves a different purpose - read: austrian/german accounting is done mainly 
to satisfy the tax authority and to calculate the taxes to pay</quote>, whereas 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">us american accounting seems to me to 
replace what we have in german "controlling" or "kostenrechnung" as well 
i.e. it serves as a source of information for the management and/or the 
investors</quote>. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked if that meant 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">american accounting is just a kind of GuV ?
GuV = Gewinn &amp; Verlust Rechnung ( don't know the english 
equivalence)</quote>. <editorialize who="Peter Sullivan">"Profit and 
Loss calculation," as far as I can tell.</editorialize> Reinhard said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">i would believe us accounting does _more_ 
than german accounting - sometimes i also get the feeling that us accounting 
doesn't have the strict concept of systematic account numbers</quote>. 
Jan said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">hmmm, I thought german accounting would 
allready be kind of too much (especial for lasy students who have to understand 
it ;) )</quote>. Reinhard said that US accounting seemed to be more detailed
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">(at least that is my understanding) - 
they do "kostenstellen" and "kostenarten" and "kostentr&#228;ger" etc. all in 
accounting</quote> <editorialize who="Peter Sullivan">Cost accounting and/or 
management accounting?</editorialize> <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller"> as far 
as I can tell - although i could misunderstand that</quote>.</p>
