<topic>DCL</topic>

<p>Perry Lorier (Remosi) reported seeing the security problems in DCL, 
as previously discussed in 
<kcref startdate="06 Jul 2002 13:40:47 -0800" subject="[Gnue-announce] DCL 20020706 (stable) Released" />, 
mentioned at <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/">bugtraq</a>. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">in some ways 
dcl isnt even on real 'version' numbers so releasing it to bugtraq seems 
kind of odd - but there are people using it in production so its understandable 
i guess</quote>. He had found bugtraq <quote who="Derek Neighbors">really 
great to work with - provided samples of how to exploit - and gave us a month 
before releasing publicly so we could fix</quote>. Perry felt that 
<quote who="Perry Lorier">php is a b'stard of a thing to get secure</quote>. 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">it was a catch 22 - i wanted to notify 
all dcl users immediately BUT to do so 'overly' publicly would be remiss as no 
patch was available</quote>. Perry agreed - <quote who="Perry Lorier">you have 
to patch the hole first :) - and by the email it sounds like that there were 
serveral :)</quote> Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">well i did say in 
commit list and irc we were closing security holes - i just didnt specifically 
say what they were until i had committed the fix for each one. Then bundled when 
all were done and did full blow release to freshmeat, all announce lists and 
such and ulf gave us like a week after release to let the users patch - which 
i think was fair</quote>.</p>
