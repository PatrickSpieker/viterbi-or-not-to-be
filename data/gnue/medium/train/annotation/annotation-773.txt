<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Federico Heinz (perlhead) asked <quote who="Federico Heinz">Any pointer 
on where forms gets its fonts?</quote> He found <quote who="Federico Heinz">the 
font is hideously large. And the encoding is not ISO-8859-1, which sucks 
too.</quote> He noted that the gnue.conf had a setting to choose monospaced 
or proportional fonts, but the comment in the file stated 
<quote who="Federico Heinz"># Normally, default font style and size is used, 
according to the active theme - But it doesn't mention which "theme" we're 
talking about. It sure doesn't use my gtk theme's settings...</quote>
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">you probably wanna change 
pointSize=10 (or so) in your gnue.conf - somehow the default was increased and 
got passed us the last release</quote>. Federico pointed out that 
<quote who="Federico Heinz">gnue.conf says pointSize is for fixed with 
only...</quote> Jason said he <quote who="Jason Cater">didn't know forms worked 
properly w/o fixed width fonts - I haven't tested it that way</quote>. 
Federico reported <quote who="Federico Heinz">It worked for the size.</quote>
He felt <quote who="Federico Heinz">The comments in gnue.conf are misleading</quote> 
as they gave <quote who="Federico Heinz">the impression that the default is 
fixedWidthFont=0</quote>. Jason agreed and said <quote who="Jason Cater">/me 
will change that</quote>.</p>

<p>On the encoding, Federico reported that <quote who="Federico Heinz">the form 
I'm executing begins with "&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;"</quote> 
but <quote who="Federico Heinz">I get ciryllic characters instead of accented 
ones.</quote> He suspected <quote who="Federico Heinz">it's because forms is picking 
a font with the wrong encoding... but I can't find out which.</quote> He went off 
to check.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.17Jul2002">
Two days later</a>, Federico reported <quote who="Federico Heinz">by 
fiddling in the forms source, I fixed my encoding problem!</quote>
He had added ISO-8859-1 as an option to the widget.SetFont 
parameters - <quote who="Federico Heinz">It seems the problem is 
that wx (or the python wx bindings, or *something*) does not get the 
encoding right unless you force it.</quote> Arturas Kriukovas 
(Arturas) confirmed <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">about a 3 days ago 
this was fixed</quote> in CVS - <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">was 
added option in gnue.conf</quote>. Marcos Dione (StyXman) confirmed 
that Project papo was currently using its own forked CVS -
<quote who="Marcos Dione">I'll tell our cvsmaster to sync if he 
finds it suitable...</quote> The reason for the fork was 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">we are hacking some things we need into 
gnue, but we can't send patches yet because we hadn't give the 
copyright to gnu yet. So, we 'forked' till we cand send our 
'improvements' to the gnue's guys.</quote> Federico wondered 
whether there was a need for a further gnue.conf option - 
<quote who="Federico Heinz">The configuration file site.py has 
an "encoding" option, which would work pretty well for 
this.</quote>. Arturas pointed out that this 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">encoding option is for database</quote>, 
not the Forms client display.</p>
