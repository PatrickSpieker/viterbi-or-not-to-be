<p>Ariel Cal&#242; (ariel_) asked <quote who="Ariel Cal&#242;">who is 
maintaining gnuedtd?</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">me, sort of</quote>, adding 
<quote who="Jason Cater">patches are welcome</quote>. Ariel reported 
several bugs - <quote who="Ariel Cal&#242;">1) the nice boxes around the 
comments are not recognized by nsglms ( and other parsers i think) - 2) 
an entity that must be further referenced must be defined as &lt;!ENTITY % 
foo "bar"&gt; and not &lt;!ENTITY foo "bar"&gt; - 3) %true and %false are 
declared AFTER %boolean.</quote> Jason said he <quote who="Jason Cater">was 
wondering about #2 - as the sample dtd's I was learning from didn't have 
them - but other ones I saw later did have them</quote>. He committed 
some fixes. Ariel said that the first problem was not only affecting 
emacs but <quote who="Ariel Cal&#242;">also sabcmd</quote> - 
<quote who="Ariel Cal&#242;">when i run sabcmd with pgsql.xsl to get a 
.sql batch file it complaints about nested comments</quote>. He confirmed
that <quote who="Ariel Cal&#242;">changhing all the minuses with pluses 
will work.</quote>. He felt that compatability with emacs' XML mode was 
important, since <quote who="Ariel Cal&#242;">until we have a working 
designer for schemas the best way to write xml documents is using emacs.
and if you want from emacs all the nice features like inserting the elements 
semi-automatically you have to specify the DOCTYPE (i.e the dtd) in the xml 
(or gsd,gfd...) file</quote>.</p>
