<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">anyone 
here have manufacturing experience?</quote> He was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">seeing manufacturers that 
distribute/wholesale/retail as being an 'odd' animal - but one that 
is more and more common with mom and pops and the internet - ToyMan: 
is an example of that :) What im seeing packages lacking is they can 
do one or the other but not both - i.e. you can get ok cheaper 
manufacturing packages but they dont do any retail or 
more importanting shipping stuff - or you can get a quickbooks/peachtree 
for cheap that does retail ok but wont let you manage the manufacturing 
side. I see the 'inventory problem' and the 'shipping problem' as the 
two areas where gnue can kick arse fast.</quote> Stuart Quimby 
(ToyMan) agreed - <quote who="Stuart Quimby">something that hooked into 
my ecomm package and played nice would be excellent</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">What im wondering is should 
inventory be separate tables for manufacturing and distribution - i.e. 
have inventory tables for the the 'components' you use to manufacture
and inventory tables for the 'products' you sell or distribute</quote>.
Stuart did not <quote who="Stuart Quimby">see the need for that - inv 
is inv</quote>. Derek said this matched <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the 
quick talks i have had with others</quote>, but 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">for me im seeing some disconnect - 
im thinking you have inventory that use to 'build' - 
then you have an 'allocation' table that says you need xyz components 
to make product A</quote>. Stuart said he used a Bill of Materials 
(BOM) table <quote who="Stuart Quimby">for that - very simple structure
- highly self referential</quote>. He noted <quote who="Stuart Quimby">*any* 
package that has a bom will do that - it's just implemented badly, 
usually</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think i might 
see the light as to it being all one structure - its just a matter of the 
'allocation' table - that says what things in inventory are needed to make 
product A</quote>. Things could get more complicated if manufactured 
products were then used as the basis for other manufactured products. 
Stuart said that his own database handled this - 
<quote who="Stuart Quimby">it's *very* simple structure</quote> with 
<quote who="Stuart Quimby">just 3 fields, Assmemb, Part, Qty</quote> 
but <quote who="Stuart Quimby">you can handle *any* situation with 
that - an Assemb. can also be a Part - so that way you build up 
sub-assem</quote>.</p>
