<topic>Financials (Accounting)</topic>

<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if 
you are doing gnue in a print shop you might want to look at NOLA (or our 
current branch that is getting moded for re-entry) - as NOLA was designed 
for printshop accounting</quote> - although in fact their changes would 
likely make it less print-shop orientated and <quote who="Derek Neighbors">more 
generic</quote>. He felt <quote who="Derek Neighbors">accoutning is easy - 
its a debit or a credit - right or left column - and it should net to zero
- nice and easy - unless you are enron</quote>. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) 
felt <quote who="Daniel Baumann">accouting is boooooring</quote> 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) felt <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">enron had some 
creativity</quote>.</p>
