<topic>DCL</topic>

<p>Derek Neighbors (Derek) said there is a need to 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">'enhance' the deb's. People are 
having trouble with them :(. At least 5 people have made comments 
like</quote> "i did apt-get install dcl, now what the hell do i 
do?". Jeff Bailey (jbailey) planned it 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">perhaps this weekend</quote>. Derek 
offered that if Jeff had not got time to do config stuff, he 
could provide <quote who="Derek Neighbors">like a one paragraph 
post install instruction list and have the deb pop up that blue 
deb screen that says ... you need to to the following &lt;insert 
steps here&gt; you can find this list at 
/usr/share/docs/dcl/install.html or something, i.e. so during 
the install it points them somewhere to get more 
information</quote>.</p>
