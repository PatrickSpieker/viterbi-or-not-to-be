<p>It was asked what two-tier and three-tier meant. Christian Selig (lupo) 
said <quote who="Christian Selig">in two-tier mode, you have layout and 
software logic on the client side and the database on the server side - 
in three-tier, you have layout on the client, software logic stored in an 
application server and the database on a server - through an intelligent 
driver model, gnue is able to operate in both modes</quote> although, as 
of time of writing, 2-tier was the most advanced/usable. It was asked 
whether GNUe could be used for a customer and address database.
Christian said <quote who="Christian Selig">this is quite realistic - 
of course, right now you have to write the application for yourself, based 
on the gnue tools</quote>.</p>

<p>It was asked if GNUe supported custom widgets,
such as a calander/date selector. Christian noted that there was already 
- or would be - support for input masks, but further widgets could be 
written using python. Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">the team is trying to make it more plausible 
to 'easily' plug in new custom widgets - like 'search' boxes, date 
pickers</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) emphasised that 
<quote who="Jason Cater">custom widgets are *not encouraged - but will be 
supported at some point</quote>. Derek agreed - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">it puts you in a bad position of having a 
'custom' (read non supported) framework - what we generally ask is if there 
is somethign you do not see ask - i think in most cases there is sufficient 
comprimise made to get 'functionality' into the framework - that avoids the 
need for 'custom' components</quote>. Jason emphasised that 
<quote who="Jason Cater">GNUe is not a GUI framework... it's a data 
manipulation and reporting framework</quote> Derek said that GNUe 
encouraged people to ask <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the developers 'how 
can i do 'X' - and see if they can provide an answer by extending existing 
widgets. Sometimes the answer will be 'we have no intention to support X'
- in which case likely gnue isnt a good choice for the application at 
hand</quote>, emphasising <quote who="Derek Neighbors">gnue is not glade - 
it is specific to database productivity applications - /me wouldnt write a 
cdplayer, webbrowser or image editor with gnue framework :)</quote> 
Because GNUe chose <quote who="Derek Neighbors">to support a myriad of platforms 
from curses to gtk to qt to html to you name it - e limit ourselves to a much 
more concise 'widget' catalog</quote>. He felt that a customer/address 
database would be <quote who="Derek Neighbors">a 'no brainer' gnue type 
application i.e. its kind of thing gnue was made for</quote>. He thought 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">its reasonable for us to support 'calendar' date 
picker entry fields - /me notes we dont currently, but i think it would be 
feasible request</quote>.</p>

<p>He also suggested looking at GNUe Small Business, 
which already had contact manager functionality - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">that probably fits to a small degree the first 
part of the question in being a customer database - if not their style, 
certainly it provides a reference to how one can do a customer 
database</quote>.</p>
