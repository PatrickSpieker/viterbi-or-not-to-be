<p>Anil Prabhakar (anilp) asked whether it was possible 
<quote who="Anil Prabhakar">to get involved in the gnu enterprise 
development</quote> with a Windows2000 PC. The aswer was 
positive. He wanted to know more about 
the <quote who="Anil Prabhakar">development environment and the 
technologies used</quote> so Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) named 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">python as a main language</quote> 
listed the supported databases. Anil asked whether he needed 
anything else additional to the "GNUe-Tools-0.4.3-setup-debug-on.exe" 
download and the answer was "No".</p> 

<p>After installation Anil could not not understand "Editor for 
connection". This was called via Start Menu -&gt; Programs -&gt; 
GNUe -&gt; GNUe Connections. Arturas explained that 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">this is to define your connection 
to the database</quote>. Anil queried where he could 
<quote who="Anil Prabhakar"> find the db scripts to create the 
necessary schemas</quote>. Arturas explained that 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">you create database yourself, that 
is you use gnue forms to connect to your database and to work with 
already existing there data</quote>. He explained 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">if you know what you need, you can 
manually create base schema and then connect gnue to it, then work 
with data. Gnue is not the tool to create db schemas</quote>. Anil 
asked how to configure connection to a 
<quote who="Anil Prabhakar">database whose SID is say "testsid" and 
the host is say "testhost" and on port "1521"</quote>. Arturas said 
that <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">at first you'll have to give some 
name for this connection (Connection name). Then</quote> the database 
type went in the Provider field (). 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">Then you'll need host and port</quote>. 
Encoding field could be left empty and both rpc type and transport 
were only needed for appserver. To "Submit" the form it should be 
saved (although toolbar "Save" button said "Save the record to the 
db" and nothing seemed to happen when it was clicked).</p>

<p>There was a discussion about how to test the connection to an 
Oracle database (from designer) (try to open datasource editor, schema 
navigator). Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) said that as Anil was trying 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">the packaged win wersion, it didn't 
contain any drivers to Oracle</quote>, as these were not freely 
redistributable. Drivers could be downloaded from 
<a href="http://www.zope.org/Members/matt/dco2/">DCOracle at 
http://www.zope.org/Members/matt/dco2/</a> (url taken from 
gnue/common/README.databases).</p>
