<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>Ken MacLeod (bitsko) asked <quote who="Ken MacLeod">anyone know 
if there are any companies far enough along using GNUe that they'd be 
looking to hire GNUe developers?  how many core+tier developers currently 
work for solid GNUe users?</quote> Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">there are several companies interested 
in GNUe solutions where they might 'hire a consultant' or 'temp' gnue 
developer - we have at least two foreign countries that employee gnue 
developers</quote>. There were about 5 core GNUe developers doing
distribution, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">coding, documentation, 
relase, management etc - but there is a large second tier contributor 
level of probably about 20 that use and sumbit patches on a less frequent 
basis</quote>. Although <quote who="Derek Neighbors">people wont ask for 
GNUe by name</quote>, it could already meet many requirements 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">in the small/medium business market</quote>.
Ken agreed - <quote who="Ken MacLeod">exactly, but they may be 
looking for solutions</quote>.</p>
