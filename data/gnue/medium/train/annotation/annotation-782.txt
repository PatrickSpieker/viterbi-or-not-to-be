<p>Some problems were reported trying to set up the GNUe Tools from CVS. 
Jason Cater (jcater) asked <quote who="Jason Cater">are you using 
setup-cvs.py? or setup.py?</quote> He advised 
<quote who="Jason Cater">we haven't updated setup.py yet... that's 
on our list of things to do for the pending release</quote> He 
would <quote who="Jason Cater">recommend using setup-cvs.py when 
running from cvs</quote>. GNUe needed version 2.2 or higher of 
wxPython - <quote who="Jason Cater">you'll prefer 2.4 
though</quote>.</p>
