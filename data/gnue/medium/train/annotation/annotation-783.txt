<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>


<p>Peter Sullivan noted that some ERP salesmen liked to suggest 
"tricky" questions to ask their competitors, and 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">wondered what a GNU Enterprise 
equivalent might look like... Top Ten Questions to ask your 
proprietary ERP salesman</quote>, together with the answers
for GNU Enterprise.</p>

<quote who="Peter Sullivan">
<ol>
<li>I'm paying how much and I'm not allowed to know how it works?</li>
<li>Am I too small for your package?</li>
<li>What happens if my level of activity increases?</li>
<li>What standards do you support, and how are they licensed?</li>
<li>How does this work with the stuff I already have?</li>
<li>What level of support will I get?</li>
<li>What happens if I want to customise the package?</li>
<li>What happens if you go bust?</li>
<li>What happens if you get taken over?</li>
<li>What happens if we don't get on?</li>
<li>How often must I upgrade?</li>
</ol>

<p>Stan Klein added an extra question - <quote who="Stan Klein">
What happens if the needs of my business don't match the features of 
your software?</quote>. He gave an example where one major manufacturer
had reviewed an ERP package <quote who="Stan Klein">and found that 
the package was based on their principal competitor's way of doing 
business.</quote>. This would have lost them their major competative 
advantege of a more effective business process. Under the GNU Public 
License, you could amend GNUe to reflect your own business processes, 
and keep them private if desired.</p>

<p>Derek Neighbors said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">This is good 
stuff, hopefully some of it will make it into our marketing campaign
</quote>, and in the meantime he suggested adding it to the FAQ. Neil 
Tiffin said the FAQ was quite large already, but 
<quote who="Neil Tiffin">A separate doc would be great.</quote>
An HTML document would <quote who="Neil Tiffin">get indexed by the 
search engines</quote>, which was important.</p>
