<topic>Application Server</topic>


<p>Holger Schurig reported problems compiling the CVS version of GNUe 
Application Server. When running it, he was getting multiple 
errors for <quote who="Holger Schurig">Duplicate class name found
</quote>, and the load was aborting with too many errors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.06Jan2002">
On IRC</a>, Reinhard said that, at the moment 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">parts of the code use the old parser 
and parts use the new parser :( as i am in the middle of the transition
</quote> However, the parsers themselves were independant of each 
other. He explained <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">to <strong>start
</strong> geas you would only need the new parser but to do 
inserts/updates/selects etc. the info is taken from the old parser
</quote> as at the time of writing.</p>

<p>He explained that the old parser used a list of reserved words for 
each supported database to avoid conflicts. Since then, it had been 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">decided to prefix every column name for 
the database with the modulename and a double underscore.</quote> A 
by-product of this was that <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">because no 
reserved word of (IMHO) no db of the world contains a double 
underscore - we can be 100% sure that no column name of ours conflicts 
with a db reserved word</quote>. He added that 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">this is not yet done to keep 
compatibility with the old parser as long as some part of the code uses 
the old parser- but is already marked as TODO in the new parser code
</quote>. However, the old check on reserved words had already been 
removed in anticipation of this.</p>

<p>Holger Schurig (holsch) said this meant <quote who="Holger Schurig">
that the current CVS geas-server cannot be used, not even for 
"finding out what it is"</quote>. Reinhard said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">it should run with the old and the new 
parser in parallel</quote>. Reinhard and Holger did some work 
on tracking down the problem Holger was having, and discovered that 
Reinhard's setup worked with <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">GNU Bison 
version 1.25</quote>, but Holger's setup failed with 
<quote who="Holger Schurig">bison (GNU Bison) 1.30</quote>. It was 
also discovered that there was a <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">Duplicate 
class name found</quote>, as the "person" class was being 
defined twice in different modules. Reinhard felt this vindicated the 
decision to prefix column names with module names - 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">this problem is one of the main reasons 
i rewrote the parser</quote>. He also noted that 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">the old parser relies on undocumented 
behaviour of bison and appearently doesn't work under bison 1.30
</quote>.</p>
