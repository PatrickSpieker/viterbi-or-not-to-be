<p>Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) said <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">
i think it is better to be case insensitive in gcd files</quote>, 
saying <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">it doesn't make sense IMHO to 
define a symbol foo and another symbol FOO and have different meanings 
for them</quote>. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">I always hated case-insensative systems
</quote>, noting that <quote who="Daniel Baumann">C and C++ don't 
seem to bug me to much with their case sensativity ;)</quote></p>

<p>Later, Holger Schurig (holsch) said <quote who="Holger Schurig">
Basically I like Turbo-Pascal and Delphi and they are both case-
insensitive. But then again I hate to look at other's source codes 
because they uppercase</quote>. Neil Tiffin (neilt) was more emphatic
- <quote who="Neil Tiffin">i hate upper case</quote>, and added
<quote who="Neil Tiffin">in direct marketing all upper case is 15% 
harder to read</quote>. Holger said <quote who="Holger Schurig">
I used mixed case for vars and uppercase for keywords in Pascal, 
that way the keywords did stand out, even without a syntax-highlithing 
editor</quote>. Neil asked <quote who="Neil Tiffin">do 
non-syntax-highlighting editors exist today</quote>? He thought 
<quote who="Neil Tiffin">the poor programmers that use those must feel 
like they live in the 18th century :)</quote></p>
