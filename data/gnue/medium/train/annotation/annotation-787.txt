<p>Holger Schurig (holsch) asked if GNUe had considered creating 
variable types that included <quote who="Holger Schurig">not just the 
type "char(64)", but also how the label should be named, 
what lookup-table to use and so on. Whenever you use this variable 
type in a table or form, it would inherit this</quote>. Neil Tiffin 
(neilt) said <quote who="Neil Tiffin">we have that but forms designers 
have not warmed up to it - we treat it as a data element</quote>. 
Holger gave an example of what he meant - <quote who="Holger Schurig">
Basically the possibility to define lots of properties.</quote>. Neil 
said GNUe <quote who="Neil Tiffin">used a different 
structure</quote>. Holger said he would investigate further.</p>
