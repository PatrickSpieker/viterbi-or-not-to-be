<topic>Application Server</topic>


<mention>Reinhard M&#252;ller</mention>

<p>Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked about 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">replication an load balancing</quote> for 
GNUe Application Server (GEAS). Holger Schurig (holsch) said 
<quote who="Holger Schurig">load balancing is often done with 
transaction monitors ... even built in ones</quote>. Daniel explained 
that <quote who="Daniel Baumann">the dotGNU ppl want an application 
server but they were talking about writing it in C# to test out</quote>
their own complier. He said there was <quote who="Daniel Baumann">
<a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/esdd/articles/linux_clust/index.html?t=gr,p=AuthClusters">
a good link</a> about how IBM does load balancing with Open LDAP on 
the dotGNU developers list</quote>. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) said 
he wanted to get GEAS working first before thinking about load 
balancing! Holger said he had <quote who="Holger Schurig">seen a 
similar HA solution for SAP DB.</quote> He explained 
<quote who="Holger Schurig">It used NBD (Network Block Device) from 
linux to mirror the database and log of two computers and used also 
<a href="http://www.linux-ha.org">www.linux-ha.org</a>'s heartbeat 
for the take-over.</quote>.</p>
