<topic>Forms</topic>
<topic>Designer</topic>


<p>Christian Selig (sledge_) reported problems installing GNUe - 
<quote who="Christian Selig">the programs (forms, designer) tell 
me that i don't have the python xml libs, but i certainly have them.
</quote> James Thompson (jamest) asked <quote who="James Thompson">
do you have the python xml or the python SIG PyXML installed
- you need the PyXML one</quote>. Christian said he had 
<quote who="Christian Selig">installed the debian package for "
xml support for python 2.x"</quote>. James confirmed that was 
correct. Christian <quote who="Christian Selig">was running from CVS, 
but my last cvs update was about two weeks ago, haven't tried again 
since then</quote>. James asked <quote who="James Thompson">do you 
still have python 1.5.x installed?</quote> Christian said 
<quote who="Christian Selig">no, that was my first guess, 1.5.x 
interfering with 2.1; i have uninstalled 1.5.x - didn't help</quote>,
but he wondered if there might be <quote who="Christian Selig">
some environment variable that points to the old libraries?</quote>
James said he had had to remove python 1.5.x, and hadn't had any problems.
Christian said the setup.py had failed - he had fixed this, but only by
commenting out <quote who="Christian Selig">the "import"s of 
the xml libs</quote>. James suggested <quote who="James Thompson">
to install pyxml from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyxml">
source</a></quote>. Christian agreed - <quote who="Christian Selig">
that should be the easiest way - though i don't like it on a system 
with usually clever package management :-)</quote>. James was still 
bemused why he hadn't had problems with a very similar set-up. 
Christian said <quote who="Christian Selig">if i find the error, i'll 
drop a mail to the list(s)</quote>.</p>
