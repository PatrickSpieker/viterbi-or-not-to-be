<p>Christian Selig (sledge_) noted that <quote who="Christian Selig">
forms seems to be quite good in 2-tier, how well off is geas and 
designer?</quote>. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">geas is alpha state to be honest - 
we got an application server contributed by a company
and are in the process of adapting it to our needs</quote>. 
James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">designer 
works ok</quote> although <quote who="James Thompson">
our mouse support is alpha quality at best wrt dragging widgets 
arround</quote>. He confirmed that python was the preferred/only
scripting language so far - <quote who="James Thompson">
we've talked about support other languages inside triggers
but we've put no effort into making it happen</quote>. Christian
siad <quote who="Christian Selig">don't worry about other languages; 
it's better to have one language supported well than having a dozen 
unmaintained. but you already know that. :)</quote>. He wondered 
<quote who="Christian Selig">btw, why have you choosen corba over 
xmlrpc or soap?</quote>. James said that Jason Cater was working 
on GNU-RPC as part of GNUe Common <quote who="James Thompson">
which should (when done) allow you to plug in comm systems like 
you do database drivers</quote>, so GNUe could ultimately support
all three and more.</p>
