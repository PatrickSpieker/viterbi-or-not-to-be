<p>Derek Neighbors reported an attempted posting to the 
now-defunct GNUe EWOK mailing list asking 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">where or how to buy ewoks 
stuffed animals from the 1980s.</quote> EWOK had actually 
been <quote who="Derek Neighbors">enterprise wide office 
kommunication</quote>, which had been dropped in favour 
of working with GNU Comm/Bayonne. Nick Rusnov (nickr) 
asked <quote who="Nick Rusnov">is this supposed to be like 
jabber?</quote> Derek said it was a 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">generic protocol for phone 
type devices - specifically fax - though jabber could have 
been used too</quote>. He was looking forward to some more 
co-operation with GNU Comm/Bayonne soon, but nothing had 
been oficially agreed yet.</p>

<p>Derek also noted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
at one time we had gedi - gnu enterprise data interchange/
interface</quote>, but this had evolved into GNUe Integrator. 
Later, Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) lobbied for the 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">return of the gedi</quote>
- <quote who="Daniel Baumann">you guys had cool star 
wars-like names back in da day</quote>.</p>
