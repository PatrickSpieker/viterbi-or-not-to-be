<topic>Navigator</topic>
<topic>Forms</topic>
<topic>Designer</topic>


<p>Holger Schurig (holsch) asked <quote who="Holger Schurig">
Is there any means for calling other forms?</quote>. 
Derek Neighbors (derek) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
i know we are doing it in forms itself - but whether easy way 
to make it in gfd file im not so certain</quote>. Holger asked 
if there were any sample forms in CVS that demonstrated this.
Derek said no, but <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
i might have a personal one around here that does
- its a fairly simple python call</quote>. 
Holger asked if <quote who="Holger Schurig">
That means that basically you have to program menus on your own
</quote>? Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
currently what we have been doing is creating 'speed bars'
i.e. make a form that has buttons on it</quote> but 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we are starting to make real 
applicaitons now and MENUS are a MUST</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, James Thompson (jamest) also said <quote who="James Thompson">
we need a forms browser - I'm getting too many forms for users to 
remember names of them</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) asked
<quote who="Jason Cater">What do you think of the process idea we 
had <a href="http://lists.gnue.org/pipermail/gnue-discuss/2001-July/000211.html">
earlier</a></quote>? He could <quote who="Jason Cater">
I can get my guy inhouse to do a quick menu based on this xml markup
- it wouldn't be hard w/gnue-common</quote>. He needed 
<quote who="Jason Cater">something like this soon as well</quote>, 
as did Derek (dneighbo), who also referred to the earlier discussion.</p>

<p>Holger said <quote who="Holger Schurig">For small projects a static 
menu would be fine, but for a full-blown ERP you need some access 
restritions</quote> in <quote who="Holger Schurig">a database-driven menu
</quote>. Nick Rusnov (nickr) suggested GNUe could <quote who="Nick Rusnov">
have a cgi script that generates the list in the form of an xml file</quote>
dynamically for the Forms client. Holger though this would make 
<quote who="Holger Schurig">installation more and more cumbersome.</quote> 
He preferred <quote who="Holger Schurig">Having this inside the CORBA 
datastream</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason Cater suggested <quote who="Jason Cater">let's slow down a bit :)
I think the current plan of attach is having an XML process definition 
to send to the navigator/menuing system</quote>. This would eventually 
include Role Based Access Control, but to start with the XML files would 
need to be generated manually, or <quote who="Jason Cater">with designer 
when it supports it :)</quote> He confirmed the XML would be a fairly 
abstract list of forms, without physical mark-up - it would be up to the 
client to work out how to display it. Derek agreed - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we can get more complex as we go
</quote>.</p>

<p>Not much later, Jason Cater reported <quote who="Jason Cater">
first draft of GNUe Navigator is in cvs - currently wx only - it's 
butt-ugly, but functional :)</quote> Derek had a vision that  
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i could see this go from menu to 
supporting roles in a workflow like capacity to tying to a 'real' 
workflow engine - but for now its simply an application container 
to launch other forms and reports and such</quote>. He asked if 
it could be made to do actions other than just 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">calling runForm or runReport</quote>,
such as <quote who="Derek Neighbors">export data or import data or 
launch application x</quote>? Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">
right now it supports forms and reports but if you look at the XML 
markup, you can see that can be extended to other things</quote>.
