<p>Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) asked <quote who="Charles Rouzer">
anyone know if a working web Forms client will be included in 
next release?</quote> Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">probably not</quote>, as he wanted 
to do another <quote who="Derek Neighbors">release before the ui 
cleanup</quote>. This interim release would be 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">based on the things that have started 
to be added - masks/auth/navigation</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) 
said <quote who="Jason Cater">I think jamest and I are ready</quote>
but that masks would have to be excluded, as <quote who="Jason Cater">
to get them to work w/0.1.x will require a butt-load of hacks</quote>
Derek said he was confused, and had thought the next release would 
be from head, numbered 0.2.0 or 0.3.0. Jason said the next release 
would be 0.1.1 - <quote who="Jason Cater">we have been so busy fixing 
problems that we haven't make HEAD incompatable w/0.1</quote> yet. 
He added <quote who="Jason Cater">we'll rebranch as soon as we are 
ready to break head - which I'm ready now</quote>.</p>
