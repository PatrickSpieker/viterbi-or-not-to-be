<p>Leading on from 
<kcref startdate="10 Dec 2001 00:00:00 -0800" title="SAP database driver for GNUe" />,
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">has 
anyone here installed sap db?</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I've installed it, but not actually used it
</quote>. He added <quote who="Jason Cater">of course, if SAP R/3 can 
run on it, I suppose I can ;)</quote> Derek said he was thinking much 
the same. The licensing was a mixture of GNU Public License and GNU 
Lesser Public License, and it <quote who="Derek Neighbors">looks like 
they readily support php/python/C/C++</quote>. He felt that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">for some enterprises that are a little 
larger it might be easier to sell sap db over postgres - as there is a 
'company' behind it</quote>. He thought that GNUe should still prefer 
postgres, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">but i think it might be worth 
testing waters with sapdb</quote> as well.</p>
