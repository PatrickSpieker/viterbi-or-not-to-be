<p>Continuing 
<kcref startdate="11 Mar 2002 06:23:05 -0800" subject="Project Management Package?" />,
Mark Smith suggested that project resources could be assigned 
<quote who="Mark Smith">based on the Human Resources data, if you
are using that package also. HR data often includes the skills,
qualifications and experience that staff have.</quote> This could 
be extended to record outside contractors as well.</p>

<p>Gil Hauer agreed - <quote who="Gil Hauer">in fact I think that 
the project management package is very much an integration of other 
gnue packages: HR, accounting, dcl, etc.</quote>
He had used Open Plan from Welcom Software, which (although Windows 
only) <quote who="Gil Hauer">allowed the project manager to
assign skill to people/things in the resource pool. It also allowed the
project manager to assign a skill to a task rather than a person. During
the scheduling phase the project selected the 'best' candidate from the
pool that satisfied the skill. 'Best' generally meant 'the most
available' I think.</quote>.</p>

<p>Mark also noted that <quote who="Mark Smith">Part of the business of 
comparing estimates to actuals depends on getting the actual hours into the 
project management application, which I find isn't well catered for generally. 
It would be really good if there could be a 'Time and Expenses' module where
everyone can enter the hours worked each week on each task within a project.
</quote> He had <quote who="Mark Smith">been hearing the term 'Professional 
Services Automation' (PSA) used recently to describe this kind of integration 
of Project Management  and other applications, and it would certainly make 
life easier if it could be achieved.</quote>. Gil said 
<quote who="Gil Hauer">I think that this is where integration with DCL would 
happen -- activities in the project plan could be bound to work-order entries 
in DCL where engineers enter hours as well as completion information. I
don't know enough about DCL yet though.</quote></p>

<p>However, this was a weak spot with many existing Project Management
tools - <quote who="Gil Hauer">I'm stuck right now having to use MS Project 
in VMware under Linux 'cause it's the only solution</quote> and even that 
was not ideal. Ralph Mayer said Microsoft Project was 
<quote who="Ralph Mayer">some sort of an "unfinished" software. 
It can do a lot, but most of the real-world-problems can only be solved 
useing VB(A). Thats my problem, I am projektmanager, not a VBA-programmer 
:-)</quote> Rich Bodo said <quote who="Rich Bodo">I always use a spreadsheet.  
I have managed fairly complex projects in this manner.  Most MS tools appear 
to be designed by comittee.</quote></p>
