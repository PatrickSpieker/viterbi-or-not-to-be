<topic>DCL</topic>


<p>Harald Mayer (Harald1) asked <quote who="Harald Mayer">is 
anything decided about how the merge will be executed? 
will only the db-structure of dcl stay?</quote> Derek 
Neighbors (derek) said this was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
not fully decided - the first thing you will see is that dcl
is getting more external development - as of today some rbac 
stuff was submitted as a patch - while it might not be the 
long term direction it solves some important issues 
immediately - also in the cvs head branch you will notice 
GNUe Forms (non web screens) for DCL being checked in - the 
contact management portion will be much much more robust in 
next DCL - and probably even further extened into real CRM in 
the GNUe CRM stuff</quote>. If the database structure of DCL 
did have to change, then <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the 
upgrade path will handle</quote> any changes needed. As well 
as the GNUe Forms for DCL in CVS, he also had 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">some others too that arent in cvs 
that need cleaning up</quote> but which were in his home directory
on the GNUe webserver.</p>
