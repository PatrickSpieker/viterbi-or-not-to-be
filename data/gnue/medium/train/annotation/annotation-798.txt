<p>Talking further about the issues raised in 
<kcref startdate="12 Dec 2001 00:00:00 -0800" title="Electronic Business XML" />, 
Sacha Schlegel (SachaS) said that <quote who="Sacha Schlegel">the 
openebxml laboratory in sweden has about 5 "scientists" 
doing projects for and around it. The people have different projects.
They are placed between computer science and business. 
They want to realise business solutions with computer science help.</quote>
They wanted to model business processes using tools like UML, but also
<quote who="Sacha Schlegel">have executable models. so you model 
then "save" and "start".</quote>. Reinhard 
M&#252;ller (reinhard) thought a tool to convert UML to GNUe Application 
Server Class Definitions would be useful - 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">that's what we are planning anyway - at 
least it was my understanding - to have a "designer" for 
geas - that will work on a high level and save it into xml files and/or
database</quote>.</p>

<p>Sacha also mentioned <quote who="Sacha Schlegel">BPML 
<a href="www.bpml.org">Business Process Modelling Language</a></quote>.
This allowed you to <quote who="Sacha Schlegel">model the 
enterprise business. the next step is inter-enterprise business
and there you can model with ebXML (electronic business XML).
ebXML focues heavily on inter enterprise business, called collaborations.</quote>
However, <quote who="Sacha Schlegel">you need some kind of mapping</quote>
between the BPML models of the inside of enterprises and the ebXML models of the 
inter-relations between enterprises. He was still keen on doing some academic
research on some topic around ebXML or enterprise modelling.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.22Mar2002">
The next day</a>, Sacha explained 
<quote who="Sacha Schlegel">BPML is a meta language.
- basically a xml vocabulary for business processes.</quote> 
He wasn't sure what was meant by <quote who="Sacha Schlegel">a business process</quote>. 
Reinhard suggested <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">an algorithm for the business</quote>. 
Sacha said <quote who="Sacha Schlegel">so basically BPML has some tags which people can 
use to describe their business processes (as mentioned yesterday, mainly 
for enterprise business processes)</quote>. According to the specification, 
<quote who="Sacha Schlegel">A process is a specific ordering of work 
activities across time and place, with a beginning, an end, and clearly 
defined inputs and outputs</quote>. He noted <quote who="Sacha Schlegel">
the main entities of the BPML vocabulary are: - messages, - 
participants, - activites, - rules, -transactions and - processes.</quote>
However, <quote who="Sacha Schlegel">I guess there is no software out there yet which 
"simply" parses it and executes it and voila you have a system which 
handles your processes.</quote> Maybe GNUe would end up as such a system.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.27Mar2002">
Some days later</a>, Sacha apologised for saying in his paper that 
<quote who="Sacha Schlegal">there is so much missing</quote> from GNUe at 
time of writing. Derek thought that was fair comment, but rather than 
say <quote who="Derek Neighbors">its like a car with out a motor -
it should read its like a motor w/o a car</quote>. He said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">I really really want to get some gnue 
apps out the door -  even if they are not the 'official' n-tier spec.</quote>
He posted a link to Sacha's article on the GNUe website -
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">its actually a pretty darn good little 
research paper - i recommend reading it if you are interested in such 
glamorous and exciting things as electronic business :)</quote>.</p>
