<topic>DCL</topic>


<mention>Harald Meyer</mention>

<p>Harald Meyer (Harald1) pointed out that the BUGS file was out of date. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said that DCL was now the preferred method of 
recording bugs for the GNUe project - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">soon 
the bugs file should be generated from there - 
until then consider the bugs file out of date :)</quote>. 
There was a guest account 
<a href="https://dcl.sourceforge.net/dclgw/">on the DCL server</a>, 
but it was read-only. Soon there would be a gateway so that e-mails 
sent to the bugs@gnuenterprise.org address would automatically 
raise a job in DCL. People who intended being active bug loggers 
could contact Derek for a 'personal' DCL username and password.</p>
