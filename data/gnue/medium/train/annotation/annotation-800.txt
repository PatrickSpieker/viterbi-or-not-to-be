<topic>Forms</topic>


<p>Linas Vepstas (linas) asked <quote who="Linas Vepstas">anyone 
here discussing how to use glade to hook up to gnue forms?</quote>
James Thompson (jamest) said that the first version of GNUe Forms 
<quote who="James Thompson">was to base on glade code which was a mistake - 
they have different targets</quote>. Linas said he realised 
<quote who="Linas Vepstas">glade won't run on win or mac, that is not my 
concern.</quote>. With a bit of care, the XML definitions for GNUe 
Forms could also be compatible with Glade. James asked 
<quote who="James Thompson">so glade would draw the form and 
gfclient would run it, is that what you are saying?</quote> 
He didn't see what this would gain. Linas said <quote who="Linas Vepstas">I've 
got to develop a pretty looking glade app; its gotta be pretty or they'll
make me code in VB. Ughh.  I'm using glade and some custom gtk widgets.
Its mostly data-driven: which means most of it is gnue-forms-like - 
so I'm scratching my head: what's the easiest way from here to there?
I could do it from scratch, I could enhance gnue-forms, I could try 
bond/bonddb</quote>. He said <quote who="Linas Vepstas">every 
half hour I change my mind. The from-scartch approach is to 
hack some xml that hooks up odbc table.fields to libglade widget 
names.  Should be easy, but ... but it leaves me cold for a 
long-term strategy (reports, etc.)</quote>. He needed to be able to 
support a <quote who="Linas Vepstas">mxiture of buttons, menus, 
radio/select, text areas with padding and glitz</quote>. He 
<quote who="Linas Vepstas">also have some custom scrolling 
strip-chart widgets and a satellite photo map underlay</quote> 
which he already had working, but <quote who="Linas Vepstas">now 
I have to hook up a bunch of forms to a database thats the 
easy/hard part - easy but tedious; alternately, hard if I try 
to merge into gnue :-(</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">linas 
glade support is a WASTE - if you want glade use glade - 
our designer IMHO is superior to glade at this point and cross platform. 
i assume your "issues" are either a. lack  of 'cool' widget support
or b. you desire native gtk. If you want (a) forms really isnt too 
interested in that, i suggest just using glade. If you desire native gtk
simply write a UIgtk.py file. I personally see glade as having nothing
to do with forms</quote>. James suggested <quote who="James Thompson">you 
may want to see about mixing and matching, using forms where it 
saves you time - as designer wizards make that part so easy - 
but dropping to glade where you need the glitz</quote>. 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">a year ago, someone could 
convince me that perhaps glade could be retrofited to be our designer - 
but honestly now our designer is there and it 'rocks'(tm)
so i cant see going backwards :)</quote>. He continued 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if you just want easy databinding in glade - 
fsthere are lots of projects that are doing databinding for glade - 
gnome-db being one of them</quote>. James said 
<quote who="James Thompson">it may be possible to extend the forms client 
to do more ie: support widget plugins, but that's going to take work :)</quote>. 
Derek said, based on previous discussions, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
making gnue MORE complex isnt our goal :)</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, James confirmed <quote who="James Thompson">we 
constantly have to defend keeping the gfd simple :)</quote> 
Linas said he had had similar issues keeping gnucash under 
control - <quote who="Linas Vepstas">its weird, you want to 
encourage contributors, so you don't want to piss people off, 
but its hard to say "don't implement that its a bad 
idea" without pissing them off - or accidentally specing 
something thats too grandioise for them to implement.</quote> 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">im all for contributions - 
im just saying what you are proposing doesnt make a lot of sense
as iirc glade has some databinding capablities or so i hear</quote>. 
However, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">it is of course gpl software 
and you can do as you like - and we would support you in it unless 
it was really whacked :)</quote></p>
