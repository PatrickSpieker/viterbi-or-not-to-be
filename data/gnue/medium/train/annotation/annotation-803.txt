<p>Further to 
<kcref startdate="19 Mar 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="GNUe Application Server version 2 update" />,
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said he was working on some proposals
for the GNUe Application Server API. Later, Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) 
supported this, but added <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">please make sure 
we all know what you are talking about</quote> - the API between what and 
what. He said the <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">final documentation will 
be separated by the intended reader -  an API doc (for the front end) - 
and an internal "hacker's guide"</quote>.</p>
