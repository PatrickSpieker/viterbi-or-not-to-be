<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) said that the <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">tools 
(forms, designer) are useful enough for 2-tier mode</quote>. 
You could <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">use designer and then customize them 
without strong XML knowledge</quote>. The <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">modules 
(like accounting, ...) are not ready</quote>, apart from DCL - 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">they were designed to be used with application 
server and now application server is in rewrite stage</quote>. 
Peter Sullivan (psu) said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">The team are all 
volunteers at the moment, so we work w/o deadlines - 
as no-one can tell how much time they will have</quote>. 
He said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">you can certainly use the GNUe tools 
in 2-tier to write apps yourself - If you're looking for 
"shrink-wrap" install and go Financials, HR, etc
we're not there yet and to be honest we need to get the n-tier tools 
written &amp; working before we start there.</quote> Dmitry noted that Forms 
and Designer were available as a <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">bynary snapshot 
for MS (it is single .exe to get forms working)</quote>. Peter said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">the official release is a few months old, you can 
either use that - or the nightly CVS snapshots</quote>. For the server end, 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">for the database back-end, use your choice of 
database - for the app-server backend, we have an Application Server that a 
company kindly contributed - but which needs an extensive re-write which is 
just starting. On databases, we currently support loads of free and non-free 
choices - including ODBC (i.e. pretty much anything that has an ODBC 
driver)</quote>. He noted that <quote who="Peter Sullivan">Even today, 2-tier 
is a good framework for those sorts of little projects that you start in MS 
Access before you realise you actually need something bigger ;-)</quote>.</p>

<p>He confirmed <quote who="Peter Sullivan">we are looking at providing 
mutliple client access, including HTML - there was a guy working on a 
<kcref startdate="18 Jan 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="HTML Client for GNUe Forms">pure 
HTML client</kcref> - 
not sure where that got to we also had someone working on 
<kcref startdate="13 Feb 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="PHP client for GNUe Forms">a PHP 
client</kcref> - which I think made more preogress</quote>. 
However, <quote who="Peter Sullivan">In practice, I would expect that using 
complicated forms via web would be quite painful - so power-users would 
probably always want to use a proper Forms client - but for occasional users, 
web is probably fine. Some of our project team are big web-application haters - 
but if you look at DCL, that is exclusively web-based at the moment -
so go figure ;-)</quote></p>

<p>Later, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">currently 
we have a framework but not the 'shrink wrap' applications - so you could 
download and install the framework to use with postgres in probably under 4 hours - 
on debian if you are experienced linux user w/ postgres running probably take you 
about 10 minutes</quote>. Although several organisations were using GNUe 
'in production,' this was by using <quote who="Derek Neighbors">paid consultants or 
in house staff to write the applicatiosn with the framework as 'custom' 
applications</quote>. As of time of writing, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if 
you just want a 'ledger' you might be able to use gnucash or sqlledger - 
if you want more than that i think gnue is right for you if you are willing to 
put some work into building what you need</quote>. He said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we are looking for people willing to build/use 
applications :) -  the problem is we ahve limited people resources - 
and most of the resources are making the tools better - 
if they stop to build official applications the tools suffer - 
so we are rough spot - more hands help :) - in fact people that are less 
engineer and more consulting type are what we need most :)</quote>. 
He regretted having to keep pointing interested people to other projects -
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i really dont want to point you there would 
MUCH rather have you use gnue - but if it fits your needs better so be it 
:(</quote>. He was considering building a GNUe front-end to the sql-ledger 
database structures</p>

<p>Peter said that <quote who="Peter Sullivan">the class defintions for GL 
were fairly simple - could easily be written as normal SQL tables - 
question is - do we want a 2-tier GL at this point?
or does it simply divert us from geas?</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">its a toss up - 
i for example would say you and i probably really arent really hot on 
tuning up GEAS - as its not our 'domain'</quote>, so they might as 
well work on 2-tier applications meanwhile. However, Peter said the
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">problem to me is that a 2-tier gl doesn't 
go anywhere - as we scrap it the day we have geas v2 - &amp;
a gl w/o ap, ar etc</quote> was probably only of limited use.</p>
