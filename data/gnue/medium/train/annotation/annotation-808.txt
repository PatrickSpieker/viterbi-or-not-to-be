John Lenton (Chipaca) said his team had been working on an 
Entity Relationship Diagram for their project, and offered to send it 
via DCC, although it was a work in progress at the moment. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">go 
ahead and send when more complete - glad to see you stopping by - 
was worried you decided gnue wasnt right tool for the job</quote>. 
John said <quote who="John Lenton">it is, or it will be, we're not sure on 
that yet :) - if what you advertise on www.gnue.org were correct, we'd be out 
of a job :)</quote> Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i just 
encourage you to remember if it doesnt fit exactly -  with a little work it 
probably could :)</quote></p>

<p>He was thinking <quote who="Derek Neighbors">of doing a promotional - 
free tacos for every gnue commit that gets approved on 'developer days'</quote>, 
based on some other projects. The reward <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
would be 'locale' based</quote>, but he was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
not sure how we can stream the donuts</quote>. John suggested 
<quote who="John Lenton">you marshall them into XML, of course - 
that'll be the first GUI DTD</quote>. Derek liked the sound of this.
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">I love all food</quote>.
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the only kind of food i dont like - 
is the kind thats not in front of me</quote>.</p>
