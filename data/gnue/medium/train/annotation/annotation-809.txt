<p>After the sucess of the poll mentioned in 
<kcref startdate="06 Feb 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="Polls for web site" />,
Derek Neighbors asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">actually anyone 
have an idea for a new poll?</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) suggested 
<quote who="Jason Cater">how about "What primary reporting 
solution does your business use?"</quote>, and gave some possible 
answers. Peter Sullivan (psu) added a few more. Peter and Jason wondered 
about adding a ficticious package at the end such as 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">OLAP-u-like</quote> or 
<quote who="Jason Cater">EZ-OLAP :)</quote>. Peter suggested 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">sorta like the CowboyNeal option on 
<a href="http://www.slashdot.org">/.</a> polls</quote>. Later, Derek 
reported <quote who="Derek Neighbors">new poll is up</quote>.</p>
