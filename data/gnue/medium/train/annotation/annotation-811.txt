<p>Jason Spence said that Bayonne, the GNU telephony project, needed 
<quote who="Jason Spence">a package to do workflow management</quote>, 
He was busy at the moment with other coding, but was reading GNUe code 
<quote who="Jason Spence">in preparation for the day when I can spend 
some sponsored time working towards using GNUe</quote> for workflow.</p>

<p>He noted that Open Office used XML as its file format, and 
wondered about writing <quote who="Jason Spence">a OpenOffice
forms to GNUe forms translator - as I understand it, both are XML
based. That would allow people to easily get a chance to migrate to
GNUe if they've already used Star/OpenOffice to create database 
apps.</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason also asked <quote who="Jason Spence">what's the status of the 
Bayonne Forms client?</quote> 
David Sugar said he had <quote who="David Sugar">been doing a lot of 
recent work on the Bayonne XML transcoding system.  If it's an XML 
document, it should be possible to create a transcoder for Bayonne 
to directly parse a gnue form :).  This actually 
was why we choose transcoding rather than implementing a specific xml 
parser.</quote>.</p>
