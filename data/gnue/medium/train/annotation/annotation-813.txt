<p>Jan Ischebeck (siesel) looked at the XSLT scripts available 
in DCL for converting XML database definitions into database
creation scripts for specific databases, as referred to in 
<kcref archive="http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue/2002-Jun/003127.html" subject="Contact, Event, and Workshop Managers" />
and 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 13 Jun 2002" title="Converting applications to GNUe" />, 
and felt this could be used to create the default database tables
for the GNUe Application Server. He asked where these should be 
placed in GNUe's CVS. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked Jan to  
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">check in the .xml file as well as the 
processed .sql files (so we dont make xslt processing a requirement 
for cvs users) yet :)</quote>. HE personally would like to 
restructure CVS to <quote who="Derek Neighbors">move samples and 
things like this out as well as docs of the modules - but thats a 
major undertaking and we certainly dont all feel that way :)</quote> 
Jan asked whether the DCL code had been assigned to the Free 
Software Foundation - <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">i.e. can I directly 
copy it</quote> into GNUe's CVS.</p>

The next day</a>, 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) and Stuart Bain (stbain) were 
trying out some other GPL-ed finance packages to look at the 
database schemas. Derek did not have Oracle, so talked Stuart 
through extracting the schemas in the XML format.
Derek noted that Jan was moving the code that used this 
from the DCL CVS into GNUe Common (GNU-RPC). 
Jan said he had not done so yet, as he was not sure where it 
should go. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">basically 
we have the python script that wraps the xslt processor (though 
any xslt processor could be used)</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek gave an example of what a standard SQL CREATE TABLE 
statement would look like in the XML format. As well as being 
a quick way of supporting multiple databases, it also produced 
excellent schema documentation - he 
<a hef="http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/fsf/datadictionary.html">pointed</a> 
to a sample. Instead of converting to XML manually, he was hoping 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">to use gnue common and its 
introspection and have it auto create XML</quote>.
Stuart posted some sample CREATE TABLE statments in 
MySQL and Oracle formats.</p>
