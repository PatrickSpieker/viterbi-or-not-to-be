<topic>Designer</topic>
<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Andrew Mitchell (gnukiwi) and Stuart Bain (stbain) did some testing of 
the *.exe versions of the 0.3.0 releases on Microsoft Windows. 
Jason Cater (jcater) confimed there was not a common 0.3.0 exe, as it 
was <quote who="Jason Cater">included in designer.exe and forms.exe</quote>. 
Stuart reported that Designer <quote who="Stuart Bain">likes to save me the 
trouble of closing designer whenever I</quote> tried to select a connection. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) suggested running Designer from the command line 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">and pass it --debug-level=10</quote> to see 
what the error message was. Jason asked <quote who="Jason Cater">are you sure 
it's a valid connections.conf entry?</quote> Derek said that Stuart's 
connections.conf <quote who="Derek Neighbors">seemed somewhat sane - 
but regardless even with a hosed connections.conf it shouldnt just crash 
:)</quote> Stuart reported that the error message was 
<quote who="Stuart Bain">Could not load MySQLdb</quote> - he had 
<quote who="Stuart Bain">tried it with both 'localhost' and the IP 
address</quote>. Jason said that the Windows executables should have support
for <quote who="Jason Cater">odbc, mysql, pypgsql</quote> compiled in.</p>

<p>Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">fwiw we have had lots o issues with 
mysql driver</quote>. Stuart suggested trying the ODBC driver in the meantime.
Andrew reported that <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">mysql odbc driver has 
issues on current debian</quote>. Jason noted that the README for the 
ODBC driver, <quote who="Jason Cater">written by Marc-Andr&#233; Lemburg</quote> 
advised that <quote who="Jason Cater">1. This driver has not been fully 
tested.  If you are successfully using this driver, please let us know.
2. This driver does not yet support schema introspection, so you will not
be able to use Wizards in GNUe Designer.</quote> Stuart confirmed 
<quote who="Stuart Bain">you're right... no Wizards</quote>. Andrew 
asked <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">so who's going to add introspection 
support to the ODBC driver then?</quote>. However, standard ODBC did not 
support introspection at all, and Jason said that <quote who="Jason Cater">the 
underlying odbc driver (C driver)</quote> that was being used 
<quote who="Jason Cater">doesn't support the ODBC extensions</quote> to 
support introspection - <quote who="Jason Cater">so until someone sends them 
a patch, not much we can do :)</quote> This might be a good project for 
any fans of C who had been put off contributing to GNUe by its python-based 
culture.</p>

<p>Stuart said <quote who="Stuart Bain">I Think I may see the 
problem</quote> - he had python already installed, 
<quote who="Stuart Bain">and it looks like it's picking up the Python in 
c:\Python21 and trying to use the MySQL driver from there</quote>. 
Jason said that the <quote who="Jason Cater">McMillan installer should pickup 
our drivers before searching the python path</quote>. Stuart said he had
<quote who="Stuart Bain">no PYTHONPATH set - but I'm betting there are 
some registry entries</quote>. Andrew reported <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">the 
same 'Cannot load MySQLdb' error - and this is on a clean box, no other python 
stuff installed</quote>. Stuart wondered if <quote who="Stuart Bain">py2exe 
embedded that path somehow</quote> as <quote who="Stuart Bain">it's 
referencing libraries in c:\python21\gnue\ that I uninstalled before I 
downloaded the .exe installers today</quote>.</p>

<p>Stuart said that the ODBC drivers were working fine, but Designer 
without introspection was a bit pointless. Derek said that the 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">other option is to install from source - 
please remember these are developer releases and none of the developers 
use windows - we put up preleases and begged people to test - you just 
happen to be one of the first to test mysql on windows for 0.3.0 
:)</quote></p>

<p>Stuart reported that <quote who="Stuart Bain">I can't 
even edit the properties of any widgets</quote>. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i believe that is a wxwindows scrollbox 
issue - if you move the property editor to upper left of your screen
then make it large enough that all scrollbars disappear - 
i will bet you can edit properties</quote>. He noted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">this behavior is pretty erratic
and so its hard for us to submit bugs to wx on it i.e. we are trying ot 
isolate to see if its us being stupid or real bugs in wx - fwiw: windows 
and certain themes in linux seem to make it more consistent :)</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.25Jun2002">
The next day</a>, Andrew reported the same problem -
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">none of the text widgets seem editable, so i 
can't change labels, names, etc :) - (this only on winXP, on a decent OS it 
works fine)</quote>. Derek siad <quote who="Derek Neighbors">take your property 
editor - move it to upper left corner of your desktop - then make it big enough 
that all scrollbars disappear</quote>. He added <quote who="Derek Neighbors">even 
decent OS's see this problem though not as consistently as windoze</quote>. 
Andrew reported <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">it fixed that part of it, but the 
entry widgets down the bottom of the main screen still don't like me</quote>. 
Derek said that most items in this section could be edited graphically 
rather than having to type in the properties box - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">its far from perfect, but once you learn the 
quirks it can make you pretty darn productive :)</quote></p>
