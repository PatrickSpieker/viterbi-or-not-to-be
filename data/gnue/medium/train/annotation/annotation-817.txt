<p>Calum Morrell (drochaid) asked <quote who="Calum Morrell">what's 
the fast way to populate a drop-down box with entries from a table 
different to the one the block the box is on is attached to?</quote> 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i would 
say look at a sample BUT i think jcater took my suggestion and 
changed how dropdowns work :)</quote> Derek explained the basic 
scenario, with bar having foo as a foreign key. You needed to 
add the foo look-up table as an additional datasource for the form. 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">Then go to tableBar.fooid entry
and open up property inspector change its type(style) to dropdown
then go up to foreign key seciont. In foreign key data source put 
name of datasource you just made - in lookup/key put fooid - 
in fk description put foodesc</quote>. This was new functionality
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">as lookups used to only have two fields 
not three</quote> - it had been added since the 0.3.0 releases, but 
CVS had it. You also needed to set prequery="true" on the new 
foreign key datasource to ensure that the look-up was 
automatically populated whenever the form was opened.</p>
