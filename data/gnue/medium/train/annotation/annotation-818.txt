<p>John Lenton (Chipaca) said <quote who="John Lenton">we're needing 
a datasource that accesses multiple tables</quote> and asked how to 
do that. This was <quote who="John Lenton">a 1:1</quote> rather than 
a master-detail or foreign key lookup, both of which were already 
supported. Jason Cater (jcater) suggested two possible syntaxes, 
using a &lt;datasource type="join"&gt; tag. Marcos Dione (StyXman) said 
he had thought of something similar to Jason's first suggestion. 
John said that the type="join" was probably unecessary as 
<quote who="John Lenton">because the name ("table1,table2") is easily 
reckognizable</quote> as a join. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) 
suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">why not do this in the db?
why not make a 'view' or such</quote>? Jason said that 
<quote who="Jason Cater">to do a view each time is a biotch</quote>, 
and Marcos pointed out that not all databases supported them. 
Derek conceeded this, but said he was not keen on the proposed 
syntax. Jason said he was <quote who="Jason Cater">trying to think 
of a better way and can't - using conditions makes sense to me, though
- as sometimes the joins can be complex</quote>. He wanted to 
avoid creating a &lt;table&gt; tag, as this might be needed as a 
reserved word elsewhere. John suggested keeping it simple to start 
with, and dealing with complications like inner and outer joins later. 
Jason agreed - <quote who="Jason Cater">that's been our approach in the 
past :) get something working - then make it "proper" later on 
:)</quote> Everybody started throwing parties (or other objects) to 
celebrate.</p>
