<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>It was asked if a drop-down box could contain two columns from the 
foreign key table - it could already show the foreign key description but
populate the foreign key value. Derek Neighbors (dneigho) said this 
had been discussed, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">but i dont think we ever 
implemented it</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said this would be 
<quote who="Jason Cater">not hard at all - shall I hack it up 
quickly?</quote> The <quote who="Jason Cater">only problem is, not sure 
if wx supports multicolumn combos - so I would have to concatenate 
them</quote>. He would check the wx documentation. Derek raised this as 
a work order in DCL. Not very much later, Jason reported 
<quote who="Jason Cater">if anyone wants to test - Work Order 73 is 
done</quote>. He have an example of how it could be used to list both 
U.S. state code and description in a drop-down box.</p>
