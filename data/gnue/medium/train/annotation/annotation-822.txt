<p>Stuart Bain (stbain) said he had <quote who="Stuart Bain">just talked 
my customer into giving 
<a href="http://www.nola.noguska.com/main.html">Nola</a> 
a whirl - his accounting firm is trying to 
sell him on Great Pains</quote>. <editorialize who="Peter Sullivan">I 
<strong>think</strong> that's a typo, but have left it in just in 
case.</editorialize> Stuart asked if anyone was using NOLA 
<quote who="Stuart Bain">in a production environment right now?</quote> 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said he might be able to find out - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">they are highly specialized vertical industry 
shop (speciallying in print shops) - so im certain a few of their printshop 
clients are using it</quote>.</p>

<p>He said he had changed his opinion of NOLA - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think they get it without getting it</quote>. 
They <quote who="Derek Neighbors">are not boned up on free software, lingo 
liguistics and the such</quote> but had found that releasing NOLA under the 
GNU Public License made sound business sense for them - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">accounting isnt their main 'package' - 
so to cover their arse they GPL'ed it, hoping others would help maintain 
it and keep it going for them</quote>. In fact, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">when 
i told them i was adding fund accounting the response was - hey a lot of 
people ask for that, can we send them to you</quote>. They had also said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">that NOLA was their free product so it got 
least of their 'developer' attention - so it would be a week or so until 
they could review the patches</quote>, which he thought was still fairly 
speedy!</p>

<p>He thought that Noguska had developed NOLA because they had been 
asked by their print shop customers <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if they 
had accounting</quote> and rather than do a <quote who="Derek Neighbors">deal 
with other vendors (quickbooks and such) interfacing to their real 
products</quote> they had <quote who="Derek Neighbors">figured lets whip 
together somethign and basically give it to customers in hopes 
we dont have to jerk around with someone elses software</quote>.</p>
