 <topic>Forms</topic>

<p>James Thompson (jamest) was trying to query back 
<quote who="James Thompson">incoming fax images that are not assigned to 
a customer</quote> (i.e. had a NULL customer ID), but could not get this 
to work properly <quote who="James Thompson">as the conditions rightfully filter 
that out - i don't want to change that behaviour as I use it to make several 
forms look like they're pulling from different tables though they are 
not</quote>. He wondered about using <quote who="James Thompson">a 
on-startup trigger</quote> to resolve his current problem, 
<quote who="James Thompson">but I don't know how i'd pass in the 
NULL</quote> value to the trigger. Jason Cater (jcater) came up with
<quote who="Jason Cater">some hackerish ways to do it</quote>, giving 
some sample code using the parameters dictionary, but added 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I don't consider it "good form" though</quote>. 
James was more impressed - <quote who="James Thompson">that's worth 
implementing just as a sample :) - as it's evil and something I'd not have 
thought about</quote> it, as he <quote who="James Thompson">associates the 
parameters dict w/ dialogs not the master form</quote>. Jason said parameters 
had never been intended for use with <quote who="Jason Cater">dialogs - though 
they've become a nice fit</quote>.</p>

<p>James asked <quote who="James Thompson">how do I use the parameters at the 
main form level - do I need to set catchNull</quote>? Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">iirc there's a form-level setParameter</quote>. 
James knew this, but meant with respect to initialisation. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I think you have to add a &lt;parameters&gt; 
section - that defines the parameter - if so, there you can set a 
"default"</quote>. James asked if this was documented in the developer's 
guide. Jason said it should be once he had finished it.</p>
