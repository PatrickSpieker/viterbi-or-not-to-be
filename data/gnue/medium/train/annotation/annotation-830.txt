<topic>Designer</topic>

<p>Jason Cater (jcater) asked <quote who="Jason Cater">what is that 
webform wizard that was added yesterday? on the surface, that seems 
quite counter to our goals of a ui-independent form definition</quote>.
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) explained <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">Its a short 
time solution to create html + javascript code out of a gnue-forms 
definition. In normal cases that code could/should be generated on 
the fly by an cgi script. At the moment it is more like a "compile" step. 
/me is planning to give the administrator the choice of doing the parsing 
of the gfd file 1. on the fly (by a cgi script) 2. direktly after a changing 
the gfd files 3. by the javascript client itself.</quote> James Thompson 
(jamest) asked <quote who="James Thompson">should a quick hack be part 
of designer?  or a seperate script altogther</quote> - 
<quote who="James Thompson">it sounds like it works nothing like the other 
wizards</quote>. Jan explained that <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">the reason 
for adding it to designer was, that its much more difficult to write a 
seperate script than writing a wizard</quote> - <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">In 
its form its  a bit similar to the "create Schema" Wizard, which is 
disabled</quote> as of time of writing <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">because 
of schema definition changes, I think.</quote> Later, he said he had 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">changed the name to "Compile for jsForms" and 
the entry in the menu to "Extras|Compile Form for GNUe JsForms' - hope 
that makes it more clear</quote>.</p>
