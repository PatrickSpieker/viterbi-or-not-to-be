<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>A problem was reported with using the wx user interface 
in GNUe Forms - when using unicode characters, such as 
Greek, they would display fine when entered, but would 
not save. Johannes Vetter (johannesV) asked 
<quote who="Johannes Vetter">ah, so 
after jumping to the next field the text disapears ? - i've 
already sent a bug report to the wx mailing list yesterday 
evening</quote>. He explained <quote who="Johannes Vetter">all 
unicode-characters generate a wx.EVT_TEXT event (containing a 
proper unicode-string) - gnue-forms has to process the wx.EVT_CHAR 
event (to make use of it's display-handlers) - and that wx.EVT_CHAR 
event returns a *wrong* unicode-character</quote>. He noted that 
<quote who="Johannes Vetter">2.6.2.1 is broken anyway 
(dropdowns)</quote>, as discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 16 Mar 2006" title="wx 2.6 and Microsoft Windows version of Forms" />, 
and suggested <quote who="Johannes Vetter">have you tried using 
2.6.1</quote> in the meantime.</p>
