<p>Johannes Vetter (johannesV) had <quote who="Johannes Vetter">experimented 
with wx.EVT_MOUSWHEEL ... it could be quite easy to fire previous-/nextRecord 
events as a result of a wheel-event</quote>. But the problem was 
<quote who="Johannes Vetter">how to determine the block which needs to be 
scrolled - we could bind such an event to each GFEntry, so one could use the 
wheel to scroll the corresponding block of each control (without havin a 
scrollbar)</quote>. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) thought 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">we should have that in 0.6 when we have layout 
management - and we can define which vbox/hbox would be bound to a block 
regarding mouse wheel events</quote>.</p>
