<p>Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) said he would have preferred it if the 
TinyERP project <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">had approached us for 
cooperation, but they didn't - and now we both are in a project state 
where it's not easy to cooperate much any more</quote>. Derek 
Neighbors (derek) <quote who="Derek Neighbors">believe i contacted tiny 
erp - for 3 years every year i would compile all similar projects and 
email them for collaboration - that is how DCL got bundled under us - 
ARIAS got bundled (or was going to at one time) under us</quote>. He 
explained that Arias <quote who="Derek Neighbors">was the original 
NOLA software - i think jcater and myself helped port to postgres - 
and did some work fixing up directory structures from original NOLA
- even started making some GNUe screens for it at one point - it 
kind of died on the vine</quote>.</p>
