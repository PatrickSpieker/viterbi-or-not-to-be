<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Johannes Vetter (johannesV) reported that <quote who="Johannes Vetter">the 
checkbox-widget could be set up to have three states, true, false and 
'not-set'</quote> - the 'not set' value would be displayed 
<quote who="Johannes Vetter">on xp i think the box is gray - haven't 
checked though on all platforms here right now</quote>. He noted that he 
was <quote who="Johannes Vetter">not sure if gnue-forms supports 
tri-state-checkboxes at all</quote> as of time of writing 
<quote who="Johannes Vetter">but i'm sure we will with the 0.6 series
- since we do have that third state (=NULL)</quote>. He noted that 
several of the databases that GNUe supported allowed NULL values 
for a boolean data type.</p>
