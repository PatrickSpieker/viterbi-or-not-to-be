<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 05 Oct 2002" title="Fixes to 0.4.0 releases setup.exe on Microsoft Windows" />, 
Bajusz Tam&#225;s reported <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">A 
repackaged GNUe-Tools-0.4.0a-setup.exe available at
<a href="http://www.extra.hu/berado88">http://www.extra.hu/berado88</a>.</quote>
Meanwhile, Robert Jenkins reported problems with the 
previous version - <quote who="Robert Jenkins">Designer 
does not run - when I try to start it, I get several 
seconds of intense disk activity, but nothing more.
No sign of any stuck processes. Forms appears to run 
OK.</quote> Later, he tried to download Bajusz's revised 
version, <quote who="Robert Jenkins">but so far all I 
cannot even get the page, I just get 110 errors.</quote> 
Bajusz explained that there was no problem with the 
underlying GNUe Designer code, but there had been a 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">packaging mistake</quote>. 
He had repackaged it, and <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">added 
some additional db drivers</quote>, including 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">firebird, sapdb, appserver</quote>.</p>

<p>Earlier, Robert also asked <quote who="Robert Jenkins">Any 
chance of converting the config files to Windows format 
for the Windows version? It's a real pain manually 
converting them with notepad..</quote> He added 
<quote who="Robert Jenkins">One of the comments by the GNUe 
people was that they need users! The majority of desktop 
systems are still Windows based (like the company 
I'm hoping to use GNUe with). Many Windows users will simply 
give up on a program that does not work first time, or needs 
things doing that they don't understand, like re-formatting 
files. Once a program is installed and running, most people 
will put some effort into learning how to operate it, but not 
if it won't install!</quote> Bajusz agreed, but said
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">The core gnue people are not windows 
fans, they mainly use debian-linux. I myself try to help testing 
on win32 and making patches if i can</quote> as a volunteer.</p>
