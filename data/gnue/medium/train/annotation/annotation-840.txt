<p>Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) asked for some help in understanding a 
shell script that was called by GNUe's 
setup-cvs.py python script. Jason Cater (jcater) explained that 
$@ was <quote who="Jason Cater">a bash construct - basically that's 
passing all command line parameters unchanged to the python 
binary</quote>. Arturas said he was trying to make this work under 
Microsoft Windows, as referred to in 
<kcref archive="http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue-dev/2002-August/000250.html" subject="[Gnue-dev] kind of Setup-cvs.py for windows" />. 
Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) asked <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">is there 
any chance to run GNUe on a good old DOS box ?</quote> Jason said this 
<quote who="Jason Cater">depends on whether python2.1 and the 
database driver will compile but it's certainly possible</quote> 
although <quote who="Jason Cater">not something I'm going to chase 
after</quote>.</p>
