<p>Jason Cater (jcater) posted a 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/curses-login.png">screenshot</a>
of a curses (text only) login screen - <quote who="Jason Cater">cursing == 
GNUe's curses widget toolset</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) explained 
<quote who="James Thompson">it's the highly modified code originally based upon 
nstti</quote>. Jason explained it had been put into GNUe Common 
<quote who="Jason Cater">because it's common to our code</quote> - 
theoretically, other GNUe tools such as Reports or Navigator might want to 
use it. James explained <quote who="James Thompson">there isn't a curses library 
out there at the moment that does what we require or that is maintained - 
we had this on seperate cvs server out of main code base</quote> - 
<quote who="James Thompson">but that made it harder to get fixes into it</quote>, 
so this had now been merged with the main GNUe CVS.</p>
