<p>Keith Jagrs (KeithJagrs) asked <quote who="Keith Jagrs">are there 
plans for gnue to serve workflow?</quote> Derek Neighbors (derek) 
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">things not much listed but we plan on - 
workflow, groupware, knowledge management</quote>. Keith asked 
<quote who="Keith Jagrs">what about using openflow - or another ongoing 
project</quote>? Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we are ALL FOR 
REUSING or merging with things - example we are working with axisgw and 
phpgw on groupware stuff - we just dont want to spread too thin and why 
we havent jumped into these areas yet - hoping a project will show 
up</quote>. He was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">examing gnukose for FSF 
currently for knowledge management - hopefully it will be something that 
can become part of GNU as well as GNUE</quote>.</p>

<p>Dan Bethe (dtm) said 
that <quote who="Dan Bethe">the university lex attended (lex from axisgw 
team) developed a knowledge management system that they want us to take 
up, so they can get support off their backs</quote>. Derek asked 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">will university make theirs gpl? 
if so i can evaluate as well</quote>. Dan said <quote who="Dan Bethe">its 
web site mentions public domain.  we'll see... it talks about the Library 
at Alexandria and the Library of Congress, so you know it's leet - 
it's called Phronesis, Greek for "wisdom"</quote>. Andrew Mitchell 
(ajmitch) said that <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">afaik 'sophia' is greek 
for wisdom ;)</quote> Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) agreed - 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">philosophy is the love of wisdom</quote> -
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">philo == love, sophia == wisdom...there 
that's the ticket ;)</quote> 
Dan asked <quote who="Dan Bethe">must a GNU project be under GPL/LGPL?  
what about GPL compatible according to www.gnu.org?</quote>
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">no a gnu project need not be 
under the GPL or LGPL but generally its HIGHLY preferred</quote>.</p>

<p>Keith looked at gnukose, and asked <quote who="Keith Jagrs">have 
you discarded zope or plone, etc?</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">zope is not workflow</quote>. 
Keith agreed, <quote who="Keith Jagrs">but is CMS - and on top of 
it is plone and openflow</quote>.</p>
