<p>Peter Sullivan (psu) said that Linux Expo UK had been 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">smaller than I expected 
(40-50 stands) but still interesting - good mix of 
a) the big boys (Sun, Oracle, IBM) come to explain their 
linux strategy - b) small to medium size IT firms based 
around GNU/Linux - c) the "dot-orgs"</quote>. There had 
not been a GNUe stand, but <quote who="Peter Sullivan">maybe 
next</quote> year. <quote who="Peter Sullivan">also seen 
at linux expo : 
<a href="http://www.jalia.com">www.jalia.com</a>. If you 
were trying to design something to be the anti-GNUe, 
this would be it - a) non-free - b) Java - c) postgres 
only</quote> - <quote who="Peter Sullivan">guess we'll 
have to keep working on acclite, then ;-)</quote></p>
