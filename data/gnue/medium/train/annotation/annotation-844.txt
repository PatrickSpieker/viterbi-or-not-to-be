<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>It was asked whether GNUe Forms could now use GTK2 natively, 
rather than having to use wxGTK and wxPython. Jason Cater 
(jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">we had a gtk2 driver given 
to us that has been put into cvs (it is native). I'm honestly 
not sure how feature complete it is compared to the wxgtk driver
but I think it's pretty far along - but I haven't had the 
opportunity to test it, so I can't say whether "far along" means 
"usable" or not. We almost have a curses version too - 
but we do consider the "wx" to be the "reference" implementation 
right now - simply because it gave us the most bang for the buck.
In the near future, we'd like to see a native QT version and a 
native Win32 version</quote>.</p>
