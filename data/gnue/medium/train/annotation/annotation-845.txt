<topic>Reports</topic>

<p>It was asked how well Reports worked with dot matrix printers. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">the reports 
package is not nearly far along as the forms package - 
it's only at 0.0.2 - so it isn't spitting out reports for 
production use yet</quote>. But his intention was that it should 
be able to <quote who="Jason Cater">talk to the printer natively
i.e., send actual text - not pictures of the pages</quote>. 
He noted that many Windows-based report programs 
<quote who="Jason Cater">use truetype fonts, etc, then render 
graphics to send to the printers - that has its place of course
- and you could do that if you wanted - but that's just doing 
injustice to dot-matrix printers :)</quote>. James Thompson 
(jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">i would think it'd be 
as hard on the printer as you'd like - as you could have your own 
output filter - what little I've gotten into it i would think you 
could do dump text w/o too much issue</quote>. He thought that 
<quote who="James Thompson">reports is pretty cool - thanks to 
jcater's mad coding skills he hacked a fax spammer filter up for 
me - so we could send reports to various schools. 1 year ago this 
required a student worker to hand fax 500 reports - i can't believe 
the poor s.o.b. didn't go mental on us :)</quote>.</p>
