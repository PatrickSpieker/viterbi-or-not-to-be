<p>Matt Rice (ratmice) reported problems <quote who="Matt Rice">i have 
appserver running on a linux box, trying to use it with 
windows forms seems to hang the windows forms client... has something 
to do with the connections.conf</quote>. Changing the Forms definition 
to talk directly to the database worked. He was using the XML-RPC 
adaptor. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">the 
xmlrpc client should work on windows, although the pw_xmlrpc one is 
possibly a bit more stable</quote>. He asked whether the form was 
hanging on start-up, or when it contacted the Application Server - 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">You could see that from the appservers 
output (gacvs/gnue-appserver -Z)</quote>. Matt said 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">well, the gnue-forms executable launches 
and then exits - i don't even get the auth form</quote>. Jan said 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">that seems to be a problem with the 
installation of xmlrpc on windows. Did you use the installer version 
or the zip files? Possibly xmlrpc isn't included in the installer  
version</quote>.</p>
