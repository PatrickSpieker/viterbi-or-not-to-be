<p>Keith Jagrs (KeithJagrs) asked <quote who="Keith Jagrs">what are 
the current  both propietrary and GPL apps that GNUe aims to 
rival?</quote> Derek Neighbors (derek) said that, for the GNUe 
Tools, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">currently forms is almost feature 
complete to Oracle SQL*Forms product</quote> and it 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">can replace Access (for applications 
*not query building*). Reporter has no equals that i can tell 
(reportlabs (free software) might be the closest) - but even BIG 
vendors like crystal reports and business objects dont really have 
a 'server' with caching and transformation like we do. Designer is 
similar to filemaker pro, delphi, powerbuilder or visual basic (only 
specific for business applications). App server would be similar to 
any app server on the market only with additional features</quote> 
specifically geared to writing business/enterprise applications. 
On the Packages, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">dcl is similar to MANY 
free software applications like request tracker and such - as similar 
to commercial applications like support magic or the likes. acclite 
would be similar to netledger, sql*ledger etc. The backend stuff is 
like nothing comparable in free software world that i know of and 
only the BIG end has it in the proprietary end - by backend i mean 
shipping automation, warehouse management, order management etc etc 
etc</quote>. Keith said <quote who="Keith Jagrs">So you have a well 
defined roadmap</quote>. Derek disagreed, saying that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">a well defined roadmap</quote> was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">next on the list - after the 0.4.0 
release</quote>. He felt that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">having in 
head and having official roadmap are two different things - 
most of the core team has an idea of what the road map is - just 
some finer points arent ironed out and none of it is official down 
digitally for others to review</quote>.</p>
