<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 05 Oct 2002" title="Debian packages for GNUe" />
Zack Brown (zbrown) reported problems with the Debian GNU/Linux packages 
for GNUe - <quote who="Zack Brown">dselect doesn't seem to recognize the 
0.4 gnue packages</quote>. <quote who="Zack Brown">However, 'apt-get 
install' appears to have worked.</quote> <quote who="Zack Brown">also, the 
dependency on mxDateTime doesn't seem to be specified in the debs</quote>. 
Jason Cater (jcater) confirmed that Zack was using the latest versions,
saying <quote who="Jason Cater">I noticed gnue-common_0.4.0-1 didn't have 
mxdatetime as a dependency - but I swore I added that for 
gnue-common_0.4.0-2</quote> - <quote who="Jason Cater">Depends: python2.1 
(&gt;= 2.1.3-1), python2.1-egenix-mxdatetime (&gt;= 2.0.3-1)</quote>.</p>

<p>Zack asked <quote who="Zack Brown">Is there a really basic intro to 
the concepts</quote> of using enterprise-style tools? Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">we are short on docs - especially non-technical 
introductions</quote>. Zack reported a broken link to the documentation 
page - <quote who="Jason Cater">it should be 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/docs.php">
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/docs.php</a>
I think.</quote></p>
