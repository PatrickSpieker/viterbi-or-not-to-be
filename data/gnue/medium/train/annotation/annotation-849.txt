<p>Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) said he had 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">made a workaround for McMillan packaging 
in designer - please tell me if you don't like my solution</quote>.
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">if it works, 
I like it - /me spent the better part of a week trying to get it 
to play nicely and obviously didn't succeed :(</quote>. 
Bajusz said <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">it works, but maybe it is 
too tortuous :) - especially hook-gnue.designer.Designer.py</quote>. 
Jason was impressed - <quote who="Jason Cater">I could not get 
McMillan to recognize my hook-* files - that's why I ended up doing 
the hidden-imports.py trick</quote>. Bajusz said 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">the trickiest part was finding keyword 
module needed in hiddenimports for TriggerEditor.py</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.16Oct2002">
The next day</a>, Peter Sullivan (psu) noted that 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">btami's web page with the new WIndows 
.exes seems to be unreachable for me</quote>. Several other people 
confirmed this. Peter asked Bajusz to e-mail it to him so he could 
put it on the main www.gnuenterprise.org web site.</p>
