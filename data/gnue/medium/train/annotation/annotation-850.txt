<p>Keith Jagrs (Keith_jgrs) asked <quote who="Keith Jagrs">are there 
plans to rewrite Double Choco Latte in Python?</quote> 
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">there are plans 
to implement GNUe Forms screens - I'm not sure it's fair to call 
that rewriting in Python though</quote>. 
<quote who="Jason Cater">actually, I *think* there may be some GNUe 
Forms screens in DCL's CVS</quote> already as of time of writing 
<quote who="Jason Cater">but don't hold me to that</quote>. 
Keith asked <quote who="Keith Jagrs">So the  DCL "engine" would 
stay as it is, but the UI will be ported to GNUe Forms?</quote> 
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I don't think there's much of 
an "engine" - it is a UI with a database backend - well - I guess 
it depends on your perspective :)</quote> - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">in any case, the GNUe Forms version would 
not be dependent on the PHP version - nor vice versa - although 
they should be able to use the same database tables</quote>. 
Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) clarified <quote who="Charles Rouzer">its 
a sharing of code or design specs.</quote></p>
