<topic>Reports</topic>

<p>Nick Rusnov (nickr) asked <quote who="Nick Rusnov">whats the 
current status of reports?</quote> Jason Cater said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">Mailmerge kicks ass - GNUe-specific 
markup tags not yet finalized</quote>. Nick said 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">mostly I'm wondering if there is a 
standalone tool I can shove data into and have it come out 
nice printed. :)</quote>  - he was 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">already gathering the requisit data 
as defined by a tempalte, I just don't have any way to format 
it into a nice report</quote>. Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">likes awk ;-)</quote>. 
Nick said he needed something <quote who="Nick Rusnov">tabular 
with page headings and footings</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">a2ps or enscript has customizable 
headers/footers</quote>. Nick said this was 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">not very good for windows with a nice 
preview window and such via the wx printing stuff. :)</quote>
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">ah, if that's what your 
looking for, then gnue-reports certainly isn't at that point - 
it can do some spiffy stuff, but via Unix command prompt and 
without print preview</quote>. Nick said 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">It'd be nice if someone made a tool 
that takes a 'ready to print' xml file and 
handles the device and printing preview stuffa. So anyway. 
Good thing wxPython has a 'table printer' object.</quote></p>
