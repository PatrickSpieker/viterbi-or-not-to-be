<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Yurii Rashkovskii (Yurik) asked <quote who="Yurii Rashkovskii">does 
anyone knows where OpenGroup specifications could be downloaded for 
free?</quote> Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">they can't - you have to pay</quote>. 
Yurii was particularly interested in the transactions XA 
specification, as <quote who="Yurii Rashkovskii">The only TP 
monitor that supports Berkeley DB (as I understand) is BEA 
Tuxedo, which isn't free :-(</quote>.</p>

<p>Daniel asked <quote who="Daniel Baumann">what's a transaction 
monitor supposed to do anyway? they mention XA/XA+ in the ODMG</quote>
(Object Data Modelling Group) <quote who="Daniel Baumann">book, 
but of course they punt on the matter</quote>. Yurii said it 
managed <quote who="Yurii Rashkovskii">distributed transactions 
(between database environemnts)</quote>. He was not keen on 
writing a transaction monitor himself, especially without access to 
the relevant standards - trying to understand the standards from 
other people's code implementing it was not ideal!</p>

<p>Daniel noted that the ODMG book did not define an interface 
for distributed transactions - <quote who="Daniel Baumann">vendors 
are not required to support distributed transactions, but if they 
do they must be XA-compliant</quote>. Yurii said he would 
<quote who="Yurii Rashkovskii">try to find something</quote> that 
<quote who="Yurii Rashkovskii">is compatible with OG XA</quote> -  
preferably not CORBA-based, as <quote who="Yurii Rashkovskii">it 
will be a bloat piece of software. Berkeley DB just provides C 
callbacks that should be used from the shared library.</quote> 
Daniel suggested <quote who="Daniel Baumann">why not check out 
<a href="http://www.omg.org">OMG</a> Object Transaction Service? 
you should be able to get that for free</quote> and the 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">ODMG ppl claim OG XA/AX+ == OMG 
Object Transaction Service - it's the OMG's XA implementation 
from what I gather</quote>. Yurii 
<quote who="Yurii Rashkovskii">got OMG spec - seems that it will 
help a lot</quote>.</p>
