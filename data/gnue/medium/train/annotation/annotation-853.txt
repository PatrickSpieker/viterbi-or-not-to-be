<p>Nicholas Lee (esands) asked why <quote who="Nicholas Lee">you guys 
prefer <a href="http://nola.noguska.com">nola</a> over 
<a href="http://www.sql-ledger.com">sql-ledger</a></quote>? 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said he had heard that 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">sql-ledger is apparantly ugly ugly 
ugly code</quote>, but Nicholas felt <quote who="Nicholas Lee">Nola is no 
better.</quote> <quote who="Nicholas Lee">sql-ledger seems to have a more 
active community and better business features.  I also trying not to 
break down and buy a copy of MYOB</quote> (Mind Your Own Books, a 
proprietary accounting package for small businesses) 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">for a couple companies I need to start books for 
and do last years accounts.</quote> Andrew said he needed 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">to get 
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/ftba/">FTBA</a> design off the 
ground next month - will require some input, if you want to help out 
:)</quote> They had already done <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">just a 
couple of test forms for the GNUe implementation - some basic php/python 
code for an early, ugly, simple version</quote>. He was 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">guessing it's the sort of software that would 
be appreciated by small companies around</quote> New Zealand. Nicholas 
said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">I think in NZ the core issue is</quote> 
government sales tax functionality. <quote who="Nicholas Lee">For most 
business is the biggest task every two months for invoice basis. For 
payment basis its even more complicated. Getting candy like "PO customer 
ship-tos" that auto generate to vendor invoice and customer invoices on 
receipt of delivery information from a supplier is also something nice.

<p>Dan Bethe (dtm) said <quote who="Dan Bethe">if ya gotta buy 
something, try mybooks from appgen.com - you can export or interconnect 
your data later - assuming this nola stuff is not good for ya</quote>. 
Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">I looked at a appgen demo but 
didn't like it that much.  Not sure how well I could get it to work in 
NZ as well.</quote> He wondered why Andrew was 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">creating a new project rather than working 
on top of acclite?</quote> Andrew felt 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">acclite seems to do a bit too much for a 
small business</quote>. Nicholas agreed it could be confusing. 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">However if you design your UI over the top 
to hide the 'unneeded' features, you get the later bonus of tracking 
acclites development and being able to upgrade to a 'large' application 
easier.</quote> Andrew agreed, <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">but 
currently acclite is mostly php-only - not the best thing to try &amp; 
put forms onto for standalone apps - since FTBA will need to run on 
mostly windows desktops, without a webserver to run the php</quote>. 
Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">from my understanding they are 
working towards form's version of acclite.</quote> Andrew noted 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">but that requires taking the php code 
&amp; turning it into something forms-accessible :) - which is a rather 
large task</quote>. Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">actally I 
think that requires taking the sql scheme turning it into something 
useful. Considering those works it might be easier to start from square 
one. ;)</quote> Andrew felt <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">acclite 
development seems to have stalled a little, unless lots hasn't been 
committed?</quote></p>

<p>Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">I think the 
main thing about accounting systems (from the pov of an IT-inclined guy 
who does business accounting) is that the core is important. I'm not 
worried about document manager and publics notices on login if I 
can't generate invoices and statements.</quote> Andrew noted 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">accounting systems only recently 
started migrating off DOS recently for small business stuff 
:)</quote> Dan agreed - <quote who="Dan Bethe">and a lot of their 
guts still use the DOS or win16 stuff</quote>.</p>
