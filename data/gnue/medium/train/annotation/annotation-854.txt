<p>Dan Bethe (dtm) pointed to a 
<a href="http://docs.axisgroupware.org/index.php?page=AxisWishList">wiki 
page</a> he had done for Axis groupware about the options for 
accounting packages. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">i see that you're still focussing on the 
web-based - would you be using a php GNUe forms client, for example? 
as phpforms seems to be the main web forms client at the moment</quote>. 
Dan said <quote who="Dan Bethe">we focus on the web based, where that 
means having a relatively thin, platform independant, client.  
preferably launchable via a web browser for reasons of authentication and 
UI integration. "Web based" may also mean that it's relatively tolerant 
of imperfections in the connection, i.e. run via internet. I think i 
have the same definition of "web based" as derek does, and it 
has no tie to html although it's highly preferable - but man if it 
makes the app seriously suffer, like for rapid data entry or 
needing a stateful connection, then that's something else - 
i mean it may require a thicker client than html</quote>.</p>

<p>Andrew said his definition of web-based was 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">accessible via the internet, usually 
via HTTP (including layers like XML-RPC or SOAP) - the standard GNUe 
forms client can load forms via http, and talk to the appserver via 
xml-rpc - it seriously rocks, really :)</quote> Dan agreed - 
<quote who="Dan Bethe">yeah that might imply the possibility for ssl
- and it could be launched via a browser. People need to have a single 
environment to branch off of, that being the intranet, and being 
powered by what we call groupware. That should be an application 
launching zone if not literally the all-encompassing appserver 
itself</quote>. Andrew said that the new GEAR (GNUe Archive) 
format could do something like this. Dan said that the browser 
<quote who="Dan Bethe">should be the encompassing GUI, that is - 
like the master menu - that's how to cater toward being the most 
things to the most people - having good defaults - making sure 
people know about system updates - having a groupware launchpad 
being the default home page</quote>. Andrew said 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">like an html-based GNUe 
Navigator? GNUe Navigator is currently a basic forms &amp; 
reports client, which has a menu/tree</quote> Nicholas Lee (esands) 
though Dan's ideas <quote who="Nicholas Lee">sounds like .NET. 
;)</quote> Dan said <quote who="Dan Bethe">minus the e-vil.</quote> 
Andrew said that <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">since DotGNU does 
still have ties with phpgw</quote>, Dan Kuykendall (seek3r) 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">is coming to talk at the next meetathon
- and i'm trying to get 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/projects/dotgnu/">DotGNU</a> 
stuff to be able to work nicely with GNUe stuff</quote> Nicholas 
said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">I think what you are saying is: 
build the infrastructure so that applications can tie together 
nicely.</quote> Andrew said <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">that's 
the aim of GNUe, DotGNU, and AxisGW - being 'glueware'</quote>. 
Nicholas agreed - <quote who="Nicholas Lee">common meme.</quote></p>

<p>Andrew said <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">what would be interesting 
would be if GNUe's appserver could run a caching php 
interpreter</quote>. Nicholas confirmed that mod_php reinterprets 
a page on each hit <quote who="Nicholas Lee">Unless you use something 
commerical</quote>. Andrew said <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">that's 
one thing that webware &amp; GNUe's appserver won't do with python - 
they store the interpreted objects in memory</quote>. 
Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">WHy not use a 
python web enviroment instead? Quixote?</quote> 
Andrew suggested <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">because GNUe's 
appserver could do some of that stuff anyway?</quote>. 
Nicholas noted that <quote who="Nicholas Lee">Zend sells a php 
cache</quote>. Andrew was <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">familiar 
with webware, haven't heard of quixote</quote>. Nicholas said that 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee"><a href="http://www.lwn.org">lwn</a> run 
it</quote>. Andrew was <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">surprised that 
there isn't a free php cache - i guess the interpreter works well 
enough for quite a few - or those that need the cache have enough 
incentive to pay for one :)</quote> Dan said 
<quote who="Dan Bethe">there are free php caches - one comes with 
the latest mod_php - also see lingerd</quote>. Andrew said 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">it sounded like lingerd wasn't a php 
cache, but an app to avoid keeping sockets open too long</quote>. 
Dan confirmed this - <quote who="Dan Bethe">so for some dynamic 
sites you can use php cache and lingerd</quote> together to 
maximise performance. Andrew agreed - <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">fast, 
scalable - so long as the php code itself is written nicely ;) - 
/me is perfectly able to write some really bad &amp; non-scalable 
python code that totally negates the benefits of a fast appserver - 
really inefficient blocking use of SQL is a great way to kill your 
website ;)</quote></p>
