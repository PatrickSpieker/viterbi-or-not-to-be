<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>Peter Sullivan (psu) said he was <quote who="Peter Sullivan">doing 
an emergency prune of the FAQ</quote> - just fixing some broken 
links <quote who="Peter Sullivan">now, then do a more comprehensive 
re-write on the content</quote> at a later date. Jason felt that 
<quote who="Jason Cater">we need to seriously look at the faq - 
and all our stuff really - imho it's WAY too package-centric - 
esp considering where we are today</quote>. The "What is GNUE?"
section of the FAQ talked exclusively about packages, not tools.
Peter suggested replacing <quote who="Peter Sullivan">that with 
the "three things" off 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/project/what.php">what.php</a></quote>.
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">sometimes I wonder if we really 
shouldn't consider ourselves as two separate projects - from an 
organizational standpoint</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason also felt that talking about the packages in the current 
tense was misleading. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">I am buried at work within week should 
be unburied and applications will start falling out</quote>. 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">it should be in present tense with 
foot note about check status or something - only because if we write 
in future tense it has to be changed later and is bad marketing 
:)</quote> Jason felt this was <quote who="Jason Cater">true to a 
point</quote> but <quote who="Jason Cater">misleading marketing is 
not a good thing... it usually backfires and will destroy a "brand" 
fairly quickly</quote>. Derek agreed - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i 
dont think we should market packages that dont exist in that fashion
- i.e. giving a status or link to satus - just to cut down on our 
reworking. I dont want to say  we have packages, but i want to make 
sure we arent talking in future tense that suggests some day we might 
consider it, but rather in a language that  says we ARE making 
packages just they dont exist yet....</quote> - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">My big frustration today is that folks 
think GNUe has no deliverables</quote>. Jason felt this was a 
consequence of the general focus in project literature on the 
(mostly still in planning) packages rather than the (mostly existing
and usable) tools. Derek said this <quote who="Derek Neighbors">falls 
in line with jcaters assement perhaps we need to market as two projects
- the website is now stuctured that way</quote>. Several people made 
positive comments about the new website. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">perhaps we need a NOTE on the front page?
that states tools are ready, packages are not? i.e. i agree 100% about 
it being confusing</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason also asked about the third point on that "What is GNUe?" web 
page - about GNUe as a project <quote who="Jason Cater">of support and 
resources for developers writing applications using the GNUe Tools (whether 
part of the 'official' GNUe Packages or not).</quote> He said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I assume with it being a 3rd category apart 
from packages we are talking about 3rd party stuff? - or are we just 
talking about the "community" of help i.e., irc, mailing lists, 
etc</quote>?</p>
