<p>Nicholas Lee (esands) asked <quote who="Nicholas Lee">Can 
someone explain how sales tax works in the US.  From my 
observation sales tax is collection on sales. I wonder however how 
business balance off the outside of the equation. sales tax on goods 
purchase for the conduct of business.  ie. for generating business 
income.  Is sales tax collected on these purchases? Is it refund some 
how?</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">if 
purchasing items for resale, you can present a Certificate of Resale 
(or something similarly titled) and the vendor won't charge you any 
taxes</quote>. Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) said 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">sales tax is only per state.
and sales tax is only for tangible goods, not services.</quote> 
Jason said this varied depending on location. Nicholas said 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">So you have to carry a card around with you.  
Sounds complex. Want about when a person is out and about? Say you 
have 100 people out and about. Do they each need to cert?</quote> 
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">usually you file this "Certificate 
of Resale" with the vendor so they have it on file - and this only 
applies to stuff you resale - if you are consuming within your business
you still have to pay sales tax</quote>. Charles clarified 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">you don't carry around a card, you just 
have to file the right paper work.. and provide your federal tax ID 
if a customer request it.</quote>.</p>

<p>Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">In NZ we are able to claim 
GST credits for items consumed in the production of business 
income</quote>. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">so if you buy more than you sell, you 
get a GST refund :)</quote> Nicholas said that the Australian 
system was even weirder. Andrew asked <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">isn't 
the tax rate dependant on the prduct/service there?</quote> Nicholas 
said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">no. just its exempt status - ie. 
finanical services (interest, bank fees, etc, but not insurance) dont 
have any GST</quote>. Andrew said <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">and 
essential goods don't either, right? whatever they define essential 
to be :)</quote>.</p>
