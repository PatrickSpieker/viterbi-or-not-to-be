<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 22 May 2006" title="Layout in GNUe Forms with wx 2.6 driver" />,
Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) suggested to James Thompson (jamest) 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">if you are bored, you can try again the 
wx26 uidriver</quote>, as Johannes Vetter (johannesV) had done 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">some massive changes and it might 
be that your issues with fscking up the boxes are solved</quote>.
James said that, although he was busy, <quote who="James Thompson">i 
really need to get that tested, as the dropdown box issues in 2.4 
are preventing some selections from being allowed</quote>. So he 
was keen to have a version of GNUe Forms that worked with the user 
interface driver for wx 2.6 as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Trying Johannes' new code for GNUe Forms with his existing GNUe 
Forms Definitions, James found problems  - 
<quote who="James Thompson">none of which are due to anything 
wrong with what you've done - it's all in my forms</quote>, where 
he had been relying on 'features' (such as overlapping text boxes) 
that Johannes had treated as 'bugs' and now fixed. Johannes confirmed 
that <quote who="Johannes Vetter">overlaping is now being checked ...
not only for boxes but for all widgets</quote>. He added, 
<quote who="Johannes Vetter">if you click the detail-button you'll 
see the offending line in your XML-File - this makes debuging</quote> 
a GNUe Form Definition (gfd) <quote who="Johannes Vetter">a lot 
easier</quote>. James reported that all five of his existing 
GNUe Form Definitions were not working with the new code - but 
<quote who="James Thompson">i would still imagine it's something 
funky I'm doing in the form</quote> rather than a problem with 
Johannes' code. He noted that, on the last one, the problem 
that he had been having with the dropdown menu had been fixed, 
but the form now <quote who="James Thompson">aborts on 
query</quote>.</p>

<p><editorialize who="Peter Sullivan">Note that the lack of any 
guarantees on backward compatability, even with 'features'/'bugs'
is one of the reasons why GNUe Forms remains at a version 
number below 1.0 as of time of writing, as discussed further in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 13 Apr 2006" title="Forms approaching version 1.0?" />.
</editorialize></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.2006-06-20">The
mext day</a>, Reinhard <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">noticed that 
dialog boxes in the wx26 driver are not modal - the "go to 
record" box and the about box both allow the main form to 
be clicked while the box is still open - then the cursor even 
blinks in the main form - but I can't type anything</quote>. 
Later, Johannes reported <quote who="Johannes Vetter">the dialogs 
*are* shown modal ... i would say it's a bug in wx that 
the mouse-click is sent to (and handled by) the parent-window</quote>. 
He confirmed that, when using the user interface drivers on Microsoft 
Windows and Mac OS X, the focus stayed on the dialog box, and 
correctly ignored any clicks on the parent form. Reinhard wondered if 
this was a problem specific to the GTK2 desktop he was using under 
GNU/Linux - <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">I think for gtk2 modal 
dialogs *always* allow the main window to be focussed again</quote>. 
Johannes confirmed that it was not possible to access the 
menu options in the parent form whilst there was a dialog 
box open, for both Microsoft Windows and the old wx version 
2.4 drivers.</p>
