<p>Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) noted that <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">the 
latest released gnue-reports</quote> no longer worked with the 
last official release of GNUe Common, as <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">it 
needs GRParser .py and GRSources from</quote> the current  
development version of GNUe Common. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) 
suggested <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">should we do a release 
of gnue-reports now? would that help?</quote> Tam&#225;s said 
that it was really GNUe Common that was the problem. Reinhard 
said <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">so we might want to look into 
releases for common and reports at least</quote>. However, he did 
not <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">want to release forms in the 
middle of this stuff we are doing</quote> until it was more 
stable. He expected that the existing 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">latest release of forms *should* work 
with</quote> the current development version of GNUe Common if they 
did a new release as of time of writing.</p>
