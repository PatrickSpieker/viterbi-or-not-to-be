<p>It was asked whether having an object ID field was necessary for databases being 
accessed by GNUe. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) said <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">we 
currently depend on oids - because they are the only way of safely identifying a 
new record that has just been inserted if the primary key has been set by a db 
trigger</quote>. It was pointed out that, with Oracle at least, database-generated 
object IDs were not guranteed to remain the same over time. James Thompson 
(jamest) had not heard this, but in any case pointed out that 
<quote who="James Thompson">postgresql 8.1 has depreciated the OID and no longer 
created them on tables unless specifically told too during the create table 
statemnet - this burns me quite a bit :)</quote> However, he had been under the 
impression that the data access code for GNUe <quote who="James Thompson">only 
used the OID if a PK field wasn't defined for that table</quote> - if you 
defined what field or fields made up the primary key as part of the datasource 
definition, it would use these instead of requiring an object ID. 
He did this all the time with things like RMA numbers or order numbers - 
<quote who="James Thompson">the user doesn't enter the PK value nor does the 
form - they save the new record and then the rma number assigned just pops up on 
their screen in the uneditable field :)</quote>. This would normally be done by 
automatically re-querying the record after save - <quote who="James Thompson">but 
I also seem to recall some dbsig drivers returning info from the execute of the 
insert</quote>. Reinhard confirmed this.</p>
