<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) reported a problem with 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">dropdowns (or other entries with 
a list of allowed values)</quote> - 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">currently when a wrong value is 
entered, the complete entry is deleted and the field is set back 
to empty - and the cursor moves out of the entry - and no error 
message is displayed. I consider this a bug and would think the 
correct behaviour would be - display error message in status line, 
beep, leave the input as it was (so I can just correct my typo) 
and leave the focus in the entry</quote>. This was agreed.</p>

<p>Later, Reinhard reported an 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">interesting problem - 
I've managed to block tabbing out of a control as long as the 
entered value is invalid - so when you hit tab or enter gnue-forms 
just beeps and shows an error message. However I seem to have no 
means to block moving the focus to another widget with the mouse - 
so you can still click out of a control even when the value is 
invalid - does anybody have any idea about this?</quote> Later, 
he thought he had <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">found a solution 
that behaves fairly reasonable - but I guess it needs testing on 
different</quote> user interfaces.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.2006-06-28">The 
next day</a>, Johannes Vetter did some testing of this fix on other user 
interfaces. He reported that using the wx 2.6 user interface driver 
in GNU/Linux seemed to work -  <quote who="Johannes Vetter">clicking 
into another entry moves the UI-focus to that entry, but keeps GF-focus 
in the dropdown. entering new text goes still into the dropdown - the 
errormessage appears in the statusline.</quote> But the same 
form using the native Microsoft Windows 32 user interface driver was not 
working as intended - <quote who="Johannes Vetter">On win32, clicking 
into another entry moves both ui- and gf-focus into the new field, no 
message, no error. the value of the dropdown is the first one 
which was available depending on my input</quote>. However, using 
the wx 2.6 user interface driver in Microsoft Windows worked fine.</p>
