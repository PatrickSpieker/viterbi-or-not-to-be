<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 13 Jun 2002" title="Grid support in GNUe Forms" />, 
Johannes Vetter (johannesV) reported a <quote who="Johannes Vetter">response 
on the wx-mailing list regarding the grid problem - 
looks like some guys have implemented a grid-control (derived from wx.grid) 
which is capable of handling multiple rows per logical record - but it 
appears as the have troubles with selecting a row as well as moving 
around in a logical way. i've installed gnuecash yesterday to get a look 
at how they did it there ...</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.2006-07-06">A
few days later</a>, Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) noted that 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">wow, zipgrid looks very nice already</quote>. 
Johannes said that there was still some tidying-up to do on the 
code, <quote who="Johannes vetter">and it supports only default-entries</quote>
as of time of writing. He posted some screenshots from 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~johannes/zipgrid-gtk.png">GTK</a> and 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~johannes/zipgrid-xp.png">Windows</a>, 
noting that <quote who="Johannes Vetter">the best thing is it is done 
with just a few lines of gfd-code</quote>, giving the lines of code 
used to generate the sample grid.</p>
