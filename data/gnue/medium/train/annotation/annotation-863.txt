<topic>Reports</topic>

<p>Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) asked 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">anybody using gnue-reports on 
windows?</quote> He wanted <quote Who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">to know 
whether you can print directly - or you have to generate a pdf 
which you then manually print</quote>? Later, Bajusz Tam&#225;s 
(btami) said that text-only reports could be printed 
directly to a printer, and <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">if use xml 
formatter, can print to a gdi printer - text, html, escp,..</quote>, 
adding <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">if you don't select 
a printer, it will pop up a selection dialog.</quote> He noted 
that all of this applied only to the current development 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">version of reports, released doesn't 
works</quote>. He noted <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">reports 
is far from a polished state</quote> as of time of writing.</p>

<p>Reinhard was <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">approaching a 
project where we would need a number of reports - most of them 
probably being simple lists of records (maybe with master/detail, 
but nothing complicated)</quote>. Tam&#225;s noted that the text-only  
version of reports did not support master/detail yet - 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">there was no work on reports 
lately</quote>. Reinhard said <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">we'll 
have to decide whether we use reports or do some manual python 
(maybe reportlab) based solution</quote>. Tam&#225;s felt it would be 
better <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">to use/enhance gnue-reports - if 
everyone using custom report solution, it will be never 
finished</quote> - <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">as i see, the engine 
itself is ready, the filters need more work</quote>.</p>
