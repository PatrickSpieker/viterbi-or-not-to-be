<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 10 May 2006" title="Performance issues with Application Server and XML-RPC" />, 
Malek Hadj-Ali (lekma) reported <quote who="Malek Hadj-Ali">the script that 
use to take 4min+ is now</quote> under 2. There were still some
<quote who="Malek Hadj-Ali">strange bugs in http 1.1 with hessian</quote> 
and <quote who="Malek Hadj-Ali">the request still eats 300Meg of 
memory</quote>. But, as Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) noted 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">at least for speed we're not magnitudes 
away any more</quote>. Malek did further testing, and noted that a 
hessian dump run independantly took a fraction of a second - the 
same hessian dump via the GNUe Application Server took 26 seconds. 
Reinhard noted that it was not unusual to see odd results like this when 
profiling python code - <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">I suspect 
all the hidden python magic like garbage collection and the like 
has a big impact on performance - and the decision when exactly 
python runs the garbage collection might depend on conditions that 
we as humans would regard as "random"</quote>. Jason Cater
(jcater) wondered if using unicode, or the presence of the python psyco 
module was making a difference, but neither of these proved to be the 
case. Both Jason and Reinhard volunteered to have a look at Malek's 
code to see if they could spot anything.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.2006-05-17">The
next day</a>, Malek reported that he had 
<quote who="Malek Hadj-Ali">figured it out - a bug in hessianlib 
that shown itself when dumping instances</quote>. He did some 
more tests with various different combinations (using XML-RPC, 
hessian and direct database access, both with and without 
GNUe Application Server) and found that hessian was still 
<i>somewhat</i> faster than the original XML-RPC protocol 
that GNUe had been using previously, but felt a bit frustrated 
that it should be <i>significantly</i> faster - as 
<quote who="Malek Hadj-Ali">pure dumps/loads is around 3 times 
faster in hessian than xmlrpc</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.2006-05-18">The 
next day</a>, Reinhard said he would apply Malik's patch 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">so others can have a look and a try</quote>. 
Malek explained that his patch fixed <quote who="Malik Hadj-Ali">a 
bug withe the hessian lib - but that don't solve all performance 
issue</quote>. Jason noted that his profiling tests 
conmfirmed this - <quote who="Jason Cater">I wrapped the calls into the 
hotshot profiler the other day - and noticed that most of the wait was 
inside of the networking code of hessianlib.py</quote>. Malek pointed  
out that <quote who="Malek Hadj-Ali">appserver adds a non negligeabable 
overhead in ClientAdapter and ServerAdapter</quote>, regardless of 
whether hessian or XML-RPC was used, <quote who="Malek Hadj-Ali">but 
it tries hard to balance this overhead with agressive http 1.1 
connections - so all in all it's not that bad.</quote>.</p>
