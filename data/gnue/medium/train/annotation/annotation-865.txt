<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>James Thompson (jamest) asked <quote who="James Thompson">how stable 
is forms head? and the wx driver in particular - 2.6</quote> as 
<quote who="James Thompson">the dropdowns in the old wx driver have 
started causing us lots of issues</quote>. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) 
replied <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">head should be perfectly usable, 
and wx26 should be possibly the most stable driver of all</quote> 
(as previously discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 16 Mar 2006" title="Reducing the number of user interface drivers for GNUe" />
and similar threads). But he cautioned that this did not mean 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">that you *won't* hit bugs...</quote>. 
James tried it, and noted <quote who="James Thompson">2.6 computes 
spacing a bit different than 2.4 did doesn't it</quote>? Johannes Vetter 
(johannesV) explained <quote who="Johanes Vetter">spacing depends on the 
biggest control possible - depending on the platform used</quote>. 
Reinhard clarified <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">it just takes standard 
entry size, standard button size, standard dropdown size - and takes the 
biggest of them - so no control will get chopped</quote>. James was concerned
that this <quote who="James Thompson">really increases the horizontal space 
usage though - like on a rows=10 - it looking like whitespace is 
doubled</quote>.</p>

<p>Reinhard wondered <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">whether widgetWidth 
and widgetHeight point sizes could be a configuration option - and if 
set override the auto dectected widget sizes</quote>. Johannes said that 
this <quote who="Johannes Vetter">should be handled quite well if there 
are layoutmanagers ...</quote>. But James noted that this would also 
need to take account of what X themes the user was running - 
<quote who="James Thompson">as for whatever reason themes effect forms 
here - a form that fits on user A's screen doesn't on User B's</quote>.
Reinhard agreed <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">that the only real solution 
is layout management - a button simply *isn't* of the same size as an 
entry</quote> for example.</p>
