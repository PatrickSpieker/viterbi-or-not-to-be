<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>James Thompson (jamest) noted that <quote who="James Thompson">the two 
biggest things stopping me from opening forms are</quote> lack of support 
for integer and boolean typecasts - the typecast-attribute only seemed to 
support date, text and number as of time of writing. He asked 
<quote who="James Thompson">is there a reason we don't don't support 
typecast= boolean or integer in</quote> GNUe Form Definitions? 
Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) replied <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">I 
have no idea, the set of possible values was defined ages ago - but it 
was never checked. I am not opposed at all to add any other values to 
the list as you see fit</quote>.</p>
