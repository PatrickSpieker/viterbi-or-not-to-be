<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Further to 
<kcref archive="http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue-dev/2002-October/000289.html" subject="[Gnue-dev] Configuration of GNUe + Oracle 9i" />, 
it was noted that GNUe looked for a particular Oracle listener, using the 
service name from connections.conf. Oracle's own SQL*Plus tools looked 
for the default listener. This was with running both SQL*Plus and GNUe 
on the same machine as the database server. Jason Cater (jcater)
explained <quote who="Jason Cater">when running on the server, sqlplus 
can use interprocess communications to talk with the server - we can't 
- we can only do it via tcp/ip</quote>. This had never been an issue 
for him, as <quote who="Jason Cater">I am running Oracle in client/server
- nothing but oracle runs on the server</quote>. This meant that the 
connections information was taken from the TNSNAMES.ORA file as 
well as listener.ora. There should be no problem running GNUe and 
the Oracle database on the same machine, but 
<quote who="Jason Cater">you'll still need a listener running though 
: :)</quote>. He volunteered to send his Oracle configuration 
files to help. The problem turned out to be that the name of the 
service was different to the (SERVICE=) entry in the 
tnsnames.ora file, which was concerning, as this file had been 
automatically generated by the Oracle tools, so therefore should 
not have gone wrong. It was asked if there was any way to 
verify the file. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I don't know
- I had a hard time setting mine up the first time - when I finally 
got a working version several years ago - I never touched it 
again</quote>.</p>
