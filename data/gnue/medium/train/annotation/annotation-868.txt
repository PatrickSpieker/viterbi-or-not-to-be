<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 28 Oct 2002" title="GNUe small business packages" />, 
Jason Cater (jcater) said that savannah hackers had queried his 
project submissions, asking for an <quote who="Jason Cater">URL to 
the source code tarball</quote>. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said this
was <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">just to check licensing</quote>. 
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I am creating new projects, though
- how can they check licensing for something I'm going to do?</quote>. 
Andrew said <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">you said for RentFree that 
you had source, they'll check that the files have the proper copyright 
into</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I already indicated 
that it was gpl</quote>. Andrew replied <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">as 
do a lot of people - but people seem to have a knack for missing copyright 
headers on source files. Projects that i've submitted have been rejected 
&amp; told to resubmit, too. Do you have any code/forms/stuff for 
gnue-sb?</quote> If not, he would need to explain that to them. 
Derek Neighbors (revDeke) noted that GNUe seemed to be the only GNU project 
that was consciencious in getting copyright assignments from contributors, 
so it was a bit galling that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">they are worried 
one of our SUB PROJECTS might not have good license?</quote> Jason said 
he did not mind so much that they needed clarification on something, but 
was surprised that it had taken two days to get back to him on it. 
Andrew said <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">if you saw the pile of projects 
that are in the submission queue...</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.01Nov2002">
The next day</a>, Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) noted that Jason's 
submissions were being discussed on the savannah-hackers 
mailing list. He reminded Jason that he would have 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">to resubmit, which means using the 
URL provided -  this is because once they have been declined for 
whatever reason, the system is designed for you to have to 
resubmit :)</quote> Jason was not very impressed with this - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">no history information? bah</quote>. 
Andrew said that savannah had been forked from the last 
public version of sourceforge, so shared many of its 
limitations. Jason said the free software way was to 
<quote who="Jason Cater">hack it to be better</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason was also confused, as <quote who="Jason Cater">They 
asked me if I wanted to be a part of the GNU project on the 
registration screen</quote>, which he had replied yes to. 
They were now asking for proof of this, but the question 
had been whether he <i>wanted</i> to be, not whether he already 
was. Andrew said <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">i told them that 
GNUe subprojects should be considered part of GNUe (as if my 
opinion matters ;)</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason also raised the issue of how he should mark the 
code as being under the GPL (GNU General Public License) - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I have a COPYING file - however - 
All the "code" is really GFD files - is it going to come back to 
bite me that there's not copyright headers in the GFD files?
or is the COPYING file enough</quote>? Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) 
said <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">the COPYING file states that 
you should have headers in each source</quote> code file.
Jason said the <quote who="Jason Cater">thing is, the GFD files 
are automatically generated</quote> by Designer - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">so keeping a header in there will be a 
biotch</quote>. Andrew suggested 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">perhaps go the nasty way &amp; have 
a license tag for forms - so that designer can generate copyright 
header in xml comments</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) said he thought that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">the gfds should have the copyright 
header - its not MANDATORY - the COPYING file is enough - but it 
is better to have in GFDs</quote> as well. Jason said he would 
put them in manually for now. Derek said the long-term solution 
was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">in designer allow a 'preferences'
that lets you put in custom headers - and wehn you make gfd's 
you can choose from those</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I think once I get "projects" working in 
Designer this will be the appropriate place for that - 
as on the "project" config screen, you could say "place xxxx 
copyright header in all G?D files"</quote>. Derek said this 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">is GREAT for two reasons - 
a. you dont have to manually fight designer - 
b. it will add headers so you dont forget :) - /me is VERY 
guilty of b</quote>. Jason felt it should not be 
<quote who="Jason Cater">a system-wide preference - as I work 
on all kinds of projects w/gnue - public, gpl'd projects - 
internal projects</quote> and so on. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i would do a 'profiles' thing
and then be able to set it by project - i.e. you could have a 
GPL profile, BSD, company foo etc</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.02Nov2002">
The next day</a>, 
Derek noted that the project page for GNUe Small Business was 
now on savannah - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i have code to 
actually already check into cvs - just getting cvs ready - 
hopefully by monday it will be 'official' - and you can checkout 
code and everything for contacts and product management</quote>. 
He explained <quote who="Derek Neighbors">its a SUB project of 
GNUe - the 'official' gnue applications will be made using the 
appserver and will be much more intensive - the 'small business' 
applications are 'official', but more a side addition - they will 
be released much sooner but will not use appserver</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek also noted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we are starting 
the legal battles to get fedex and ups api for shipping management 
as free software - but regardless of how we release it that is 
being worked on as well - sales order, invoicing, shipping 
management, contact management, inventory/product management 
should be within next 30 - 60 days</quote>. Charles Rouzer 
(Mr_You) asked <quote who="Charles Rouzer">how are other free 
solutions connecting to UPS/Fex?</quote> Derek replied
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">they arent or they are doing so 
illegally - the way it looks right now (at least for fedex) is 
that if you write a solution you can not distribute it - whether 
its 'free software' or 'propreitary' software</quote>. He said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we have some issues to resolve legally 
- we are going by the letter of the fedex contract (not us, but 
real lawyers reviewing) - we will likely try to communicate with 
them to get written consent to develop free software using the 
api's in some form or another - as the other alternative is to 
'reverse engineer' and play samba like api madness - which we 
certainly could do if necessary</quote>. He was not tempted to 
just <quote who="Derek Neighbors">download the api and write 
something and distribute under gpl</quote> as 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if fedex found out and got pissed 
off, they could kill the project dead</quote>. The worst case 
scenario was that the shipping management would have to be 
done as proprietary software <quote who="Derek Neighbors">that 
interfaces with gnue</quote> but <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we 
would MUCH rather it be free software</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said that the 'code' for GNUe Small Business was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">pretty much all schema's and xml 
files - which is what is great - entire applications beeing xml 
and db schema. Actually i think in the product management stuff 
for right now i only have 1 trigger :) - and that is to over come 
an oddity in my ui refreshing :)</quote> to refresh a list of 
foreign keys for a dropdown, as discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 25 Oct 2002" title="Updating drop-down lists and changeable runtime parameters" />.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.03Nov2002">
The next day</a>, Derek cut and pasted his initial CVS check-in 
for GNUe Small Business. Nicholas Lee (esands) noted the 
GNUe Schema Definition (.gsd) files in the check-in and 
asked <quote who="Nicholas Lee">I assume designer reads gsd 
files and outputs sql?</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">kind of</quote> - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">gsd is an xml file - 
currently you use xslt and an xsl (style sheet) - 
and it makes a sql file.</quote> At the moment, he did this 
from the command line, but it was intended that Designer 
should do this directly in the future, and it might do 
so already. He noted the code for the XSLT was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">all in gnue-common iirc</quote> 
- <quote who="Derek Neighbors">gnue/common/utils/xml2sql/ i 
think has the stylesheets</quote>. Nicholas asked 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">what deb is PySablot?</quote>. 
Derek said that the pysablot <quote who="Derek Neighbors">debs 
arent in sid yet :( - working on it - they are on our 
<a href="http://gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/debian/">website</a> 
though :)</quote>. He warned that the .gsd-handling code 
in CVS was temporarily broken as of time of writing, which 
Nicholas confirmed - Derek was using a slightly older copy 
that still worked, as <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i have 
real world deadlines and others have needs that are watiing 
on us - so expect gnue-sb to move at fairly steady pace 
compared to how gnue apps have gone in the past</quote>.</p>
