<mention>Andrew Mitchell</mention>

<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) needed to check copyright assignments 
for GNUe on one of the FSF servers. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch)
restored his account, setting up an ssh key for access, 
discussing some of the principles of key signing. 
Derek logged in, and said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we have 
a ton of assignments - i think we are half the copyright file 
for</quote> the whole of the Free Software Foundation (FSF).</p>
