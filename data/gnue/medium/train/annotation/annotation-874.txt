<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) asked <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">what 
is the cause of cvs [checkout aborted]: 
reading gnue/appserver/grpc/GEAS.grpc: Too many levels of symbolic 
links - it was discussed earlier</quote>. Jason Cater said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I have no idea what that's from - 
I removed that file from my directory when it happened to me - 
and updated again - but I have no idea what's causing it</quote>. 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">derek 
&amp; i also got that error</quote>. Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
he had asked savannah-hackers if they knew what the problem was in 
<kcref archive="http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue-dev/2002-October/000283.html" subject="[Gnue-dev] CVS Errors" />, 
but they had not been able to help. Derek also said that 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) had told him he knew what the problem was, 
but he was not sure whether Jan had actually fixed it yet. 
The issue was that <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">"GEAS.grpc" was 
replaced by a symbolic link pointing to itself</quote>, 
causing an infinite loop. <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">The actual 
CVS version of setup-cvs.py now provides both an upgrade path AND
removes the recursive symbolic link "GEAS.grpc".</quote></p>
