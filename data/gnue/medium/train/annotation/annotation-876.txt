<p>Peter Sullivan (psu) noted that the first anniversary issue 
of Kernel Cousins GNUe <quote who="Peter Sullivan">has more 
words than issue 1 had bytes...</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) 
said <quote who="Jason Cater">good job - pretty soon, you might 
have to learn to delegate :)</quote> Peter said that 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">group authorship is a distinct 
possibility</quote>. He felt that Kernel Cousins 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">might be a good way for non-coders 
to get involved - without having to dig into the deeper recesses 
of the dcoumentation or the website (our other two big non-coding 
TODOs). Main problem is how I "tweak" the mechanisms of 
group-authoring a KC to fit IRC as the way the other lists work 
is that people claim "threads" via a central mailing list once 
they're finished - IRC != threads</quote> He would
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">not want people to divert coding time 
to write KCs - as that rather misses the point</quote>.</p>
