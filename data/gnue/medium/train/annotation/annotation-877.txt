<topic>Financials (Accounting)</topic>

<p>Nicholas Lee (esands) asked about multi-currency General 
Ledger functionality. Peter Sullivan (psu) said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">you decide on a base currency - 
then wherever you have an "amount" field normally -  
you have 3 - base amount, foreign amount, and foreign currency. 
Foreign currency AP &amp; AR are the real funsters - 
as you have to hack gain/loss on settlement of open transactions.
e.g. raise AR invoice for USD 100 ( = GBP 64) - 
eventually you get paid USD 100, but by then it is GBP 63 - 
so you have to write off the missing GBP 1 as a forex loss</quote>. 
Nick Rusnov (nickr) suggested <quote who="Nick Rusnov">see, if 
we had One World Currency we wouldn't have this problem</quote>. 
Jason Cater (jcater) suggested <quote who="Jason Cater">I vote on 
donuts - of course, currency that can spoil might make saving 
interesting :)</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.02Nov2002">
The next day</a>, Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">For reconcilations 
I assume most multi-currency GLs keep a seperate ledger of (rate, amount) 
figures. What's the general practice for pricing a currency account on a 
given balance date? given that the base currency figure in that account 
represents and average of the prior exchanges, but the rate to realise the 
monies on a balance rate might result in a fx loss or gain.</quote>
Peter, said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">To me, the key principle is that you 
define a base currency - and then all transactions in GL store amount in base 
currency, amount in foreign currency, name of foreign currency. To get "true" 
trial balance you do select sum (base_amt) from balances ;</quote>
Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">That's need for tax purposes and need 
for in order to rationalise transactions within the GL.  From a business 
management point of view though you need reconcile transactions and deal 
with making profit over multiple currencies</quote> Peter felt 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">only if that's useful management information to 
you - I could imagine a biz not caring how much profit they made in Aussie 
dollars, just how much they made on product category X</quote>.</p>

<p>Nicholas asked <quote who="Nicholas Lee">What's the general rule of thumb 
in the UK regarding balance date base currency valutions of a foreign bank 
account?</quote> Peter disclaimed <quote who="Peter Sullivan">I'm not an 
expert on forex, but I believe this is where unrealised gain/loss on forex 
comes in</quote> - <quote who="Peter Sullivan">for balance sheet purposes 
you convert at prevailing exchnage rate at 31st Decembefr - The difference 
between this and what the amount in your books is constitues (IIRC) the 
unrelised gain or loss</quote>. He gave a simple example of an unrealised 
gain. The <quote who="Peter Sullivan">main issue (i am not a lawyer, 
especially a tax lawyer) is how taxman wants you to treat this</quote>.</p>

<p>Nicholas asked what exchange rate to use - 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">the given rate on that day? or by the internal 
rate of sumif(GBP)/sumif(USD)</quote>? Peter said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">I would always go far a "daily" rate in this 
day and age - with computers to do the work for us - monthly rates are less 
accurate - taxman might have a view too</quote>. Nicholas said 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">I'll have to think how to use that in the context 
of hedging your transactions.</quote> Peter said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">hedging if used properly is just a way of 
realising the potential gain/loss - i.e. take a forward position for when 
you expect the transaction to settle (for an invoice, typically 30 
days)</quote>. Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">Depends on the terms, 
for instance many of our transactions are 90 day - foreign exchanges ones 
that is</quote>.</p>

<p>Nicholas asked <quote who="Nicholas Lee">I assume a form of that triple 
is used</quote> in the Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable ledgers 
as well. Peter agreed - <quote who="Peter Sullivan">once the transaction 
is settled (i.e. paid) you'd have a trigger to work out the *realised* 
gain/loss and post that right away</quote>. Nicholas said 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">Actually the commerical system we use, generates 
the variances both on posting (month end) and payment</quote>.</p>

<p>Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) noted that, in Austria and Germany, 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">for the balance, you may not consider unrealized 
forex gains - and you _have_to_ consider unrealized forex losses - 
so you always have to use the "worst case" in the balance</quote>. 
Nicholas was surprised <quote who="Nicholas Lee">they don't try get more 
tax by requiring realisation of gains though. Must be nicer now you have 
the euro.</quote> Reinhard said the aim was to ensure 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">that the balance shouldn't look better 
than it really should be</quote>. Nicholas said 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">Doesn't that depend on your point of view?  
Although the balance in both currencies in the balance sheet is an average 
of past transactions.  At given moment it can be realised into the base 
currency. All past rates are in the past and all future rates unknown.  
Thus there is no true better or worse. Still I agree its better just 
realising fx losses. Otherwise it could cause undue hardship on a businesses 
cashflow.</quote> Reinhard agreed, but said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">with the worst case view it's shure the 
balance doesn't look better than the real future outcome will be - 
it might probably look worse - but that's actually the point of a worst 
case view :)</quote>.</p>
