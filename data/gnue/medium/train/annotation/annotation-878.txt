<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) asked <quote who="Charles Rouzer">how can 
you do secure db connections</quote> with GNUe? 
Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we have full security wrapper 
now - i.e. plugin - that you can use kerberos, pam, etc</quote>. 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">currently we use ssh</quote> - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">so the client is on my machine i 
ssh tunnel port 5342 to the internet machine postgres is 
on</quote>. Charles asked how this would work with client PCs
running Microsoft Windows. Derek said they could use 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">putty</quote> which was a free 
ssh client written native for Win32 - cygwin was not needed. 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we will likely add this as a plugin 
to the framework - so it will create tunnels everything on fly 
for you</quote>. <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the idea would be 
to have this wizard be in the framework and then execute the script 
on demand - instead of have to run externally</quote>. 
Charles noted <quote who="Charles Rouzer">you guys run GNUe 
locally.. but there are TONS of small business people that would 
rather run their small biz software remotely and not worry about a 
server or anything.. its harder to sell a "hacked" solution like 
ssh tunnel until its seamlessly integrated...</quote> 
Calum Morrell (drochaid) asked <quote who="Calum Morrell">err, how 
is an ssh tunnel "hacked" in any sense? it's a fairly standard 
security consideration</quote>. Charles said 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">my definition of "hacked" in this case 
means.. to the end user (newbie).. it may seem "hacked together" 
for them.. if they have to install more than one package and 
configure this and that.. rather than just configuring a GNUe Forms 
client.</quote> Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the ssh 
stuff would be IN the client - i.e. to a lay person it woudl be 
click button enter username and passowrd - nothing more nothing 
less</quote>. Even now, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">it is install 
gnue install putty and click such and such to configure remote server 
done</quote> - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if you were 'deploying' 
you could actually precreate the script - and they wouldnt do 
anything but connect</quote>.</p>
