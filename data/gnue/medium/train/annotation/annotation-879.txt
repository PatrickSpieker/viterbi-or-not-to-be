<p>Calum Morrell (drochaid) asked <quote who="Calum Morrell">what's 
the documentation side of GNUe doing recently?</quote> 
Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) said 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">jason has a nice 
<a href="http://gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/Developers-Guide.pdf">developer 
doc</a> - its a doc for wannabe GNUe Application 
Developers ;-) like me ;-) - not python coders.</quote> 
Derek Neighbors (derek) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">its in 
jasons home directory i think - as its a work in progress</quote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.03Nov2002">
The next day</a>, Jason Cater (jcater) asked <quote who="Jason Cater">have 
you given any thought on how to handle our new GNUe/Small Business 
Edition</quote> for the website. <quote who="Jason Cater">I 
think derek and I were leaning towards keeping it as GNUe
(and so having it be a part of GNUe's website, somehow) - 
we just wanted a separate CVS tree</quote>. Peter said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">I think I would just add gnue-sb to 
the "Applications" section of the site</quote>, noting that 
registering the project in CVS at savannah, the FSF's free 
equivalent to sourceforge, would automatically create a web 
page for the project on the www.gnu.org website. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">we are **strongly** considering going 
to this gnue-??? model for all our gnue stuff</quote> with 
seperate CVS repositories for <quote who="Jason Cater">gnue-forms, 
gnue-reports, etc</quote>. Peter said this 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">gives us an auto structure for the 
web site too - as each gnue-foo will have its own mini site on 
www.gnu.org - with /software/gnue/ as the official entry 
point</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">actually, 
that is one of our hangups - as we were expecting it to be harder 
to do the website :)</quote> However, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">this would let gnue.org be more of a 
community site like derek's always clamoring for - as we would 
always have easily accessible tool sites</quote> Peter said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">well, www.gnuenterprise.org already 
has things that we wouldn't ever put on www.gnu.org - e.g. the 
irc logs</quote>.</p>

<p>Calum asked whether the website should 
<quote who="Calum Morrell">give documentation a much more prominent 
position?</quote> Peter said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">Documentation 
is a funny one - as we only have 1 docs page at the moment - but there 
are at least 3 levels - a) end user docs, b) application developer 
docs (people designing apps with gnue), c) GNUe developer docs</quote>. 
Calum said <quote who="Calum Morrell">I always find it's one of the 
most important link .. and just now it's the 2nd last item on the 
menu, or into community and the 2nd last item, there</quote> - he 
<quote who="Calum Morrell">like to see "GNUe Docs" beside "GNUe 
Community" in the top header</quote>. Peter said that 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">Short term, I may as well go back to the 
old "fudge" - which is to have Docs listed in both Project 
(loghically just under "Downloads") - and also in Community as 
well</quote> until there were enough documents of different types to 
warrant two pages. Calum suggested adding another major category 
down the left hand side for Documentation, and adding a tab across 
the top. Peter noted that the tabs across the top related to the 
three bullet points on the Home Page about "What is GNUe?" - 
Tools, Applications and Community, but he supposed he could 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">say that GNue was 4 things, one of which 
is a repository of docs</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason was not keen on <quote who="Jason Cater">another tab across 
the top - I think we have about as many tabs as we can realistically 
put there</quote>. Instead, <quote who="Jason Cater">I think each 
tab deserve's its own doc</quote> page - <quote who="Jason Cater">if 
we have a centralized doc page I think it's going to be so 
confusing</quote>. Calum felt <quote who="Calum Morrell">if someone 
isn't sure which category a doc is likely to be in, could piss them 
off trying to find it</quote>. Jason outlined how his idea would 
work - <quote who="Jason Cater">the Forms/ page would still list 
all the form-related docs - but from the main menu, you could 
quickly get to all tool-related docs too</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">one of the things we've been 
emphasizing over the last month or so is that the tools get lost in 
the apps - so we're trying to point out that GNue is 3 projects in one. 
I just think the documentation should follow in that focus as well - 
and I'm talking at a minimum here</quote>. Calum said 
<quote who="Calum Morrell">whereas I would always classify documention 
as a separate project, as without really good docs, the tools/apps 
are useless to the less than technical users</quote>. Peter felt 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">we need a lot more docs before any of 
this matters - but that will come</quote>.</p>
