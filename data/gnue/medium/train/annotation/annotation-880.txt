<topic>Bayonne</topic>

<p>David Sugar (dyfet) said <quote who="David Sugar">we are close 
to a 1.1 release in bayonne</quote>, the GNU telephony software 
project. Derek Neighbors (derek) needed to 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">get a frelling copy of bayonne 
working - i just got a new phone that does AOL</quote> Instant 
Messaging (IM) <quote who="Derek Neighbors">and im enamored - 
/me is drooling over possibilities</quote>. David said 
<quote who="David Sugar">actually I have considered adding 
im support to Bayonne....so it can send sms messages and 
popups with incoming call info</quote> - 
<quote who="David Sugar">well, it could though something like 
jabber, i suppose, where there are appropriate im/sms gateways.  
thats why i want to build an im module in bayonne</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">hmm it does sms - grr 
i REALLY need to get a hold of it. the biggest hold up (i know you 
guys hate hearing this) is it needs to support normal modems - 
currently the hardware cost is way too high barrier to entry for 
'free software' developers</quote>. David said 
<quote who="David Sugar">free is not free as in price :)</quote>. 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i know freedom is 
expensive - just free software developers unless commissioned 
directly to install phone software can not afford 500+ for a 
professional phone card. i think if it ran on modems you would 
have a huge user base - i know for myself i would be running at 
home</quote>. David said <quote who="David Sugar">I would like 
to get a modem version running - there even is a start of a 
voicemodem driver, but nobody has been working on it</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i have 3 clients that 
are considering buying hardware - but its hard for me to give 
strong recommendation when i havent driven it myself</quote>. 
He had been working with some Bayonne people to get it set up 
for a client <quote who="Derek Neighbors">so that i can get a 
bayonne install and get an idea for capabilities - and MOST 
importantly start writing applications to it :)</quote>. 
David agreed - <quote who="David Sugar">and most important, I 
think, writing applications that integrate into/relate to gnue 
apps....</quote>.</p>
