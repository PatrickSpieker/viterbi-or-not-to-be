<topic>Designer</topic>

<p>Jason Cater (jcater) noted that Monte Lin 
<quote who="Jason Cater">who uses the debian packages has sent 
in a patch which fixes the Property Inspector issue :) :) :) 
- the one we've been trying to figure out for a year now - and 
it's a one-liner</quote>. Calum Morrell (drochaid) asked 
<quote who="Calum Morrell">is that the "can't edit field with 
scroll bars present" one?</quote> as mentioned in several 
previous threads. 
Peter Sullivan (psu) said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">this is 
the great thing about free software - users who fix their own 
bugs - gotta love 'em</quote>. Jason noted that he had 
previously claimed this <quote who="Jason Cater">was a WX bug, 
and not a GNUe bug</quote>. Peter suggested several 
possible lines of defence for Jason - either 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">the wx docs weren;t clear</quote>, 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">no-one else noticed it either</quote> 
or <quote who="Peter Sullivan">derek told me to do it that way 
;-)</quote>.</p>
