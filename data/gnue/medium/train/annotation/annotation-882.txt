<p>Anthony Liguori (aliguori) <quote who="Anthony Liguori">had 
a quick question about the security adapter layer... noticed that ldap 
and active directory were connected to it (presumably, example security 
plugins) - ldap doesn't seem like nearly enough for enterprise security 
though (and security is a huge part of the app server) so i was 
wondering if this project is going to have a huge dependecy on active 
directory? or are there plans to work on an enterprise security 
layer?</quote> Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said GNUe 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">probably plans to work on something - i very 
much doubt that there'd be an AD dependency :)</quote>.</p>

<p>Anthony asked <quote who="Anthony Liguori">is this the same 
app server that the dotGNU project refers too?</quote> - 
<quote who="Anthony Liguori">the one that supposed to support both 
j2ee and clr</quote> architectures. Andrew said not - 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">the GNUe appserver is written in 
python</quote>, which was <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">a programming 
language - we build the architecture :)</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) 
explained <quote who="Jason Cater">our main goal with gnue appserver 
is centralizing business application rules - business logic, if you 
will</quote> - <quote who="Jason Cater">note that we aren't building 
a generic, all purpose application server</quote>. Derek pointed to 
his <a href="http://www.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/geas_notes.txt">notes</a>
from a previous meeting - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">you will notice 
goal number one precludes use of j2ee and/or .NET</quote>.</p>

<p>Anthony surmised <quote who="Anthony Liguori">it seems that 
the GNUe app server is based on RPC, LDAP, and Python.  
Seems a bit like Active Directory...</quote> Derek disagreed - 
if you had to compare GNUe AppServer to any Microsoft product, 
the closest was probably Microsoft Transaction Server, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">and even there its a bad 
analogy</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said that, as of time of writing, GNUe and DotGNU were 
two very different projects, but there had been discussions on 
working together in two areas. The first was GNU-RPC - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">also there 
was talk by dotGNU folks to look at appserver as something they 
are interested in</quote> as a basis for their own web-based 
application server. Andrew, as <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">the 
main person who has feet in both projects</quote>, said that 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">the gnu-rpc implementation will be 
getting worked on next week</quote> - 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">and appserver will be used</quote>
by DotGNU <quote who="Andrew Mitchell"> where it 
suits  - if</quote> GNUe's <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">appserver 
is not suitable for more generic tasks, then we'll sort something 
else out :)</quote>. He explained <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">gnu-rpc 
is an abstraction layer to allow multiple transports to be 
used</quote> (SOAP, CORBA and XML-RPC) - Derek explained 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">think perl-dbi only for rpc 
mechanisms - again its written in python</quote>. Andrew 
said he was planning to write a version of GNU-RPC in C# for 
DotGNU. Derek said that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">jcater is one 
that wrote gnu rpc</quote> for GNUe, with the fine-tuning 
done by Jan Ischebeck (siesel).</p>
