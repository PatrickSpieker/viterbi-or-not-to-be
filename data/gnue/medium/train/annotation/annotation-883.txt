<p>James Thompson (jamest) was <quote who="James Thompson">testing 
a fix for the wx splashscreen timeout bad window error</quote>, 
as discussed in <kcref subject="[IRC] 25 Oct 2002" title="Problems with Forms splashscreen" />,
<quote who="James Thompson">and think he figured it out - but I 
need to really load this machine down to test properly</quote>.
Later, Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) asked <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">does 
navigator work?</quote> - he was getting an 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">AttributeError: GFUserInterface instance 
has no attribute 'splash'</quote>. James said helpfully 
<quote who="James Thompson">I think the answer to your question is 
"yes, navigator is broken" :)</quote>. He 
<quote who="James Thompson">had two options here - 1 ) keep the 
splash on top for 3 seconds - 2 ) drop the splashscren the moment 
the form was ready for processing - it's 1 line of code either way.
I did 1 as on a fast system the splashscreen wouldn't have been up 
any time at all - but what would peopler prefer</quote>? Jason 
Cater (jcater) pointed out that <quote who="Jason Cater">navigator 
is supposed to always suppress the splash</quote>, but in Forms, he 
would prefer the <quote who="Jason Cater">3 sec</quote> option.</p>
