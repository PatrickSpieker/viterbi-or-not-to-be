<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>
<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Jeff Bailey (jbailey) asked whether GNUe could be used 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">for a simple PO system.  I think it's 
all good for that, yes?  Like it's stable, generally won't eat 
data and all that? Backend would presummably one of our Oracle 
DBs or mysql or something like that.  Clients are all 
win32.</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">haven't had it eat data yet :) - 
I think it'll be fine - as long as you don't have a user
named</quote> Derek Neighbors - <quote who="Jason Cater">if 
that's the case, everything seems to fall apart</quote>. 
Derek (revDeke) defended himself - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">im not sure its EVER eaten my 
data - its not accepted it before</quote> with some of the more 
unstable CVS versions <quote who="Derek Neighbors">but never 
eaten it</quote>. Jeff asked how the screens were accessed. 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">screens are either supplied 
locally, or can be grabbed over http</quote>. Derek 
clarified <quote who="Derek Neighbors">they can be grabbed over 
any transport supported by python - http/https/ftp/etc</quote>, 
using python's urlOpen() function or equivalent.</p>
