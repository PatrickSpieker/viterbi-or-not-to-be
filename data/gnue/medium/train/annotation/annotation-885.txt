<topic>Forms</topic>

<mention>James Thompson</mention>

<p>John Lenton (Chipaca) asked <quote who="John Lenton">is 
there a way to abort a page switch? i.e. the guy clicked on 
a different page but he left this one in an illegal state</quote>. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">you 
could do a form.setFocus(some widget on the bad 
page)</quote>. John reported <quote who="John Lenton">form.
setFocus(widget) changes the focus back to the page, but 
it then changes back to the page the user clicked on - 
i.e. with debug-level set to 5 I get one "changing focus" 
when I clicked on the page tag, and two when I press 
"Cancel"</quote>. He asked <quote who="John Lenton">shouldn't 
the pre-focusout trigger get called *before* the actual switch 
of focus?</quote> James Thompson (jamest) agreed.</p>

<p>John asked how to cancel a page flip, 
<quote who="John Lenton">without writing one trigger per 
page</quote>. This would allow the form to check user input 
amd <quote who="John Lenton">go back to the page the user was 
on if she forgot to fill something in</quote>. Jason Cater 
(jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">the goal was to allow 
triggers to return a true or false based on success/failure
- so if a failure was returned everything stops</quote>. 
John said <quote who="John Lenton">yeah, but the page has 
already changed, even</quote> at the point the pre-focusout
trigger was called. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">then 
that's a bug w/page changing</quote>. John expressed some 
frustration with the wxpython GUI toolkit, but recognised 
why GNUe used it, as it allowed cross-platform GUI so easily. 
<quote who="John Lenton">the worst bug is the 
widget-seems-to-get-focus-but-doesn't - that confuses the 
hell out of people</quote>. This was 
<quote who="John Lenton">the one where you point at 
an entry but just on the border so the cursor isn't acutally 
I-shaped, click, and the | cursor appears in the entry, but 
the focus isn't there - it's amazingly simple to trigger 
that one by accident</quote>. Jason said he had never 
seen this.</p>
