<p>James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">for 
all the appserver developers in the house - jcater and myself 
are wanting to do a normal release of common, forms, reports, designer
- then do what I've been calling a spitshine release at (0.5.0). 
meaning the next release is 0.4.1 - then 0.5.0 comes out with no 
new functionality - (I'm talking common version numbers btw) - 
we've instead focus on code cleanup, docs, bugfixes</quote> -  
<quote who="James Thompson">0.4.1 would be basically cvs that we 
have now</quote>. However, <quote who="James Thompson">how would 
this effect appserver? do we need to hold off on a common freeze 
for a while to get some features needed in there</quote>? 
Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) felt <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">it 
would be better to do both 0.4.1 _and_ 0.5.0 of common 
_before_ </quote> the Application Server team started "breakage"
by adding the features they needed to Common.
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">However it would be good to ask</quote> 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">too - 
because he's exactly the one that can answer this question - 
he always was the personified interface between common and appserver 
:) - and at our meeting he talked about some points he wants to 
change in common - however i didn't get the feeling that they were 
_urgent_</quote>. James said <quote who="James Thompson">ok, the 
main reason I ask is we don't want the appserver needs to not get 
met - and I'd hate to try and say "no new features" if it hurts 
appserver. I'd rather do a series of 0.4.x releases to get what 
you require in there first - we've kind of promised ourselves no 
common|forms|designer 0.5.0 without good docs. Well, one thing that 
I hope to get into 0.4.1 is autodoc support for triggers in the base 
apps - so that it'll be easier to create them for 0.5.0 :) autodoc 
= our command line interface to dump various info about things like 
parameters</quote>.</p>
