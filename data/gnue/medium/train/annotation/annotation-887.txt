<p>Jeff Bailey (jbailey) started to re-build the Debian packages for 
GNUe, so that he could get them into sid (the Debian unstable 
distribution. Derek Neighbors (derek) asked 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">can you commit them to cvs</quote>? 
Jeff suggested some possible changes to the CVS structure to make 
this easier - <quote who="Jeff Bailey">The way I do the packaging is 
that the upstream source is just a tarball sitting in the deb.  
That way upgrades are mostly just replacing the tarball.
I will cheerfully keep that in cvs if you'd like - that would be easy 
enough - but I'd make a new toplevel "packaging/debian/PACKAGENAME/" 
probably...</quote> Jason wondered if his original Debian packages 
should have been marked as for woody (as of time of writing, the 
Debian stable distribution), <quote who="Jason Cater">as they rely 
on python 2.1 stuff</quote>. Jeff found and Jason fixed various 
bugs and other oddities in CVS (such as image files that had the 
executable flag set). Jeff explained <quote who="Jeff Bailey">I'm 
taking a tarball of the CVS tree and stuffing it into my packaging.
Which is mostly jcaters packaging.</quote> Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I actually thought you weren't supposed 
to package against a cvs tree directly - that's why I worked from 
the source tarball</quote> of the 0.4.0 releases. Jeff said 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">It depends on the maintainer. I only 
package against CVS when I'm friends with upstream.</quote>
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said it depended 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">and what level of masochism they 
like - i package from cvs for DotGNU stuff - because i am part of 
upstream :)</quote>.</p>

<p>Jeff finished packaging GNUe Common, and asked 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">Why did you call the package 
gnue-forms-wxgtk instead of just gnue-forms?</quote> Andrew 
said there were other Forms clients available, including 
php. Jason added <quote who="Jason Cater">there's also a 
gnue-forms-curses and a gnue-forms-gtk2</quote> which they 
would probably look to do Debian packages for once they were 
a bit more mature. <quote who="Jason Cater">there probably 
should be a gnue-forms-base or such - as a good chunk of the 
code is the same</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) agreed - 
<quote who="James Thompson">then driver .debs</quote> for 
each seperate User Interface (UI).</p>

<p>Jeff could not find the man files for Forms in CVS. Jason 
explained <quote who="Jason Cater">that's created dynamically
when we package up a tarball</quote>, but could also be 
generated on demand with the --generate-man-page flag. 
James noted that the man pages were not 
<quote who="James Thompson">100% complete</quote>. 
Jeff said <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Even if they're partially 
complete that's fine. The GNU project doesn't support man pages, 
right? =) So having a partial one, and a note to look at the 
texinfo documentation is usually fine.</quote> Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">as soon as I learn texinfo we'll hve 
a --generate-texinfo-page :)</quote> flag as well.</p>

<p>Testing the packages, Jason noted 
<quote who="Jason Cater">it runs - but my intro.gfd shows no 
labels - but running against my latest cvs copy, they do 
show.</quote> <quote who="Jason Cater">I don't see how this 
could have *anything* to do with debs - but its odd</quote>. 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">don't 
try apt-get install gnue-forms gnue-designer - unless you want 
the 0.1.1 version :)</quote> - 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">does gnue-forms-wxgtk replace 
gnue-forms?</quote> Jeff said <quote who="Jeff Bailey">replace,
conflicts, yes.</quote>. Andrew said 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">gnue-appserver had best replace 
geas</quote>. Jeff asked <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Is there any 
value in doing appserver yet, or should it wait?</quote> If 
the only reason was to replace the old GEAS (GNUe Application 
Server) package, he could <quote who="Jeff Bailey">just file a 
bug and have it removed.</quote></p>

<p>Later, he announced <quote who="Jeff Bailey">gnue-common, 
gnue-forms, and gnue-designer were all ACCEPTED into 
Debian as of about 30 minutes ago.  They'll be in sid tommorow.
The geas update will probably wait until next week.</quote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.06Nov2002">
The next day</a>, Jeff asked <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Does 
appserver actually do anything yet?</quote> Reinhard M&#252;ller
(reinhard) said <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">it passes all 
data requests through to the database - and has a very very 
basic function for calling methods</quote>. Jeff said 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">Okay, cool.  I just want to make sure 
if I go throught he effort of packaging it that it's not a 
waste of time.</quote> Reinhard said <quote who="Jeff Bailey">not 
sure about that - it does nothing "useful" now - it's more like 
an empty box that can be filled afterwards - the only reason i 
see it would make sense to package it is for "marketing" 
reasons</quote>. Jeff agreed - <quote who="Jeff Bailey">I'm not 
so concerned about the usefulness.  I just want it to somewhat 
work as advertised.</quote></p>
