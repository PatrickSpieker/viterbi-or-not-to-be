<p>It was asked if there was a php Forms client. Jan Ischebeck 
(siesel) said there was, <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">but not 
very stable at the moment.</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) 
sighed <quote who="Jason Cater">I guess I'll never understand 
this web-based frenzy</quote>. Jeff Bailey (jbailey) said 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">Zero footprint clients save us a 
pile of cash here.</quote> Jason said that was different - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I love the thrill of 0 footprint 
too</quote> - <quote who="Jason Cater">I squeal like a stuck 
hog</quote>. Jeff mused <quote who="Jeff Bailey">I wonder 
sometimes if I'm happiest having never met any of you.

are</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">there is no such thing as zero 
footprint client - web apps need a broswer ive yet to find one 
that is ZERO footprint - to top that off they are all 
different - and EVERY corporate one we have looked into 
MANDATED</quote> Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 or 
higher. He was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">thinking at some 
point of making a 'wrapper' for forms so its a plugin - 
so you can run forms like 'applets' i.e. you go to a url that 
uses forms - and it tells you to get gnue plugin v0.4.1
- you go and grab that and voila now forms works. The sad 
thing is it will quell the 'web freaks' - but in essence it 
is nothing more than normal forms wrapped</quote>.</p>
