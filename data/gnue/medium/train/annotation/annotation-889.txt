<p>Jason Cater (jcater) explained that 
<quote who="Jason Cater">my problem with roadmaps is - it doesn't 
define where we're going - it defines what others expect me to 
do</quote>. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">there are others who can help!</quote> 
but Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">nah, 
no one is worthy of hacking jcater's code</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I welcome help - and I'd like to take this 
opportunity to thank those who have started coding more and 
more</quote>, including Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami), Andrew, 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel), the members of project Papo - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I *know* I missed someone... so don't take 
it personally</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) sniffed 
<quote who="James Thompson">now we know how he feels about my 
code</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">you haven't 
started coding more and more - you've always coded</quote>.</p>
