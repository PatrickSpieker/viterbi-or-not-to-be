<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) reported a bug with GNUe Forms on 
Microsoft Windows 32 - <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">with tabbed 
forms - when changing pages with mouse - after that going to  
the next record - the "content" doesn't refresh</quote>. 
He pointed to the area of the code which would mean that 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">changing tabs with mouse will be 
OK - but PgDn/PgUp wrong - but it's only on win32 IIRC</quote>. 
James Thompson (jamest) suggested a possible work-around, but 
said he <quote who="James Thompson">has no working win32 boxes 
handy</quote> to test this himself. Bajusz said 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">i feel nobody likes to fix win32 bugs 
here :)</quote> James said <quote who="James Thompson">i started 
hammering thru the dcl bugs last nite - so if they are in there 
I'll make as attempt to fix them</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater)
explained <quote who="Jason Cater">it's not so much we like to 
fix non-Win32 bugs vs Win32 - it's that we don;t have win32 
machines handy :(</quote> Bajusz said 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">i think fixing win32 bugs is 
important, cose most of GNUe users will use win clients
- while M$ is so strong in offices</quote>.</p>
