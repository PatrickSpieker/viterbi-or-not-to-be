<topic>DCL</topic>

<p>Jeff Bailey (jbailey) noted that the gcc (GNU C Compiler) 
project's mailing list <quote who="Jeff Bailey">seem to indicate 
that folks there want to switch from Gnats to Bugzilla</quote> 
as their bug-tracking system. <quote who="Jeff Bailey">People 
(and by this, I generally mean Derek) who would prefer that they 
use DCL should probably speak up.</quote> Derek Neighbors 
(derek) admitted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">im a dcl evangelizer
- BUT its more 'work order' oriented than software bug oriented - 
i.e. there are several features missing that would make it 
better</quote> specifically for bug tracking - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">but i think it does pretty darn 
good</quote>. He felt that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">with most 
software you hope you are doing more new work than fixing bugs - 
and i think DCL is FAR superior in task management - but weaker 
in bug management (though it does an ok job of this). If 
'versioning' stuff was beefed up a bit it would be pretty good - 
bugzilla is great for version management, but its really bad for 
end users to deal with (imho) i.e. its daunting to deal with 
unless you use it religiously</quote>. Jeff said 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">I know several people with the same 
complaint.</quote></p>
