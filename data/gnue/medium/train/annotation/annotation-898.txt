<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">I was going 
to compile a comprehensive list of report objects which woudl translate to 
tags/attributes</quote> for XML. Derek gave some examples. Jason Cater said his 
and Michael Dean's ideas had been similar, they had just used different 
terminology. Derek said he had used Quickreports, but would welcome input from 
people who had used packages like Crystal Reports as well, to 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">see what's missing, what's stupid</quote>. At this 
stage, this was reference material, not a proposal. Later, he admitted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">the part I'm torn on is we have two phases - 
pre data population, post data population - some of these are needed pre 
and some post and some both</quote>. It was not clear whether items like 
page numbers and orientation should be part of the XML, as they were 
display-dependant.</p>
