<p>James Thompson (jamest) said they were doing a new release this weekend, 
and wanted to include madlocke's code. Michael Maluck (madlocke) said he 
needed to discuss a few problems first. His postgres wasn't asking for a 
password, as it had not been set up that way - he suggested having a 
<quote who="Michael Maluck">UILoginHandler in a base class or as base class
</quote>. James agreed. Michael said the UI code <quote who="Michael Maluck">can 
display most things... the last I did was data exchange... some things 
work... buttons work...</quote>.</p>

Three days later,</a> in a discussion about Webware, Derek Neighbors (derek) 
said they were <quote who="Derek Neighbors">looking to use webware for UI 
driver [...] that madlocke is working on.</quote> GNUe Forms is designed 
work with any user interface that there is a driver written for. 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">Now the killer thing is if you use something 
python based you can use all underlying objects</quote> and just reimplement 
the driver.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.13Nov2001">
The next day</a>, Michael said he hadn't been able to commit his code yet, 
as he was having to use <quote who="Michael Maluck">WinCVS to checkout</quote> 
and was getting conversion problems with carridge returns/line feeds. Derek 
(dneighbo) asked him to e-mail the code. Michael said there was a problem, in 
that <quote who="Michael Maluck">the only relation between labels and entries is 
position on screen</quote>. Derek said we should be 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">autocreating the lable based off a property 
of entry</quote>.</p>
