<topic>Forms</topic>

<mention>ra3vat</mention>

<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) asked <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">do I need separate 
driver or something to use gnuef with mysql, both on windows?</quote> 
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">I don't think the mysql 
drivers work on win32 without modification</quote>. Later, Derek Neighbors
(derek) said he wasn't sure that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the mysql 
drivers for windows 'native'</quote> had ever been tested - the generic 
Windows ODBC drivers had been tested, but a long time ago. Dmitry was 
also having problems with using GNUe Forms with postgres on Windows. 
Derek wondered if this was a TCP/IP probelm. Jason and Dmitry swapped 
error messages and the set-up information in an attempt to solve the 
problem.</p>
