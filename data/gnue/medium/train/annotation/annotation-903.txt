<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked <quote who="Daniel Baumann">if 
GNUe would benefit from using</quote> the XForms W3C standard. 
Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) it <quote who="Charles Rouzer">probably 
wouldn't be hard to integrate X-Forms clients at somepoint, or redo 
GNUe Forms to use X-Forms methods instead</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Daniel asked if X-Forms was <quote who="Daniel Baumann">feature 
filled enough</quote> to be used for GNUe Forms Definition 
(gfd) format. James Thompson (jamest) said it had 
<quote who="James Thompson">too much complexity for our target 
application</quote>. Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">It's standard in sense its submitted 
to a 'standards body'</quote> but no-one was using it. Daniel 
replied that <quote who="Daniel Baumann">mozilla</quote> was 
implementing it. Derek said he liked XUL, but did not 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">think it fits with what we are 
doing</quote>.</p>
