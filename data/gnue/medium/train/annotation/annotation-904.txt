<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Oliver Vecernik reported some errors running GNUe Application Server
(GEAS) from cvs. Reinhard M&#252;ller said that 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">I think the reason is that you entered 
a non-numeric string when asked for the weight.</quote> 
Oliver also asked <quote who="Oliver Vecernik">Is there a step 
by step instruction</quote> for producing classes and testing them in Python. 
Reinhard said <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">To produce classes you need to write 
.gcd files. For the python test you could refer to the samples</quote> or 
suggested joining the IRC channel. Oliver also asked 
<quote who="Oliver Vecernik">How to shutdown GEAS correctly?</quote>. 
Reinhard said the kill command was the only way - 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">we will add some better way someday.</quote></p>

<p>Later, <a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.12Nov2001">
on IRC,</a>, Oliver (ov) asked about the status of methods in GEAS. 
Reinhard (reinhard) said <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">to be 100% honest 
methods are already implemented but in a way we are not happy with and 
e want to redo the implementation so we don't tell you :)</quote> Later, 
he added <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">forms and reports seems usable
in the state they are now. GEAS was contributed by a company and we 
are now in the process of going through the code and adapting it to 
our needs wrt maintainability, performance etc.</quote> Oliver asked 
<quote who="Oliver Vecernik">is there a possibility to write 
businessobjects for 2 tier and port them to geas sometimes?</quote>
James Thompson (jamest) said it depended. <quote who="James Thompson">We're 
going to try and share trigger/method system - if it works then 
I think you could at least share the methods - the object definition 
isn't possible now</quote>. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said he 
thought <quote who="Daniel Baumann">forms could play with objects too 
and they can execute on the client side</quote>. Ideally, the 
GNUe Common package should handle all of this, and 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">you shouldn't even have to know that the 
objects are remote objects or not</quote>.</p>
