<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>Alan Clifford asked <quote who="Alan Clifford">What is the implementation plan for 
GNU Enterprise?</quote> Derek Neighbors said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">A 
roadmap for the tools has just started to take shape.</quote> 
Although the applications side had lost some focus, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">I 
think we have some consulting jobs that will push feature sets here very soon 
though.</quote> General Ledger, Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable were the 
logical starting point, but <quote who="Derek Neighbors">I think 'real world' demands 
will pull us in other directions. Mainly invoicing (billing) and CRM.</quote> 
Alan asked <quote who="Alan Clifford">Do you plan to do an overall design before you 
start implementation of components?</quote> Derek replied 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">Yes and no.  We were running thought of TWO tracts.  
One tract is the pie in the sky fleshing out of the package/module with review 
from lists etc and incorporation as the 'official GNUe' piece for said item.  
The other tract is demand based consulting type stuff that will be 
contributed back for redistribution but will not be 'official'.
This comes because we have some real consulting demands that will not 
allow us to do it the 'offical' way, but will likely produce usable for 
others software.  We have always had the notion of 'official', 
'friendly', 'unfriendly' etc types of packages.</quote></p>

<p>Alan volunteered to <quote who="Alan Clifford">submit one page descriptions 
of various packages so you can replace the "This is the x package" 
messages when users click on the GNUe package names on the "gnuenterprise.org
" page.</quote> Derek said the documentation was done in 
<a href="http://www.docbook.org">docbook</a>. 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">You can find the source for the documents 
in the CVS tree.</quote> He encouraged Alan to submit a proposal for Accounts 
Payable, using the other proposals as a template. Neil Tiffin said
<quote who="Neil Tiffin">Email the proposal to me in any text based format and 
i will circulate it and put the relevant details on the web site.  Please 
feel free to submit AP or improvements in AR and GL. The current 
specification are not rigorous and need a lot of work.</quote></p>
