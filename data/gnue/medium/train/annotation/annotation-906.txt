<topic>Forms</topic>
<topic>Designer</topic>

<p>James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">we can now 
have a setup.exe for forms and designer. However we should probably come 
up with a default install behaviour for gnue tools on windows machines
</quote>. Some files needed to go into C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM, others to
C:\Program Files\gnue. Jason Cater said <quote who="Jason Cater">an 
alternative installation scheme would be to have two installation 
.exes</quote>, one with just the client software and another one for full 
development. James said the environment variables should logically go in 
the Windows Registry, but no-one was very keen on this, because as James
himself pointed out <quote who="James Thompson">as it sets we 
<strong>should</strong> be able to network install this puppy - registry 
hacks make than tougher</quote>. So for the moment, the client applications 
would just look in their own directory for files.</p>

<p>Later on, James confirmed that they were using inno, 
<quote who="James Thompson">a free installer for windows - takes a script 
and makes a setup.exe from a bunch of files - with the files we have gnuef 
and designer are setup.exe's that install and uninstall nicely - just got 
to work some kinks out of the system</quote>. He later said 
<quote who="James Thompson">we're currently looking for a win32 install 
maintainer</quote>, but there were no volunteers. He finally got the GNUe 
Forms install working, with <quote who="James Thompson">some minnor issues to 
work out</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.13Nov2001">
The next day,</a> Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">testing windows installer</quote>. 
James was hoping Derek 
<quote who="James Thompson">would do up a little intro form</quote> as 
there were no sample forms included at all yet. Derek requested that the icon 
for the GNUe Forms client should point to a <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
default sample form</quote>. Later, Jason confirmed that the sample files 
had been added as a selectable componant, and said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">our windows setup rocks!</quote> Derek said he wished 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we could make the unix setup that damn clean 
and good looking</quote>. But using apt-get would tie people to Debian, 
and most other solutions were proprietry. Perry Lorier (Isomer) suggested 
<quote who="Perry Lorier">setup.sh isn't a bad way either</quote>.</p>
