<p>James Thompson (jamest) did some final tidying up for 0.1.0 with Jason 
Cater (jcater), and said <quote who="James Thompson">so we're pretty much down 
to doc updates now right?</quote>. Later, Derek Neighbors said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we need to make a 'manual' for designer that 
has 'pictures'</quote>, but for 0.1.0, the Technical Reference would do. 
James suggested including <quote who="James Thompson">a URL link to the docs 
then they are always up to date :)</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I still can't get lyx 
working</quote>. James said <quote who="James Thompson">I've written 3 
chapters of a manual while he's trying to just get the dependencies</quote>.
Derek said he'd rather the screenshots did not imply preference 
for <quote who="Derek Neighbors">one desktop over another :)</quote>
to avoid holy wars over the merits of KDE, GNOME or even Microsoft 
Windows.</p>
