<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Jason Cater (jcater) said he had set up <quote who="Jason Cater">a form that 
is pulling data from an MS Access database via ODBC</quote>. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the reason 
this is cool as now we know integrator can be made to convert people from access 
to postgres :)</quote> Later, Jason confimed he was working on native drivers 
for Access, as <quote who="Jason Cater">ODBC drivers will not support 
introspection (so designer won't be quite as impressive running via ODBC) - 
but running native against MS Access/SQL Server/FoxPro with full schema discovery
- that's an upgrade path :)</quote></p>
