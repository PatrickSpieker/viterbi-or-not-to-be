<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) asked how to pass additional commands to the database 
after getting a connection. Jason Cater said <quote who="Jason Cater">If you are 
having to customize one of our drivers for your environment, then we may need to do 
something else</quote> Dmitry said he needed to <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">SET 
CLIENT_ENCODING TO 'WIN'</quote> for his set-up. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked 
if <quote who="Derek Neighbors">this should be another item in the connection 
file?</quote> Jason agreed, and quickly made the changes and committed them to 
CVS.</p>
