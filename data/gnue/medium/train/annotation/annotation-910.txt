<p>Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) felt that <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">the 
win32 forms driver is ready for a 0.5.1 release</quote> but would welcome 
some more testing. As of time of writing, wxPython was still the default 
user interface, but <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">you can use --ui win32 
, if you don't want wx for login</quote>. The next stage in Microsoft 
Windows compatability would be to add <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">a GDI 
report filter</quote> to reports - many cheap "Windows-only" printers 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">talk only GDI</quote> with no other 
printer control language - <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">and unfortunately 
they are getting popular</quote>. Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) reported that 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">dropdown boxes looks thicker then regular entries, 
is that mandatory look&amp;feel for them?</quote> He and Tam&#225;s traded 
screenshots, and discovered that it depended what point size you were using 
for the characters. Tam&#225;s concluded <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">i see 
the problem, but i think this is not a gnue,wx problem, but gui in general, if
you got it on linux too</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.24May2003">
Two days later</a>, Dmitry felt <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">it can't be a bug 
in widget library</quote>. Tam&#225;s disagreed - 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">with pointSize=10 you will see, qt is OK 
!</quote> which implied it was not the GNUe code causing the problem - 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">you will see, that the problem disappears with 
higher pointsizes</quote> Dmitry asked <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">what do you 
think could be done to solve this for smaller pointsizes?</quote> Tam&#225;s
suggested <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">finish qt driver :)</quote>, but 
Dmitry did <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">not understand how qt is better than 
native win32 for windows?</quote> Tam&#225;s thought their 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">gui toolkit (qt), is independent from standard 
win32 gui API</quote>.</p>
