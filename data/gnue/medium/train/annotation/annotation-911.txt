<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) noted that, in the Application 
Server code, <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">currently, the default 
for rpctype is "pw_xmlrpc" - could we change that to "xmlrpc"?</quote>
This was the normal Remote Procedure Call (RPC) method in the Debian 
stable distribution of GNU/Linux. He noted that this defult would only 
apply where <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">no config file exists (or 
the option is not mentioned in config file)</quote>. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) 
recommended leaving <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">the pw_xmlrpc driver as 
default option, because its the only one working on windows in server 
mode and its included in the default python distro</quote> - 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">new in python 2.2 ;)</quote>. Reinhard 
noted he was currently using python 2.1 - he was torn between having 
a default that did not work on Debian stable and having a default that 
did not work on Microsoft Windows. Jan suggested 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">what about a fall back list</quote>? 
Reinhard was not sure how this would work. Jan said that this would be 
similar to the fall back mechanism already in the database drivers.
Jason Cater (jcater) explained <quote who="Jason Cater">0.5.0 introduced 
a fallback mechanism - if you say provider=oracle it tries the</quote>
various Oracle database drivers in turn - <quote who="Jason Cater">likewise 
w/postgres, etc - it may not be working perfectly as this was the first 
release</quote>. Reinhard thought it sounded like this could be used 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">for rpc driver fallback</quote> as 
well.</p>
