<p>Jan Ischebeck (siesel) noted that <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">there are 
some pysablot packages which are required for gnue reports</quote>. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said that Nick Rusnov (nickr) had done some 
unofficial Debian packages for pysablot (a utility to allow python 
programs such as GNUe to access the Sablotron XML programs), but these 
could not be uploaded as offical Debian packages as 
<quote who="Jason Cater">we were waiting for license clarification upstream, 
iirc</quote>. However, <quote who="Jason Cater">pysablot is only required 
for the demo stuff - all the new stuff doesn't need it</quote>. Jan 
asked <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">about the other sablotron wrappers for 
python</quote>, noting that he had <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">tried reports 
doing pdf export with reportlab, great stuff :)</quote> Jason was not 
keen - <quote who="Jason Cater">we tried it</quote>. Jeff Bailey (jbailey)
suggested <quote who="Jeff Bailey">using something else like 
<a href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/python.html">
http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/python.html</a></quote>. Jason had not seen 
this, but pointed out that <quote who="Jason Cater">the xslt processor for 
reports is pluggable - i.e., someone just needs to wrap that package and 
reports supports it</quote>. Jeff thought this might already have been 
done.</p>

<p>Christian Selig (lupo) wondered why Jason was not keen on XSLT generally
for GNUe Reports. Jason said that <quote who="Jason Cater">the idea behind 
using xslt in the first place was that non-programmers could do their 
own</quote> output filters, but <quote who="Jason Cater">after doing several 
ourselves, I don't think that's a reasonable goal</quote> - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">xslt is great for going from xml --&gt; some other 
xml-like format - but going from xml to text, postscript, pcl, etc is using 
the wrong tool imho</quote>.</p>

<p>Jan asked whether <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">the native pdf / ps creation 
of reports</quote> was <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">working already? /me wants 
to printout some tables with chinese characters, and its possibly easier to 
tweak the native ps creation algorithm than to tweak reportlab</quote>. 
Jason was not sure - he thought Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) had 
<quote who="Jason Cater">added some native ps generation</quote> but Jason 
himself was now <quote who="Jason Cater">working on the next generation markup 
- based on styles, etc</quote>. However,<quote who="Jason Cater">it's got a 
ways to go before useful</quote> and he was concentrating on Designer at the 
moment. But he noted that <quote who="Jason Cater">reports can output docbook 
directly - I've been meaning to add an example report to that effect - but 
I'm having to learn docbook at the same time</quote>.</p>
