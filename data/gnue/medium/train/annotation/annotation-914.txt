<p>Warren Turkal wondered <quote who="Warren Turkal">Why is this project 
developing their own schema language instead of using the 
W3 standard XML Schema language?</quote> Derek Neighbors noted there 
was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">x-forms W3 standard as well</quote>. 
Much of GNUe's initial work on its own formats predated these standards, 
and if GNUe did use them <quote who="Derek Neighbors">you have no say 
what so ever unless you are willing to pay big corporate money to sit 
on the board</quote> - obviously impracticable for a free software 
project like GNUe. Jason Cater added <quote who="Jason Cater">Also, 
the XML Schema defines a heirarchial-based schema, whereas our
goal is to create a simplified relational schema without much of a
learning curve. XML Schema is well-suited for replacing DTDs, but I
don't think defining relational databases is a good fit.</quote>
Christian Selig agreed - <quote who="Christian Selig">It is not the 
right thing for describing databases, because we rely on relational 
ones (currently, and I don't think that will change till way past 
1.0).</quote> Leandro Dutra hoped <quote who="Leandro Dutra">that will 
never change! I really can't imagine anything I would not do with a 
relational database.</quote></p>
