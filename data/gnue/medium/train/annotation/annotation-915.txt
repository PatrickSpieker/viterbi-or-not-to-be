<topic>DCL</topic>

<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) asked Jeff Bailey (jbailey) 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">think you can .debianize the latest dcl 
release?</quote> He was still planning, long-term, to convert DCL 
to <quote who="Derek Neighbors">a GNU Enterprise tool</quote>. 
Alternatively, he suggested Jeff might like to help 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">me understand packaging enough to take 
it over so you arent wasting time maintaining something you are not 
directly involved with</quote>. Jeff said that if 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">You can't upload it, so there's no point in 
you maintaining it. The ideal is that you should find a DD that cares 
about DCL.</quote> Derek said he was keen to become a Debian developer, 
and felt that maintaining DCL would be a good place to start. 
Jeff said that there were three steps to becoming a Debian developer - 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">1) Get your GPG key signed by a DD - 2) Read 
the packaging and policy manuals. - 3) Find a sponsor. I can do #3 if 
you have #1 and #2 done.</quote>. He noted that 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">The DCL packaging is annoying because it's a 
PHP app. What's the time frame for turning it into a real app</quote> 
based on the GNUe Tools?</p>
