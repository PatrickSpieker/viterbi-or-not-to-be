<topic>Workflow</topic>

<p>Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) asked <quote who="Charles Rouzer">anyone have 
any thoughts on how workflow is expected to be done in 
gnuenterprise?</quote> - <quote who="Charles Rouzer">Documents can 
TimeOut, be Rejected, Acknowledged, Auto Routed</quote> and so on. 
D Smith (dsmith) noted <quote who="D Smith">At the last 
place I worked</quote> he <quote who="D Smith">was trying to get 
time sheets automated</quote> - <quote who="D Smith">One big big 
issue is that the customer has to sign the sheet. We were thinking about 
ways to let the customer approve the sheet with a web based form.
But then there are security issues. Cutsomers looking at other customers 
projects, etc. With a piece of paper, you can wave it under his nose and 
he will sign it, but try an get them to go to a web page with tricky 
authentication.</quote> Charles said <quote who="Charles Rouzer">I'd like 
to get something started in GNUe so that my app is somewhat GNUe 
compatible. right now, I'm thinking the workflow engine would run in cron 
to automate/timeout/etc.</quote> One solution for this scenario 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">could be the user receives an email with a url 
to the document he must "sign".. no authentication really needed</quote> 
as <quote who="Charles Rouzer">of course the url to that document would 
contain a "random key" to make it a little more secure.</quote> 
D Smith felt that <quote who="D Smith">The whole "customer calls; 
trouble ticket generated; worker logs time; time approved; bill generated" 
sequence ought to be fairly common. Any service industry.</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) said he had <quote who="Derek Neighbors">spoken 
ad nausem about</quote> workflow previously - unlike others, he did not 
see it as <quote who="Derek Neighbors">just another part of appserver</quote>. 
Charles said he would like any work he was doing for himself to form the 
basis of (or, at least, be compatible with) whatever GNUe was doing on 
workflow - <quote who="Charles Rouzer">I guess I'll submit some proposals 
and get ya'lls input then</quote>. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">the key pieces i see as being necessary for 
success - 1. highly flexible (non programmer) way to define flow - 2. 
multiple transport mechanism - for part 1 i think of xml based rule 
flow</quote>, similar to the existing GNUe Forms Definitions (*.gfd) and 
GNUe Schema Definitions (*.gsd). <quote who="Derek Neighbors">for part 2 
i mean just like we are UI and Database agnostic, so too should we be 
'notification' agnostic - i.e. we should support web, email, jabber etc 
etc etc. i had diagrams and docs somewhere - but its been a while</quote>. 
He noted that GNUe Common <quote who="Derek Neighbors">already has rpc 
communication necessary for 'notifications'</quote> and 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">has strong xml parsing engines</quote>.</p>

<p>D Smith said he was <quote who="D Smith">thinking email, pdas, 
text messaging phones, and pagers</quote> as possible notification 
methods. Derek said he was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">thinking jabber 
would be interesting and have jabber embedded into GNU Enterprise framework 
(optionally) - so when you login to a GNU Enterprise application you have a 
little 'message' status bar</quote> D Smith noted there were 
<quote who="D Smith">sms and smtp trasports for jabber.  
Intresting.</quote> Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i suspect we 
will support all of those things - i.e. even within a company someone may 
like IM more than e-Mail - or prefer both. i know most 'approval' things i 
would want email - as IM or a page is reserved for 'important' 
things</quote>.</p>
