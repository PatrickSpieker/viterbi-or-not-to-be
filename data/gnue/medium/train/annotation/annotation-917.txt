<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) said there were other people 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">using my forms under windows - so it is not just 
my tests</quote>, but <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">there are no completed 
gnue-based ERP applications currently</quote>. Christian Selig (lupo) 
pointed out <quote who="Christian Selig">you forgot project papo - 
which is complete, but it is available in spanish only :( - it was written 
only with argentina in mind - but i heard something about papo people 
targeting whole south america in the long run</quote>. GNUe allowed you 
to <quote who="Christian Selig">develop data-driven applications quite 
rapidly</quote>. Any programming needed to be done in python, but 
Christian had found this quite easy to learn - 
<quote who="Christian Selig">it's more like javascript "done right"</quote>. 
In any case, <quote who="Christian Selig">usually, 98% of a gnue based 
application is written in XML - you don't "program" an app, you describe 
it</quote>.</p>

<p>For people looking for an existing free software ERP, 
<quote who="Christian Selig">nola is a web-based free ERP from noguska. 
development has stopped and some other group took it over.</quote>  
Where an application was <quote who="Christian Selig">mainly about displaying 
and maintaining data</quote> without <quote who="Christian Selig">a lot of 
computations</quote>, writing it in GNUe could be very quick - it would 
probably take longer to set the database up than to write the form definitions 
for GNUe Forms!</p>
