<topic>Navigator</topic>

<p>Derek Neighbors (revDeke) admitted he had been dubious about Navigator at first 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">and really thought we needed extendable menu structures 
in the forms API</quote> but, having seen how other ERP packages worked, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think navigator is more the way to go</quote>. 
Christian Selig (lupo) said <quote who="Christian Selig">without a basic RBAC</quote> 
(Role Based Access Control - the ability to set which users can see/use which menu 
options) <quote who="Christian Selig">it is not usable for me</quote>. 
Jason Cater (jcater) conceeded that <quote who="Jason Cater">the original navigator 
was(is) clunky - navigator certainly isn't in its final form</quote>. Derek 
suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">maybe if you could dock it to the main form 
or have the forms open w/in navigator in an MDI type function - i think it will be 
HIGHLY usable - as of now its still usable</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">as with all things I see this as pluggable - I want an 
MDI-like interface that you describe (perhaps that will even become the default .. 
.I dunno) but the beauty of the .gpd -like definition</quote> was that people 
could write their own Navigator client or Navigator plug-in to present the contents 
of the GNUe Process Definition (*.gpd) file any way they wanted to.</p>

<p>Christian asked <quote who="Christian Selig">what do you think about "tabbed 
browsing" for forms within navigator?</quote> Derek preferred trees, as he felt 
they were more intuitive for business people. Derek noted that both SAP and 
Peoplesoft had a menu system where end-users could build their own menu from the 
choices available - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i.e. its almost like a 
'favorites'</quote>. He would try something similar in the GNUe Small 
Business application he was developing.</p>
