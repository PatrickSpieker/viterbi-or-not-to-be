<p>Further to <kcref subject="[IRC] 01 Jun 2003" title="Arias, fork of NOLA" />, 
Derek Neighbors (derek) said he <quote who="Derek Neighbors">is hoping to slurp 
ARIAS</quote>, the free software project based on NOLA, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">and compare it to acclite</quote>, GNUe's own 
version of the NOLA code tree. <quote who="Derek Neighbors">with any luck i can 
run patches against acclite - hen beg you guys to kill ARIAS cvs and use Acclite 
instead - /me garners his evil laughter</quote>. Later, he concluded it would 
not be as simple as that - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">not impossible just will 
be time consuming</quote>.  Chan Min Wai (dcmwai) said <quote who="Chan Min Wai">I've 
modified arias a lot .... really alot....</quote> but noted that much of this 
was related to adding <quote who="Chan Min Wai">Languages translation 
Modification</quote> - ignoring these, <quote who="Chan Min Wai">I think that the 
differenr will be alot more smaller.</quote></p>

<p>Later, as the arias developers gathered on the channel, Derek said that 
the main issues for him with respect to co-operation were 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">item 1 for me is are you willing to assign copyright 
to FSF on all future works? item 2 is are you willing to break all NOLA 
compatiablity and dependencies</quote> Josh Flechtner (jafgon) was fine on the 
first point, but more worried about the second - <quote who="Josh Flechtner">i 
am willing to break for a better solution but not just for the sake of 
breaking </quote>. Chan felt that breakage was not an issue, as long as there 
was an upgrade path. Derek said GNUe could help with this. He felt that 
incompatible changes were inevitable as <quote who="Derek Neighbors">their 
inventory, invoicing etc is WAY too print shop specific</quote>, reflecting 
the needs of Nogasaku, the original authors of NOLA, who wrote it as a GPL 
(free software) accounting package to sit alongside their proprietary print shop 
management software - however, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the HR and Base 
Accounting (ledgers) we might be able to not gut too severely</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek emphasised that GNUe had a very broad vision - it was intended 
eventually to be a free replacement for full ERP systems like SAP and Peoplesoft, 
rather than a Quickbooks or Peachtree replacement. Having said that, the 
GNUe Small Business sub-project had a less ambitious focus - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i see gnue-sb as being a 2-tier small/medium 
enterprise base package - so you would get basic invoicing that works 80% of 
your needs - then a non programmer can modify forms/tables as necessary to meet 
the other 20% for the vertical industry you are in</quote> - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we want something quickly - not something perfect - 
gnue proper (the official gnue ERP packages) are available for those wishing 
to over design a system - gnue-sb belongs to get something out to meet basic 
needs</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said he had gone off the idea of <quote who="Derek Neighbors">porting 
all arias changes back into acclite</quote> - assuming that the changes from 
NOLA to acclite had not taken too long, it would probably be easier to do this 
the other way around and apply the acclite changes to arias, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">then check into gnue-sb cvs or some fresh 
cvs</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">I think I spent 
a saturday night on the restructuring</quote> - both the directory cleanup 
and adding postgreSQL support - <quote who="Jason Cater">so it's probably not 
a big deal to do it again if need be</quote>. Josh said he would still keep 
the sourceforge page for arias up, and would answer any "SOS" support e-mails, 
but would focus his main effort on a joint gnue-sb/arias venture. Derek agreed - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i suspect it will take a little time to get 
gnue-sb up and usable so ARIAS still is an option until that time (another 
reason not to cut it off)</quote>.</p>

<p>They discussed the practical steps involved 
in merging the code base - Derek said the priorities were to 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">get dir structure over</quote> and 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">get schema converted to gnue schema format</quote>.
After that, the priorities, in whatever order people felt was urgent, were 
to fold in the existing Product and Contact support from GNUe Small Business, 
and adding the accounting functionality that Jason had 
<a href="http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/gnue-sb-discuss/2003-03/msg00007.html">requested</a>.
Josh and Chan discussed whether there were any urgent fixes they needed to 
apply to the arias code before the merge.</p>
