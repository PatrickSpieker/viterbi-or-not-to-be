<p>Ryan Grange said that the Supply Chain proposals for GNUe described 
ordering <quote who="Ryan Grange">parts in for shipment to a customer.  
What if you want the part vendor to ship them directly to 
your customer (drop shipment) instead of paying freight twice?</quote>
Peter Sullivan said that, as there would presumably be 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">a mark-up to the cost</quote>, then 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">the way that I would approach 
this is to have a virtual "drop shipping" warehouse, and set the business 
rules so that any goods "received" into this warehouse were immediately
"issued" to the end customer at the selling price. This would enable you 
to calculate your profit/loss on your drop shipping "warehouse" in the 
same way as for the other, physical, warehouses.</quote> This was all 
a bit theoretical at the moment, however.</p>
