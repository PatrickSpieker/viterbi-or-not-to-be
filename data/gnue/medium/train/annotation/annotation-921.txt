<p>John Marciano reported some problems when he 
<quote who="John Marciano">ran the setup.py script 
in each directory</quote>but got an error message for 
Forms. Derek Neighbors 
said that the <quote who="Derek Neighbors">New 
preferred way to install cvs is to run setup-cvs.py 
in the root directory of cvs and answer the questions.
You will need to have wxWindows, mxDateTime, Python2.x
installed.  Also to do database applications you need 
a database and the proper python db driver for that 
database.</quote></p>

<p>Also, for GEAS, John got a message 
<quote who="John Marciano">Please don't try to compile 
this program, it is obsolete and not maintained any 
more - Again this doesn't sound good.</quote>.
Derek explained <quote who="Derek Neighbors">geas 
(the old appserver) is still in cvs because you cant really remove
things from cvs (or in this case we didnt want to) we wanted to leave
for reference.  We changed the script so others wouldnt waste time
compiling it.  The new application server is in 'appserver' 
directory.</quote></p>

<p>John also asked <quote who="John Marciano">is anyone 
using this system in a manufacturing/production 
environment?</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">We 
are getting ready to roll solutions for two or more small
manufacturing / production shops in the next 6 months.</quote>.</p>
