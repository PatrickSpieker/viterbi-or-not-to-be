<topic>Designer</topic>

<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 13 Aug 2002" title="GNUe at Linux World Expo" />, 
James Thompson (jamest) asked <quote who="James Thompson">so 
hows the show this year? more/less people - more/less 
interest</quote>? Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">WAY 
more people - similar percent interest - we have a book deal 
i think if we want it</quote>. He had been unable to get the 
demos working fully <quote who="Derek Neighbors">so i show VERY 
cripled functionality :( - but the marketing slicks are MUCH 
improved - so that helps compensate</quote>. He had gone 
back to the 0.3.0 official releases rather than CVS for 
stability - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the cvs demo doesnt 
work for designer - m/d is dorked bad in both</quote>. 
James noted that master-detail <quote who="James Thompson">works 
perfectly at work</quote> using the 
<quote who="James Thompson">cvs copy</quote> of the code.</p>

The next day</a>, Dan Bethe (dtm) said he had given Derek 
a lift back to the airport - <quote who="Dan Bethe">i 
only got to lwce in time to pack up the GNUe booth! and to fend 
off the herds of mad forklifts!</quote> However, he had had a chance 
to see <quote who="Dan Bethe">gnue for the first time ever!</quote></p>
