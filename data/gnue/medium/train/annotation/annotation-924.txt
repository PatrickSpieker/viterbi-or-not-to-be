<topic>Navigator</topic>

<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 13 Aug 2002" title="GNUe at Linux World Expo" />,
James Thompson (jamest) asked <quote who="James Thompson">does 
the name lbergman ring any bells? they submitted our project to 
the linux fund</quote>. Later, Peter Sullivan (psu) asked 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">can someone explain the lburkman 
joke/reference to me? I thought it was just me, but jamest 
doesn't grok it either</quote>. <quote who="Jason Cater">Nor
do I</quote>, said Jason Cater (jcater) - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I wonder if he signed GNUe up for a 
grant, or if he signed up for a grant using the GNUe banner?
there could be a difference :) if it's the first, I'd like to 
shake his hand - if it's the second, I'd like to know why - 
if it's the third, then someone must be confused because I 
only gave 2 reasons</quote>. Peter said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">the way dneighbo was talking it 
was like it was a known alias - or the name of a prominant 
GNUe/free sw hater ;-)</quote> Jason thought there was no 
such thing as a GNUe-hater - <quote who="Jason Cater">we're 
so huggable and luvable</quote>. James added 
<quote who="James Thompson">we never met a goat we didn't 
like</quote>. Peter said he had <quote who="Peter Sullivan">even 
checked to see if it was a name on any of our screenshots, but no
- unless it is the name of the ship on the Navigator screen - 
USS lburkman</quote>.</p>
