<p>Peter Sullivan said that, just in the same way that
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">the export, i.e. database -&gt; XML, 
bit</quote> of GNUe Integrator was shared functionality 
with GNUe Reports, <quote who="Peter Sullivan">The work that 
Jason and Jan have been doing on the on the schema 
import wizard</quote> which <quote who="Peter Sullivan">will 
now include data as well as just schema</quote> ,
as discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 10 Jul 2002" title="Including data in GNUe Application Server schema definitions" />, 
could form the basis of <quote who="Peter Sullivan">the other 
half (import, i.e. XML -&gt; database) of GNUe Integrator, or at 
least a major building block for it</quote>.
Derek Neighbors agreed - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the 
biggest thing that is missing is the data transformation on 
the fly stuff.  (i.e. Integrator Triggers) and of course a nice 
UI to go along with it.  I think much of Integrator will
become basically reuse of other core code in different ways within
Desinger.</quote>.</p>
