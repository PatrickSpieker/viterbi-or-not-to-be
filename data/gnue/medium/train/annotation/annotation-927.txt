<p>James Thompson (jamest) said that the GNU Enterprise main 
web server, as referred to in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 01 Aug 2002" title="Problems with GNU Enterprise website" />, 
was <quote who="James Thompson">up and I was hoping we'd just 
go to the new site instead of the old one</quote>. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) asked 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">is dcl back</quote>? James said 
<quote who="James Thompson">nope - mail, apache/php, firewall, 
user accounts - that's all - lots more to do</quote>. 
Peter Sullivan (psu) said he had <quote who="Peter Sullivan">been 
working locally on the new site whilst ash was away - but not 
testing as I don;t have Apache/PHP here</quote> - but 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">with a few hours effort this weekend 
we could probably cut over say Sunday to something that is more 
up to date than current site - and we can then add the final 
flourishes (e.g. polls, if we still want them) over next few 
weeks</quote>, suggesting <quote who="Peter Sullivan">Maybe 
we should have a poll on whether to have polls</quote>.</p>
