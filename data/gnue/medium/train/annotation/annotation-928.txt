<p>Daniel Prather (MysticOne) asked <quote who="Daniel Prather">what 
all *does* GNUe do?  Right now is it primarily just a contact database?</quote>
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said it was an <quote who="Daniel Baumann">ERP 
framework - we have forms client, rad designer, navigator, commmon module, etc.
appserver too of course - /me is trying to think if he forgot something</quote>.
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) added <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">dcl, bayonne 
:)</quote> which Daniel Baumann explained: <quote who="Daniel Baumann">dcl is a 
project management app that is under the gnue umbrella and bayonne is the gnu 
telephony server which is affiliated with gnue too - also in the works is an 
accounting system using forms (adapted from Nola)</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) 
added <quote who="Jason Cater">also a Rental Management app</quote>.</p>

<p>Daniel Prather asked about point of sale systems. Daniel Baumann, remembering  
<kcref subject="[IRC] 11 Aug 2002" title="Point-of-Sale systems for GNUe" />, 
said that <a href="http://gibbon.sourceforge.net">gibbon</a>
was looking to work with GNUe. Jason said that he was 
<quote who="Jason Cater">working on point of sale as we speak - 
as I open up a used book store in 6 weeks - and seeing as how I'm a core GNUe 
developer, I'm morally obligated to using GNUe :)</quote>. He added 
<quote who="Jason Cater">not to point you in another direction, but I looked 
at <a href="http://bananapos.com/pos/index.html">bananahead</a> POS and it 
looked pretty darn feature complete - /me didn't actually test it, 
though</quote>, adding <quote who="Jason Cater">of course, I encourage you to 
use us :) - but if you are needing something immediately, there's a 
lead</quote>.</p>
