<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>
<topic>Integrator</topic>

<p>Jeff Childers asked <quote who="Jeff Childers">Has any kind 
of data dictionary or data structures definition been started yet? 
If not, I have a concept that I've been using over the last couple 
years in our development that seems to really shorten development 
time.</quote> Properties/fields of objects/tables were defined 
as either <quote who="Jeff Childers">Primary key</quote>, 
<quote who="Jeff Childers">Surrogate key</quote>, 
<quote who="Jeff Childers">Local value</quote> or 
<quote who="Jeff Childers">Composite value</quote>. 
This allowed you to <quote who="Jeff Childers">add default logic to 
your base classes for data entry controls that determine behavior
when the control is created on a form depending on the data type.</quote>
For instance, primary keys would be <quote who="Jeff Childers">Never 
shown</quote>, whilst surrogate keys would automatically 
<quote who="Jeff Childers">Implement lookup logic when in edit mode 
via right click menu or create a small lookup button next to field on 
init etc).</quote> This had several benefits for control and 
maintanance, in particular <quote who="Jeff Childers">Adding controls to 
forms requires only to set the field ID to enable the majority of
functionality that you typically want</quote> - 
<quote who="Jeff Childers">the control will self-select the
appropriate widget.</quote> Derek Neighbors said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">You are describing relevant stuff to 
AppServer, however, currently I havent been doing a lot of work in that 
area.  I think we need to get AppServer farther along before we can get 
too into these discussions.</quote></p>

<p>Earlier, Todd Boyle felt that <quote who="Todd Boyle">any data 
dictionary 
should be based on ebXML</quote> and gave the 
<quote who="Todd Boyle">One sentence elevator pitch: GNUE is not 
the only application in the enterprise, and will need to exchange 
information with a huge variety of heterogenous applications and 
platforms</quote> whether <quote who="Todd Boyle">During
the implementation/migration phase at the very least</quote> or 
as a permanant interface. He gave some web links for 
<quote who="Todd Boyle"><a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/regrep/">The 
ebXML RegRep specifications</a></quote>,
<quote who="Todd Boyle"><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ebxmlrr">Open 
source RegRep project</a></quote> and 
<quote who="Todd Boyle"><a href="http://www.ebtwg.org/projects/core.html">The 
ebXML core component specification</a></quote>.
Whilst he appreciated that <quote who="Todd Boyle">a 
product-specific data dictionary gives you ease of use, 
and immediate payoff and reinforces 
your own community</quote>, he felt that using ebXML 
within GNUe could help bring forward 
<quote who="Todd Boyle">the day when
individuals and small businesses can conduct exchanges
with each other (as well as large enterprises)</quote>.
EDI had not worked for these groups. 
<quote who="Todd Boyle">If GNUE doesn't help get us 
away from paper invoices, printing and mailing checks, 
etc. I'm gonna scream,</quote>.</p>

<p>Christopher Brown felt <quote who="Christopher Brown">No, 
this puts the cart before the horse</quote> - not all data 
would need to be interoperable, and  
<quote who="Christopher Brown">There _will_ be data on the 
system that under NO circumstances should be released externally, 
such as security configuration and personal information 
(as is found in payroll).</quote> He felt that 
<quote who="Christopher Brown">The point _isn't_ about 
abstract XML schema; it's about the concrete question of what 
DBMS tables are on THIS system, and how do they link to the 
INTERNAL functionality of GnuE, to forms, business rules, and 
such.</quote>.</p>

<p>Jeff looked over Todd's links, and said 
<quote who="Jeff Childers">Personally, I am 100% in favor of building 
an open-standards platform to drive e-transactions. I share your 
frustration with the inefficiency of what is largely a 1,000-year-old 
process</quote> and agreed that EDI was not the answer. However, 
he urged caution - <quote who="Jeff Childers">One does wonder, though, with
all the new acronyms these days, just how many standards one project can
support.</quote> Derek Neighbors said that GNUe supported 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">many standards now.  Most of our
project is in XML.  We support nearly any SQL92 compliant database 
etc, etc.</quote> He emphasised <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we will 
store the data we need.  The software is GPL and certainly with Integrator 
and our other tools you can get data pumped out in about any format you 
want to interoperate with others.  Whether it be ebXML or EDI or you 
name it.</quote> Jeff agreed - <quote who="Jeff Childers">GPL
is as open as it gets. Anyone motivated enough can add a data filter
for whatever standard is required for whichever industry.</quote></p>
