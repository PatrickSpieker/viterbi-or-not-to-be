<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 11 Aug 2002" title="GNUe at open source e-Government conference" />, 
Stan Klein (sklein) reported that he had <quote who="Stan Klein">put 
in the speaking proposals for the DC conference on "open source and 
e-government"</quote>. He noted <quote who="Stan Klein">Even if we 
don't get selected to speak, we should submit material for the 
"conference handbook" I figure there are about 32 speaking slots (2 
sessions each morning and afternoon, 2 days, 4 speakers each 
session)</quote>. The conference organisers would 
<quote who="Stan Klein">send out notifications of acceptance by Friday, 
and we have about a month to get in any material we want to 
submit</quote>.</p>
