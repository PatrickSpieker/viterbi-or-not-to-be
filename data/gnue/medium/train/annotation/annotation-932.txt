<topic>Financials (Accounting)</topic>

<p>Matt Raykowski (sfb-) asked <quote who="Matt Raykowski">how 
GNUe compares to Compiere.</quote> Peter Sullivan (psu) 
said that <quote who="Peter Sullivan">the big issue for people here 
is that Compiere, although free (as in freedom) itself
has non-free dependancies such as Java and (the biggie) Oracle DB 
s/w i.e. unless you have sold your soul to Oracle for a database, 
it's just  a kool but inert lump of code - GNUe is designed to have 
no non-free depends at all i.e. you can use GNUe w/Oracle - but you 
can also use with MySQL, Freebird, postgresql, SAB-DB etc</quote>. 
Matt noted that <quote who="Matt Raykowski">they're making progress on 
PG support though.</quote>. Peter said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">at 
moment, we have tools (very good tools) for building apps - especially 
in 2 tier mode (i.e. forms talks direct to database) - but are a bit 
short on apps themselves as frankly we really want our appserver working 
i.e. would like our official apps to be 3-tier from start</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Derek Neighbors (deke) said that Compiere had a 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">qeustionable license</quote> - the 
Mozilla Public License - which <quote who="Derek Neighbors">does not 
protect developers</quote>. GNUe was intended to be a full enterprise 
resource planning package <quote who="Derek Neighbors">like SAP R/3, 
PeopleSoft and the likes</quote>.</p>
