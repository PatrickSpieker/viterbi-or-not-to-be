<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Matt Raykowski (sfb-) asked <quote who="Matt Raykowski">are the forms 
also stored in the appserver and pushed to the client?</quote> 
Peter Sullivan (psu) said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">the forms at the 
moment contain all the biz logic</quote> but 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">forms can read forms definitions from an 
URL so no big deal</quote> - 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">once we have appserver working well
(there's already a proof of concept version) then the biz logic sits 
there</quote>. He explained <quote who="Peter Sullivan">geas == old app 
server, discontinued - app server = new app server, early in development -  
but not everyone is always 100% consistant on terms</quote>. He suggested 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">trout beatings</quote> for people who got it 
wrong.</p>

<p>Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">on the application side 
we are not far along at all - we havent put the focus there - in 
short if you want to author an HRMS system gnue could do that today - 
if you want to download and 'run' an HRMS system with minimal effort 
we can not do that today</quote>. However, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we are strongly encouraging interested 
parties in helping make the applications - so we can continue to grow 
the tools</quote>.</p>
