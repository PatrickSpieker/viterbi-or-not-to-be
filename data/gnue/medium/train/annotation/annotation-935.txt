<p>Hans Kugler (LuftHans) asked <quote who="Hans Kugler">what's 
wPython.wx and what debian package(s) would hold it?</quote> Jason Cater 
(jcater) suggested <quote who="Jason Cater">libwxgtk2.2-python</quote>.
Hans said <quote who="Hans Kugler">hmm, looks like I've got the 
wxPython modules installed, but gfdes still dies. Do I need to reconfigure 
something? rebuild gfdes?</quote> Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) suggested 
checking the version of python on the default path. Derek Neighbors 
(deke) said that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">likely wx is either not 
installed or installed incorrectly on this machine - we see it all the time 
on red hat where people have 1.5.2 and 2.1 or 2.1 and 2.2 installed and 
install wx but install it for a python other than the default</quote>.
You could fix this by running setup-cvs.py from a specific version of 
python - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">python2.1 setup-cvs.py - instead 
of ./setup-cvs.py</quote>.</p>

<p>Hans asked <quote who="Hans Kugler">which util registers 
the db connections in connections.conf?</quote> Peter Sullivan (psu) 
said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">vi or emacs ;-) - seriously, I believe 
it is just a text file.</quote> Hans had some problems setting up 
a connection for a mySQL database. Later, Derek Neighbors (deke) 
explained <quote who="Derek Neighbors">connections.conf gets reloaded 
when you run apps</quote>. He could not see any problems with 
Hans's setup <quote who="Derek Neighbors">but  i warn you i dont 
do mysql so im not much help there - try  making the name all lower 
case</quote> - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">iirc i had problems with 
this before - fixed it then someone re broked it</quote>.</p>
