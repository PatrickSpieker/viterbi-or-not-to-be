<topic>Forms</topic>
<topic>Common</topic>

<p>John Lenton (Chipaca) asked <quote who="John Lenton">is there 
any reason the names of datasources, pages, forms and blocks invade 
the root namespace?</quote> He added <quote who="John Lenton">it 
feels ugly, and it breaks things. is there any reason for it?</quote>
For example, <quote who="John Lenton">I can't have a form called the 
same as a datasource</quote> and <quote who="John Lenton">you can 
actually name a form in such a way that it conflicts with something 
inside gnue - having one entry point would be cleaner, no?</quote>
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">not in our minds - 
we have a progressing namespace - as you move up the tree siblings, 
etc appear in your namespace. I admit we don't have all the error 
checking in place we need - but this progressive namespace was a feature
i.e., a design decision not a bug</quote>. John said 
<quote who="John Lenton">we guessed as much</quote> but 
<quote who="John Lenton">we fail to see the usefulness of it, and we 
have several times stumbled over it in dismay - perhaps we fail to see 
something you could explain better?</quote></p>
