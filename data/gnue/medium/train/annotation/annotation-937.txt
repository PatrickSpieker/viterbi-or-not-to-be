<p>Michael Goebel reported <quote who="Michael Goebel">that GNUe 
works on my Suse 7.1 distribution with kernel 2.4.0. I tried both 
version 0.3.0 and the latest cvs snapshot</quote>. He said 
<quote who="Michael Goebel">the effort was well worth it. After the
installation was complete (two days), I looked for about half an 
hour so at the form samples. After that I had written my
first functional database form in less than 10 minutes. And it 
worked !! I already wonder what I will be able to do once I have 
actually read the documentation :)</quote>. He outlined in detail 
the steps he had needed to install GNUe, which (in summary) were:</p>

<ul>
<li>He <quote who="Michael Goebel">I already had a running 
PostGresql 7.2.1, downloaded from postgresql.org,</quote> 
enabled <quote who="Michael Goebel">for accepting TCP/IP
connections</quote></li>
<li>He used Yast, the Suse installer, to install the relevant 
python packages.</li>
<li>He downloaded and installed 
<quote who="Michael Goebel">mxDateTime.py from 
<a href="http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/">egenix</a></quote></li>
<li>He installed <quote who="Michael Goebel">PyGreSQL (Postgres client 
interface for Python)</quote>, resolving some problems with
<quote who="Michael Goebel">Making postgres with "configure 
--with-python"</quote>.</li>
<li>To install wxPython he <quote who="Michael Goebel">had to 
experiment for a while</quote> but eventually got it to work.</li>
<li>He downloaded the GNUe tarball from the website and configured 
this.</li>
<li><quote who="Michael Goebel">That's it -&gt; test it by running 
the forms in the sample directory. If in GUI trouble, try passing 
"--debuglevel=10" as a parameter to gnue-forms. If in database 
trouble, also take a look at the postgres logfile.</quote></li>
</ul>
