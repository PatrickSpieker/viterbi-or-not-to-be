<p>Jason Smith (jhs) asked <quote who="Jason Smith">how 
different the latest release version is from CVS 
i.e. should I even bother with release?</quote>
Derek Neighbors (derek) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">its 
not all that different</quote> as of time of writing, but 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">it depends on your interest in 
gnue. If you are just wanting quick eval and end user 
perspective stick with release. If you want to be more 'active'
then i would take cvs. If you are on windows i would take 
release.</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) said that CVS was fairly stable as of 
time of writing, as he had <quote who="Jason Cater">fixed 
various "oddities" in cvs today - /me is working on a 
rental property management app using GNUe and it is coming 
along very nicely/quickly</quote>.</p>
