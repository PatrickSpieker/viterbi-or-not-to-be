<p>Jason Smith (jhs) asked about installation documentation - 
<quote who="Jason Smith">will the install-from-CVS doc 
suffice?</quote> Derek thought so, but noted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">there is an 'installing cvs 
for RedHat doc floating around'</quote>, but noted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if debian you are looking at 
about a 3 minute install</quote>. Although there were no
official debian packages for GNUe yet, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">apt-get install psycopg</quote> 
was a quick way of getting most of the dependancies. 
Jason said he would probably use GNUe with MySQL initially. 
Derek said that MySQL was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">good 
for web work but serious issues for 'real' work :)</quote>.
He personally was preferring SAP-DB more and more, 
as discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 30 Jun 2002" title="SAP-DB community" />. 
To install CVS once it was downloaded, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">from the root cvs directory
type ./setup-cvs and answer the questions - and thats it.
Try gnue/forms/samples/intro/intro.gfd sample after that.
If it works then change entry in connections.conf and try a db 
form :)</quote></p>
