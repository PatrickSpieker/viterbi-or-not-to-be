<topic>DCL</topic>

<p>Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) mentioned that 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">derek seems to be worried about
dcl &amp; gnue debs</quote> (as discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 30 May 2002" title="Debian packages for GNUe and DCL" /> 
and previously) - 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">especially as there's a security release 
of DCL due out</quote>. Jeff Bailey (jbailey) said he believed 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">there's 0 people using the old DCL 
debs now.  So at least the annoyance of making it upgrade friendly 
is gone.</quote></p>

<p>Later, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked Jeff 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">to check in what he had for dcl 
debs</quote>. Jeff explained his current debs for DCL were a 
quick fix for himself, <quote who="Jeff Bailey">So it's not 
suitable for checking in</quote> to CVS. He could 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">just upload them</quote> if necessary. 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">basically i need debs 
for dcl (and i know you are busy) - but rather than start from 
scratch i was hoping to pick up where ever you left off if 
possible. I have a security release i hope to bundle tonight in 
tar/gz format and would be killer if i could offer debs at that 
time as well</quote>. Jeff said he would 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">probably have a bit of time tonight to 
putit together for you.  IT's easier than explaining what I've 
done. Then you're welcome to update yourself after, or have me or 
another DD do it.</quote>. Derek said he would get a tarball to 
him soon - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i have to do some testing 
still on faq/project sections but if you can package that and feel 
comfortable giving me something to commit to cvs would be 
great</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.07Jul2002">
Two days later</a>, Jeff wondered <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Why 
doesn't dcl use a makefile like every other project out there? 
=)</quote>. Derek said he was not keen on make, but 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">certainly if you need a make file 
create one</quote>. Jeff said <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Lemme 
throw a simple one together. I'll cheerfully maintain it ongoing.
Since otherwise I'd pretty much be doing so for the package 
anyway.</quote>.</p>

<p>Jeff and Andrew tried to work out where the various DCL files 
needed to go to comply with Debian guidelines. 
Jeff noted that the Debian guidelines said 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">that web apps go somewhere under 
/usr/share/doc/PACKAGE/ - That doesn't seem right, though.</quote>
He had a look at the Debian package for Sourceforge, but 
that did not seem to be a good model. He decided 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">/usr/share/dcl/www for the web root - 
scripts under /usr/share/dcl - docs under /usr/share/doc/dcl/ - 
config file in /etc</quote>.</p>

<p>He was not sure what to do with the 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">attachments directory</quote> 
as the DCL application <quote who="Jeff Bailey">wants to *Write* 
there</quote>. Andrew said this was <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">for 
email attachments sent thru - eg, submitting stuff to 
designer-support@gnuenterprise.org, with a patch attached</quote>. 
Jeff considered various possible locations, and wondered about 
using /var/spool - <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Esp. if it's a temp 
holding pen, and not permanent storage</quote>, quoting the 
guidelines that <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Data in /var/spool 
represents work to be done in the future (by a program, user, or 
administrator); often data is deleted after it has been 
processed</quote>. Andrew noted that squirrelmail did something 
similar.</p>

<p>Jeff also wondered about <quote who="Jeff Bailey">The 
templates/custom</quote> as <quote who="Jeff Bailey">if 
it's not in /etc or /var, it's going to get overwritten on 
upgrade.</quote> Andrew said that 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">templates/custom looks like it 
is for site-customisation</quote> and suggested
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">so perhaps put it in var, and 
symlink it into the webroot?</quote>. However, 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">that'd require apache to follow 
symlinks</quote>. Jeff suggested /etc - 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">I guess the question is it more state 
data or configuration file? =)</quote>.</p>

<p>Jeff tried to compile the Debian package, and 
reported <quote who="Jeff Bailey">No errors</quote>, but some 
warnings - <quote who="Jeff Bailey">6 of which are that upstream 
appears to have made some files gratuitously execuatble.</quote>
He reported <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Right, first cut DCL debs 
available</quote>, adding <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Bug reports 
should just be emailed to me, and I'll get them through as quick 
as I can.</quote> Later, Derek thanked Jeff and said he 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">will try to test today and will put 
a call out on the home pages and announce for testing</quote>.</p>
