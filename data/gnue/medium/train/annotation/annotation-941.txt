<p>Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked where he could find a
Debian packages for pysablot, the python wrapper for 
sablotron, the XML processor that people had been using 
for GNUe Reports. Jason Cater (jcater) said he had them 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org~/jcater/debian/">mirrored</a>, 
but warned <quote who="Jason Cater">don't ask me questions about 
xslt syntax - 'cause I'd have to lie</quote>. Derek Neighbors 
had done all of the work on the xsl files for Reports - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I've tried to learn it some -
but haven't spent much time</quote>. He added 
<quote who="Jason Cater">btw, when I was learning it, 
the material on the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a>
had the best tutorial</quote>.</p>
