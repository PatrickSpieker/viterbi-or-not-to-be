<p>Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) posted the source for a form he was 
having problems with - he had checked that 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">there does exist database, table, 
data on it</quote>. Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) had a 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">problem with date fields</quote> - 
they were <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">getting localized representation 
which is not accepted by postgres</quote>. Arturas said that his 
work on i18n internationalisation had not included date formats - 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">their format as i remember is coded 
directly in the source</quote>. Dmitry noted that the comments in 
the DateMask.py file admitted <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin"># TODO: 
This is obviously not Internationalized!</quote>.</p>

<p>He asked James Thompson (jamest) <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">is 
it possible with formatmask(displaymask..) to have datetime data 
passed always in mm/dd/yy format to a db backend?</quote> 
James said <quote who="James Thompson">the displayhandlers store in 
a format different than they display - i don't recal the 
details</quote>. Dmitry said <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">now it 
represented it in long format with localized weekdays names which 
did not accepted by postgres</quote>. He would 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">like temporary leave it in mm/dd/yy 
via forms, did it now with export LC_TIME=C</quote>.</p>
