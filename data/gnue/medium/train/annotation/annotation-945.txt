<topic>Application Server</topic>

<mention>Jan Ischebeck</mention>

<p>Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">if you wouldn't mind if I wrote a schema 
and odlml xml parser and write some xslt stuff too for the "object" 
format in the appserver. We can write some transformations to go to ODL. 
I have been readin GParser a bit and it makes sense.</quote> 
Reinhard said that he personally would probably never use 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">a parser for odlml xml class definition 
files</quote> - he was <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">not sure if it 
is worth doing</quote> but he would not stop Daniel if he was interested. 
Daniel said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">well it lets me play with xml 
;)</quote> - more practically, <quote who="Daniel Baumann">all the other 
xml elements in the various gnue formats are GObj based objects</quote>, 
so using an XML-based format might allow re-use of concepts like triggers.</p>

<p>Reinhard said that, <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">working _daily_ with 
a buttload of different business application _users_</quote> his perception 
was <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">most of them give a sh*t about wheter 
something is in XML or in foo</quote> - <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">what 
they want is a stable working usable business software that is easily extensible
- to some degree extensible by an _average_ business user. However as derek 
likes to say "gnue will be all things to all people" - so i guess someday gnue 
will be ODMG compilant as well as easy to extend and performant and all the 
other things we want it to be</quote>.</p>

<p>Daniel said he was <quote who="Daniel Baumann">I am just trying to leverage 
all the hard work that jcater and jamest have put into "common" - seems like 
what you want can be defined at a higher level, like a business rule design type 
thing that people can use</quote>. Reinhard emphasised this was just his 
personal opinion, <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">and i might not see all 
sides of the coin</quote>. Daniel said that Jan Ischebeck had been 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">implementing the same ideas in _featuretest plus 
some of the things he was bringin to the table</quote>. Reinhard said he 
had <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">lost track about what jan is doing as 
well - and i'm positive we might have different opinions on some topics</quote>. 
He really needed more time and/or sleep to catch up.</p>
