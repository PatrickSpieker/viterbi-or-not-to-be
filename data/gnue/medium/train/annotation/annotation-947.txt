<topic>Forms</topic>

<mention>ra3vat</mention>

<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) asked <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">how 
to get value (for later calculation) of a field in a trigger, just 
blockname.fieldname returns instance type, not numeric(or string) 
type</quote>. Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) said 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">in my forms i used like 
'print pgName.blkName.entryName' in trigger - this worked (now my 
cvs copy is broken, so i can't check it)</quote>. Dmitry 
suggested <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">oh, may be converting to str 
first would help - seems , that worked</quote>.</p>

<p>He said it <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">seems i'm uncompartible with 
triggers</quote>. Arturas suggested <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">feed 
them with chocolate? :)</quote>. Dmitry pasted his code, and said he 
could not <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">get calc.qnty value printed</quote>, 
but this proved to be a typo. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) origianally 
suggested <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">print "%s" % calc.qnty, 
perhaps?</quote> but then realised <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">hmm, 
maybe print is not best to use from form? perhaps the forms client is 
capturing stdout? /me used GDebugMesg</quote>. Dmitry confirmed he had 
resolved the problem, but asked <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">how to exclude 
calculated field from tab order?</quote>. Arturas said 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">make it readonly :)</quote>, using the 
readonly="" parameter for the entry tag.</p>
