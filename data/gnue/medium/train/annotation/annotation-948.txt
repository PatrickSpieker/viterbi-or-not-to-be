<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) said he had a <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">tabbed 
form with calculated field that works when you insert data row by row, 
how to get it working when I switch between tabs or run query? what kind of 
trigger should i add?</quote> James Thompson (jamest) said 
<quote who="James Thompson">on forms like that i used to create a named 
trigger then put a post-change (IIRC) trigger that referenced the named 
trigger on all fields involved in the calculation - that should work for 
queries</quote>. This meant that <quote who="James Thompson">instead of 
having the trigger definition on each entry 
contain the trigger text I just point them at the named trigger.
It's been months since I looked/tested that - 
gnue/forms/samples/button/forms contains named trigger example</quote>. 
Dmitry asked <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">one more question is there a 
trigger that is fired one time on form's startup?</quote>. 
Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) suggested <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">you 
can try with focus-in for the first entry in the form - it should get 
focus bu default</quote>. James said <quote who="James Thompson">if 
that works it's an interesting hack - as we don't have any type of on 
startup trigger but we need one</quote>.</p>
