<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said that things were 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">hectic</quote> preparing 
for GNUe's stand at Linux World Expo in San Fransisco
in August. He said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">a. we 
need marketing materials - b. we need to have them 
printed :)</quote> He thought that Jason Cater (jcater) was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">probably best situated to design 
(a)</quote> but was not sure about printing. 
He had <quote who="Derek Neighbors">got for free a nice 
display to hold trifoldss - its probably 20x15 or larger clear 
plexiglass so you can insert your own print - then it has the 
holder on it for the trifolds. I was thinking if we can get low 
cost trifold even b/w with a nice insert for the holder i can 
place that on the main table - as a help yourself kind of 
thing</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">any 
marketing materials I produce will be available in press-ready 
PDF</quote> for ease of printing.</p>
