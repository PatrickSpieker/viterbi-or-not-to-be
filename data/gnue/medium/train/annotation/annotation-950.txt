<mention>James Thompson</mention>

<p>Problems were reported trying to get GNUe to 
run from CVS on Debian woody. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">in the root of cvs there should 
be setup-cvs.py or setup-cvs.sh (i cant recall which) - run that 
instead and answer the questions</quote>. He noted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">this lets you run cvs and production 
at same time if needed and gives much greater controll of where 
things are and such</quote>. Later, James Thompson (jamest) 
confirmed that gfcvs was the CVS version of the code, whilst 
gfclient was the production/official release. Jason Cater 
(jcater) confessed <quote who="Jason Cater">/me broke cvs 
designer last night - /me will fix tonight</quote>.</p>
