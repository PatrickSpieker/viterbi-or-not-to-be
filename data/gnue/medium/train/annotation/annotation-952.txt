<p>Derek Neighbors (revDeke) asked whether there were going to be 
Debian packages (debs) for 0.4.3 of gnue <quote who="Derek Neighbors">as 
0.5.0 will probably be in the cooker a bit before its announced as stable 
and we are getting ready to dig into gnue-sb pretty hard and it will 
target 0.4.3 until 0.5.0 is stable</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek was interested whether case insensitive queries in 0.4.3 would be
implemented. James Thompson (jamest) answered negatively. Derek asked 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">will this be in 0.5.x? Or would it be too 
rough to back port into 0.4.3</quote>? James was 
<quote who="James Thompson">pretty sure it's a trivial addition - ilike 
support needs added to the GCondition/Datasource</quote>. Derek thought 
it probably should be <quote who="Derek Neighbors">a property in the 
entry or datasource (or both)</quote>. Easier to implement should be 
by form with a gnue.conf option (so it sets it for all forms). This would 
be almost enough for now, and would work well with gnue-sb. Jeff Bailey 
(jbailey) said <quote who="Jeff Bailey">my needs are mostly case 
insensitive matches to company names and people's names.</quote> It 
should be in the whole framework. Jason Cater (jcater) noticed that ilike 
(case insensitive like) is not sql92 (<quote who="Jason Cater">it might 
be sql99</quote>). Also, <quote who="Jason Cater">we can't just throw 
in upper() into the queries</quote>. James said he had 
<quote who="James Thompson">no issue with forms doing it as my own 
users use mixed case data</quote>. Jeff offered pushing down to the DB 
layer a flag so that each DB could do this it's own way. James had to 
think about this more. Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) found the only solution for 
oracle - <quote who="Mike Vincent">the use of lower() or upper() in 
the query</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Derek asked what was the <quote who="Derek Neighbors">eta's 
on 0.5.0</quote>. Jason said it would not be within 3 weeks.</p>
