<p>Derek Neighbors (grassHopper) said that GNUe Small Business was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">not ready for prime time usage - 
0.1 should be out shortly but it will be product management and 
contact management in a base form - you can grab the cvs</quote>.
There was a createdb.sql script for PostgreSQL which needed to 
be run, then <quote who="Derek Neighbors">setup your 
connections.conf file to point to dbname with gnue_sb as the</quote>
connection name, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">and start running 
the forms - all forms under 'item' directory should work at this 
point except item_maint.gfd</quote>. It was asked whether each 
form had to be run seperately. Christian Selig (lupo) asked if 
there were <quote who="Christian Selig">any navigator files in 
current gnue-sb??</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">not functioning ones</quote> -
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">you have to run gnue-forms 
filename.gfd</quote> as of time of writing.</p>
