<topic>Small Business</topic>

<p>Nicholas Lee (esands) suggested that GNUe Small Business should 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">Target sql-ledgers feature set.  Except 
for a few niggles it does the job.  Ignore SL's schema and 
code.</quote> Derek Neighbors (derek) disagreed - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i would be much more likely to start 
with NOLA - /me assumes people liking sql-ledger will like it and 
GNUe isnt for them - those wishing to have something they can 
extend and has clean data structures will look for gnue-sb</quote>.
He felt sql-ledger was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">very nice for 
the market that is using it - it certainly is more functional than 
gnue-sb</quote> as of time of writing <quote who="Derek Neighbors">and
there is something to be said for working code :)</quote>
However, he felt the inability <quote who="Derek Neighbors">to 
reconcile a ledger</quote> indicated a different target audience.</p>
