<p>Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">how 
is designer improving?</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">it requires wx2.6 now - so the first 
change was getting it stable on 2.6. Then I stopped using GNUe 
Form's ui drivers to draw widgets in real-time on the layout 
canvas - I now draw my own objects on my own canvas object - 
this gave me a tremendous amount of control over the canvas - 
so things "just work" on it now - like rubberband 
boxes, etc. I also reworked the property editor - which as it 
turns out - was solely responsible for the 2+ second delay
between clicking on a widget, and having designer actually 
select that widget. Actually, that will be the extent of the 
changes before I declare designer "stable" again - 
but there's a lot of under the hood cleaning (comments, better 
variable naming, etc)</quote>.</p>

<p>Jan said that he was <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">thinking how 
to enable designer to create appserver designs</quote>, alongside 
its current role as a designer for Forms and Reports. Jason 
said he definantly wanted <quote who="Jason Cater">to tackle that 
after I get forms support stable again</quote> but he had not 
given much thought to how an Appserver Designer would actually 
work yet - it needed to be a tool for end users who were 
not programmers but who understood the business process they 
were trying to model.</p>

<p>For the current (Forms-related) version of Designer, Jason 
was <quote who="Jason Cater">not *that* far away from wanting 
alpha testers - if I can get in a couple of solid days of programming, 
I think it'd be where I want it at</quote>.</p>
