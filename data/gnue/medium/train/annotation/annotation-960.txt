<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Jason Cater (jcater) asked <quote who="Jason Cater">how far are we 
featurewise from considering a 1.0 release</quote> for GNUe Forms. 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I only ask because I see so many projects 
where our 0.6 is comparable to their 1.6 or even 2.6</quote>. This 
made no difference to him, but it maybe affected 
others' willingness to use GNUe. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) 
said <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">there is one psychological thing 
here for me - as long as we are 0.x I feel like having the right to 
break compatibility - as soon as we are 1.0 I think we morally have 
the obligation to stay compatible with every single feature or 
misfeature that is in the code. I seriously would like to see a 0.9 
or comparable being in use for &gt; 6 months without much happening - so 
we know it's stable enough</quote>, both in terms of bugs and in 
terms of not needing new features that would break 
backward-compatability.</p>
