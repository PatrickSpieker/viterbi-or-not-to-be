<p>Reinhard M&#252;ller officially announed <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">
the decision to rewrite the GNU Enterprise Application Server from 
scratch. The rewrite will take place in python. We have decided to keep
the acronym "GEAS".</quote> There was a 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~reinhard/whitepaper">whitepaper</a> 
available for comments. <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">The next step 
would be to define the interface GEAS shows against the front 
end</quote>, which would be done in the next few days/weeks. Charles 
Rouzer suggested <quote who="Charles Rouzer">I would like security and 
authentication seperated in the white paper</quote>, as authentication 
could be done via the database back-end, whilst security could be done 
using <quote who="Charles Rouzer">Role Base Access Control 
(RBAC)</quote>, which could be tied <quote who="Charles Rouzer">into 
future OSs that also implement RBAC</quote>, as previously 
discussed. Reinhard agreed these were important, but said they were 
both aspects of <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">
the single big and important goal that the system must be secure.</quote>
However, <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">
I am 100% sure we will come back on viewing these points seperate as
soon as we talk about implementation details.</quote>.</p>

<p>Some days later, 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.09Mar2002">
on IRC</a>, Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked <quote who="Daniel Baumann">
what are the current geas assignments?</quote>. Derek Neighbors (derek) 
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we need to use DCL for our todos - i 
think the big current item is to document common</quote>. Daniel was keen 
to do some work on API design - this would be for 'internal' APIs within 
GEAs <quote who="Daniel Baumann">or comething that will go in common 
if we chose to put it there</quote>. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) 
suggested basing any API proposals on 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">neilt's drawing</quote>. He said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">the most 
important interface is what GEAS (as a whole) shows against forms
- the "external" API of geas so to speak</quote>. Daniel 
suggested <quote who="Daniel Baumann">I would think for that forms 
would use OQL</quote>, adding <quote who="Daniel Baumann">ODMG has a 
bunch of interfaces</quote>. Reinhard suggested 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">i think we must discuss with jamest 
what would make most sense to him</quote>.</p>

<p>Reinhard confirmed that Derek had requested 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">GEASv2 still is named geas - and said 
that it would be no problem to remove all docs from the web and 
everywhere that refer to the first implementation and are not longer 
valid - however i'd like to ask <cite>who</cite> will do this 
removement</quote>.</p>

<p>Daniel suggested <quote who="Daniel Baumann">we should fiogure out 
what parts are "common" to geas arhitecture - probably 
security and protoclo adapters can be factored out into common</quote>. 
He suggested <quote who="Daniel Baumann">I think the diagram could be 
much refined altogether...maybe that's what I'll start with, breaking 
things down further</quote>. Reinhard said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">that's why i think we need a lot of 
communication with jcater and jamest - much more than before</quote>. 
Daniel agreed - <quote who="Daniel Baumann">we shooting toward a much 
more integrated GNUe :) [...] this is good for unity, because too long 
have various parts just been "distant" - it was like talk to 
me at an arms length (CORBA)</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.11Mar2002">
Two days later</a>, 
Reinhard confirmed that <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">the geas 
that is currently in the downloads area or in cvs is the 
"old" incarnation and we have stopped development on that. 
A complete rewrite from scratch is just about to be started</quote>. 
This meant that any time spent trying to get the existing GNUe 
Application Server (GEAS) to run would likely be wasted. He said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">i guess what i'm saying is - there is no 
"geas" at the moment - the old has died - the new has not yet
been born - but keep your eyes open - the new one will arrive soon 
:)</quote> On timescales, he noted <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">
currently all of GNU Enterprise is volunteer work - we all do it in our
spare time</quote>. However, <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">remember you
can use GNU Enterprise in 2-tier and in n-tier mode - 2-tier means 
forms talks directly to database - this is very usable already and it 
<cite>is</cite> used in production at several places</quote>.</p>

<p>On the new GEAS, Reinhard thought <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">it 
will be some months until that constellation is usabel in 
production</quote>, but this could be speeded up considerably if an 
external company was willing to lend programmers to help. He said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">the new incarnation of the application 
server will be written in python - however python is very easy to 
learn</quote>, and boasted <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">i still have 
to see the man that started to learn python and did not like it 
:)</quote>. Derek (dneighbo) said that there was no real 
documentation on the new GEAS yet, but there was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">some 'precusory' stuff</quote> 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~reinhard/whitepaper/">
on the website</a>.</p>
