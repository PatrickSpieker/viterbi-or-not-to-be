<topic>Application Server</topic>


<p>Emmanuel Salvador reported a problem with the configure 
script for GNUe Application Server 0.0.5 and posted his 
<quote who="Emmanuel Salvador">log file</quote>, which 
showed the problem was with the uuid header file. 
Jens M&#252;ller noted that <quote who="Jens M&#252;ller">
The Debian package</quote> for GEAS listed libuuid1 
as a dependancy. Reinhard confimed this, saying 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">uuid.h is a part of the 
ext2fs package</quote> and explained where to find it. 
However, he warned <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">
that geas-0.0.5 is a development version and does about
nothing that would be usable to the end user</quote>. It 
was also about to be made obsolete by the 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">rewrite of GEAS</quote> now 
under way.</p>
