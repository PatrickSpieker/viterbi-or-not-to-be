<p>In an attempt to conclude 
<kcref startdate="07 Mar 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="Debian packages for GNUe" />,
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">nickr 
think i could sucker you into fixing our debian packages?</quote>. 
Nick Rusnov (nickr) asked <quote who="Nick Rusnov">are they broken 
again? - the bugs that I had filed god closed.</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think common is busted - as designer 
cant find some images - and the .conf file doesnt get created only the 
sample</quote>. Nick asked <quote who="Nick Rusnov">are they based on 
a release or CVS?</quote>. Derek wasn't sure - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">eventually i would like to see - 
gnue-forms, gnue-appsever, gnue-designer, gnue-common - then a tasksel 
for gnue</quote>, and eventually seperate versions of common for each 
database backend, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">just like apache does 
with its 'modules'</quote>. It would be interesting to have 'dev' 
packages for the CVS versions as well - Nick said 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">-cvs is the normal suffix for cvs 
stuff</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">for now just 
release no other frills is cool by me :)</quote>.</p>
