<p>Continuing 
<kcref startdate="03 Feb 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="Document Storage/Content Management for GNUe" />,  
Nick Rusnov (nickr) provided Stuart Bain (stbain) with 
<a href="http://nick.industrialmeats.com/proj/document-store/gnue/spec/Document-Store/documentstorespec.html">
a link</a> to his document store proposals. He said 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">the storage part is pretty simple - the 
library will be the fun part.</quote>. Stuart said the 
<quote who="Stuart Bain">indexing, sorting, searching</quote> would be 
the difficult part. Nick said it would use 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">GnUe Common - I believe that it provides DB 
neutrality</quote>. The front end would be through 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">forms/web/whatever - all the various objects 
are RPC and 'trustless' or reduced trust relationships - so your client
just has to speak RPC</quote>. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) confirmed 
that Common would provide datanbase and RPC abstraction, but said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">currently only good docs for common are 
the source :( - we do plan on changing that though</quote>.</p>
