<p>Todd Boyle replied to Zachary Coffin' e-mail in 
<kcref startdate="21 Feb 2002 18:46:04 -0800" subject="ERP Standards" />, 
noting <quote who="Todd Boyle">More of your word-count is directed at 
me, as a person than on issues.</quote>. After discussing the issues 
raised in Zack's e-mail point by point, he concluded 
<quote who="Todd Boyle">Give us a GL schema.  Not a taxonomy for XBRL.
No more delays or manuevers.</quote> Derek Neighbors reprised the 
issue of membership fees for standards bodies, noting 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">Anything above no cost for a group of free
software developers is too much.</quote> He preferred the GNU/Linux 
model, where <quote who="Derek Neighbors">The bigger plays should be 
ponying up the resources in largest volume as they have the most to 
GAIN, but they shouldnt lock out the little guy, as that is a free 
resource to them.</quote> He noted that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
several people over the years have asked us to look at XBRL for 
G/L stuff and we saw it only as a reporting standard not a G/L 
standard.  Which leads me to believe people are stupid (either for 
miscontruing this or not finding the G/L standard in there) or that 
its being misrepresented/mismarketed somewhere.</quote>. He said he 
had <quote who="Derek Neighbors">publicly criticized Todd in many 
areas and vice versa</quote> but <quote who="Derek Neighbors">I think 
he has been pretty cordial here in combating what appears to be FUD 
with facts.  It has been an interesting dialog and several good issues 
are brought up.  Fortunately or Unfortunately we have been so head 
down on coding tools we havent been taking issue with all the 
accounting world around us. When we do I think that these conversations
will only get better.</quote></p>
