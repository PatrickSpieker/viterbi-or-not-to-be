<p>Gil Hauer asked about <quote who="Gil Hauer">
the project management package for GNUE</quote> 
Derek said that DCL would probably <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
become the base for our project management package</quote>, but if Gil didn't
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">think DCL fits what you are looking for let 
us know and we can start looking into getting a proposal written and 
something implemented.</quote>. Gil said <quote who="Gil Hauer">
Perhaps the best thing to do is to try to explain, in some small way,
what I as a project manager need to do.</quote>. He raised a series of 
detailed points under the headings of:</p>

<quote who="Gil Hauer">
<ol>
<li>Project Planning</li>
<li>Project Control</li>
<li>Project Close</li>
</ol>
</quote>

<p>as well as issues such as contact management, document management 
and version control.</p>
