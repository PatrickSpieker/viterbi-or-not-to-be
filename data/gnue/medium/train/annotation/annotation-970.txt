<topic>Financials (Accounting)</topic>
<topic>DCL</topic>


<p>It was asked whether GNUe was usable as at time of writing to 
manage a small business. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">gnue is two projects in one - a. create 
the tools that can be used to build powerful business applications -
b. create the powerful business applications themselves</quote>. Derek 
Neighbors (dneighbo) added <quote who="Derek Neighbors">c. a meta 
package of GNU that bundles enterprise software for the GNU project 
:)</quote>. Reinhard said <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">if you are 
looking at a tool that lets you build your own business apps - then 
you could use gnue for sure</quote>. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if you are wanting to open the box and 
press the button to have accounting then nope :)</quote> - however, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">DCL and Bayonne are both available and 
working</quote>.</p>

<p>It was asked how much development would be needed to get something 
usable. Derek said this <quote who="Derek Neighbors">depends - for 
example i expect DCL to be ready very soon for small business (SERVICE) 
based consultants</quote>. He explained DCL was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">like a project management / help desk 
system - we are adding strong CRM support into it - and making it so 
that the work order side could be used to generate invoices i.e. a time 
entry/crm/billing solution for software consultants (or any service based 
company) - it is quite usable today</quote>. However, he confirmed 
that there is no way to do accounting, and was not expected soon.</p>

<p>Later, it was asked what level of development was needed to develop 
in GNUe. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">our framework is 
designd for BUSINESS ANALYST more thna 'programmers' - so if you can 
understand table structures and know what you want your app to do - 
doing it in GNUe shouldnt be too difficult even for a non 
'programmer'</quote>.</p>
