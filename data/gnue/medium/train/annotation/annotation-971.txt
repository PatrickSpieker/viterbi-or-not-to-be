<p>Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) asked about GNUe Reports - 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">is there any directions - or frozen ?</quote>.
James Thompson (jamest) said there was <quote who="James Thompson">
nothing in stone - but jcater has been the only one coding on it - 
so I imagine the docs are all in that head of his :) - or in some text 
files in the reports/doc dir</quote>. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">the code works - the biggest hang up is we
need to 'define' our tags - several of us have mentioned some things 
but no one made a 'proposal' - once that is done i can do XSLT style 
sheets against them</quote>. Bajusz asked what was meant by 'tags.' 
Derek said these would cover <quote who="Derek Neighbors">setup and 
layout - so you might hae like - 
&lt;title&gt;my foo report&lt;/title&gt;</quote>. This was documented 
at <a href="http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/reports.txt">
http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/reports.txt</a>. He explained 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">basically that doc isnt what we WANT - 
but it helps describe what we are looking for. I'm all about starting 
simple - and working way into more complex reporting ojbects :)</quote>.
Bajusz said he would read it and <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">try a 
proposal</quote>.</p>
