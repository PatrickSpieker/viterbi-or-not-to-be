<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>


<p>Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) noted <quote who="Daniel Baumann">
hey did you guys see that we got 2 talkbacks on linuxtoday 
aboutvt he KC?</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said he 
<quote who="Jason Cater">is responding</quote>. Derek Neighbors 
(derek) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">hey talking crap about 
gnue is like eating pizza - if im not involved its not 
allowed</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason pasted his reply - <quote who="Jason Cater">
There are in effect two different projects at work here. The first one 
is a database-backed application framework. Several of us are using the
Forms and Designer components in a production (or commercial) 
environment in 2-tier mode (i.e., the client talks directly to the 
database and doesn't delegate any logic to an application server 
middleware). The Application Server (GEAS) is being reworked and is 
not, to my knowledge, used in production environment. When you see 
comments about not preserving backwards compatability, they are 
referring to GEAS.</quote></p>

<p><quote who="Jason Cater">
The second part, actual business applications (such as financials, 
supply chain management, etc) are still in the planning stages and are 
awaiting a working application server. So, to answer your question, 
yes, parts of it are being used in production. I use custom forms 
(designed inhouse) that connect to my Oracle database to run parts of 
our callcenter and warehouse. Come check us out.</quote></p>

<p>David McWherter (dtm) suggested <quote who="David McWherter">
uh oh   if there was a linuxtoday article about gnue today, then 
we'd better behave ourselves - someone might be watching</quote>. 
Daniel wasn't worried - <quote who="Daniel Baumann">psu knows what 
to edit out</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) suggested 
<quote who="James Thompson">looks like we'd better ban most the 
losers that hang out here - including ourselves</quote>, at which 
point the Channel Server bot granted him operator status.</p>

<p>Derek <quote who="Derek Neighbors">submitted two responses as 
well - though for clarification ( i suppose we should document this 
better) gnue is three things :)</quote>:</p>

<quote who="Derek Neighbors">
<ol>
<li>a gnu meta package bundling gnu project packages that are 
enterprise related</li>
<li>an application framework</li>
<li>applications built using the framework</li>
</ol>

<p>Nick Rusnov (nickr) asked <quote who="Nick Rusnov">
is there a whatis section on the wesite?</quote>. Derek said 
that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">'What is GNUe?' 
is first thing on the left corner of the webpage - 
if only the 'blink' tag wasnt banned</quote>. Nick suggested 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">
&lt;span style="font-size: 10em"&gt;Eh! What the frig is this 
shit?&lt;/span&gt;</quote>, noting <quote who="Nick Rusnov">
10em font would be like half a screen high or so.</quote>.</p>
