<p>Following on from 
<kcref startdate="09 Feb 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="Occasional unicode problems with Designer" /> 
and 
<kcref startdate="21 Feb 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="GNUe full-time developers" />, 
Derek Neighbors (laurie) noted that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">arturas has been jamming on i18n</quote>, 
and <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
i think his conclusion is he has patch that makes 
it work with our parser - BUT - wxWindows doesnt support unicode 
(and he hit same python bug i think we did)</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.13Mar2002">
The next day</a>, Derek asked Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas2) whether he 
had <quote who="Derek Neighbors">sent anything to the 
wxWindows/wxPython mailing lists to ask when items will be corrected 
on thier end</quote>? Arturas said he hadn't, 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">because i'm not sure whether this is 
because of my not big knowledge (maybe i just don't knwo something) -
and to tell the truth i didn't think about this possibility :(</quote>.
Derek said he had <quote who="Derek Neighbors">forwarded it jamest 
and jcater to try to see if they had any insight - i will try to look 
at it tonight</quote>.</p>
