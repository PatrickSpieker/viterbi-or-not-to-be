<topic>Designer</topic>


<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
what is the datasources editor for exactly... (it appears 
to not do anything you cant do in properties or schema editor)
</quote>. and added <quote who="Derek Neighbors">are you open to 
suggestions on schema editor....</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
that <quote who="Jason Cater">datasource editor predated schema 
navigator - and datasource editor will eventually be more than it is 
now </quote>. Derek said he <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
would like to see us get more into database space i.e. show a tree 
view of drivers installed and let you config them and set optoins 
etc... but also allow you to create table defintions in 
designer</quote>. This was not really urgent, but 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">lots of people (the business users) are 
hung up on concept of having to hand write a sql script</quote>. 
Jason said he had <quote who="Jason Cater">started on such a thing - 
but this damn real life keeps interfering</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
that guy in here today yogurt (dont know exact nick) wanted dynamic 
table editor - which might be pretty cool as example of python wx 
application that is not gnue but uses gnue-common - basically fire it 
up and select a driver, select a database, select a table, select some 
fields - and it opens in a wxGrid. At first i was like just make a 
form, but then i recalled that i had such a tool i made in delphi one 
afternoon that was EXTREMELY valuable - as it was a real easy way to 
view data in a lightweight way without having to make forms</quote>. 
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">not sure I see how this is 
different than our "multi-row" layout option in the Simple 
Wizard</quote>. Derek said he <quote who="Derek Neighbors">thought it 
might be a decent usage of gnue common outside gnue :) - not saying WE 
should author it :)</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">my 
only fear is that has SO much in common with forms</quote> that there 
was a danger of <quote who="Jason Cater">feature-creep</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek suggested that the master detail wizard 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">should list all fields in master on left 
and all fields for detail on right - you highlight the field in each 
you want and click a button in the middle to bind them</quote>. Jason 
asked <quote who="Jason Cater">how would that work w/multiple 
keys?</quote> Derek suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">you can 
highlight multiple on both sides</quote>. Jason emphasised that the 
master-detail wizard had been <quote who="Jason Cater">a sample wizard 
to show what designer could do AS IT SITS :) - never said it was the 
best or final way ;)</quote>. Derek said the wizard could also ask 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">how many rows the detail is if you choose 
grid</quote>. Jason said he had been torn about this - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">as that isn't actually a "grid" 
wizard but a simple demo wizard and I don't want to keep cramming 
options in that simple wizard</quote>. Derek suggested 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if we made it automatically put a 
scrollbar on right then i dont think we need to ask</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason said he had <quote who="Jason Cater">never had the 
inclination or need to try scrollbars so I dunno how they work</quote>.
Derek confirmed that the Technical Reference manual stated that 
scrollbars were <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
Only partially implemented at this time. Will show on form
but do nothing</quote>, which was exactly what 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">my bug report to jamest was gonig to 
be</quote>.</p>
