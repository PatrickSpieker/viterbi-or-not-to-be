<p>Michael Dean (mdean) said he had <quote who="Michael Dean">got 2 
offers to help develop features today</quote>. On the first, Derek 
Neighbors (dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think we want 
RBAC</quote> but he preferred either <quote who="Derek Neighbors">a. 
do it right even if it takes a long time - b. do a hack to meet current
needs knowing it needs to be done right eventually.</quote> He felt 
the proposal seemed to fall between these two approaches. Michael said 
<quote who="Michael Dean">I think he'll go for RBAC</quote>. He had 
also had a volunteer keen to work on 
<quote who="Michael Dean">authentication, enhanced configuration, and 
additional look-and-feel template sets.</quote>.</p>

<p>Peter Sullivan (psu) asked if DCL should now be referred to as 
"GNUe DCL", in the light of 
<kcref startdate="05 Mar 2002 13:18:55 -0800" subject="[Gnue-announce] GNU Enteprise and Double Choco Latte Projects Merge to Further Accelerate Free Software Enterprise Application Offerings" />.
Michael wasn't <quote who="Michael Dean">sure how we should approach 
that...</quote>. Derek suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">for now 
call it DCL - we havent worked out specifics of GNUe DCL - i imagine as
it advances it will be - GNUe HelpDesk, GNUe Project Managment, or 
something - but we are a ways off from that :)</quote>. Michael said 
<quote who="Michael Dean">it's a tricky thing, since DCL has built its 
own brand</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think 
initially DCL is like Bayonne in that its a project under GNUe - 
but it slowly will start to get GNUe front ends (but still keep its 
back ends) and then over time start to use contacts module of gnue, 
accounting module of gnue, invoice, etc etc - here then it will be 
uch more of a 'hybrid'</quote>. Michael suggested 
<quote who="Michael Dean">I would reserve GNUe DCL for a GNUe 
framework implementation - like your DCL forms</quote>. Derek agreed - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">basically there are still tons of steps 
:) - but the first and biggest has been taken, and that is to work 
together on a much deeper level than just acknowledging one anothers 
projects as a nicety - but rather immerse the visions of both projects 
into a reality</quote>. He admitted this sounded like 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">marketing spew</quote>, but blamed the 
Kernel Cousins, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">as i know i will be 
quoted :)</quote>.</p>
