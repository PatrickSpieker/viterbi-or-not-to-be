<topic>Forms</topic>


<p>Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) asked <quote who="Charles Rouzer">how would 
I get real functionality with just a 2-tier app? - ie. its just a data 
in/out app, not much functionality beyond that.</quote> Jason Cater 
(jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">there's no less functionality 
than in n-tier mode - it's just where does the functionality 
lie</quote>. Charles asked <quote who="Charles Rouzer">so how do I get 
"external" functionality?  such as, data is inputed, email of
data is sent - without having something monitor the database 
tables</quote>? Peter Sullivan (psu) suggested 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">attatch a trigger to something on the form
e.,g the submnit button &amp; write some python to do it</quote>. 
Jason agreed - <quote who="Jason Cater">it would be no different than 
in n-tier mode -  in n-tier you have triggers watching transactions at 
the middle-ware level</quote>. Nick Rusnov suggested 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">you could put a pl/sql trigger in no?</quote>.
Peter said this would be <quote who="Peter Sullivan">d/b specific - 
a forms trigger will work with any back end</quote>. Charles asked 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">how would a trigger execute code?</quote>. 
Jason explained that was what a Forms trigger was - this wasn't a 
database-level trigger. Nick said <quote who="Nick Rusnov">the reason 
I liked the database level trigger is you only have to deal with 
sending mail in one spot then and get mail working on one 
computer</quote>. Charles agreed, saying that he might have a mix of 
different operating systems running the Forms client. Jason suggested 
<quote who="Jason Cater">when that's a big deal for my stuff, I just 
have an xml-rpc instance running on the server to listen for those 
events</quote>. Nick also suggested <quote who="Nick Rusnov">you could 
have like a webform email thing and url encode it. its hacky 
though.</quote> Charles asked <quote who="Charles Rouser">with DB 
triggers, is there a "mail function" or a method of executing
external scripts?</quote>. Nick noted that in 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">postgres you can embed a perl scrip.t or a 
pl/sql script - I know in perl its pretty easy to send mail 
:)</quote>.</p>
