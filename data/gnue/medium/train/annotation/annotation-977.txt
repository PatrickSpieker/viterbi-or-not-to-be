<p>Stuart Bain (stbain) said <quote who="Stuart Bain">I think I found the 
"Killer app" that will bring GNUe into the limelight</quote>
One of his clients was a car dealership who was very unhappy with their
relationship with one of their system suppliers, who was 
<quote who="Stuart Bain">pretty much gouging them for support, installation, 
and maintenance on obsolete technology - it's nothing for some 
dealerships to spend up to $45K to add 12 users at an existing location
</quote>. The system supplier <quote who="Stuart Bain">maintains complete 
control over the machines [...] refuses to give out root passwords or 
work with third party vendors to implement new technologies or add new 
sites</quote>. He wondered <quote who="Stuart Bain">is GNUe ready to 
build a Dealer Management System on?</quote> Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) 
said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">you could hack up a 2-tier app</quote>
with the GNUe Tools as they stood at time of writing. He believed  
that <quote who="Daniel Baumann">ncurses is probably old and 
rotting away</quote> but noted <quote who="Daniel Baumann">there's going 
to be a UI rewrite soon</quote> which should reinstate support for it. 
Stuart said that <quote who="Stuart Bain">capitalizing on their existing 
hardware (dumb terminals) would be a big selling point</quote> and added 
<quote who="Stuart Bain">oh... BTW... they're willing to fund us :)</quote>
He also asked <quote who="Stuart Bain">do you know off the top of your 
head how much it would take to port forms to a java swing interface?
</quote> Daniel said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">we have a Java forms 
client - however - the proper thing to do would be to write java ui 
plugin</quote> and he noted <quote who="Daniel Baumann">swing is 
non-free</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said his original involvement 
with GNUe had been due to dissatisfaction with <quote who="Jason Cater">
actually writing a swing-based forms app</quote>. However, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">it is certainly possible to port forsm to 
java/swing - actually, we consider the Python forms to be a "
reference" implementation not necessarily the "only" 
implementation</quote> of GNUe Forms. Stuart was worried about the 
implications of having to install the Forms client and the python/
wxpython dependancies on each PC. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">
we have precompiled Windows binaries on the website that contains 
EVERYTHING</quote>. For GNU/Linux, you could either 
<quote who="Jason Cater">use diskless terminals</quote> such as the 
Linux Terminal Server Project or <quote who="Jason Cater">create a 
"static" python + wx install then tar it up and untar on all 
the other machines - in effect creating a binary image</quote>. 
Daniel said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">long term I would hope you would 
want to use geas and define your business objects and methods, but ubtil 
then you could just use the forms client and a database and write som 
triggers and have a nice app</quote>. Stuart said the idea was to 
<quote who="Stuart Bain">have the entire dealer base in the country throw
their weight behind the development effort(s) - so we would definitely 
want to use a mature GEAS and use 3 tier design</quote>. He added 
<quote who="Stuart Bain">I also discussed the problem w/ multiple vendors... 
GM, Chrysler, Ford, Honda, etc... they all have their proprietary protocols 
to access information from their networks - so I'm also thinking something 
along the lines of an Automotive Markup Language - AML ;) I'm thinking we 
can work with OASIS and try to lobby for some support in that area</quote>
Jason had to run, but suggested that Stuart talked to Derek Neighbors.</p>

<p>Later, Derek suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if you are on 
windows dont use cvs - instead grab the .exe's - that way you dont 
have to install any dependencies - they are all included</quote>. He 
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we are PRIMED to run on vt100 as 
soon as curses support is back</quote> and said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think what you are asking is DEFINITELY 
do able w/ two tier as it sits right now</quote>. He personally didn't 
see any value in a java/swing client - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
if you wanted java, i would write from scratch in java</quote>. He 
said he was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">not sure what the questions 
were in some regards i.e. is stbain asking can this be done or asking 
for us to do it?</quote> Jason said he was <quote who="Jason Cater">
not really sure</quote>. Daniel said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">hey, 
I am all for offering my services ;)</quote>.</p>
