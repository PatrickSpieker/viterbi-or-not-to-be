<p>Miguel de Icaza (miguel) asked <quote who="Miguel de Icaza">Anyone 
know where I can get complete rpms of Gnu Enterprise?</quote>. Daniel 
Baumann (chillywilly) said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">we don't have 
rpms</quote> at the time of writing. Miguel also asked 
<quote who="Miguel de Icaza">So does GNU enterprise use WxWindows 
only? (and gtk through this?) - I thought it had a pluggable architecture
</quote>? Jason Cater (jcater) said the wxPython version 
<quote who="Jason Cater">is currently our reference implementation - next 
up will be a curses-based plugin followed by an html</quote>. They had 
had a curses-based version previously, but had not been keeping it up to 
date. Miguel asked <quote who="Miguel de Icaza">Is GNUE end-user ready? I 
am going to ask someone at Ximian to make rpms ;-)</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">the forms client is in production use several 
places</quote> and <quote who="Jason Cater">the designer ide is coming 
along nicely</quote>. Miguel noted <quote who="Miguel de Icaza">Ok, so you 
are not reusing anything like glade (totally understandable)</quote>.
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">we have an entry on that in our faq - 
glade is EXCELLENT for designing GTK apps</quote> - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">but that is not what we do</quote>. Miguel asked 
<quote who="Miguel de Icaza">Ok, so what should I subscribe to if I want 
to know when you guys make rpms of the new release?</quote> He was pointed 
to the gnue-annouce@gnu.org mailing list at 
<a href="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnue-announce">
http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnue-announce</a></p>

<p>Later, Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i missed miguel eh</quote> -
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">guess we have hit the 'radar'</quote> with Ximian.
He added <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i have long long long long said
that gnue is one of the few pieces of free software that has a BUSINESS MODEL
</quote>. He said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">8 months ago i would have been 
PLEASED as punch that ximian was interested</quote> but now he was not so 
sure. However, he added <quote who="Derek Neighbors">hopefully they will bring 
resources and good intentions</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.18Jan2002">
The next day</a>, Reinhard M&#252;ller noted <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">
we had ppl from gnucash and bayonne here for quite some time - then we had 
bkuhn - now miguel - i'm expecting rms to appear tomorrow ;)</quote>
Later, Derek said that Richard Stallman did not use IRC, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">but he does give 'pleasant emails' occassionally 
:) - i.e. rms knows about gnue and knows somewhat of what is going on
</quote>.</p>
