James Thompson (jamest) noted that Michael Maluck (madlocke) had 
<quote who="James Thompson">got a lot of work done on the layout mgr
</quote>. However, he said <quote who="James Thompson">i can't see us 
replacing GParser as forms and designer both use it heavily</quote>
Michael said <quote who="Michael Maluck">for now i only wrote own one 
because it was easier and i wanted to try some things...</quote> 
He also was <quote who="Michael Maluck">still thinking of getting rid 
of this phaseinit... but not now...</quote>. James said they had 
previously had <quote who="James Thompson">a single init system 
that just didn't work for our multipart system</quote>. He hoped to 
<quote who="James Thompson">fold the layout manager into the current 
code base w/ a few changes - then see about adding in the html stuff 
along side our current UI rewrite</quote>. They hadn't progressed with 
this so far as it was <quote who="James Thompson">really dependent 
upon the html clients needs - jcater and I have discussed it somewhat 
- but nothing on paper yet</quote>. They had been 
<quote who="James Thompson">talking about having a single process on 
the web server - using sessoins/cookies to driver mutliple UIhtml 
sessions for different users</quote>.</p>
