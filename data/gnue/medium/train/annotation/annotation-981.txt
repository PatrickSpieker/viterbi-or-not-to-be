<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) complained that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i cant get cvs at work</quote> and asked 
Jason Cater (jcater) to send it to him as a .tar file. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I think we should do this weekly 
(automatically) and post to website</quote>. Derek agreed, but 
suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">nightly</quote>. Jason 
concurred <quote who="Jason Cater">I'm thinking of having 
gnue-cvs-&lt;date&gt;.tar.gz and keep the last 5 days worth</quote>.
After a while, he confirmed that the snapshots were now at
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/download/snapshots/">
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/download/snapshots/</a>.</p>
