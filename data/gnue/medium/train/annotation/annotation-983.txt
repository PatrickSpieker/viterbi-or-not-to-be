<p>James Thompson (jamest) said that version 0.1.1 of GNUe Forms, Designer 
and Common <quote who="James Thompson">should be out today in release form
</quote>, once he had tested them <quote who="James Thompson">on win32</quote>.
He explained that version 0.1.1 would be <quote who="James Thompson">
the basic release. Then I'm adding trigger enhancements in forms. If time 
allows I'm redoing the event system as well so that it plays nicer w/ the 
mouse.  I'll also fold in the i18n stuff from the dude from india. Also want 
to get a good look into madlocke's layout mgr and see what it'll take to add 
that in as well [...] plan on doing an install guide too for maintainers</quote>.
</p> 

<p>Later, James added that <quote who="James Thompson">i'm putting together a 
list of db  driver authors and mailing lists and am contacting them about our 
drivers - looking for people to help give us the info we need for introspection
as well as testers</quote>. He then officially tagged CVS for a release of Forms, 
Common and Designer and did <quote who="James Thompson">a happy dance</quote>.
