<topic>Forms</topic>


<p>Holger Schurig (holsch) asked <quote who="Holger Schurig">
is anybody caring for the UIcurses.py file?  It's in a sad state ...
</quote>. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">UIcurses was done by a guy named arno
- he had to stop because he got seriosly ill iirc - meanwhile a lot 
in forms has changed and so the UIcurses.py is no longer compatible 
with the rest i guess</quote>. Holger said <quote who="Holger Schurig">
I'd love to have even a minimal UIcurses that lacks almost all widgets
so that I can show a demo to my boss</quote>. Reinhard said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">a lot of people in this project want 
curses - me too btw :)</quote>. Holger said <quote who="Holger Schurig">
I tried for 4 hours to understand enought of python and UI&lt;whatever&gt; 
to get something running - but to no avail. Maybe even an totally 
empty UIskeleton.py would help. In that case I would probably try to
create a UInewt.py (I like newt much more than curses). The problem is 
that python-newt currently only exists for python 1.5 ...</quote> 
Reinhard agreed that might be a problem, as 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">forms <strong>needs</strong> 2.0 at least
</quote>.</p>

<p>Holger later explained how to find the python code for newt - 
<quote who="Holger Schurig">python stuff in in the normal newt-rpm e.g. in
newt-0.50.33-1.i386.rpm - yes, it's called "snack"</quote>. 
He felt newt was easier to program, but noted that 
<quote who="Holger Schurig">I don't know if it can be used event-driven
</quote>. Derek Neighbors (derek) said that didn't matter, as 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">forms has its own events system</quote>.
He felt it <quote who="Derek Neighbors">would be cool to offer 3 diff 
curses modes :) as originally we were offering pyncurses (whose maintainer 
actually worked on gnue for a bit) then we switched to curses that comes 
w/ python [...] so to offer newt version would be sweet if got all three 
up and moving - it woudl REALLY show the power of gnue - yeah we have 
'character based' forms - which style you want? curses, pyncurses or newt?
</quote>.</p>

<p>Holger felt somewhat frustrated that <quote who="Holger Schurig">
Forms are designed for character based terms (i.e. absolute coordinates,) 
but they don't run on them ...</quote> as at the time of writing. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">they did - i promise they did - in fact if you 
grab an old release from the website it will work with curses</quote>. 
Holger said he had considered this, <quote who="Holger Schurig">
but forms without a layout manager just suffer as soon as it comes to i18n. 
Some languages use lots of more characters than english ... :-(</quote>
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i dont think that layout manager is 
that huge of deal personally</quote>. Holger disagreed - <quote who="Holger Schurig"> 
The problem is that many english words are short, but they are 
long in hungarian or german</quote>, which could make labels look ugly.
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">point is you have the source - 
if it looked horrid in your language w/ a little work you could fix it :)
</quote></p>.

<p>Later, Jason Cater (jcater) confessed that he had been the last person to
modify the UIcurses.py code. He said <quote who="Jason Cater">I'm in the process 
of abstracting the "input handling" out of UIwxpython and trying to 
get curses working again</quote>.</p>
