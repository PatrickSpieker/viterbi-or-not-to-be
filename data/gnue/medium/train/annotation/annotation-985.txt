<p>Jason Cater (jcater) announced <quote who="Jason Cater">
as of 10 minutes ago designer fully supports drag and drop schema 
introspection - drag a table to the form, and a datasource and block 
is created</quote>. Several people were very impressed. 
Later, he said <quote who="Jason Cater">Designer is almost useful now - 
our Layout Editor is drag-n-drop + toolbar at top plus we have full schema 
introspection support plus a real syntax-highlighting code editor
plus a data source editor</quote>. He clarified that "schema"
meant <quote who="Jason Cater">for relational sources, it's "tables" 
+ "fields" but for object sources, it's "objects" + 
"attributes"</quote>. This meant <quote who="Jason Cater">
whenever GEAS works - designer will be ready</quote>.</p>
