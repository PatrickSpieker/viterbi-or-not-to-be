<p>Rob Levin (lilo--) <quote who="Rob Levin">
wondered if someone could give him a quick summary of the development 
framework and what it compares to in the proprietary world - right now 
I'm stuck with Windows Powerbuilder and I wanted to know that there was 
at least something sane out there :)</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) said 
the GNUe tools were a <quote who="Jason Cater">direct comparison to 
Oracle Forms and PowerBuilder</quote>. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">nah, GNUe is better :)</quote>. Jason 
said they supported a wide range of database back-ends - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">Postgres, MySQL, DB2, Oracle, SAP-DB, 
Interbase, Informix, any ODBC</quote>. Rob, all embarassed, asked
<quote who="Rob Levin">is the dreaded MS SQL Server somewhere in there? :)
</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">we are working on an ADO 
driver - but it's supported via ODBC at the moment</quote>. He explained
<quote who="Jason Cater">ADO is supposedly MS Server's native interface 
format</quote>. The ODBC support was slightly limited, as 
<quote who="Jason Cater">we use a public domain ODBC driver which is 
lacking introspection</quote>. This meant <quote who="Jason Cater">
our Designer can't automatically create forms</quote> using ODBC.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.21Jan2002">
As midnight came</a>, he explained that <quote who="Jason Cater">Designer 
is our IDE - Forms runs what Designer creates</quote>. Rob asked about 
debugging, as <quote who="Rob Levin">Powerbuilder is horrible :)</quote>.
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">as right now, try not to make 
mistakes :)</quote> Rob said <quote who="Rob Levin">well, I can accept 
that - Powerbuilder is that way and it will never get better ;)</quote>.
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">actually, the client software is in 
production use at my office and a few other guy's offices - my IT team is 
starting to use designer - but it's fairly new. Now the other tools 
aren't as "mature" i.e., reporting, app server, etc
but we're getting there :)</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Rob asked <quote who="Rob Levin">what kind of resource do I 
need to demonstrate the software, you think?  big machine, medium sized?
</quote> Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">not too much at all, really
- I have 30 users all running on a dual 400 Mhz PII</quote>, using other 
applications as well.</p>
