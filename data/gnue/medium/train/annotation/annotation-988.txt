<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>
<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Dirk Riehle asked <quote who="Dirk Riehle">Why is GNUe a "meta-project". 
Is it more than a bundle of the three mentioned projects</quote> on the 
front page of the website. Peter Sullivan said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">The "meta-" part relates really to the 
Community aspect, IMHO. As well as the "official" GNUe Applications, 
anything else written using the GNUe Tools can, in effect, tap into 
the resources of the wider GNUe Community.
This is why GNUe has a much wider scope than most other similar projects
(both free and proprietary) - they either focus on providing a toolkit, 
or "shrink-wrapped" applications. GNUe aims to do both, and 
more!</quote>.</p>

<p>Dirk also commented that he <quote who="Dirk Riehle">was surprised to 
see that no implementation work has been done on the actual packages. 
Am I mistaken or did you focus (almost exclusively) on the 
tooling/runtime so far?</quote> Peter agreed - 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">Although several people are now using 
Forms "in production" with private applications they have written 
themselves,  the main GNUe Applications have always been intended 
to use the Application Server (n-tier), and hence there has been 
little impetus in this area so far.</quote></p>
