<p>It was asked what progress had been made on the Small Business 
edition of GNUe. Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) said that there was a 
project page for it on 
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnue-sb">savannah</a>, 
the Free Software Foundation's free fork of Sourceforge. On the 
tools, <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">0.4.1 coming soon</quote> and 
Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) noted that <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">the 
tools is very useful already - forms, reports are tools to build 
your own application</quote>. The amount of "programming" needed 
to build an application <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">depends on 
application you need but mostly you do not need programming 
knowledge</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.15Nov2002">
The next day</a>, Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) asked 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">how's gnue-sb going?</quote>. 
Derek Neighbors (derek) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">good 
but slow - jcater pounded out schema fixes YEAH - so for now 
we have the gsd's fixed and working ! i will be fixing the 
forms to match</quote>. Andrew said he had 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">to look at gnue-sb, the description 
looks like interesting stuff - SB is what i mainly care about - 
since we don't really have much bigger than small businesses 
:)</quote> in New Zealand.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.17Nov2002">
Two days later</a>, 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">ok 
new gnue-sb committed - item management and contact management 
forms should 'function'. They could be improved a bit and could have 
more features - but the basic schema's and forms are there and do 
work! Basically the two custom pieces i had hodgepodged at one time 
are now functioning.</quote> Having pushed for feature maps for the 
GNUe Tools (as discussed in
<kcref subject="[IRC] 08 Nov 2002" title="Feature plans for GNUe" />, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i will look at 'feature maps' now for 
gnuesb</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Derek said he was still holding off a public launch 
for GNUe Small Business until the issues with the CVS were 
resolved - it had been given a Savannah CVS web-page at 
www.nongnu.org in error instead of on www.gnu.org. Jeff Bailey 
(jbailey) asked <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Why don't you just 
have gnue-sb under gnuenterprise.org ?</quote> Derek replied 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">because we dont want people to 
think we have abandoned appserver and more robust SAP R/3 type 
implementation</quote>. However, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we 
needed something QUICK</quote> for some specific clients 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">that was two tier and ready to ship 
within a quarter or two - i.e. read not something perfect with 
ultimate planning and documentation - but something worked and 
could be extended</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.18Nov2002">
The next day</a>, Derek confirmed that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">currently gnue-sb only supports postgres - 
until the gsd tool is fixed to support the other databases - as soon as 
the tool renders gsd's for a db that db should be supported by 
gnue-sb</quote>. He personally would not recommend MySQL for use 
against gnue-sb - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">mysql is not a kwality 
kode database for this type of application</quote>, nor was sqlite. He 
noted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">my personal goal for gnuesb is not to 
be quickbooks - if someone wants that i will point them to gnucash small 
business project. If someone is willing to do local filesystem for a db 
then gnue-sb is bigger than them (imho) - /me isnt opposed to getting 
sqllite working, but states strongly that is not the target market for 
gnue-sb</quote>. Jason agreed, but said <quote who="Jason Cater">I bet 
we still see the single business owner strolling in - wanting something 
for his PC</quote>.</p>

<p>Christian Selig (lupo) asked <quote who="Christian Selig">does/will 
gnue-sb handle european tax stuff - ie tax on sales</quote>? Derek
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">right now this is my big pain - im 
torn whether to make gnue-sb US only - or support foreign stuff. The 
problem i have with making it 'anywhere' is you lose a TON of validation 
rules US business love and speed features. Like if US only i can make it 
so you enter a zipcode and it auto populates city and state - i can 
validate phone numbers against states i.e. is that a valid area code for 
a state etc etc. As soon as i make it i18n i end up with very sloppy 
validation and very general data entry. /me realizes there is a huge 
foreign market and doesnt want to discount that</quote>. 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if lots of non us people are willing to 
help and use likely i will make it i18n - if not then i will likely 
make US centric as thats my target market</quote>. Christian said 
<quote who="Christian Selig">i think having a market at all is better 
than fulfilling thousand problematic and inconsistent wishes - if the 
resources aren't sufficient, we can still fork. Currently i just don't 
have an enterprise customer who wants to make a switch :( - so i don't 
have big ERP reality touch :-((</quote></p>
