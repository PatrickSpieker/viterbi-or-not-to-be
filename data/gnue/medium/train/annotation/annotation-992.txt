<topic>Reports</topic>

<p>It was noted that Reports produced HTML output, and asked 
how this could used in situations that needed accurate 
positioning, such as printing an invoice on a pre-printed form.
James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">gnues 
reporting tool outputs an XML markup that can be converted to 
text, html, ps, pdf, whatever - I've had people write letters 
in word processor of their choice - save as PS file via windows 
apple laserwriter - then reports can merge data in. Sent out 
about 600 faxes this way a few months back</quote>.</p>
