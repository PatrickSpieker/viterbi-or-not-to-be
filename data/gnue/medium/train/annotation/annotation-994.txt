J Mozeleski
<p>J Mozeleski (imoz) asked what ERP backgrounds the GNUe core 
developers had - whether it was mainly J-BOPS 
(<quote who="J Mozeleski">JD Edwards/Baan/Oracle/Peoplesoft/SAP 
high end ERP background</quote>). James Thompson (jamest) said they had 
<quote who="James Thompson">a little of everything, my experiece 
is with a home grown erp at a mfg plant using oracle and their old 
sql*tools. GNUe Forms is somewhat based upon the way Oracle SQL*Forms 
worked - as both myself and jcater like that tool, however we've 
altered things we hated about it</quote>. J Mozeleski said his 
background was more middle-market, including working 
<quote who="J Mozeleski">for a Great Plains VAR writing custom 
enhancements for clients</quote>. He had been thinking about 
<quote who="J Mozeleski">an open source mid-market solution</quote>
but <quote who="J Mozeleski">after finding Gnue 
I'm thinking instead of creating something from scratch I could use 
your toolset to do this?  Except I would have to learn Python 
:-)</quote>. James said <quote who="James Thompson">sorta - 
our trigger system currently only supports python - but quite a bit 
can be done via designer w/o writting any triggers. Even learning 
python you'd only have to learn a small part of it - we have a doc 
in cvs that give a little tutorial on it too - should be in the 
next release due out any day now</quote>.</p>

<p>J Mozeleski noted that <quote who="J Mozeleski">Great Plains works 
virtually identical to this.  They have a custom scripting language 
called Dexterity and a similar forms designer, etc. Same concept 
of triggers, etc. Of course then they got bought by M$ and are now 
porting to .NET...</quote> Also, as proprietary software, 
<quote who="J Mozeleski">you have to buy a very expensive site 
license to use the modified code and only dealers get access to 
the Dexterity tools.</quote>.</p>
