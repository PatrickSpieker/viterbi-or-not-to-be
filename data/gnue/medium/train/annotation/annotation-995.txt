<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 07 Nov 2002" title="CSV driver for GNUe" />, 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">wrote 
a simple csv parser last night that handles quoted strings &amp; 
newlines - /mecouldn't sleep :)</quote> This included writing a 
special __GetFieldSchema handler <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">to 
make up field names, or read them from the first row :)</quote>
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i 
suppose there should be 3 ways (at least to do schema introspection 
on csv) - one is the header row(s) define the 'table' - two is a 
separate flat file defines the 'table' - three is an separate xml 
flat file defines teh 'table'</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) 
added <quote who="Jason Cater">four is it could be part of the 
datasource definition</quote>. Andrew siad 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">i thought you didn't want this to 
be complex :)</quote> Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">im 
cool with simple and growing it</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Matt Rice (ratmice) asked why a sample form definition 
contained both a &lt;staticset&gt; &lt;/staticset&gt; tag and 
a &lt;form&gt; &lt;/form&gt; tag - <quote who="Matt Rice">it 
would be much easier if they were seperated so that a single form 
could work with multiple static sets</quote> Jason explained
<quote who="Jason Cater">a staticset is just that, static - 
it isn't updated by a form</quote>. Matt said he really needed a 
dynamic set, but wanted something he could use offline. 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) suggested <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">you 
can use sqllite for that.</quote> Jason suggested 
<quote who="Jason Cater">if you really wanted something even simpler 
than sqlite - you could use csv files - /me shudders at the thought 
of doing that with forms - but you could</quote>. Andrew confirmed 
that his code defined a class for a CSV_DataObject that was a 
STATIC_DataObject. Jason said that was probably correct for the 
moment - <quote who="Jason Cater">when I was thinking about it
that was my plans too :)</quote></p>
