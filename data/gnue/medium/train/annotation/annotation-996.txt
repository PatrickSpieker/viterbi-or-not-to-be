<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 13 Nov 2002" title="i18n issues with Reports" />, 
Bajusz Tam&#225;s said <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">i have a dilemma - 
1. use sitecuspomize.py for setdefaultencoding() - 2. use 
encoding in every place where it needed - i myself used 1. 
before ,and i was happy - but today i remowed my sitecustomize.py
to test for release and got errors from several places</quote>. 
James Thompson (jamest) asked <quote who="James Thompson">are you 
saying we need a way to modify sitecustomize.py during 
setup?</quote> Bajusz was not sure, as Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) 
has raised concerns about how this would affect other python 
applications on the same machine. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">in production environments, we will 
probably have a "custom" python install in which it wouldn't make 
a difference. I don't know what else to do though - without changing 
all file open() commands to a codec.open(file, encoding='unicode') - 
which will suck</quote>. James did not 
<quote who="James Thompson">think a small alteration to the file 
(prompted for of course) is that big an issue</quote>. Bajusz
said <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">if we can use our sitecustomize.py 
with setdefaultencoding() - then no need for many 
*.encode(encoding) - and python do the rest. The remaining problem, 
how an install process gets the correct encoding - maybe a popup 
like in a debian install</quote>? James said 
<quote who="James Thompson">i think it'd have to be - as this is 
different from the locale setting isn't it?</quote> Bajusz said 
yes - his own locale was hu_HU (for Hungarian/Hungary) but his 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">encoding in python is iso8859-2 or 
cp1250</quote> - <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">python can grab 
encoding from XP/2000 and from LC_ALL in *nix</quote>. Jason 
asked if this was the default behaviour. Bajusz said that this 
was his custom install - <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">no 
sitecustomize.py exist per default</quote>. Jason felt 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I really hate that you can't change 
encoding in your app - that is a really bizarre design decision 
for python to make :(</quote>.</p>

Two days later</a>,
James Thompson (jamest) asked how well GNUe was working in 
Microsoft Windows for Bajusz. Bajusz said that he had not 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">put site.py/sitecustomize.py into</quote> 
the McMillan packages (used to create stand-alone *.exe files for 
python applications in Microsoft Windows - 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">so i tend to use encodings thing 
:(</quote>. Forms and Designer themselves were reasonably stable, 
but there were a significant number of 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">event issues</quote> which he had raised 
as <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">collected win32 bugs in DCL :)</quote>. 
He had also <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">failed with making forms/reports 
with simple wizard if i used non ascii title - when i want to save 
them</quote>. James said he needed to move the formFontEncoding 
code from Forms into Common. Jason Cater (jcater) asked 
<quote who="Jason Cater">what outside of forms will use it?</quote>
James asked <quote who="James Thompson">wasn't designer going to 
support all languages in its menus/dialgos?</quote>.</p>

<p>Bajusz reported <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">huh, finally i 
reproduced my error :)</quote> in Reports. It appeared to be 
treating the %s paramter literally as an invalid XML tag, rather 
than replacing it with the value of the paramter - this was 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">without sitecustomize.py</quote>. 
James was surprised <quote who="James Thompson">it's really 
putting the %s in there?</quote> Jason suggested putting a 
print statement in to print some relevant variable values. 
Bajusz said that the debugging print statement itself then 
errored out - <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">UnicodeError: ASCII 
encoding error: ordinal not in range(128) - python always 
wants to convert unicode strings into ascii</quote>. This 
was not normally a problem <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">cose 
python is clever - but it allways uses unicode in XML</quote>. 
Bajusz realised that Arturas' patch to Reports was not 
ideal, as it used FontEncoding code originally meant for 
Forms - <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">but as jamest said, a simple 
fontEncoding in [common] is a solution</quote>. Jason felt that 
<quote who="Jason Cater">fileEncoding? or textEncoding</quote>
would be a better name, as fonts per se were not the issue. 
James asked <quote who="James Thompson">did we ever get a 
global section working in config file?</quote> to be able to 
set options like this for all the tools - 
<quote who="James Thompson">/me thinks he worked on a [default] 
section</quote>. Bajusz wondered what <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">if 
someone wants to use different lang for forms and for 
reports</quote>.</p>

<p>Dmitry said he had <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">a mail from 
python gettext author</quote>. He had recommended using ugettext, 
which would always return a Unicode object, or several other
complicated-looking alternatives. Dmitry would forward this to 
the mailing list.</p>
