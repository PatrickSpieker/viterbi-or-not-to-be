<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 12 Nov 2002" title="Planning for next release" />, 
Derek Neighbors (derek) noted that people had commented 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">that 0.4.0 windows version on win2000 
is very broked (i experienced same) - so if we can get some prelease 
of 0.4.1 for windows it would be great - /me realizes we are doing 
native win32 for 0.5.0 - but still we need an interim</quote>. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">bug btami when 
you see him - he's completely set up to do it fairly quickly.
It'd take me a while to get back set up</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.15Nov2002">
The next day</a>, Jason announced <quote who="Jason Cater">New 
prereleases (-pre3)</quote>, which included several fixes and 
<quote who="Jason Cater">Demo-able curses support in 
forms</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">i 
know jcater and I are ready to release - so 0.4.1 may be today</quote>
if people were happy with the pre-releases. Jason confirmed 
<quote who="Jason Cater">each of the tools has a ChangeLog - 
and a NEWS file with an executive summary of changes</quote>. 
Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said that if James wanted any more testing 
from him on GNU/Linux, that would have to wait until later on. Also, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we need 
windows prereleases - /me is waiting to pounce on btami</quote>. 
James said that he did not feel the need for any more GNU/Linux 
testing, as <quote who="James Thompson">i've ran all my work forms thru 
it - and I'm implementing something today pretty big using just designer 
and forms. I think we'll be ok - plus I think we've time today - my 
weekend is iffy at best</quote>. Derek empathised, and said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">certainly release if you feel ready - 
/me gets to maintain the 0.4.2 release - so if i find stuff and it gets 
fixed i can always release 0.4.2 :)</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Peter Sullivan (psu_) said he had updated the website to 
urge people to test the pre-releases, suggesting the tag line 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">Pre-releases - when *everyone* gets to 
act like derek, and we're grateful</quote>. Jason suggested 
<quote who="Jason Cater">Pre-releases - for the derek in 
you!</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Derek asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">you 
releasing tonight or doing another pre-release - and will 
there be a windows release for 0.4.1 - or will we be saying 
windows support is gone until 0.5.0</quote>? Jason said he 
and James were both busy, <quote who="Jason Cater">so it 
looks like it's later this weekend - though I might stop 
in and do -pre4's</quote>. Derek said his 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">fear is no one has pre-release 
tested any windows</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I think some were testing under 
windows</quote>.</p>

Two days later</a>, 
Jason Cater (jcater) and James Thompson (jamest) went on a 
final bug-squishing frenzy, before Jason announced 
<quote who="Jason Cater">cvs is being tagged</quote> 
for a release. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">jcater/jamest MAJOR kudos to 
this release - it is by far the best gnue we have seen to 
date</quote> - incrementing the version number just from 
0.4.0 to 0.4.1 <quote who="Derek Neighbors">hardly seems 
fair</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">actually, 
it was mostly cleanup</quote>.</p>

<p>James asked Jeff Bailey <quote who="James Thompson">we 
released/are releasing today - any chance we can get new 
debs marked same version # but 0.4.1b instead of a</quote>. 
Derek asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">why cant we use 
0.4.1 ?</quote> Jeff said that the existing Debian packages, 
based on CVS, had been designated 0.4.1a and 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">0.4.1 is lexically a lower version 
that 0.4.1a</quote>, which would cause problems for the 
Debian packaging system, as discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 05 Nov 2002" title="GNUe Project organisation - version numbers, roadmaps, testing and branches" />.</p>

<p>Later, Jason warned <quote who="Jason Cater">make sure 
you are somewhat happy with this release - as cvs will 
break for a little while (not too long, but it will 
break)</quote>. He then did <quote who="Jason Cater">a 
happy dance</quote> as he announced the new releases -
Forms 0.4.1, Reports 0.1.0, Designer 0.4.1, Common 0.4.1 
and Navigator 0.0.2. Derek said he would do the 
annnouncements to Freshmeat - Jason confirmed that he had 
e-mailed the gnue-announce mailing list.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.18Nov2002">
After midnight</a>, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) noted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">ok freshmeat updated with all 
releases - i had to add navigator i guess i never released 
it at 0.0.1</quote>. The freshmeat administrators approved 
the postings straight away - Derek had been hoping they 
would have done it in the morning. Freshmeat's 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">biggest audience is US</quote> 
and <quote who="Derek Neighbors">with a little luck they 
would stick on the front page till about 12 my time i.e. 
most of the US audience would see them during morning or 
lunch break</quote>. He noted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">on days we run releases at 
freshmeat our web traffic jumps WAY up</quote>. Andrew 
Mitchell (ajmitch) suggested 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">that's when jamest turns 
the</quote> air cooling <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">on 
for the webserver :)</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) and Peter Sullivan (psu) discussed 
the arrangements for getting the Microsoft Windows setup.exe
versions of the 0.4.1 releases onto the website - 
Bajusz said he would do two versions again, one with the 
python console window visible (for debugging purposes) and 
one without.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.19Nov2002">
Two days later</a>, Peter Sullivan (psu) announced 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">btami's setup.exes now on the 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/news/news117.php">website</a>.
</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) was surprised at the size - almost 
10MB each. Peter suspected <quote who="Peter Sullivan">that the extra 
drivers (sapdb, firebird, etc) are the main causes of the bloat</quote>.
Bajusz confirmed that the setup.exes included GNUe Reports as well, 
now that this had reached version 0.1.0. The main reason that the 
files were so big was the inclusion of wxPython, which was 6MB 
all by itself, rather than the database drivers.</p>
