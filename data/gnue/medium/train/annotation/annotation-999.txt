<topic>Common</topic>
<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Marcos Dione (StyXman) was <quote who="Marcos Dione">finishing 
the merge</quote> to include all the changes to GNUe's CVS in 
Papo's CVS. <quote who="Marcos Dione">but I want to be sure we 
didn't break anything. should I use the samples to test, and that 
would be enough, or are better test somewhere else?</quote> 
James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">i think the 
samples are fine - once you've merged can you get us a list of 
differences between your code and ours</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Marcos noted that <quote who="Marcos Dione">almost all the 
DBdirver.py's have the same $driver_DataObject_Object._buildQuery 
method - they're all the same (ok, just the first few ones)</quote>. 
Derek Neighbors (derek) commented <quote who="Derek Neighbors">good 
eyesight you have young jedi</quote>. Marcos suggested 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">why not move it to DBSIG_DataObject_Object 
or above?</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">if 
you look closer, they can't be moved up - this is forcing the DO to not run 
the parent's DO, but a second parent's one</quote> - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">/me remembers hating to do that, but it was 
necessary</quote>. Marcos noted he had to change this in each of the 
16 database drivers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.18Nov2002">
Some days later</a>, 
Marcos asked <quote who="Marcos Dione">what would 
be that 'kstructural changes'that you tal about in (one of) your last 
commit?</quote> Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) speculated 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">evil doings :)</quote>, mainly the 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">seperation of logic and layout</quote>, 
as discussed in <kcref subject="[IRC] 15 Nov 2002" title="Feature plans for 0.5.0 and later" />. This made it even 
urgent to <quote who="Derek Neighbors">merge our trees (i had hoped 
you would have merged for 0.4.1 release) - but if you guys dont hop on 
it in next day or two it will likely be really BAD - i.e. the guts will 
change significantly and merging will be near impossible</quote>. 
Marcos said <quote who="Marcos Dione">I can send the big patch 
*now*</quote>. James asked 
<quote who="James Thompson">does it have to be one huge patch?</quote> 
Marcos said he could <quote who="Marcos Dione">(try to) separate it in 
functional patches</quote> but that would take some time. James said to 
send it anyway. Marcos disclaimed <quote who="Marcos Dione">some features 
added are maybe deprecated. those you think are ugly, pleasse feel fre 
to discuss them either in your mailing list or in ours.</quote> Marcos 
sent the main large patch as a single 143k diff file to James for 
review.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.19Nov3003">
The next day</a>, Marcos noted that <quote who="Marcos Dione">the 
simplest of our patches</quote> had now been applied to the main 
GNUe code tree. James said he had some queries on the other 
parts of the patch. Marcos explained that 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">genericBox is for asking questions with 
more options than 'yrs' and 'no'</quote>, whilst 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">atomic* is to make sure only one person 
can modify a what-would-be-called database register at a 
time</quote>. James asked <quote who="James Thompson">could the same 
result be accomplished by adding an atomic="" to the datasource 
tag</quote>? Marcos said it was more subtle that that - by applying it 
to an individual entry, <quote who="Marcos Dione">only that entry must 
be atromic. the others may not be midified atomically</quote>. 
This was called from a trigger - he pasted an example.
James explained <quote who="James Thompson">the reason I ask this is 
that we want datasources to support record locking which this appears 
to be - if we were to add a atomic or locking="" attribute to a 
datasource that locked records after they were modified - would that 
serve the same purpose? and I think it may require less work on the 
trigger writters part :)</quote>.</p>

<p>Earlier, James noted that 
<quote who="James Thompson">function calls in python are a hideous 
performance hit - we switched from a getFoo() to self._foo with the 
_ meaning private</quote>. They had not realised this at first 
either! Later, John Lenton (Chipaca) said 
<quote who="John Lenton">how is less than 10% a 
major performance hit? or, how is less than 10% reason enough to 
through the whole OO thing out the window?</quote> James 
said <quote who="James Thompson">that 10% isn't much on 
occasional calls but our UI system had lots of such things going 
on</quote>. Jason felt that 
<quote who="Jason Cater">self._form is as much OO as 
self.getForm() - just maybe not by the java definition</quote>. 
John said <quote who="John Lenton">I have no problem wiht self.form, 
in fact, I kind of like it. It's the /^_/ that bothers us, as that 
is always an indication of "this is private" - and in fact you agree
- but then you expect people to call that, so it's no longer 
private</quote>. Jason said that the underscore prefix in code was used 
to indicated that something <quote who="Jason Cater">is considered 
to be a settable attribute - ala XML files</quote>. It was only 
in the context of the connections.conf config file that it meant 
"private." James said <quote who="James Thompson">i don't think we 
have a hardfast rule on private</quote>.</p>

<p>Earlier, James asked whether they had got scrollbars 
<quote who="James Thompson">working with gridlayouts now?</quote>.
Marcos explained <quote who="Marcos Dione">scrollbars associate to 
its surrounding block. - they 'register' to them - so, when the data 
source is updated, and the block is notified, the scrollbar gets 
updated too. what I can't make work is 'free scrolling'. wx is very 
ugly reporting these ind of events</quote>.</p>

<p>James also noted <quote who="James Thompson">you exposed some gnue 
internals via some of those trigger functions - i was wondering why?
i know we did hacks like this at one time - but started to try to move 
away from them as internals can change and will alot :) So if we can 
figure out what is making you have to drop to internal levels we can 
adust the code - every time I've done this the workaround makes the 
triggers easier to maintain :)</quote> He was aiming to 
<quote who="James Thompson">get a fair bit of this in for 0.4.2 but 
not all of it - as I'm pressed for time and have other bugzzz to 
address ;)</quote></p>

<p>Marcos said <quote who="Marcos Dione">I guess you're also puzzled 
by that history tables thing...</quote> Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think your history tables need to be 
implemented as tables and triggers and not embedded in forms (read 
hardcoded) - i had same need for gnue-sb - was going to do all in 
triggers though there has been talk of making some 
'convience functions' for such things so triggers would be nice and 
clean</quote>. To save recoding the trigger for every field, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">you should be able to make it a shared 
trigger and just reuse it</quote>. Jason said that 
they had not wanted to use papo's solution as the general GNUe 
solution for transaction/history tables because 
<quote who="Jason Cater">we can't have harcoded schemas in 
common</quote>. Derek agreed - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">not 
everyone wants it - and HARDCODING it is not a solution</quote>. 
Marcos said <quote who="Marcos Dione">we done it that way because 
appserver (what would like to use) was not available when we 
started coding things</quote> in a stable version. But he felt 
papo <quote who="Marcos Dione">we can live with an external patch 
'till we recode, I gues...</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">after this merge 
there will need to be some ground rules</quote>. He wanted to avoid 
papo having to maintain a seperate CVS, and would prefer patches 
function-by-function, rather than mega-patches like the current 
one. Marcos agreed - <quote who="Marcos Dione">remember that the 
patch was sent 'as is', as I had no time to filter out what I 
thought it won't get anyways.</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we are willing to do what it takes 
to merge the repositories best we can - but we dont want 
'resyncing' to be a regular thing... we want one repository and 
patches :)</quote> Marcos, as the person responsible for 
re-syncing, was fully in agreement!</p>

<p>Later, John said <quote who="John Lenton">We really, really 
need some way to tell when it's ok to go in and use 
the stuff and when we must write an accessor for it</quote>. 
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">if there's not an accessor 
now, then we didn't intend for it to have one</quote>. 
James said <quote who="James Thompson">if it requires any type 
of logic at all to get what you require then you need an 
accessor</quote>.</p>

<p>Earlier, Derek emphasised that quibbles like this 
on papo's patch was not a rejection of the functionality - just some 
concerns over how it had been implemented. James agreed - 
<quote who="James Thompson">dude, there's some cool stuff in that 
patch</quote> - <quote who="James Thompson">I'm happy to see a 
working scrollbar setup</quote> for example, and 
<quote who="James Thompson">you're menubar patches inspired jcater 
to add trigger to flip them off and on (I think)</quote>. 
Also, <quote who="James Thompson">the whole atomic* stuff has me 
seriously looking at replacing the TODO lock record here crap in 
datasources</quote>.</p>

<p>Earlier, Derek wondered if some of the issues with the patch were 
just a matter of personal coding style - like where to put braces or 
how much indentation to use. John asked about indentation. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">we are actually *very* standardized on 
indentation... any variancies are oddities that someone likely 
committed - we do two space indents, with no tabs</quote> - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I don't think we want patches that do 
nothing but fix indentation levels - but that is what we try to 
code at</quote>. John said he would make this the standard for 
future papo patches.</p>

<p>Later, Jason asked what the new <quote who="Jason Cater">&lt;entry 
style="textlookup"&gt;</quote> was for - it seemed to be just the 
sames a label. John explained <quote who="John Lenton">textlookup _is_ 
a label, except that it goes and fetches the labelee in a dictionary 
table - rather like a cross between label and dropdown - the name 
might be less than perfect... but we couldn't find anything better 
:)</quote>. James asked <quote who="James Thompson">how large are the 
dictionaries this thing is pulling from ?</quote> John said 
it was typically used where doing a normal query would involve 
bringing back many rows of un-needed data. James agreed - 
<quote who="James Thompson">if we did this via a normal datasource 
with prequery="" and the result set it huge we kill memory (a 
shortcomming on our end)</quote> - but <quote who="James Thompson">if 
we're scrolling thru a partlist and it's having to pull 
the values each time from the backend the UI would get choppy 
(a shortcomming of the way you've set it up, i think)</quote>. 
However, <quote who="James Thompson">our datasources already have a 
very stupid cache system built in</quote> which could help. 
Alternatively, <quote who="James Thompson">this could easily be 
accomplished as a post-change trigger via the simpleQuery function 
(i think)</quote> or <quote who="James Thompson">could we merge the 
concepts and use the datasources for now and concentrate on improving 
the cache system in datasources</quote> long term. Jason said that, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">for *this* particular case</quote>, the 
first way of doing it was the best <quote who="Jason Cater">although 
I do want to see cache system improvements</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason also suggested using the "foreign key refresh" 
functionality recently added for dropdowns, triggered by the 
on-change trigger. John asked how this would work. James 
suggested <quote who="James Thompson">it'd be a style=label with 
the same attribs as a dropdown?</quote> John asked 
<quote who="John Lenton">wouldn't that amount to overloading of 
label?</quote> - not that overloading was necessarily bad. 
James said this <quote who="James Thompson">allows a uidriver that 
doesn't know how to deal w/ style=dropdown to still display a 
normal entry</quote> - such as <quote who="James Thompson">the old, 
forgotten curses driver - it didn't do dropdowns but it did handle 
entries - our sample form had a dropdown where I could select Kansas 
in the dropdown - the text client let me type ks</quote>, degrading 
gracefully.</p>

<p>John said that <quote who="John Lenton">another reason for not 
fetching everything is that these things might change between the 
first fetch and the time one wants to display them, so in effect you 
have to fetch it every time anyway</quote>. James agreed -
<quote who="James Thompson">/me understands that you want the field 
to update if the backend data changes</quote>. John said 
<quote who="John Lenton">this is taking one more step down the road 
of "dropdowns need their own datasource"</quote>. Jason said this 
was the case anyway - <quote who="Jason Cater">all references to a 
database are done via a datasource - when you consider what all else 
datasources can do this opens up a lot of possibilities - e.g., with 
our static datasources - we can have combo boxes that pull from a 
static set of values defined within the form, not pulled from a 
table - that's just one example - remember we are abstracted from a 
relational database</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.20Nov2002">
The next day</a>, James apologised for not getting more patches 
applied yet. Marcos was not worried - he said he had printed off 
James' comment about "some cool stuff in that patch" 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">in big black letters</quote> -
<quote who="Marcos Dione">we're gonna get that sheet of paper 
framed :)</quote>.</p>
