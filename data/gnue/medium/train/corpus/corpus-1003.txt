<roche> hi, what kind of skills are needed for help in this projects (as programer)?
<nickr> python
<ajmitch> herro
<roche> humm, herro , wtf? , /me stfw 
<jcater> roche: a good sense of humor is a big plus
<nickr> a penchant for GOAT BUGGERY
<roche> lol, :-) 
<ajmitch> you also have to be able to endure computer fixit problems ;)
<nickr> you have to endure endless bubbleheaded questions
<roche> buggery its a good beggining ... 
<nickr> dude, you're into goats? SICK!
<ajmitch> nickr: he's in #gnuenterprise. what do you expect?
Action: roche get "The Random House Websters English Learners Dictonary" , because something smell bad 
<jcater> oh, that's normally chillywilly
<jcater> but he's not here
<jcater> so I don't know what smells
Action: jcater looks around

<Varadhan> jcater: any plans for a new release???
<jcater> yeah
<Varadhan> jcater: we have setup a stall in the ORACLE WORLD with gnue + oracle9i + debian + IA64...
<jcater> cool
<Varadhan> jcater: can you have a visit to the stall in your free time (if you have some... ;))
<jcater> eh?
<jcater> I'm in Tennessee
<Varadhan> jcater: Oh!!!
<nickr> of for the love of...
<nickr> chillywilly left some trout laying on the heater vent again
<Varadhan> jcater: i don't know about the places there... is it far away from the venue of Oracle world???
<jcater> Varadhan: but, otherwise, I'd love to visit :)
<jcater> where is Oracle World?
<jcater> San Francisco?
<Varadhan> jcater: yes...
<Varadhan> jcater: is Tennessee far away from San Francisco???
<jcater> 1,800 miles 
<Varadhan> jcater: Oh GOD!!!
<jcater> but thanks for the invitation
<Varadhan> jcater: Welcome...
<ajmitch> SF is also a little far for me to go :)
<jcater> Varadhan: to show how flexible our gnue-forms client is: http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/curses-intro.png

KeithJagrs (jorgre@63.74.24.9) joined #gnuenterprise.
<KeithJagrs> hello
<KeithJagrs> jamest: you there?
<jamest> yes
<KeithJagrs> I believe i saw in the IRC logs you are'nt quite happy with wx under win32
<KeithJagrs> what are the plans to circinvent this?
<KeithJagrs> circunvent or workaround
<jamest> well
<jamest> i know works being done on gtk2 driver which works under windows.....however what I believe you will see in the next major upgrade is a UIdriver based upon win32all
<jamest> my understanding it that is exposes the win32 api directly which will make for a painfull coding experience but should result in us getting exactly what we require
<jamest> i have not looked into this really closely yet though (my last copy of the win api book covers the "new" api in win 3.1)
<jamest> :)
<jamest> do you have any suggestions for a different approach to the problem?
Yurik (~yrashk@as5300.kharkov.ukrtel.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<KeithJagrs> hmmmm. well not really
<KeithJagrs> does this mean you will drop wx in favour of gtk2?
<jamest> i doubt it
<jamest> I'm not sure if you've looked at the code
<KeithJagrs> not so close i must say
jcater (~jason@w202.z065105010.mem-tn.dsl.cnc.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> there is a dir forms/src/uidrivers/
<jamest> in there you find
<jamest> curses, gtk2, wx directories
<jamest> adding a ui driver means swithing to that dir and doing mkdir newdrivername
<jamest> mkdir win32
<jamest> cd win32
<jamest> vi UIdriver.py
<jamest> <code like mad goat>
<jamest> from command line
<jamest> gfcvs -u win32
<KeithJagrs> gonna check that
<jamest> as a sample
<jamest> bash-2.05a$ cd ~/cvs/gnue/forms/src/uidrivers/
<jamest> bash-2.05a$ mkdir foo
<jamest> bash-2.05a$ cp wx/* foo
<jamest> cp: omitting directory `wx/CVS'
<jamest> bash-2.05a$ gfcvs -u foo ~/cvs/gnue/forms/samples/intro/intro.gfd
<jamest> forms now supports the foo interface which just happens to behave just like our wx one :)
<jamest> the idea is we don't want coders to have to learn the internals of forms to add a driver
<jamest> well, not all the internals
<jamest> they just have to provide code to deal with the events that are passed into a driver
<KeithJagrs> I see
<KeithJagrs> I still dont have something clear. about curses
<jamest> actually, you'll find this style of coding throughout gnue
<jamest> our database drivers work the same way
<KeithJagrs> can curses worl on DOS ?

johannes (~johannes@M701P023.adsl.highway.telekom.at) joined #gnuenterprise.
<KeithJagrs> btw: is this included in docs?
<jamest> designer also has plug-in system to extend it's capabilities 
<jamest> what?  how to add drivers and such?
<jamest> no
<KeithJagrs> yes
<KeithJagrs> Ii see
<KeithJagrs> I see
<jamest> i commited the start of a Developing with GNUe Common last nite but it has a long way to go
<jamest> the forms doc is on hold as we're about to make radical changes to the gfd format
<jamest> so writing a doc to make it obsolete didn't make much sense :)
<jamest> KeithJagrs: what platform you interested in running this on?
<jcater> KeithJagrs: I looked at curses + DOS
<jcater> went into "python" on a win32 machine
<jcater> and did "import curses"
<KeithJagrs> win32 
<jcater> and it didn't work
Yurik (~yrashk@as5300.kharkov.ukrtel.net) left irc: Read error: 54 (Connection reset by peer)
<jamest> i don't think we're too worried about text on windows though
<KeithJagrs> well, it might be better than the current wx in win32
<jamest> personally, i saw the curses thing as usefull for someone running text terminals
<KeithJagrs> for the moment
<jamest> KeithJagrs: the win32 api is to be started right after we get 0.4.1 out the door
<KeithJagrs> also there are some companies working with accounting software that runs on DOS
<jamest> jcater: you agree?
<jcater> but, of course
<jamest> KeithJagrs: yeah, i know text apps are used alot in the real world
<jamest> i myself don't think gui == good by default
<jamest> however i think a dos text client would be a huge investment in time
<jamest> now if a person could find a python module for manipulating text then it would be possible
<jamest> but doing from scratch would be painful
<KeithJagrs> yes , your right on that one
<jcater> well
<jcater> the approach I would take
<jamest> what I do see alot on the street is windows apps running tn3270 or telnet to a unix box in the background
<jcater> is my understanding is that you can get curses libraries for win32/dos machines
<KeithJagrs> well my only interest for the moment  is  to see gnue running smoothly in win32
<jamest> I'm amazed at how often i see that
<jcater> so you'd probabl;y be able to custom compile a python binary
<jcater> I don't have the time to invest in that route
<jcater> but I imagine it's doable
<KeithJagrs> that would be good 
<jamest> ooooo, if we can get a python binary that does that
<jamest> then our existing packaging will just work
<jamest> KeithJagrs: we know that win32 support is a big issue
reinhard (~reinhard@M693P020.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: "No problem is so interesting that you can't just walk away from it"
<KeithJagrs> yes
<jamest> that combined with the desire to work on layout caused us to adjust our feature plans
<KeithJagrs> I have spent a considerable amount of time trying to convince a prospect to migrate to linux
<jamest> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/forms.html
<KeithJagrs> but he already boutgh MS windows and Office licenses this year
<KeithJagrs> so he discarded that option
<jcater> I think a win32 client will come along very quickly once its started
<KeithJagrs> they have 12 workstations there, its a car dealer
<jamest> 2 options 
<KeithJagrs> 2?
<jamest>   1) give us a little time - 0.4.1 should be out in next few days.  Then we'll start efforts on win32api
<jamest>   2) setup a cheap arse "server" running the curses client w/ putty on the win boxes
<jamest> it may sound sick but when I go places I spend time looking at their computer interfaces (at stores, companies, etc)
<jamest> i always ask myself "can forms do that?"
<KeithJagrs> heh
<jamest> i see option 2 happen alot
<jamest> which always strikes me as funny
<KeithJagrs> I been hoping myself that Forms run on those Ms OSes
<jamest> to spend XX dollars on a windows license to run as a glorified vt320
<KeithJagrs> yes, you bet
<KeithJagrs> me too
<jcater> I think we are *really* close to releasing
<KeithJagrs> Im reading http://www.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/forms.html
<KeithJagrs> interesting
<KeithJagrs> when did you publish that
<jcater> this past week
<jcater> it's a work in progress
<jcater> that's a preview
<jcater> (but basically our plans)
<KeithJagrs> great work!
<KeithJagrs> why dont you put a link to those in the news section of Home page?
<jamest> they are very new
<jamest> several need filled out 
<KeithJagrs> ok
<jamest> fwiw - these are based upon kde's feature plan pages
<jcater> mixed with two guys twisted minds
<jamest> we didn't come up with the format (credit where credit is due :)
<jamest> yeah, we tweaked them a bit
<jamest> so i know jcater and I are ready to release
<jamest> so 0.4.1 may be today
<KeithJagrs> today?!
<KeithJagrs> great!
<KeithJagrs> jcater and jamest: you both wrote those plans? great work anyway
<KeithJagrs> It was badly need it
<jamest> yeah, beats real work
<KeithJagrs> hehe
<jamest> i think jan did the appserver one
<jcater> does it beat users?
<jcater> if so, I need a feature plan here at work
<KeithJagrs> I mean, it could not mean a lot of work to do but it's a milestone. Roadmaps are good

<jamest> how about we add the feature plans to the site as part of the release
<jamest> revDeke: did you test those prereleases?  we want to release today
<KeithJagrs> where is the changelog, if its already written?
<jcater> each of the tools has a ChangeLog
<jcater> and a NEWS file with an executive summary of changes
<KeithJagrs> ok
<revDeke> jamest: gack
<revDeke> can you give me tonight?
<revDeke> wife has a party to go to 
<revDeke> i will put kids down and 7 and have from like 7 to 10 to test
<revDeke> we need windows prereleases
<jamest> revDeke: i don't think it's needed
<jamest> you testing
Action: revDeke is waiting to pounce on btami
<jamest> i've ran all my work forms thru it
<jamest> and I'm implementing something today pretty big using just designer and forms
<jamest> i think we'll be ok
jwalls (~jwalls@146.145.164.54) left irc: "using sirc version 2.211+KSIRC/1.2.4"
<jamest> plus I think we've time today
<jamest> my weekend is iffy at best
<revDeke> roflmao: i have heard that one before ;)
<revDeke> certainly release if you feel ready
Action: revDeke gets to maintain the 0.4.2 release
<jamest> i feel pretty good about this release
<revDeke> so if i find stuff and it gets fixed i can always release 0.4.2 :)
Action: revDeke suspects we will get to 0.4.4 or so
dneighbo (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<revDeke> as it appears 0.5.0 will be pretty major so likely will be a while
Action: revDeke notes 'a while' is a relative term not a deragatory one
<jamest> most of 0.5.0 shouldn't be major, we've been looking into it
<revDeke> cool, i havent reviewed the feature plans just yet (in detail)
<revDeke> i have been toying some with DCL
<jamest> it'll be major on the user visible side of things, but internals shouldn't kill us
<revDeke> so that we can get the feature plan items actually in DCL as work orders
<jamest> i think hiding all the new derek flags will take longer
Action: revDeke is thinking the win32 driver and curses drivers will be the biggies
<revDeke> not necessarily in 'dev' time
<revDeke> but in testing time
<revDeke> assuming basic curses support didnt make it into 0.4.1
<jamest> i'm pretty sure it will be _almost_ feature complete for 0.4.1
<jamest> but I haven't tested in a few days
<revDeke> cool
<revDeke> i dont think it needs to be 'complete' for 0.4.1 just like i dont think win32 would need to be complete for 0.5.0
<revDeke> but more 'reasonably' complete 'first preview' give us lots of feedback :)
<jamest> i imagine 0.5.0 will have the new gfd format and maybe the start of win32
<jamest> the new gfd format will be a HUGE gain for forms
<jamest> as you'll be able to do l33t things in it
<revDeke> what is the major change in the gfd format?
<KeithJagrs> do you think  0.5.0 could be ready in the first quarter of '03?
<jamest> complete seperation of layout from logic
<jamest> you'll be able to mirror fields on multiple pages
<jamest> mix things about any way you like
<jamest> i think 0.5.0 is this year
<jamest> it's become an itch we've got to scratch
<jamest> you should get a layout manager system as well
<KeithJagrs> this year? there's only one month and a half left to new year's eve
<jamest> hmmmm, maybe that is pushing it
<jcater> KeithJagrs: our history is to release either right before or on a major holiday
<jamest> damn, is it really mid november alread
<jcater> so we have christmas to look forward too :)
<jamest> i still think we can come close
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I really want to push the gfd layout changes out into the public
<KeithJagrs> hehe
<jcater> of course, I'd really like some donuts right now too
<jamest> we'll have to switch from code like mad goat mode into the ultr4-3x3tr3m3 code like mad jcater mode
Action: jcater plans on hitting this hard immediately after a release
<jamest> some of us may lose finger joints in the process though
<KeithJagrs> heh
<KeithJagrs> i have a question on appserv
<KeithJagrs> is it intended to have its own web server?
<KeithJagrs> like many python web frameworks?
<jamest> i don't know
<jcater> it reuses the socket server in Python's libraries
<jamest> it shouldn't be hard
<jcater> to serve anything needing such
<jcater> (e.g., xml-rpc, etc)
<jcater> but I'm not sure I'd call that a built-in web server
<jamest> as it uses common GServerApp IIRC
<jamest> which I believe still had the goal of providing those types of services
<jcater> yes
<jcater> it does
<jcater> (not just have the goals :)
<jamest> did medusa support make it in?
<jcater> it will
<KeithJagrs> medusa?
<jcater> snake-haired mythological chick
<jcater> causing terror
Action: jcater thinks that's in common
<jamest> turned people to stone
<revDeke> well 0.5.0 before end of Q4 02 would be great
<KeithJagrs> I know that part
<revDeke> while there are lots of holidays generally that means time off work
<revDeke> which means to a degree gnue time :)
<jamest> i get petrified looking at common
<revDeke> i think it would be good to have it by end of january
<jamest> KeithJagrs: search google for python medusa
<KeithJagrs> will do
Action: revDeke is worried about this gfd switch
<jamest> i'm trying
<revDeke> will we have conversion tools?
<jcater> revDeke: of course
<jamest> yes, for most cases
<revDeke> or open in design and save
<jamest> of course
Action: revDeke is only worried as im getting ready to do a boat load of forms
<jamest> I think we're pretty good about changing things and hiding it
<revDeke> yes i agree
<jamest> i wouldn't expect this to be much different
<jamest> http://oedipus.sourceforge.net/medusa/
<revDeke> jamest: if not, lube is cheap, right?
<jamest> it's worth it in any case
<jcater> yes
<jamest> this is something I wanted from day 1
<jcater> yes, me too
<KeithJagrs> jamest: thanks. I also found http://www.nightmare.com/medusa/
<jamest> it's how sql*forms from oracle did it
<jcater> jamest and I were discussing and decided we really couldn't wait any longer
<jamest> actually, ours will be better
<jcater> as the closer to 1.0 we get, the more stable the gfd format must be
<jcater> so if we are going to do a "correction" in our format
<jcater> we better get it on!
<revDeke> well i think major changes to gfd are better now than 1.0 ;)
<jamest> and the doc needed a final gfd format
Action: revDeke is excited about the change
<KeithJagrs> jamest: what you wanted to do since day 1?
<jamest> a cleanup/doc release then major change would have been a "bad thing"
<jamest> seperate the logic from the layout in gfd
<jamest> when I started I wanted something out the door fast
<KeithJagrs> good idea, indeed
<jamest> so I blended them which was a bad, bad thing
<jamest> but it was quick, i was just learning python while coding, i was young and needed the money
<KeithJagrs> heh
<KeithJagrs> what a novel
<nickr> aw jamest, we've all been domn that route
<jamest> Oracle's SQL*forms was the inspiratoin for forms
<jamest> to take a similar approach and improve upon their design
<jcater> dude!
<nickr> but you end up just spending all your money on gold chains and skintight pants.
<jcater> you realize with this separation
<jcater> I will quite literally be able to do a converter
<KeithJagrs> hahahaha
<jcater> that was my big hangup
<jamest> yes
<jcater> well one of the 2
<jcater> the other one is pl/sql triggers
<nickr> huzzah
<jcater> of course I could do a SWIG against PL/SQL C libraries
Action: jcater considers the tasks involved
<jamest> oracle forms kicked arse but cost big $$$$
<jcater> or maybe I won't
<nickr> don't things like postgres have native python trigger support?
<revDeke> well i think ultimately we will be better than sql*forms for many reasons 
<jcater> will be?
<jamest> we are better now in many respects
<jamest> very many
<jcater> yes
<jamest> in almost every way to be honest
<jamest> maybe that's too stong a statement
<jamest> jcater...sanity check please
Action: jcater slaps jamest
<jamest> thanks
<jamest> but was i right or wrong
<jcater> I think so
<jamest> layout they have us
<jcater> but I'm biased
<jamest> stability of the painter they had us 
<jamest> abilities of the painter we kill them
<jamest> painter = deisigner
<revDeke> well they do beat us on price
<jamest> forms is more powerfull than their client
<jamest> IMHO
<jcater> yes
<jamest> however they have a pretty slick pop-up selector we need
<jcater> we have python triggers :)
<revDeke> pop up selector
Action: jcater never could get that pop-up selector to work right
<jcater> we don't use it
Action: revDeke thinks this might be what i have been begging for
<jamest> i used it alot
<jamest> revDeke: it is
<jcater> revDeke: we *do* take patches
<jcater> I know talking to other people you might think we won't apply them
<jcater> but that's just not true
<jamest> we even apply a few of them
<revDeke> jcater: careful you might get some one day ;)
<jamest> as long as they don't break other stuff
<revDeke> i wanted a toolbar a long while back and added one that was so ugly someone took and made it right ;)
<revDeke> same thing with some datasource triggers
Action: revDeke knows i just hve to get something working so minimal that you guys panic and write what i really need just to keep my butt out of the code ;)
<jcater> not your butt
<jcater> your butt-ugly code
Action: jcater hides
<revDeke> i.e. 'oh crap, he is determined enough to actually be committing code, jamest quick get on implementing that and get him the hell out of here' ;)
<nickr> revDeke: thats a good strategy
<revDeke> nickr: seriously it has worked in the past ;)
<jamest> yeah, it works
<nickr> ruling the codebase by FEAR
<revDeke> as the thought of me adding stupid features i want is far worse than them adding the stupid features i want ;)
<nickr> a sort of cvs terrorism
<jamest> actually, you'll find that common/forms/reports/etc we try and make it easy for others to add
Nick change: revDeke -> dekeBinLaden
<jamest> we say it's to prevent people from needing to learn internals
<jamest> the truth is we don't want derek in there
<jamest> he adds a little trigger and goes away - we're happy
<jamest> he recodes datasources - we quit
<nickr> so why doesn't designer support sqlite anyway?
Nick change: dekeBinLaden -> revDeke
<jamest> actually, derek maintaining datasources sounds kind of appealing
<revDeke> no need to recode datasources its blocks that are a problem ;)
Action: revDeke runs away ;)
Action: jamest thwaps revDeke
<jamest> nickr: you mean the wizards?
<nickr> No, common doesn't talk to sqlite
<jamest> grrrrr
<nickr> hrm, I suppose I could use sqlrelay
<jamest> does it give error?
<nickr> yea, no driver
<nickr> and there isn't a drive for it
<nickr> at least not in my install
<nickr> maybe its jbailey's fault.
<nickr> driver
<jamest> you running debs?
<nickr> yep
<nickr> It seems like the driver should exist (if it existsZ) regardless of wether pysqlite is avalible as a package or not.
<jamest> nickr: i'll install sqlite and test
<nickr> the driver isn't in common
<nickr> in my install of common
<nickr> there is no sqlite/ directory
<KeithJagrs> jcater: are there any messages in the Small Business mail list archives? I get a 404 error
<jcater> jamest / nickr:
<jcater> that's because gnue.common.dbdrivers.sqlite isn't listed in common/setup.py
Action: jcater just looked
<nickr> fun fun
psu (psu@81.98.44.42) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<nickr> for now Ican use sqlrelay
<nickr> I think
<jcater> ok, updated in cvs
<nickr> how do I configure connections for sqlrelay
<KeithJagrs> gotta run. c ya!

<jamest> fwiw: in reference to our discussoins this morning about win32 curses mode
<jamest> http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/wconio.html
<jamest> it's not curses but at quick glance it looks like it would provide enough features to make such a driver possible
Arturas (~arturas@gsk.vtu.lt) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> Hello
<jamest> hi
Action: revDeke shudders at wincurses
<revDeke> jamest: i think your idea of vt100 putty connections
<revDeke> to GNUe Server would be more effective :)
xetrex (~chatzilla@195.148.248.83) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> jamest: that looks so close to the underlying curses driver
<jcater> that I bet it could be grafted in
<jcater> so the "widget set" we have created to go over curses
<jcater> could also be used over wcon
<Arturas> bye
Arturas (~arturas@gsk.vtu.lt) left #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> jamest: but I wonder what the advantage is?
<jcater> as I don't think this is really "DOS" screen io
<jcater> but Win32 console IO
<jcater> I can't tell if that'll work under "DOS" or not
xetrex (~chatzilla@195.148.248.83) left irc: "ChatZilla 0.8.7 in Beonex Communicator"
<jamest> i figured that most dos windows are really nothing more than win32 consoles
<jamest> the issues keith had was client picked windows/office for the clients
<jamest> and last I checked office is GUI
<jamest> :)
<jamest> anyone running pure dos solution would probably be more open to other setups
<jamest> unless legacy app forced them into it 
StyXman (~mdione@ADSL-200-59-86-17.cordoba.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> if they are in a dos setup
<jcater> we talk them into putting in an ltsp server
<jcater> and make the dos machines LTSP "telnet" clients :)
<StyXman> so, I'm finishing the merge. but I want to be sure we didn't berak anything. should I use the samples to tes, and that would be enought, or are better test somewhere else?
<jamest> hey, i haven't got into the curses driver enough
<jamest> but I swore it used panel
<jcater> I want to make it use panel
<StyXman> s/berak/break/
<jcater> but haven't gotten around to it
<jamest> so we'd have to form for winconsole
<StyXman> s/tes/test/
<jcater> StyXman: that's a good start, I guess
<jamest> StyXman: i think the samples are fine 
<StyXman> s/enought/enogh/
<jamest> StyXman: once you've merged can you get us a list of differences between your code and outs
<jamest> ours
<StyXman> ok, no more typos/brainos :)
<StyXman> yes! that's what life spins around these weeks :)
<StyXman> stay tuned.

<StyXman> question?
<jcater> answer!
<derek> no
<derek> thats a question and an answer
<StyXman> I see that almos all the DBdirver.py's have the same $driver_DataObject_Object._buildQuery method
<StyXman> they're all the same (ok, just the first few ones)
<derek> StyXman: good eyesight you have young jedi
<StyXman> I mean, is the *same* code.
<StyXman> why not move it to DBSIG_DataObject_Object or above?
<jcater> but they aren't same in all cases :(
<StyXman> 6 and counting...
<StyXman> cxoracle, db2, informix...
<StyXman> interbase..
<StyXman> mxodbc..
<jcater> if you look closer, they can't be moved up
<jcater> this is forcing the DO to not run the parent's DO, but a second parent's one
Action: jcater remembers this now
<jcater> e.g., 
<StyXman> ah, I see.
<jcater> class Interbase_DataObject_SQL(Interbase_DataObject, \
<jcater>       DBSIG_DataObject_SQL):
<jcater> without the _buildQuery override
<jcater> it'd run Interbase_DataObject._buildQuery
<jcater> not DBSIG_DataObject_SQL._buildQuery(self, conditions)
Action: jcater remembers hating to do that, but it was necessary
<StyXman> and only DBSIG subclasses has these new params 'sql' and 'forDetail', right?
<ajmitch> morning
<StyXman> hi ajmitch 
<jcater> something like that, yes
<StyXman> better, less work
jwalls (~jwalls@146.145.164.54) left #gnuenterprise.
<StyXman> they're 16!
<StyXman> done anyways.
<derek> ?
<derek> who is 16?
<jamest> db drivers
<jamest> StyXman: sucks doesn't it
<jamest> i did them on our side the first time :)
psu__ (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> what do you mean "done anyways?"
<ajmitch> another psu!!
<jcater> psu_/ psu__
<jcater> what a nice tail you have
<jamest> jcater: he modified his tree to match ours
<jamest> i imagine
<nickr> should go by _psu .. compiler reserved symbol!
<StyXman> jamest: you're right. I'm synced till yesterday
<StyXman> took me 16 hours
<ajmitch> jcater/ jamest: sounds like the forms internals rewrite will be fun
<jcater> StyXman: darn! and we gutted everything this morning.
<jcater> just kidding!
<StyXman> and 16 dbdrivers had the 'feature' I stated above :)
<jcater> ajmitch: nah, not too bad
<jcater> StyXman: but you didn't change that, right?
<ajmitch> does forms support optional parameters, such as panel background colours?
<StyXman> jcater: I know, I hear cvs :)
<jamest> yeah, i think we left setup-cvs.py alone
<StyXman> jcater: just added our code... which touched all the DBSIG dbrivers
<StyXman> no, now that I think about it... I just broke it
<ajmitch> ooh, grid view mode for 0.7.x

<derek> ?
<ajmitch> looking at feature plan
<jcater> StyXman: um
<jcater> dare I ask
<derek> do we have feature plans on website?
<jcater> why you were in all the dbdrivers?
<derek> i.e. linked from website
<ajmitch> derek: afaik, no
<derek> if not we should have under each tool package
<derek> where status is
<StyXman> now it's fine!
<derek> ajmitch: can you give me url
<derek> i have lost mine
<ajmitch> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/forms.html
<StyXman> for the multple ables support. we need (eventually) to pass a hint about which table are we talking about...
<derek> for forms what happened to 0.4.1 release?
<StyXman> (that is the answer to your question, jcater)
<derek> we should leave them on there as complete
<derek> no?
<derek> i.e.
<derek> todo
<derek> progress
<derek> finished
<StyXman> the new parameter is called qTable and is the last one 'defaulted' to None.
<derek> i think it makes for a nice history as well
<derek> or did you guys just start with 0.5.0
<StyXman> if None is get in that parameter, we fallback to the default.
<StyXman> I mena, we fallback to what 'you' were doing.
<StyXman> s/mena/mean/
<jamest> we start w/ 0.5.0
<derek> jamest: i might do some clean up of these as some stuff is duplicated or not consistent
<derek> are they in cvs?
<jamest> no
<derek> also there are features that are missing (i assume these are possibly not comprehensive)
<jamest> they are not complete
<derek> in which case i will throw out the feature and you all can determine where it best fits
<jamest> and don't go thinking that if you add it then we'll do it :)
<jcater> at least let us finish what we're doing with them
<derek> things like popup dialog box
<derek> or such
<jamest> 0.5.1 full support of everything derek wants
<derek> sigh
<derek> i said i would tell you features i see missing and you decided
<jamest> we'd have to visit AZ then :)
Action: derek never said would dictate where things are done
<derek> i.e. you could say we will never support that
<derek> we will support it after 1.0 sometime
<derek> or yeah we need that lets decide where it goes
Action: derek isnt sure what ...let us finish what we're doing with them... means
<jamest> derek: you have time now?
<ajmitch> derek: it means: "keep your hands off"! :)
<jamest> as we want them done for the release
<derek> i dont have access to change them now
<jamest> so if you do later we'll probably already have them tweaked
<derek> i have time to comment on them
<jamest> comment away
<jamest> but we know about the duplicatoin
<jamest> you may be best off telling us what you see missing
<derek> Switch to GNUe Common menu system after it's completion(*) 
<derek> is listed in 0.5.0 and 0.6.0
<derek> so is Complete Curses UI driver 
<jcater> we are well aware of the duplications
<derek> i would put in one or the other
<jcater> that's what we were saying
<jcater> :)
<derek> and denote that its subject to move
<derek> i.e. its planned for 0.5.0 but if it comes down to it, it can bail to 0.6.0 at which point it would move (unless the duplication is just an accident)
<StyXman> jcater: anyways, you'll se in the patches :)
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> joy
<derek> what is grid view mode?
<derek> there was talk of moving win32 native to 0.5.0 currently its in 0.7.0
<jamest> converts a std form to look like pgaccess
<derek> ok then one thing i think missing (maybe its a post 1.0 thing) is real grids
<jamest> it's a shut up users that keep asking for pgaccess on my systems even though pgaccess is slow and buggy
<jamest> feature
<derek> i know its an aethsetics thing but lots of people want it
<ajmitch> derek: see 0.7.0?
<derek> and if we dont add someone else will someday and likely not in the way we want it
<derek> ajmitch: 0.7.0 has grid view
<derek> which is not 'real grid'
<derek> at least not based on what jamest said
<ajmitch> how do you define 'real grid' ?
<ajmitch> i guess grid view is like access' datasheet view
<ajmitch> and 'real grid' is a grid widget in forms?
<derek> yeah but thats mroe a custom form (best i can tell)
<derek> im talking a native grid widget
<ajmitch> right
<derek> again this is high priority it could be post 1.0
<derek> but thats what im asking ... should it be pre 1.0 and if so, how pre 1.0
<derek> im thinking the blocks/fields things might make it easier to implement
<ajmitch> either 0.7.x or 0.8.x?
<derek> i question the need for a qt driver pre 1.0
<derek> but i understand scratching itches
<ajmitch> why?
<nickr> what!?
<nickr> you don't want total kde integration?
<ajmitch> wasn't one mostly written?
Action: derek wishes we could find some sucker to write though
<derek> like happened with gtk2 one
<derek> i.e. i would like to see a qt driver
<derek> just hate to see critical resources on it, again i understand the scratch an itch so its comment not a complaint
<ajmitch> Qt or KDE? if you use KDE then you can get fancier widgets :)
<jamest> thats all?
<nickr> should add a 'suckers welcome' sign to the channel
Action: derek thought you stopped listening as no comment
<derek> so i stopped
<derek> i can go on :)
<jamest> go ahead...I'm kinda busy
<jamest> but I'm reading
<jamest> plus it's easier to say "I don't see anything above worth adding"
<jamest> than saying "no" lots and lots of times
<jamest> j/k
<derek> oh most of my other stuff was questions for designer, but looks like its plan isnt produced yet
<derek> the three things i have there 
<derek> - good mask editor
<derek> - starting of schema editor
<derek> - trigger editor capabilities
<derek> - cvs integration
<derek> - project capabilities
<derek> - gpd editor
<derek> schema and gpd editor are becoming a big weakness i see as i am starting to write applications
<ajmitch> project capabilities has been started
<ajmitch> gpd?
<derek> project capabilities and trigger editor would be nice but i can hobble ok w/o 
<derek> mask editor and cvs integration would be gravy :)
<derek> oh yeah
<nickr> mmm delicious gravy
<derek> reports design capability
<ajmitch> for a trigger editor, would you reuse an existing editor or editor code?
<derek> these are items to think about when making the designer feature plan
<ajmitch> a good mask editor could have a set of preset masks to use
<derek> well i would like to eventually see cheesy editor so to speak as part of designer
<jcater> ajmitch: it does
<derek> or ability to include your favorite 
<ajmitch> jcater: ok, wish i knew that :)
<derek> ajmitch: correct, btw the mask stuff might exist, i saw something simliar when there
<jcater> ajmitch: you do now
<derek> but i never got it to work quite right
<ajmitch> i'd better check it out then
<jcater> oooo
<derek> good mask editor might just mean 'more polish'
<jcater> I never said it works
<jcater> I just said it does have predefined formats
<ajmitch> hehe
<derek> :)
<jcater> seriously
<jcater> in yor gnue.conf
<derek> oh other items for forms
<jcater> you can have DateFormat_MontAndDay = %m/%d
Action: derek gets ready to duck
<jcater> then in your gfd file
<derek> calendar picker
<jcater> the format mask can be "&MonthAndDay"
<ajmitch> cute
<ajmitch> derek: i think it could be useful - if someone is willing to code it
<ajmitch> not too hard for the wx driver
<derek> im serious
<derek> i think about every platform can support as well
<derek> i see it as nothing mroe than attribute of entry of some kind
<jcater> derek: would you like fries with that?
<derek> supersized baby ;)
<ajmitch> jcater: demanding, isn't he?
Action: jamest blinks
<jcater>  /msg jamest you go for the kneecaps, I'll grab the bat and go for the head
<jamest> it's easier to pull up a calendar/ click left or right to find the month/year you require, then click on the day ?
<jamest> that to type 15-nov-2002
<jamest> s/that/than
<derek> jamest: yes
<ajmitch> unfortunately it is
<derek> example... im planning airline travel
<derek> i want to travel week of christmas
<jamest> overseas i hope
<derek> i want ot leave monday before christmas
<jcater> rofl
<derek> and return friday after christmas
<jamest> :P
<derek> do you know those dates w/o looking at a calendar?
<derek> unfortunately i dont
<jamest> derek: i see the point now, thanks
<derek> its much easier for the application to show me a calendar than to hunt one down :(
<nickr> derek: what? you don't have an autistic savant who is an expert in the calendar system sitting next to you?
<derek> i was going to make a crude comment but thats not nice
<ajmitch> hmm, when was wxCalendarCtrl added to wxpython? is it in 2.2.x ? :)
<derek> re: calendar thing its not high priority thing
<derek> it was one of those ithink we need, could be post 1.0 pre 1.0 thats your call
<jamest> i think i'd rather see a plugin system
<derek> ?
<jamest> that would allow people to add such a feature
<derek> that woudl be fine
<derek> but i think its something pretty core
<jamest> as i'm sure we'll get lots of examples like this for various things
<derek> i would think it should ship with gnue
<jamest> i think i'm ok with it going in 
<ajmitch> right, so long is it's just an entry widget subclass thing, and doesn't require .gfd changes
<derek> not be a 'third' party thing
<jamest> as it does have a use
<jamest> i imagine that'll be 1.0+
<derek> im not opposed to abstracting it so that other things can be done as well
<derek> i.e. i realize there will be lots of similar requests some we agree with some we dont
Action: ajmitch dons flameproof suit
<ajmitch> what sort of timeframe are we estimating for these releases? :)
<derek> jcater: other thing on common/forms roadmap i didnt see (maybe its done in 0.4.1) was that stuff papo had on multi table datasources or such
<derek> ajmitch: there was talk about trying to have 0.5.0 by end of december early january if real life (tm) treats everyone well
<derek> i think predicating anything beyond that for other releases makes little sense
<ajmitch> right
<ajmitch> it also invites having large rotten fruit thrown at you
<jamest> the multitable write patch was causing some issues
<jamest> i can't recall the details
<derek> yes i know, but that is why i said i didnt see
<jamest> multitable read works fine w/o the patch
<derek> didnt know if it was resolved
<jcater> yes, multitable read works well
<derek> or if it was deemed undoable
<derek> or if it needed to be discussed what release it might be seen

<derek> hmmm this page might do the trick :)
<psu_> if not, tell me ehat needs adding/changing
<psu_> does anyone know how to get an iconbox back in enlightenment w/o middle button?
<jamest> psu: you link direct into forms for the feature plans
<jamest> maybe we need an index.html in there that isn't app specific?
<psu_> As I don't really want to rebuilt an XF86Config just for that
<psu_> jamest: I will fix that soon
<psu_> we need an index.php/html for that dir

<derek> other thing we need

<derek> as i know my pet peeve in getting new software is hunting down what license its under before downloading
<jamest> ls
<derek> we make lots of reference to freesoftware and even fsf, but i dont see clarification where we state we are GPL
<psu_> yep - most people should hopefully be able to guess that GNU* == GPL, but why not tell 'em outright?
<derek> it is in the mini faq item #7
<psu_> needs to be on the front page IMHO
<derek> im thinking make it part of items 1 and 2 on the front page
<derek> GNUe supports multi-language interfaces and non-ASCII character sets. The GNUe Tools are licensed under the GNU GPL <-- link
<derek> A set of packages, licensed under the GNU GPL and written using the tools, to implement a full Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. 
<derek> or such
<derek> i.e. you are a better word smith than I
<derek> so please take liberty of making it sound intelligent :)
<ajmitch> but you may want to reassure people that using GNUe doesn't make their stuff GPL
<derek> well for a few donuts we overlook any violations right jcater?
<ajmitch> as i've heard people worry about that before (interesting problem there)
<derek> true... maybe point to gpl faq as well
<psu_> well, the way to look at it is, if you did a spreadsheet in GNUmeric, would that be GPL?
<psu_> Is it true that one of the Powerpoint licenses bans you from saying rude things about M$
<psu_> or was that just a slashdot rumour/FUD?
<ajmitch> wouldn't surprise me
<ajmitch> but possibly /. FUD
<ajmitch> applications that hook into GNUe common, what license would they fall under?
<psu_> along lines of "free software declared enemy in war on terrorism; to be banned in all lower 48"
<nickr> I don't think its possible for a license to do crazy things like that.
<nickr> they can say anything they want
<nickr> but I don't think things like that are binding
<nickr> in a software license.
<psu_> maybe if they never sort out getting jcater's RentFree as part of GNU
<psu_> he can make it "donutware"
<ajmitch> nickr: the problem is that MS licenses fall under contract law more than copyright
<psu_> ajmitch: I would guess that anything that called GNUe Common but did not modify the internals
<ajmitch> essentially agreeing to an NDA :)
<psu_> and was distrib seperately with it, they would not *have* to be GPL 
<psu_> but IANAL
<nickr> I think that its gray, anyway. Lots of nonbinding clauses.
<psu_> obviously, we would prefer it to be
<ajmitch> for that, i'd imagine you'd need the license to be GPL+linking exception
<psu_> however, if I'm right, I'm not sure what the LGPL is for 
<psu_> so just /ignore me
<ajmitch> GPL+LE & LGPL differ in some important aspects, iirc
<ajmitch> i just can't recall what they are ;)
KeithJagrs (trilluser@63.74.24.9) joined #gnuenterprise.
<KeithJagrs> hello
<ajmitch> hi
<KeithJagrs> question: if I use a hosting service, and have acces to the shell via telnet or ssh, can I install python on my own?
<psu_> Anyone got any hints on my Enlightenment problem, then?
<ajmitch> KeithJagrs: i guess you could
<nickr> KeithJagrs: "probably"
<KeithJagrs> hmmm
<psu_> KeithJagrs: depends on your user's permissions on the remote server
<nickr> well if you have enough space you could probably install it to your local directory
<KeithJagrs> thats the idea nickr
<nickr> directory layout is essentially arbitrary anyway. :)
<psu_> involve.php now has the doc-support address instead
<KeithJagrs> what kind of permissions do you think I'd need
<nickr> KeithJagrs: nothing but ability to write to your local directory
<nickr> and compile stuff
<nickr> and set your path and other env variables
<KeithJagrs> compile?
<KeithJagrs> hmmm
<KeithJagrs> not sure about that
<nickr> type gcc
<nickr> and see if it works :)
<KeithJagrs> ok
<psu_> and what.php now clearly states we are GPL & links to the FSF's FAQ
<ajmitch> ok
<KeithJagrs> hello psu, you still on 28.8 kbps?
<psu_> KeithJagrs: upstairs, yes
<KeithJagrs> ;)
<psu_> downstairs, 600k cable modem
<KeithJagrs> upstairs?
<ajmitch> heheh
<ajmitch> why?
<derek> if you used common via 'import type statements and such' i think your resulting application would need to be GPL
<derek> if you used it via RPC it could be anything you like
<psu_> ajmitch: I'm not getting rid of the dial-up until I'm happy with the cable
<ajmitch> derek: right, that's what i thought
<psu_> & got all my e-mail addresses changed over, etc.
<KeithJagrs> nickr: ok. i type gcc and get : no imput files
<KeithJagrs> forgive my ignorance. does this mean its ok?
<nickr> Yea
<KeithJagrs> ok
<KeithJagrs> should I untar python on a directory above htdocs?
<nickr> into !
<nickr> er

<derek> gnue_support: update cvs try again
<jcater> gnue_user: Great! but you broke something else
<ajmitch> at least we don't have to recompile for every change :)
Action: derek thanks that should be the new gnue joke
<jcater> gnue_support: update cvs try again
<jcater> gnue_user: You had a typo
<derek> hmmm car wont start... 
<jcater> gnue_support: update cvs try again

<derek> aj: trying designer
<derek> aj: hmm its broke
<derek> jcater: update cvs

<jcater> it's ESP
Action: derek thinks its like a jedi mind trick
Action: derek there is an error
<derek> jedi_cater: no error to see here move along

<derek> its interesting though you know you are screwed if jamest or jcater says
<derek> 'can you send me a sample'
<derek> or
<derek> 'can you file a bug on that'
<derek> as that means we arent sure how the hell you are breaking it and it doesnt sound like fun we want to play right now ;)
Action: jcater thinks derek hears that a lot
<derek> nah you guys are too familiar with me
<derek> i get the "wtf are you doing"
<jcater> oh, yeah
<derek> or "how the hell are you making it do that:"
<ajmitch> umm...
<jamest> ajmitch: about to commit
<ajmitch> jamest: ok
<jamest> must make sure I'm not screwing something else up
<ajmitch> we're here to tell you if you do
<derek> you releasing tonight or doing another pre-release
<derek> and will there be a windows release for 0.4.1
<jamest> DefaultUI ok for the optoin name?
<ajmitch> sure
<derek> or will we be saying windows support is gone until 0.5.0
<jcater> I am doing the birthday thing tonight
<jcater> so I can't help w/release tonight
<jcater> and I think jamest is tied up
<ajmitch> is btami the windows release lord?
<jcater> so it looks like it's later this weekend
<jcater> though I might stop in and do -pre4's
<derek> ajmitch: my fear is no one has pre-release tested any windows
<jamest> commited the forms chnage
<jamest> now looking at designer
<jcater> I think some were testing under windows
<derek> well before you guys run off if you can create pre4's
<ajmitch> most people here seem to use GNU/Linux
<derek> i will test tonight in my gnue-sb work
<jamest> ajmitch: i assume you were adding to an existing form?
<ajmitch> derek: how's gnue-sb going?
<ajmitch> jamest: yup
<derek> ajmitch: good but slow
Action: ajmitch has to look at gnue-sb, the description looks like interesting stuff
<derek> jcater pounded out schema fixes YEAH
<derek> so for now we have the gsd's fixed and working !
<ajmitch> SB is what i mainly care about
<derek> i will be fixing the forms to match

<ajmitch> oh
<derek> apt-get install gnue-forms-wx

<chillywilly> SUBJ: Engineers, Scientists, and Mathematicians, Take One
<chillywilly> Engineers think that equations approximate the real world.
<chillywilly> Physicists think that the real world approximates equations.
<chillywilly> Mathematicians are unable to make the connection ...
<chillywilly> ---
<chillywilly> SUBJ: Engineers, Scientists, and Mathematicians, Take Two
<chillywilly> An engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician are shown a pasture
<chillywilly> with a herd of sheep, and told to put them inside the smallest
<chillywilly> possible amount of fence.
<chillywilly> The engineer is first. He herds the sheep into a circle and then
<chillywilly> puts the fence around them, declaring, "A circle will use the least
<chillywilly> fence for a given area, so this is the best solution."
<chillywilly> The physicist is next. He creates a circular fence of infinite
<chillywilly> radius around the sheep, and then draws the fence tight around the
<chillywilly> herd, declaring, "This will give the smallest circular fence around
<chillywilly> the herd."
<chillywilly> The mathematician is last. After giving the problem a little
<chillywilly> thought, he puts a small fence around himself and then declares, "I
<chillywilly> define myself to be on the outside."

<dneighbo> hi jcater
<jcater> word
Action: dneighbo is finally getting around to cvs updating all my trees
Action: jcater takes that as his cue to leave
<ajmitch> hehe
<dneighbo> to start tearing into gnue-sb
<dneighbo> how was birthday?
<jcater> good
Action: jcater feels like an old man
<ajmitch> your birthday?
<jcater> ya
<ajmitch> happy b'day :)
<jcater> thanks
<dneighbo> ooooo
<dneighbo> someone has redhat packages for 0.4.0
<dneighbo> grrr my connectino is fouling up again
<dneighbo> sisgh
<jcater> ajmitch: do you know if jamest was able to fix that Add Datasource issue?
<jcater> I know he was on his way out'
<ajmitch> jcater: he said he'd have to leave it
<jcater> grrrrr
<jcater> my damn toilet is leaking
<ajmitch> :)
<jcater> sometimes I hate owning a house
<chillywilly> sweating a lot?
<chillywilly> the tank that is
<chillywilly> ;)
<dneighbo> he fixed it by assigning it to jcater :)
<dneighbo> early birthday present and all
<dneighbo> jcater: hey my toilet is too
<dneighbo> i tried to fix it last weekend
<chillywilly> toilet tank
<dneighbo> spent an hour 'modifying' parts
<dneighbo> but looks like i will have to break down and go buy a few new pieces
Action: dneighbo was impressed with his toilet mods too
<jcater> chillywilly: no, it's the supply line
<chillywilly> oh
<jcater> it's one of those vinyl kind
<jcater> I've had really bad luck w/those going out
<jcater> I had two vinyl ones wearing out at the rental house
<chillywilly> I was gonna say if it sweats too mch you can insulate the tank to stop that
<jcater> chillywilly: nah, I live in the south... not a issue down here
<dneighbo> get the braided hose
<jcater> dneighbo: yeah
<jcater> that's all I'll buy from now on
<ajmitch> jcater: the problem was in the add dropdown wizard, where i got the wonderful opportunity to select a datasource
<jcater> that's 3 vinyl ones I will have replaced in the last 6 weeks
<dneighbo> my problem isnt a 'leak' its that the toilet runs
<dneighbo> was faulty diapraghm 
<jcater> ajmitch: yeah, I see the issue
<jcater> will try to patch shortly
<dneighbo> fixed that with some 'spare' parts
<ajmitch> cool
Action: ajmitch just added the entry manually
<dneighbo> but they dont quite fit the toilet so had to mod the 'float' a bit to get things operational
<dneighbo> worked for about 3 months but the strain on the new return is too much so its progressively failing
<dneighbo> :(
Action: dneighbo just cant cut it as a toilet engineer ;)
<jcater> yeah I had that issue recently
<jcater> as simple as they are
<jcater> I hate dealing w/toilet floats
<dneighbo> my net connection SUCKS
<jcater> birds getting in the way?
<ajmitch> lovely, a toilet discussion
<dneighbo> hey i have a new camera i think its time to get some toilet mod shots ;)
<jcater> rofl
<jcater> ajmitch: could be worse
<jcater> we could be talking underground septic system repair
<ajmitch> could be talking about what goes into the toilets?
Action: chillywilly would love to have a toilet problem with *his* house ;)...er, or have a house at all for that matter
<dneighbo> hey when people say gnue is sh*t
<dneighbo> we can say thats ok we are toilet pros
<dneighbo> mdean: where oh where is mdean
<dneighbo> jcater: i have actually modded a sump pump before
<jcater> chillywilly: see, this is more a relational problem than an object-oriented one
<jcater> see, you can define the house as an object and you as an object
<jcater> but you're gonna have to create some relationship with a really good job
<dneighbo> pre emgering it in the septic system though :)
Action: dneighbo is SO grateful we dont have septic systems like that out here (at least not in the city)
<jcater> dneighbo: I can relate
<dneighbo> jcater: yeah the toilet.flush() method doesnt seem to be completing its callback
<jcater> it's friggin discusting
<chillywilly> jcater: gee thanks that helps tremendously
<chillywilly> NOT
<jcater> dneighbo: well, I tried the message-passing paradigm
<jcater> but it just didn't respond to my cursing
<jcater> so then I tried the reference-by-handle methodology
<jcater> but hitting it with a bat hurt me more than it
<jcater> and it still didn't work
Action: jcater could try virtual methods
<jcater> but taking a shit on the couch probably isn't a good idea
<jcater> especially considering wife would make me sleep on the couch afterwards
<jcater> which quickly turns into a pseudo-object-relational nightmare
<ajmitch> sigh, geek jokes :)
<chillywilly> relationship Job lackee inverse Job::masta;
<jcater> ajmitch: oh, it gets worse... but I'll stop here :)
<chillywilly> praise the Lord :)
<jcater> sometimes I get the feeling chillywilly doesn't like me :-/
<chillywilly> it's all in your head
<jcater> but then I consider what I'm missing out on
<dneighbo> wow kde3 is kind of nice
Action: dneighbo ducks
<jcater> and I don't feel so bad
<jcater> kind of?
<jcater> it's the choice of a gnu generation
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<chillywilly> uh, hell no
<ajmitch> kde rocks
<dneighbo> wife broke computer today and startx over gdm got her in kde3
<jcater> I love kde
<jcater> it's made my life so much easier
Action: jcater was so glad to get the callcenter off of gnome
<dneighbo> its very 'crisp'
<dneighbo> nice fonts
<dneighbo> i still think their widgets and icons are ugly as sin
Action: dneighbo likes it all
<dneighbo> i.e. i like gnome, kde is nice, i live in fluxbox
<dneighbo> hey chillywilly did you see my ximian barbie?
<chillywilly> no
Action: chillywilly is feeling a bit depressed right now
<jcater> cheer up, little buddy
<chillywilly> eh...
<jcater> it could be worse
<dneighbo> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/ximian_barbie.jpg
<dneighbo> that should cheer you up
<dneighbo> doh!
<dneighbo> i just realized he aint got no pants on
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/toilet_mod.png
<dneighbo> gnue the first irc channel featuring toilet mods
<chillywilly> lol, where'd you get ximian barbie clothes?
<dneighbo> i think a little plexiglass and tube lighting and tis complete
<dneighbo> chillywilly: i have a bunch of rupert monkeys
<dneighbo> i gave some to the girls
<jcater> dneighbo: y'all must not have very high water pressure in AZ
<dneighbo> one day i stepped on something, cussed and picked it up
<dneighbo> it was ken w/ a helixcode shirt
<dneighbo> and i was like WHOA where did they get that
Action: chillywilly has never seen a rupert monkey
<dneighbo> and just before i was really ready to freak
<dneighbo> i saw a naked rupert on the floor
<jcater> you don't have a clippy thingy securing the white tubing in place
<chillywilly> heheh
<jcater> those would fly out here in Memphis
<dneighbo> and was like ahhh they stole it from rupert
Action: dneighbo thinks that was pretty clever
<jcater> argh!
<dneighbo> they wanted daddy ken doll
<jcater> what am I saying!
<dneighbo> rofl
<chillywilly> I need caffiene
<dneighbo> ok nickr you here
<dneighbo> you know of a good tool that will 'scale' all the images in a directory
<jcater> imagemagick
<jcater> oh, that was a nickr question... sorry
Action: dneighbo think igal might do this
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> i only asked nickr as he is camera guru
Action: dneighbo is debating if i want to keep photos at the super size image
<dneighbo> image management yet another problem w/o time to fix
<jcater> EXAMPLES
<jcater>        To make a thumbnail of a JPEG image, use:
<jcater>            convert -size 120x120 cockatoo.jpg -resize 120x120
<jcater>                    +profile '*' thumbnail.jpg
<jcater>        In this example, "-size 120x120" gives a hint to the JPEG decoder that the image is  going
<jcater>        to  be downscaled to 120x120, allowing it to run faster by avoiding returning a full-reso
<jcater>        lution image.  The "-resize 120x120" specifies the desired dimensions of the output image.
<jcater>        It  will be scaled so its largest dimension is 120 pixels.  The "+profile '*'" removes any
<jcater>        ICM, EXIF, IPTC, or other profiles that might be present in the input and aren't needed in
<jcater>        the thumbnail.
<jcater> that could be as simple as:  convert myimage.jpg -resize 120x120 thumbnail.jpg
<jcater> but their example has a few optimizations (which I've never used, btw)
<dneighbo> yeah but thats not my problem persay
<dneighbo> the issue is i have a huge file from the camera
<dneighbo> i want to smoosh it for web display (igal) does that just fine
<dneighbo> i was thinking of trashing the big file
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> really this is our camera now
<dneighbo> and wife might choose to make prints etc
<dneighbo> ultimately i will be archiving off on to CD-R regularly
Action: ajmitch looks for a nice easy way to generate a class hierarchy & docs :)
<dneighbo> so its more a liguistical thign
<dneighbo> of download to where
<dneighbo> rename in what way
<dneighbo> move to where to burn etc
Action: jcater has a cron job set up for marketing at work
<dneighbo> and move to web
<dneighbo> etc etc
<jcater> they save pdf copies of all our supplies/materials when they are done to a directory
<jcater> I then have a cronjob that regularly looks for files here
<jcater> creates .png images for web use
<jcater> of the supplies from the pdf
<jcater> creates another pdf that's not at the 1200x1200 resolution
<jcater> that's more suitable for emailing someone to just glance at
<jcater> uploads framed png version to our
<jcater> salesrep's online account center
<jcater> as well as another scaled down pdf that they can preview
<jcater> might want to consider something like that
<jcater> you just save images to a certain directory
<jcater> and periodically, web-ready viersions, archive-ready versions, etc are created 
Action: jcater is just thinking how your wife likes things... "it just works"

<ajmitch> hey jeff
<dneighbo> yeah
<dneighbo> im thinking of having wife just always dump them in a photos directory
<dneighbo> then nightly cronjob
<dneighbo> and move to a 'burnme' directory
<dneighbo> and move a smaller copy to the pre-web directory
<dneighbo> then periodically i can rename and categorize the ones for webpublishing
<dneighbo> and burn the big guys to cd and delete or something

<dneighbo> to give people finer grain control of the install
<jbailey> ajmitch: Nothing wrong with sheep jokes as long as I don't inflict them on NZers, right?
<jbailey> dneighbo: Yes, I think that's the plan.
<jbailey> certainly for forms anyway.
<jbailey> The hard part with doing it too much is that people will never figure out what to install.
<ajmitch> dneighbo: http://ajmitch.dhis.org/devel/classdocs/ 
<ajmitch> i've got to find out how to fill in the summary & source, but it gives a useful hierarchy :)

<jbailey> Dunno.  It's a usual phenominon of this channel when actual work is being done.
<jbailey> I'm in here for 30 minutes thinking about work, no noise.
<jbailey> I mention sheep and both you *and* derek appear out of thin air. =)

<dneighbo> woo hoo
<dneighbo> gnue-sb has working item management !
<ra3vat> is it committed?
<dneighbo> yeah but not the main maint screen
Action: dneighbo forgot that one
<dneighbo> duh...
<ra3vat> what gcvs is for?
<dneighbo> it wraps common
<dneighbo> so say you write a script myfoo.py
<dneighbo> that usues common
<dneighbo> instead of having to set python paths you can just do
<dneighbo> gcvs myfoo.py
<ra3vat> oh, good thing
<dneighbo> which is nice since the gsd converter uses common but isnt a real script as of yet
<dneighbo> gcvs Scripter.py mycool.gsd postgresql > newpsql.sql
<dneighbo> anyone else using cvs?
<dneighbo> combo boxes seem broken for me

<ra3vat> when will we get that [common] in gnue.conf?
<jbailey> Heya siesel.
<siesel> jbailey: one question: should the /etc/gnue/sample.connection.conf and /etc/gnue/sample.gnue.conf be configuration files?
<siesel> ra3vat: its just a bit hacking needed, i.e. changing all calls in form from gConfig to gformConfig and using gConfig only to access [common] values
<ra3vat> gConfigForms?
<jbailey> siesel: I don't think so - Because they're intended to be samples, there should be no good reason to change them.
<jbailey> But debhelper will mark them as such automatically.
<jbailey> I so I will probably move them into /usr/share/doc/PACKAGE/examples
<siesel> that would be great, thanks.
<jbailey> Is it causing you grief?
<jbailey> (Assessing urgency)
<siesel> ra3vat: you can set global configuration commands in GConfig.py

<dneighbo> i didnt get prereleases tested (me got busy and used cvs forgetting)
<dneighbo> stuff looks very good
<dneighbo> much more solid that 0.4.0
<dneighbo> i have questions on formatmasks
<dneighbo> actually i worked around it so the question lies in feature map
<dneighbo> we need to add number/currency format/input masks
<dneighbo> and documentation of masks :)
<dneighbo> i ahve to take kids swimming
<dneighbo> but when i get back i have a nice 5gallon drum of lube
<dneighbo> and i plan to sit down with navigator
<dneighbo> so expect the feature map to fall out ;)
<jcater> input masks are a BIG todo
<jcater> we are very close
<jcater> but no cigar quite yet
<jcater> (that should be in 0.5.0 plans, if not, I'll add)
<dneighbo> again im not dictating which release :)
<jcater> it's a biggie
<jcater> as in, needs
<jcater> well, and programming too I guess
<jcater> although most of the backend is in there
<dneighbo> it could be i didnt look
<dneighbo> i know we talked about it in designer the other day
<dneighbo> looks like date stuff is there and documented some

<dneighbo> btw: you might want to check out gnue-sb
<dneighbo> its product stuff might be getting closer to usable for the bookstore
<dneighbo> hopefully by next sunday inventory will be there
<jcater> cool
<dneighbo> also i noticed something
<dneighbo> in the import statements of the gsd
<dneighbo> if i have
<dneighbo>   <import-table library="item_source.gsd" name="item_source"/>
<dneighbo> and item_source.gsd contains

<dneighbo> <!-- SOURCE LOOKUP TABLE -->
<dneighbo>   <table name="item_source">
<dneighbo>     <fields>
<dneighbo> it works

<dneighbo> <schema><tables>
<dneighbo> <!-- SOURCE LOOKUP TABLE -->
<dneighbo>   <table name="source_lookup">
<dneighbo>     <fields>
<dneighbo> it does not
<dneighbo> and Scripter.py never gives errors
<dneighbo> ie the import 'name' must match the table 'name'
<dneighbo> or the .sql doesnt get created, but no errors are generated
<dneighbo> im not sure if you meant it to force a name match or not
<dneighbo> if not its a bug
<jcater> um
<dneighbo> if so, we need an error message saying the .sql isnt created
<jcater> yes, it has to have a name to import against
<jcater> that's the purpose of that field
<jcater> but it is definitely a bug
<jcater> that parser doesn't bomb off with an error
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> ah, found it
<jcater> ok, committed

<dneighbo> hasnt asked me to go into microsoft networking yet
<chillywilly> hehe
<jbailey> neigbours is easy. =)
<jbailey> bah.  neighbours.
<chillywilly> did yo tell him you are running GNU/Linux?
<chillywilly> you
Action: jcater can see it now with the new training
<jcater> "Is GNU/Linux like Linux?"
<dneighbo> and ran network tests instead of assuming i was an idito
<dneighbo> idiot
<dneighbo> and ran same tests i have and confirms there is about 20% packet loss happening
<dneighbo> and will be sending someone out to replace the hardware
<dneighbo> chillywilly: no i learned the hardway to never do that :)
<dneighbo> i told him i was running M$ Advanced Linux Pro
<dneighbo> he said he hadnt tried that one yet...
<dneighbo> ;)?
<dneighbo> tech coming on monday to bring me new modem
<dneighbo> until then i guess i suffer
<jamest> technician shows up and notices that mr neybers has his home stereo speaker output spliced into network line because we wanted to be a webcaster
<dneighbo> roflmao
<dneighbo> um jamest now they have guitars that support ethernet connections
<dneighbo> why splice ;)
<jcater> gives new meaning to pinging a guitar
<jbailey> Think of the hack value.
<jbailey> 'cause next will be 802.11b
<jcater> I'd just hate to see the DoS on that thing
<jcater> what would happen?
<jcater> strings break?
<jbailey> And just *wait* until some major rock star in some major concert forgets to turn on encryption or uses an insecure password.
<jcater> hehe
<jcater> "Daddy, why does the guitar sound like it says, "I ownz ju"???
<jbailey> Headline: Geek arrested today at Metallica concert for incitement to riot.  "I thought it would be a good prank", said the man who simply gave his name as "Hax0r".  Earlier today, metalica began to play, when the sound cut out and began playing a backstreet boys song.  "It was hard to find the culprit with all the blood and corpses around", said Officer Kruptpky, "but the laptop was a dead give away."
<chillywilly> you guys are just taking this too far
<jbailey> It's either this, hack glibc, or do homework. =)
<chillywilly> well a wise man once said to me, "why don't you do something with your life?"
<jcater> chillywilly: why haven't you answered?

<dneighbo> jcater: i dont know, but its interesting none the less
<chillywilly> hmmm, most ppl still dig analog music though
<chillywilly> that's why we still prefer tube amps
<dneighbo> http://magic.gibson.com/
<dneighbo> of course its patent stuff
<dneighbo> so it needs a free equivalent :)
<chillywilly> thought they said it was going to be royalty free?
<chillywilly> so the patent is a bit moot isn't it?
<jcater> not hardly
<jcater> I'll let you use my foobulation library royalty free, chilly
<dneighbo> i saw the license
<dneighbo> just now
<dneighbo> its not even royalty free
<jcater> what happens when you piss me off, chilly?
<dneighbo> its royalty free for 10 years
<dneighbo> i.e. they want people to adopt over next 10 years
<chillywilly> jcater: yea, I know patents are still crappy
<dneighbo> and then when they ahve everyone by the balls the royalty wears off
<jbailey> Negotiate for royalty-free for 25 years. =)
<jcater> funny thing though
<psu> yeah, but with a Mickey Mouse Copyright Act, 10 years could become 100...
<jcater> I thought patents had a 14 year shelf life?
<dneighbo> Is there a license fee for developers?
<dneighbo> No. We are providing a ten year royalty free license on MaGIC. 
<psu> or 1...
<chillywilly> This is the same BS that Henry J's been trying to force down the throats of the rest of the industry for the past two years. It's why Gibson bought and killed Opcode. It's not a patch on the ass of Yamaha's MLan standard that's based on the much faster IEEE-1394 (aka Firewire). It's another worthless ego-trip for Gibson's delusional owner.
<chillywilly> Back to "Gibson Makes Music 'Magic'"
<chillywilly>   
<chillywilly> they all assume ppl would uise winders

<chillywilly> it's worn out

<jcater> wtf is a prelease?
Action: jcater must've been on crack
<chillywilly> ?
<chillywilly> oh, nm
<chillywilly> hehe
Action: chillywilly didn't even see the typo right away
<chillywilly> so don't feel bad
Action: psu will probably be looking to hook some people into helping on KCs
<psu> i.e. a group-authored approach
<psu> but I'm thinking how to do it first 
<psu> then will look for some volunteers
<jcater> I'll be happy to volunteer some people for you
<psu> no volunteers == carry on solo, but not cover everything
<psu> s/everything/as much
<jbailey> jcater: A prerelease is like preboarding an airplane.
<psu> since it doesn't cover *everything* even now
<jcater> jbailey: ?
<jbailey> jcater: It's a fiction created by marketing people to make others think something cool is happening and that they're not part of it. =)
Action: psu would not have been able to keep up this week if he hadn't been on vacation
<jcater> psu: I would volunteer to help, but I already spend too many hours on gnue each week :(
<psu> ooo
<psu> jcater: agreed
<jcater> agreed?
<jcater> you've been talking to my wife?
<psu> does this mean we'll get little cocktails w/frilly umbrellas 
<jbailey> psu: You'd know better than me if people have made the same mistake you made "How can I help?" =)_

<jbailey> nubile?  I don't think you've seen the flight attendants on air canada these days. =)

<jcater> hey now
<jcater> I try
<chillywilly> why would you *want* to be part of the marketing team?
<jcater> isn't that how you get the chicks?
<psu> marketing == easier than coding
<chillywilly> but you're married
<jcater> chillywilly: shhh!
<jcater> don't tell my girlfriend
<chillywilly> do you have a desth wish?
<chillywilly> death
<jcater> she might get jealous
<jcater> besides, the way things currently are
<jcater> I'm married to GNUe
<jcater> the wife is my mistress I escape to occasionally
<psu> chillywilly: you'll understand after 7th June 2003
<chillywilly> heheh
Action: psu notes that is the only 2003 date in my diary so far
<psu> well, apart from my Feb dentist appointment
<chillywilly> that date is "tentative" ;)
<psu> ok
Action: jcater hates programming in curses
<chillywilly> jamest's analogy of the even system is funny

<chillywilly> hehe, I see derek finally forced yall into roadmaps?
<jcater> no!
<jcater> not roadmaps!
<jcater> feature plans, dammit
<jcater> feature plans
<jcater> ;)
<jcater> anyone here have a good crockpot chili recipe?
<jbailey> I do.
<jcater> bah
<jbailey> But it's all vegan, is that okay? 
<jcater> that uses ground beef?
<jcater> actually that might be good
<jcater> what's in it?
<jbailey> I always wonder when I see people put meat into crockpots.  I didn't think those things stayed warm enough to keep away bacteria.
<jcater> I'm pretty sure they do
<jbailey> I also have the same fear when I see those rotating slabs of meat at greek take out places.
<psu> kebabs
<chillywilly> a spit?
Action: psu likes the way they call them "doner kebabs" to imply the animals were volunteers
Action: psu guesses that "Donner kebabs" has a diff implication in USA
<nickr>  hehe
<nickr> said entirely differently than doner though
<jcater> yummy

<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I haven't rewired my new house
Action: psu is away: kc-ing
<jcater> so I don't have cat5 in the kitchen for my recipe station :(
<chillywilly> dragon ball z rocks
<jcater> jbailey: what's in your vegan chili?
<jbailey> a couple types of beans, fried onions, lots of tomatoe sauce.
<jbailey> (or crushed tomatos)
<jbailey> Carrots, spices.
<jbailey> Trying to tihnk what else I throw in there.
<chillywilly> sounds pretty good
<jbailey> I like using black beans and black-eyed peas.
<jbailey> I tried chickpeas once (garbonzo beans for the UKer), and that was a mistake. =)
<jcater> mmmm
<jbailey> If you're using a crockpot with chilli and you want to throw in corn or something like that, don't throw it in until near the end or it turns into mush.
<jbailey> I'm torn between wanting to turn up the heat and wanting icecream.
<jbailey> I probably shouldn't do both. =)

<btami> me too
<ajmitch> morning
<jamest> anyone care to change it now ?
<jcater> I can
<jamest> kewl
<jcater> after I start the crockpot up

<jamest> btami: how well is  windows working?
<jamest> gnue in windows
<btami> i'v failed to put site.py/sitecustomize.py into McMillan
<btami> so i tend to use encodings thing
<btami> :(
<jamest> but how does forms itself (and designer) run?
<jamest> are they stable/usable
<jamest> or flaky as hell
<btami> well, they are OK
<ra3vat> no, thay are flaky
<btami> except the event issues
<btami> look collected win32 bugs in DCL :)
<jamest> ok
<ra3vat> btami: with test you asked i've only got an error when running form from within a designer
<jamest> i put a patch into designer yesterday
<btami> no
<jamest> so it'll work now but error out at the end
<ra3vat> ok, will check again
<jamest> part of designer outside of src/forms is still forms specific :(
<jamest> it'll get fixed after release
<btami> i'v failed with making forms/reports with simple wizard if i used non ascii title
<btami> when i want to save them
<jamest> ah, i thought he was talking about running form insdie designer via debug-run    my bad
<ra3vat> btami: what happens when you save?
<btami> btw. i can't run forms from designer via debug :)
<jamest> from today's cvs?
<btami> wait i try all my things again :)
<jcater> wait
<jcater> re the formFontEncoding
<jcater> what outside of forms will use it?
<jamest> wasn't designer going to support all languages in its menus/dialgos?
Action: jamest runs
<jcater> oh, yeah... designer
<jcater> doh!
<ajmitch> oooh, who has call center software available? :)
Action: ajmitch just got email from boss asking about it
<jcater> I have highly custom stuff
<ajmitch> right, i heard you had some stuff
<ajmitch> how custom is it? tailored exactly for the business?
<jcater> yeah
<ajmitch> what industry?
<jcater> fundraising

<jcater> jason@jcater:~$
<jcater> gotcha
<btami> my bad patch in GParser.py now uses formFontEncoding
<btami> that is wrong
<jcater> formFontEncoding in GParser?
<jcater> why?
<btami> sorry, that is not my patch, its from art
<btami> my is in GRReport
<btami> but as jamest said, a simple fontEncoding in [common] is a solution
<jcater> but, but, but
<jcater> what fonts are in GRReport?
<jcater> this is where I'm getting lost
<jcater> should that be
<jcater> fileEncoding?
<jcater> or textEncoding
<btami> yes
<jcater> it's the "font" part that's losing me
<jcater> ok
<jcater> we are on the same page now
<btami> maybe font is needed for wx
<jcater> which is the better name?
<jcater> textEncoding?
<btami> ok for me

<ra3vat> > how to reach what GNU gettext bind_textdomain_codeset function is for

<ra3vat> Dmitry,
<ra3vat> I recommend to use ugettext instead, or wrap it
<ra3vat> appropriately. ugettext will always return Unicode objects (assuming
<ra3vat> that the codeset of the .mo file was properly declared in the .mo
<ra3vat> header).
<ra3vat> > I'd like to use translation catalog which is in koi8-r encoding with gui
<ra3vat> > that expects either koi8-r or cp1251.
<ra3vat> Then I recommend to do something like this
<ra3vat> catalog = gettext.translation("domainname")
<ra3vat> runtime_charset = "cp1251"
<ra3vat> def _(msg):
<ra3vat>   return catalog.ugettext(msg).encode(runtime_charset)
<ra3vat> Changing runtime_charset will then arrange for _ to return
<ra3vat> differently-encoded messages.
<ra3vat> > The problem is that we are trying to leave encoding = "ascii" in
<ra3vat> > site.py as it is by default and assign needed encoding at run time.
<ra3vat> That is a good idea.
<ra3vat> > Without bind_textdomain_codeset we need to put something like
<ra3vat> > _('Text String').encode(neededencoding) in too many places
<ra3vat> Not necessarily. Even without ugettext, you could always do
<ra3vat> def _(msg):
<ra3vat>   gettext.dgettext(domain).decode("koi8-r").encode("cp1251")
<ra3vat> That, of course, requires you to hard-code the codeset of the catalog,
<ra3vat> which is undesirable - ugettext finds out the codeset of the catalog
<ra3vat> dynamically.
<ra3vat> Remember: _ is just a function. This function can do any computation
<ra3vat> you want.
<ra3vat> > Sorry for not asking in newsgroup but personally.
<ra3vat> That is ok (in this specific case :-).
<ra3vat> If you think bind_textdomain_codeset is a better interface than
<ra3vat> ugettext, I encourage you to enhance gettext.py in this respect.  I
<ra3vat> would add another dictionary, next to _localedirs; say,
<ra3vat> _localecodesets. Then, add a gettext_codeset method to GNUTranslation,
<ra3vat> which does recoding if necessary, and use that in dgettext if a
<ra3vat> _localecodeset has been set for the domain.
<ra3vat> You might also consider adding a codeset argument to install, which
<ra3vat> would (if recoding is needed) install a lambda function like
<ra3vat>    def install(self, unicode=0, codeset = None):
<ra3vat>         import _
<ra3vat> looks very bad
<ra3vat> better to forward to maillist

<jamest> whoop!
<jamest> got designer to lock my entire UI
<jamest> that's a good thing right?
<dneighbo> cool
<jamest> one step further down the path to being a dneighbo
<dneighbo> i remember sosmething similar in the 0.0.1 days ;)
<dneighbo> with forms
<jamest> how goes the testing with gnue-sb forms?
<dneighbo> i have them all working
<dneighbo> i told jcater things look WAY more solid than 0.4.0
<dneighbo> very impressive
<dneighbo> i didnt use the pre-release though (my mess up) i used cvs

<dneighbo> ok jamest you want bug reports?
<jamest> yes
<dneighbo> or you want me to submit via dcl
<dneighbo> jamest: i might have some need for sloppy query
<dneighbo> designer still has really _old_ bug of not properly updating forms in designer when dealing with entry w/ rows
<dneighbo> i.e. you add an entry
<dneighbo> then change its 'row' property to 10
<dneighbo> it wont show on the screen until you shut the form down and reopen it
Action: dneighbo remembers vaguely this being a wx issue
<jamest> i can reimplement sloppy query
<jamest> no, it's our issue
<jamest> but it's not worth fixing at this time 
<jamest> as that's going to change anyway
<ra3vat> jamest: yes
<dneighbo> jamest: 3 more forms down for testing
<dneighbo> using designer a bit on them
<dneighbo> moving to the big bad ugly mo-fo
