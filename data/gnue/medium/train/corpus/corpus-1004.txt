<jbailey> Whatfore?
<jbailey> dneighbo: Probably, which package?
<jbailey> ajmitch: What did I do this time?
<dneighbo> for debs
<ajmitch> sheep jokes :P
<dneighbo> ajmitch: says gtk2 isnt in there
Action: dneighbo was thinking we would do

<dneighbo> gnue-forms-curses

<dneighbo> er base
<dneighbo> gnue-common-pyscopg
<dneighbo> or such
<dneighbo> if that makes reasonable sense to you
<dneighbo> to give people finer grain control of the install
<jbailey> ajmitch: Nothing wrong with sheep jokes as long as I don't inflict them on NZers, right?
<jbailey> dneighbo: Yes, I think that's the plan.
<jbailey> certainly for forms anyway.
<jbailey> The hard part with doing it too much is that people will never figure out what to install.

<ajmitch> i've got to find out how to fill in the summary & source, but it gives a useful hierarchy :)
<ajmitch> hmm, why is it that everyone goes silent when i'm around? :)
<jbailey> Dunno.  It's a usual phenominon of this channel when actual work is being done.
<jbailey> I'm in here for 30 minutes thinking about work, no noise.
<jbailey> I mention sheep and both you *and* derek appear out of thin air. =)
<jbailey> I tihnk the trick is to make it look like it's not important.
<jbailey> That way noone gets scared off. =)
<ajmitch> i appeared a few minutes after your sheep remark ;)
<ajmitch> i was busy looking at what inherits from what in the source

<dneighbo> woo hoo
<dneighbo> gnue-sb has working item management !
<ra3vat> is it committed?
<dneighbo> yeah but not the main maint screen
Action: dneighbo forgot that one
<dneighbo> duh...
<ra3vat> what gcvs is for?
<dneighbo> it wraps common
<dneighbo> so say you write a script myfoo.py
<dneighbo> that usues common
<dneighbo> instead of having to set python paths you can just do
<dneighbo> gcvs myfoo.py
<ra3vat> oh, good thing
<dneighbo> which is nice since the gsd converter uses common but isnt a real script as of yet
<dneighbo> gcvs Scripter.py mycool.gsd postgresql > newpsql.sql
<dneighbo> anyone else using cvs?
<dneighbo> combo boxes seem broken for me
<dneighbo> the data shows up in the list

<dneighbo> yeeehaw combobox works for me now
<dneighbo> old designer seems have typecast some fields that dont work with new schema

<ra3vat> when will we get that [common] in gnue.conf?
<jbailey> Heya siesel.
<siesel> jbailey: one question: should the /etc/gnue/sample.connection.conf and /etc/gnue/sample.gnue.conf be configuration files?
<siesel> ra3vat: its just a bit hacking needed, i.e. changing all calls in form from gConfig to gformConfig and using gConfig only to access [common] values
<ra3vat> gConfigForms?
<jbailey> siesel: I don't think so - Because they're intended to be samples, there should be no good reason to change them.
<jbailey> But debhelper will mark them as such automatically.
<jbailey> I so I will probably move them into /usr/share/doc/PACKAGE/examples
<siesel> that would be great, thanks.
<jbailey> Is it causing you grief?
<jbailey> (Assessing urgency)
<siesel> ra3vat: you can set global configuration commands in GConfig.py
<jbailey> If yes, please file a bug so that I remember it.
<siesel> jbailey: just a question of astetics :)

<dneighbo> i didnt get prereleases tested (me got busy and used cvs forgetting)
<dneighbo> stuff looks very good
<dneighbo> much more solid that 0.4.0
<dneighbo> i have questions on formatmasks
<dneighbo> actually i worked around it so the question lies in feature map
<dneighbo> we need to add number/currency format/input masks
<dneighbo> and documentation of masks :)
<dneighbo> i ahve to take kids swimming
<dneighbo> but when i get back i have a nice 5gallon drum of lube
<dneighbo> and i plan to sit down with navigator
<dneighbo> so expect the feature map to fall out ;)
<jcater> input masks are a BIG todo
<jcater> we are very close
<jcater> but no cigar quite yet
<jcater> (that should be in 0.5.0 plans, if not, I'll add)
<dneighbo> again im not dictating which release :)
<jcater> it's a biggie
<jcater> as in, needs
<jcater> well, and programming too I guess
<jcater> although most of the backend is in there
<dneighbo> it could be i didnt look
<dneighbo> i know we talked about it in designer the other day

<dneighbo> im not sure if you meant it to force a name match or not
<dneighbo> if not its a bug
<jcater> um
<dneighbo> if so, we need an error message saying the .sql isnt created

<chillywilly> This is the same BS that Henry J's been trying to force down the throats of the rest of the industry for the past two years. It's why Gibson bought and killed Opcode.

<jcater> jbailey: what's in your vegan chili?
<jbailey> a couple types of beans, fried onions, lots of tomatoe sauce.
<jbailey> (or crushed tomatos)
<jbailey> Carrots, spices.
<jbailey> Trying to tihnk what else I throw in there.
<chillywilly> sounds pretty good
<jbailey> I like using black beans and black-eyed peas.
<jbailey> I tried chickpeas once (garbonzo beans for the UKer), and that was a mistake. =)
<jcater> mmmm
<jbailey> If you're using a crockpot with chilli and you want to throw in corn or something like that, don't throw it in until near the end or it turns into mush.
<jbailey> I'm torn between wanting to turn up the heat and wanting icecream.
<jbailey> I probably shouldn't do both. =)

<jamest> i put a patch into designer yesterday
<btami> no
<jamest> so it'll work now but error out at the end
<ra3vat> ok, will check again
<jamest> part of designer outside of src/forms is still forms specific :(
<jamest> it'll get fixed after release
<btami> i'v failed with making forms/reports with simple wizard if i used non ascii title

<btami> sorry, that is not my patch, its from art
<btami> my is in GRReport

<jcater> but, but, but
<jcater> what fonts are in GRReport?
<jcater> this is where I'm getting lost
<jcater> should that be
<jcater> fileEncoding?
<jcater> or textEncoding
<btami> yes
<jcater> it's the "font" part that's losing me
<jcater> ok
<jcater> we are on the same page now
<btami> maybe font is needed for wx
<jcater> which is the better name?
<jcater> textEncoding?
<btami> ok for me
<btami> formFontEncoding is needed for  wx UI driver
<jcater> but are they the same thing always?
<btami> and this new one is for parsers
<jcater> ok
<jcater> so this does not replace formFontEncoding?

<ra3vat> > how to reach what GNU gettext bind_textdomain_codeset function is for
<ra3vat> > with python gettext module?
<ra3vat> Dmitry,
<ra3vat> I recommend to use ugettext instead, or wrap it
<ra3vat> appropriately. ugettext will always return Unicode objects (assuming
<ra3vat> that the codeset of the .mo file was properly declared in the .mo
<ra3vat> header).
<ra3vat> > I'd like to use translation catalog which is in koi8-r encoding with gui
<ra3vat> > that expects either koi8-r or cp1251.
<ra3vat> Then I recommend to do something like this
<ra3vat> catalog = gettext.translation("domainname")
<ra3vat> runtime_charset = "cp1251"
<ra3vat> def _(msg):
<ra3vat>   return catalog.ugettext(msg).encode(runtime_charset)
<ra3vat> Changing runtime_charset will then arrange for _ to return
<ra3vat> differently-encoded messages.
<ra3vat> > The problem is that we are trying to leave encoding = "ascii" in
<ra3vat> > site.py as it is by default and assign needed encoding at run time.
<ra3vat> That is a good idea.
<ra3vat> > Without bind_textdomain_codeset we need to put something like
<ra3vat> > _('Text String').encode(neededencoding) in too many places
<ra3vat> Not necessarily. Even without ugettext, you could always do
<ra3vat> def _(msg):
<ra3vat>   gettext.dgettext(domain).decode("koi8-r").encode("cp1251")
<ra3vat> That, of course, requires you to hard-code the codeset of the catalog,
<ra3vat> which is undesirable - ugettext finds out the codeset of the catalog
<ra3vat> dynamically.
<ra3vat> Remember: _ is just a function. This function can do any computation
<ra3vat> you want.
<ra3vat> > Sorry for not asking in newsgroup but personally.
<ra3vat> That is ok (in this specific case :-).
<ra3vat> If you think bind_textdomain_codeset is a better interface than
<ra3vat> ugettext, I encourage you to enhance gettext.py in this respect.  I
<ra3vat> would add another dictionary, next to _localedirs; say,
<ra3vat> _localecodesets. Then, add a gettext_codeset method to GNUTranslation,
<ra3vat> which does recoding if necessary, and use that in dgettext if a
<ra3vat> _localecodeset has been set for the domain.
<ra3vat> You might also consider adding a codeset argument to install, which
<ra3vat> would (if recoding is needed) install a lambda function like
<ra3vat>    def install(self, unicode=0, codeset = None):
<ra3vat>         import _
<ra3vat> looks very bad
<ra3vat> better to forward to maillist

Action: dneighbo has been checking guide but last three times struck out :(
<dneighbo> i.e. the section existed but was blank, so i was asking if in guide

<dimas> is there any side effect of labels being inside block?
<jcater> if you have rows=".." set on the block, they will be repeated once for each row
<ra3vat> ok

<ra3vat> DB000: KeyError: <gnue.forms.GFObjects.GFEntry.GFEntry instance at 01E098EC>

ariel_ (~ariel@ppp-217-133-240-136.dialup.tiscali.it) left irc: "Uscita dal client"
<ra3vat> and then strange behavior when i hit "f8" right after form appeared all entries from a few tabbed pages displayed upon each other at once
<ra3vat> and when i click on tabs one may display what other should
<ra3vat> this same form works under linux about a week in heavy load. and works great

<derek> jcater / jamest i had to run before
<derek> something odd happened that needs to be researched
<derek> i had forms or designer open (i dont recall which) 
<derek> and when i shut it down
<derek> X crashed and restarted
<derek> if it were on my normal machine i would say no big deal, but on my laptop X never crashes
<derek> add to the fact that jamest had same thing happen today (or so it seemed)
<derek> we might want to look into this
<derek> other than that cvs has been a dream to play with today
<derek> responsive, stable and productive
<derek> i hope to make it back tonight to play some more
Action: derek is away: family
