<jamest> is this only in i18n forms?
<jamest> hi btami
<btami> hi
<jamest> how goes the win32 stuff
<ra3vat> btami: i've got that bug with non-ascii page and title
<btami> so i'm not a paranoid
<ra3vat> but in my case it was that encoding missed in xml header
<btami> jamest: win32 setup is ok, just about 10Mb, not for slow modem :)
<ra3vat> jamest: will try again now on w98 and ascii form
<jamest> 10MB!!!!!!
<jamest> wow
<btami> it grabs tcl/tk/tkinter too
<btami> i don't know which modul
<btami> but i have another bugs :)
<btami> 1. please put gnue.common.external into commons setup.py
<btami> 2. i don't know how to save trigger code (written in event editor) with designer
<btami> it doesn't saves for me
<jamest> 1.   working on it

<jamest> 2. how are you using it?
<jamest> do you add the trigger then edit it
<jamest> edit existing trigger
<jamest> or other
<btami> added a new button with wizard
<btami> then edited in event editor
Action: jamest will try it
<ra3vat> jamest: ascii-only form negative values for width and max-length
<jamest> 1. fixed in cv
<jamest> s
<ra3vat> unpaired </options> right after <form ..> tag
<jamest> ra3vat: :(  I've see something like this once or twice
<jamest> with <block> tags
<btami> i'm waiting to say my 3. :)
<jamest> acsii-only?
<jamest> ra3vat?
<jamest> oooo wizards have issues
<jamest> !@#!$!@#
<ra3vat> i did not put any non-ascii
<ra3vat> values
<jamest> it's a simple table?
<jamest> using the simple wizard?
<jamest> ooooooo
<jamest> what distro you running?
<jamest> and what db driver?
<ra3vat> simple form wizard
<jamest> there is a known issue with one of the postgresql drivers in debian sid
<jamest> that IIRC does exactly this
<ra3vat> distro is w98 :)
<jamest> what db driver?
<ra3vat> db drive is pypgsql
<jamest> btami: I'm going to need time on #2 as I see a problem in there
<jamest> what's #3
<jamest> ra3vat: can you send me the schema of the table?
<jamest> so I can test 
<btami> reports without any non ascii
<btami> with sablotron filter
Action: jamest cringes
Action: jamest ph34rs reports code
<btami> jcater put encoding="iso8859-1" into xml header
<btami> but sablotron doesn't knoes that
<btami> it knows iso-8859-1
<btami> so sablotron fails
<jamest> so if I thange to the latter we'll be ok
<jamest> and the current iso8859-1 isn't used elsewhere?
<ra3vat> CREATE TABLE "reclaims" (
<ra3vat>         "id" integer DEFAULT nextval('reclaims_id_seq'::text) NOT NULL,
<ra3vat>         "num" text,
<ra3vat>         "origdate" date,

<ra3vat>         "vendor_id" integer,
<ra3vat>         "model" character varying(20),
<ra3vat> is what pg_dump gives and i only choose num and model fields
<btami> jamest:iso8859-2 is used elsewhere, but they are correct, its only a sblotron issue i think
<jamest> in our sablotron setup or the program in general?
Action: jamest knows nothing about sablotron
fixe (~adam@dsl093-081-253.chi2.dsl.speakeasy.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<btami> in sablotron general
<jamest> :(
<ra3vat> btami: then blame sablotron guys :)
<btami> :)
<jamest> ra3vat: are you using pypgsql 2.3beta or 2.2 stable?
<jamest> btami: if it's in sablotron then do you have any suggestions for a workaround we can put in our code?
<jamest> among the numerious things in the world that I have no clue about i18n/encodings are pretty high on the list 
<ra3vat> it is 2.0.win32
<btami> jamest: in GRReport.py line#134 
<btami> encoding = 'iso-8859-1' 
<btami> will fix it

<_btami> jamest: what about changing formFontEncoding [forms] -> fontEncoding [common] i gnue.conf ?
lupo (~lupo@pD9542DB5.dip.t-dialin.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> jason looked into that yesterday and had some concern, but I have no clue what it was
<ra3vat> jamest: have you seen another issue i tried to explain yesterday?
<jamest> ?
<ra3vat> it is in backlog
<jamest> ok, i'll look in a bit
Action: jamest is on a mission
<jamest> forms was scrapped by a local company for a custom java app partially due to fact that python isn't as well know (i guess)
<jamest> that app has taking them the better part of this year to implement
<lupo> how ignorant
<jamest> and certain feautres are missing 
<lupo> lemme guess, you did it in 5 minutes with forms and python :)
<jamest> so I was working on their hardware one weekend and they mentioned they couldn't do lookups on anything but id number and phone number
<jamest> then only pull 1 record at a time
<jamest> so via designer I whipped up a query form in like 90 seconds
<lupo> brb
<jamest> they liked it
<jamest> now I'm making one for them to query anything that the java app builds
<jamest> and it didn't take 5 minutes
<jamest> I've probably got a few hours in it
<jamest> but i'm finding forms bugs as I go
<jamest> and it won't do what the java app does
<jamest> i'd need a few more hours to get all the triggers in place :)
<jamest> but I desperately want to get this in there
<jamest> as they are using forms and reports in production now
<jamest> but want to rewrite all in java or something else
<lupo> great
<lupo> so you get paid for working on gnue tools, at least from that customer?
<jamest> i get money for the time working on the form
<jamest> i don't get paid time for gnue coding time
<lupo> paid for fixing forms bugs?
<jamest> which makes it hard to explain to wife sometimes
<jamest> as I worked like 4 hours yesterday 
<lupo> what's so difficult to understand?
<jamest> the fact that I don't charge for finding gnue bugs
<lupo> i see
<jamest> as 4 hours on their stuff != 4 hours of money
<jamest> and I work at an extremely low rate
<jamest> the original contract stated that anything I did for them that wasn't private was mine to integrate into gnue
<jamest> if it wasn't like that then the old hourly wage would have shot up alot
<lupo> what a pity
<jamest> what? that they scrapped it?
<jamest> or that I don't get paid to work on gnue code?
Action: jamest wouldn't want to get paid for that as then it'd be "work" 
<lupo> ah
<lupo> programming for fun :)

<jamest> oh yeah
<jamest> i don't need this side job
<jamest> but the owner is a great guy
<jamest> and I love maintaining their hardware
<lupo> ?
<jamest> when I started they had 1 dos box (8088 machine) and a win95 box
<lupo> and now?

<jamest> they now are 100% linux based (except for fedex computer, their scanner pc, and a copy of dreamweaver)
<jamest> running like 18 ltsp workstations
<jamest> all from a couple of custom servers I built
<lupo> great
<ra3vat> btami: you get that Martin's message with comment from gnue-dev list?
<jamest> it's fun
<btami> ra3vat: yes
<jamest> anyway, i must finish this form up
<jamest> as their java coder is overloaded with work
<lupo> 18 ltsp workstations is fun, right :)
<jamest> and this takes the pressure off him and makes a good case for keeping forms/reports instead of replacing
<ra3vat> btami: am i the only one who has different encoding on different platform?
<btami> no, i have iso8859-2 on linux, and cp1250 on win32

<psu> Hmm
<psu> what does this error msg mean (excuse paste)
<psu> cvs server: ERROR: cannot write file /webcvs/software/gnue/gnue.html,v: Permission denied
<psu> does it simply mean what it says (i.e my perms are b0rked)?
<jcater> they don't have you in the webcvs group
<psu> or is it ... something more sinister...
<jcater> psu: hang on
<psu> yes, but I am a member of gnue
<jcater> well
<psu> so should have access to our HTML CVS
<jcater> they neglected to set /webcvs/software/gnue to be in gnue's group
<jcater> :(
<psu> ah
<psu> that would be it ;-/
<jcater> can you try again?
<Mr_You> I get some errors with the latest navigator prerelease and others, probably me tho..
<psu> rock!
<Mr_You> tried loading gnue-sb contacts.gpd  (sp?)
<psu> Checking in gnue.html; initial revision: 1.1 done
<Mr_You> anyone know if GNUe actually uses the schema definition files to create the DB tables or is it just for reference for now?

<psu> Mr_You: it should work
<psu> I know derek has been beating on jcater to fix some probs with gsd support
<psu> and the beating has stopped
<psu> so I assume it's been fixed ;-)
<Mr_You> well  I haven't begun using it, I'm just curious if this aspect is functional or not.
<Mr_You> I was going to mess with gnue-sb 
<Mr_You> I gotta setup another dev box, sucks  working this way.
<Mr_You> dualboot.

<DrudgeRoopert> err payment due
<nickr> gnucash?
<DrudgeRoopert> im using that, but im not sure how to do it so you say you did some work and you havent been paid for it yet.

<ajmitch> hello all
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-245.wasp.net.au) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<jcater> ajmitch: werd
<ajmitch> hey
<ajmitch> now i can get back to making my form work :)
<ajmitch> like automagically inserting sequence numbers for master/detail
<jamest> that should be in the docs as a recipe 
<jamest> IIRC
<ajmitch> mysql's auto_increment doesn't work for master/detail, nor is it friendly :)
<ajmitch> yeah, i know, mysql sucks
<ajmitch> so who has a recipe for me? ;)
<chillywilly> take on mysql
<chillywilly> er, one
<chillywilly> broil it
<chillywilly> cut it up into little pieces
<chillywilly> works wonders as a substitude for cat litter
<chillywilly> cna even help yo soak up oil spills on your driveway
<jcater> chillywilly: yeah, and it can soak up that cat piss 10 times faster than postgresql
<jcater> just don't ask it to save the stuff reliably and it's all good
<jamest> ajmitch: i think if you implenet 
<jamest> sequenceNumber in the mysql driver 
<ajmitch> jcater: i got a couple of bugs for the gtk2 driver, shall i put them in dcl & fix them sometime?
<jamest> then you'd have them
<jamest> i _think_
<ajmitch> hmm
<jcater> ajmitch: works for me
<jcater> ajmitch: we never mind when someone wants to open a ticket that they plan to fix someday
<ajmitch> ok
<jcater> :)
<ajmitch> they _should_ be fairly simple to fix
<ajmitch> but can't promise that :)
<jamest> ajmitch: yes
<jamest> you fix that one driver functoin and it should just work
<jamest> what's the issue w/ mysql and sequences
<jamest> lemme guess....it doesn't have them
<ajmitch> jamest: ok, i just don't understand the issue :)
<ajmitch> jamest: all i want is for the primary key (id) to be set for each record :)
<jamest> in the detail?
<jamest> s
<ajmitch> and the value being set to be visible to the detail portion
<jamest> that's automatic on a commit in common
<ajmitch> right
<jamest> however getting the initial value from the db isn't IIRC
<ajmitch> hmm
<jamest> if you do the assignment on the database side then you have issues IIRC
<jamest> a db side trigger
<ajmitch> yup
<jamest> or a default value set to a function
<ajmitch> triggers? what's that? this is mysql i'm using :)
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> well, then that can't be the issue then :)
<jamest> does it have sequences?
<ajmitch> umm
<jamest> and is that where you are getting the primary key value?
<ajmitch> i'm not getting it yet
<jamest> where is it stored?
<ajmitch> at the moment, i have the primary key field set to auto_increment in the db
<ajmitch> which sucks
<jamest> hey! auto_increement == db side trigger!
<jamest> see, it's more advance than i give it credit
<jcater> um
<ajmitch> hah
<jcater> do you know the name of the sequence it created?
<ajmitch> name?
<jamest> this is mysql...naming things slows it down
Action: ajmitch doesn't think mysql does this sequence thing
<ajmitch> it's simple
<jcater> yeah it does
<jcater> it just hides it from you
<ajmitch> great
Action: jcater is googling for the answer
<jamest> showing user things slows it down
<ajmitch> i'd like to switch to postgresql :)
<chillywilly> the lesson here kiddies
<chillywilly> mysql sucks ass
<ajmitch> the lesson here, is that sometimes we don't have that much choice 
<chillywilly> that is all
<chillywilly> ajmitch: why would you HAVE to use mysql?
Action: jamest is just giving ajmitch a hard time
<jamest> with the gazillon installs for mysql it must be doing something right
<ajmitch> say if you're developing something for systems already with mysql
<chillywilly> use gsd and you get them all right? ;)
<ajmitch> or if you want to make something based on a db even simpler than mysql (like gadfly)
<ajmitch> would probably be easier for me to get the current id value, increment it, and save it back
<jamest> you using inno ?
<jamest> ajmitch?
<ajmitch> nope
<jamest> what's your backend then?
<ajmitch> huh?
<ajmitch> i'm currently using mysql
<jamest> mysql supports multiple backends
<ajmitch> will probably do forms for non-mysql stuff at some point
<ajmitch> hmm ok
<ajmitch> i'm just using boring old standard mysql from debian sid
<jamest> http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/SEC468.html
<jcater> ajmitch: will other programs be accessing this table?
<jcater> accessing == inserting records
<jamest> http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/ODBC_and_last_insert_id.html
<jamest> this should work for us I think
<jcater> dude
<jcater> there's no way
<jamest> ah, crap I misread that
<jamest> that's AFTER the insert isn't it
<jcater> yeah
<jamest> ajmitch: here's what you do
<jcater> but that's what I keep coming back to 
<jamest> create a table gnue_seed
<jcater> that, or  select max(id)+1 from table;
<ajmitch> jcater: nah, only this one for now
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> then let's create a real sequence :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<jamest> then make the getSequence in the db driver read the seed via a select for update, update it, 
Action: ajmitch gets confused
<jamest> then have it print to the debug log
<ajmitch> only got 3 hours sleep last night ;)
<jamest> "compensating for the lack of a sane database"
<ajmitch> i have no problems with dropping the tables & starting again
<jcater> ajmitch: great!!!!!
<jcater> do that
<jcater> then do apt-get install postgresql
<ajmitch> haha
<ajmitch> i already have postgresql running here
<jcater> dudes
<ajmitch> i want to know how to do this for any mysql form :)
<jcater> there has to be some way to get at that autoincremenet
<jamest> oooooo
<jamest> nevermind
<ajmitch> this is just a test form for now
<ajmitch> because i was bored ;)
Action: ajmitch would have thought this would be a 2-minute thing with mysql, at most
<chillywilly> buuurp
<jcater> ajmitch: so did I
<dneighbo> jcater / jamest did you see my back log the other day
<dneighbo> closing designer/forms crashed my X instance completely
<dneighbo> same as happened to jamest
<jamest> no, it locks mine
Action: dneighbo notes this was after about 1.5 hours of using forms/designer
Action: dneighbo isnt saying gnue is the cause, but it smells fishy
<jamest> i've used it all day with crash issues
<jamest> had 1 lockup issue that is non reproducable 
<dneighbo> jamest: so you confirming that gnue is crashing X
<jamest> no, x is fine
<jcater> using gnue for 1.5 hrs?!?!?!
<jcater> what, are you nuts!
<jamest> it's locking keyboard focus onto itself
<jcater> that could cause blindness, you know
<jamest> and not letter go
<jamest> x is fine
<jamest> :)
<ajmitch> jamest: i had one lockup
<dneighbo> jcater: well when it works i can uses it all day :)
Action: dneighbo has a slew of gnue-sb commits
<dneighbo> like i think almost every form is fully functional now :)
Action: ajmitch tries again to see if he locks it
<jamest> we're in the middle of a release 
<dneighbo> i just was finishing the last form when it died
<jamest> as in tying up the text files
<ajmitch> hmm no
<jamest> so it'll have to wait 
<dneighbo> and then i had to run
<dneighbo> jamest: thats fine
<jamest> btw - checkboxes work again 
<jamest> thank you jcater
<dneighbo> i have no problem releasing with known bugs
<ajmitch> tag it for next release if we have another 0.4.x
Action: dneighbo just wanted to make sure i voiced my 'experience'
<dneighbo> i.e. wanting to give you all feedback
<jamest> thank yo
Action: jcater wasn't paying attention
<jcater> but: 
<jamest> we needed the testing
<jcater> if feedback == positive: 
<jcater>   print "um, thanks"
<jcater> else:
<jcater>   print "We didn't ask"
<jcater> I think that covers it
Action: jcater ducks
<jamest>   print "must be on your end"
<jcater> hehe
<jcater> yeah, that's better
Action: ajmitch files a couple of bugs :)
<chillywilly> print "dneighbo did it"
<chillywilly> print "run with --disable-masta-hooks"
<ajmitch> hehe, i love how it says jcater is responsible for the forms bugs when submitted :)
<dneighbo> jcater: actually almsot all my feedback was very positive
<jcater> cool
<jcater> then:
<jcater> "um, thanks"
<dneighbo> stating stuff that hasnt worked in a year is now working
<dneighbo> and that stuff was very solid
<dneighbo> and i was able to be HIGHLY productive with it
<ajmitch> sounds like this release might be worth using then
<jamest> about time you updated your forms, you know we try and break the gfd at every release
<dneighbo> the only real thing i ran into was the crashing X
<dneighbo> and that was after almost 2 hours of productive
<dneighbo> time
<jamest> and if you didn't update your forms then we musta come full circle

<dneighbo> or file a bug to them?
<jcater> oops, I forgot the html versions... they are uploaded now
<jcater> dneighbo: I'm going to have to spend some time on that
<jcater> and do a simple script that can repeat the issue
<ajmitch> jcater: oh btw: http://ajmitch.dhis.org/devel/classdocs/
<ajmitch> just a simple class hierarchy for now
<jcater> gack
<jcater> that's scary looking
<ajmitch> yup
<jcater> :)
<jcater> alrighty everyone
<jcater> time's up
<jcater> cvs is being tagged
<ajmitch> excellent
Action: dneighbo loves gsd
<dneighbo> jcater: is it working in designer again?
<dneighbo> i.e. the wizard to create them from db's?
<jcater> I think so
<jcater> that's gonna get a hefty overhaul shortly
<dneighbo> otay
<jamest> bash-2.05a$ history | grep tag

<dneighbo> mmm mmm goodness
<dneighbo> jcater: im seeing that very quickly we will need to address gsd 'diffs'
<dneighbo> i.e. schema mods
<dneighbo> as currently its easy for me as i know what im changing so i just drop the thing i modified and rerun script
<jcater> dneighbo: already in the works
<dneighbo> otay
Action: dneighbo likes irc tonight
<dneighbo> favorable responses, minimal 'hang the bloody bastard' and a release to boot
<dneighbo> does it get any better?
<chillywilly> we could have pizza and donuts
<jcater> ok, everyone do the dance with me:  http://www.gnuenterprise.org/var/www/downloads/prereleases/
<jcater> err
<jcater> s,var/www,
<dneighbo> SO KICK ASS
<jcater> http://www.gnuenteprise.org/downloads/prereleases/
<dneighbo> my contact_manager.gfd now saves in gnue_sb!!!
<dneighbo> i think that was last non functional form in there
<jcater> fsck
<jcater> nickserv isn't letting me log in
<jcater> if that dependent on my hostname?
<jcater> s/if/is
<chillywilly> I dun think so
<chillywilly> does it complain?
<jcater> tells me bad password
<jcater> which I don't buy
<jcater> I just don't forget passwords, dammit
<chillywilly> yes you do
<chillywilly> ;)
#gnuenterprise: mode change '+o jcater' by ChanServ!ChanServ@services.
Topic changed on #gnuenterprise by jcater!~jcater@cpe-066-061-083-220.midsouth.rr.com: One last dance: http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/prereleases.php ... do your part.
<dneighbo> cool even the nested/custom block navigation functions
<jcater> it, um, remembered my password
<jcater> dumb thing
<jcater> ;)
<dneighbo> ok new gnue-sb committed
<dneighbo> item management and contact management forms should 'function'
<dneighbo> they could be improved a bit
<dneighbo> and could have more features
<dneighbo> but the basic schema's and forms are there and do work!
<dneighbo> basically the two custom pieces i had hodgepodged at one time are now functioning
<dneighbo> i will look at 'feature maps' now for gnuesb
<jcater> cool
<dneighbo> and will build on these blocks as i begin to fold in stuff from NOLA
<dneighbo> btw: jcater/jamest MAJOR kudos to this release
<dneighbo> it is by far the best gnue we have seen to date
<jcater> so, what is this release's name?
<dneighbo> hardly seems fair to consider it a x.x.X release
<jcater> is it the "dneighbo is ecstatic" release?
<jcater> dneighbo: actually, it was mostly cleanup
<dneighbo> sure we can nick name it DIE
<dneighbo> hmmm RFID interesting concept
<jcater> ?
<dneighbo> wireless barcodes basically
<dneighbo> instead of a 'barcode' product has a an RF transmitable tag
<dneighbo> the trick is alien technologies just bumped the technology forward by lightyears
<dneighbo> coming up with sub .10 RFID tags
<dneighbo> of which someone just bought 500 million
<dneighbo> almost half of what is on the market currently
<dneighbo> all starwars toys ship with them
<dneighbo> http://www.rfidjournal.com/FAQs.html
<dneighbo> two immediately striking things are 
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I've read about these
<dneighbo> they can carry tihngs like 'expiration dates'
<chillywilly> next toe gov't embeds a chip into everyone's skull in order to keep track of them
<dneighbo> but i think places really using them are by 'pallets'
<dneighbo> you can skrink a whole pallet
<dneighbo> and scan the items w/o unbundling the pallet
<dneighbo> or so it would seem
<dneighbo> since they are not based on line of sight
<jcater> dneighbo: we traditionally have a "In other news, ...." paragraph at the end of our release announcements
<jcater> do you want gnue-sb mentioned there?
<dneighbo> yes please
<chillywilly> why does this stuff make me think they are gonna se RFIDs to track ppl?
<dneighbo> it needs people starting to beat on it
<chillywilly> am I paranoid?
<jcater> chillywilly: the range on those RFIDs are really small
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> i.e. they are great for warehousing
<dneighbo> chillywilly: if you stuff starwars figures up your ass, you deserve to be tracked ;)
<jcater> but you are talking a few feet, iirc
<jcater> dneighbo: rofl
<dneighbo> jcater: when i was ops manager at macy's
<chillywilly> dneighbo: I know where you are
<dneighbo> we were all RF based to inventory system
<dneighbo> and we had 3 story building
<dneighbo> probably 20,000 sqft per floor
<dneighbo> and we were running about 4 repeaters per floor
<dneighbo> one in each corner
<dneighbo> and at times we had 'blank' spots where it would cut out
<dneighbo> i would think its similar to wifi in range
<dneighbo> i.e. about that of a large home
<dneighbo> 3,000sqft or so
<jcater> but I think these RFIDs are so low power, they are even smaller range than that

<ajmitch> hey jeff
<jamest> jbailey: we released/are releasing today
<jamest> any chance we can get new debs marked same version # but 0.4.1b instead of a
<jbailey> Nice.  Are you using a version number that I can use? =)
<jamest> we used 0.4.1
<jamest> for forms
<jbailey> *cry*
<ajmitch> jbailey: be glad he didn't use a negative number :)
<jbailey> Mmm..  I can probably hack around it.
<jcater> that should be a simple change to your GNUE_VERSION_SUFFIX
<jcater> you currently have
<jcater> GNUE_VERSION_SUFFIX=-`date ....`
<jcater> couldn't that just be
<jcater> GNUE_VERSION_SUFFIX=b-`date ....`
<jbailey> It could be, but normally I would pull the tarball from a released directory.
<jbailey> Y'know - wanting man pages and all that. =)
<dneighbo> why cant we use 0.4.1
<dneighbo> ?
<jcater> jbailey: I can do tarballs with that if you'd like
<jbailey> dneighbo: 0.4.1 is lexically a lower version that 0.4.1a
<dneighbo> ah
<jamest> jbailey: are they hard to make?
<jamest> or get in sid?
<jbailey> jamest: Which 'they' in this case?
<jamest> the debs
<jbailey> No, not at all.
<jamest> i can test them tonight as I'm getting ready to update some production equipemnt
<jbailey> Once I have a tarball, I just overwrite the one that's there, change the version number in two places and upload.
<ajmitch> people dump all sorts of crap in sid
Action: jcater can do a tarball marked as "b" if you need it
<ajmitch> 0.4.1release :)
<jamest> 0.4.1damnMaintainersDidntListen
<jamest> or is it damnDevelopers
Action: jcater votes on damnChillywilly
<jcater> not sure why though
<jcater> :)
<jbailey> =)
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<jamest> oooo, good one
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> or
<jcater> 0.4.1derekLikesThisOne
<jcater> ;)
<ajmitch> 0.4.1sillyDebianNumbering
<chillywilly> i hope you all get leprosy and your male appendage falls off
Action: dneighbo is away: family
<jcater> chillywilly: even the women here?
<jcater> oh, wait.....
Action: chillywilly looks around
Action: chillywilly hands his glasses to jcater
<jbailey> What's your perscription?
Action: dneighbo is back (gone 00:04:17)
<dneighbo> guess wife wont be ready for movie for another 40 minutes
<chillywilly> heheh
<dneighbo> jcater: my connection is still knind of sluggishs can you verify if there is a createon/by date/time 'recipe' in the guide
<dneighbo> before i download it
Action: dneighbo is thinking its  straightforward on-commit trigger
<jcater> well
<jcater> um
<dneighbo> but am not sure syntax to get 'userid'
<jcater> if you'd downloaded these final tarballs to help out
<jcater> like a good team player
<jcater> then you'd have them
<dneighbo> are they uploaded?
Action: jcater goes into hiding
<dneighbo> if so i will grab right now
<jamest> yeah, they're uploaded
<jcater> see the topic
<dneighbo> as i really want to be running a stable release
<dneighbo> that says prerelease
<jamest> yeah
Action: dneighbo thought you guys just mention you bundled the final release
<jcater> those are final unless they don't install for someone
<jamest> they are finals 
<dneighbo> ok
Action: dneighbo gets it now
<jamest> when okd it a mv * ../current
<jcater> I'll just do a mv if they are ok
<dneighbo> downloading
<jcater> dneighbo: we have a createdon recipe
<jcater> but createdby
<jcater> who is 
<jcater> "
<jcater> "by"
<jcater> ?
<dneighbo> ?
<jamest> i think he wants the username of the logged in user
<dneighbo> yes
Action: dneighbo wasnt sure how to get that info via trigger
<jcater> username == username as logged into the database
<jamest> i almost understand jcater communicatoin
<jamest> like I almost understand jcater code
<jamest> somebody help me
<chillywilly> lol
<jcater> dneighbo: I know we can do that via triggers
<dneighbo> jcater: well what if you are using a custom 'authenicator'
<jcater> but we probably need to add a convenience method
Action: dneighbo had to make all my 'transactional' stuff like that nullable for now in gnue-sb
<dneighbo> until i get good trigger way to do it (or a convenience method)
<dneighbo> then i will add it back in
Action: dneighbo thinks the date part is taken care of
<dneighbo> if the db is setup properly
<dneighbo> as on should use function that posts timestamp if null else nothing if there
<dneighbo> and the modified should use function that posts timestamp no matter what
<dneighbo> though it would be better to amke it in application i think
Action: dneighbo is just so happy that its looking so good
<dneighbo> jamest: tool made front page of phoenix entertainment section here
<dneighbo> you interested in a copy
Action: dneighbo thinks he remembers you are a tool fan
<jamest> yeah
<jcater> what?
<jcater> no backstreet boys?
<jbailey> "I want it that way"
<jcater> be forewarned folks
<jcater> make sure you are somewhat happy with this release
<jcater> as cvs will break for a little while
<jcater> (not too long, but it will break)
<dneighbo> actually they made front page with a reference to a&e section
<dneighbo> article: "A thinking fan's band: metal master tool revises its thought-provoking show"
<dneighbo> guess they will be in concert here tuesday
<dneighbo> rock they had gilbert high marching band drum corps in their last concert here
<dneighbo> as the nephew of Adam Jones goes to school there :)
<dneighbo> jamest: i can likely get you lots of high quality Tool live concerts
<dneighbo> if you are interested as well
<jcater> wife must've gotten ahold of him
<dneighbo> they are a good live band as they do things on the fly
Action: dneighbo thought it was my lag time
<jamest> maybe
Action: dneighbo was going to cut and mail you the article but its online
<dneighbo> http://www.arizonarepublic.com/ae/articles/1117tool17.html
<dneighbo> just no photo of the band (which is pretty funny)
<dneighbo> they are in a group holding hands like a circle
<dneighbo> but chancellor (on left) has his hand making a hole by cupping index finger and thumb
<dneighbo> and maynard (on right) has index finger outstretched inserting it the 'hole'
<dneighbo> complete the circle
<dneighbo> sexual inneundo implied :)
<jbailey> That's like the little dutch boy with the finger in the dyke? =)
Action: dneighbo wonders about #debian
<dneighbo> a guy asks about getting apm support and someone tells him
<dneighbo> recompile your kernel
<dneighbo> its like WTF thats stock as a module in every debian kernel
<jcater> anyone having any luck (good or ill) with those tarballs?
<dneighbo> finally someone else gave wild syntax to just add the module (already provided by debian)
<dneighbo> i suggested using modconf
<dneighbo> and people screamed that wont work...
Action: dneighbo hasnt had modconf fail yet inserting modules (but im no debian guru)
Action: dneighbo thinks its no wonder most people hate debian they get support from wrong places ;)
<jbailey> What's modconf? =)
Action: dneighbo gratiously thanks nickr, ajmitch, jbailey, jamest, jcater for the stellar debian support they provide here
<jbailey> Do most people hate Debian?
<dneighbo> yes
<dneighbo> in our LUG
<jbailey> My experience is that most people hate installing Debian.
<dneighbo> when i started there only 1 out 60 folks ran debian
<jbailey> I certainly do. =)
<dneighbo> after helping install debian and over a year or so showing them power of debina
<ajmitch> debian users are by far the most vocal in out LUG
<dneighbo> i woudl say about half are running debian
<dneighbo> nearly everyone tried it
<dneighbo> but failed at install and gave up
<dneighbo> i have yet to find someone who had help installing and were shown how to get audio and such working
<dneighbo> that didnt stick with it
<dneighbo> sadly this is one of debians main weak points
<dneighbo> i think a xandros or good debian distro could change that
<dneighbo> or better yet if HP would just sell Debian PC's ;)
<jbailey> The new debian installer is reported to be amazing.
<dneighbo> then the install could be avoided altogether
<jbailey> But there's some chance that sarge won't ship with it.  The other ports aren't diving in quickly enough to get it running.
<ajmitch> jbailey: any chance of the hurd port releasing with sarge+1? ;)
<jbailey> If I were a stats major, I might inform you that the probability was non-zero.
<jbailey> As a gratutious developper, I'd say that we're on a firm 'maybe'.
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> would depend a lot on the criteria for release
<ajmitch> hopefully decent GNUe packages can find their way into sarge :)
<ajmitch> would probably want a stable set by then :)
Action: dneighbo is away: movie
<jbailey> gnue-common will be in sarge in two weeks.

#gnuenterprise: mode change '-o jcater' by jcater!~jcater@cpe-066-061-083-220.midsouth.rr.com
<jcater> dude!
<jcater> where'd chillywilly go?
<chillywilly> who cares?
<jcater> what was that?
<jcater> did someone say something?
<chillywilly> it was nothing
<chillywilly> a fart in the wind
Action: jcater wondered what the smell was
<jcater> and here I thought it was the donut box from 2 weeks ago I haven't trashed
<jbailey> invisible?
<jbailey> That's the state you reach after 4 tequilas, yes?
Action: chillywilly wouldn't know
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I guess that makes me opulent
<jcater> or translucent?
<chillywilly> ppl who drink are we and cannot deal with reality ;)
<chillywilly> weak
<jcater> are you kidding
<jcater> I deal w/reality pretty darn well after a few drinks
<jbailey> I can be weak.
<jbailey> Who the hell wants to be strong all the time? =)
Action: drochaid showered just last month ....
<chillywilly> jbailey: yo mamma does
<jbailey> showers?
<drochaid> not with me!!!
<drochaid> I'd have noticed
<jcater> shower?
<jcater> what's that?
<jbailey> drochaid: I'd hope not.  She's been dead for 2 years. =)
<jcater> is that one of those newfangled things like an outhouse?
<chillywilly> not sure...
Action: drochaid shivers
<chillywilly> I read about them once
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> my bddy has this as part of his sig
<chillywilly> I predict Microsoft will be in dire strates by the winter of 2004 due to
<chillywilly> the loss of enterprise computing clients.  These customers will migrate
<chillywilly> to Open Source alternatives which offer freedom.  I am a part of this
<chillywilly> software revolution.
<drochaid> OI
<jcater> hmmm
<drochaid> don't use Dire Straits name like that :P
<jcater> that's better than my "Please send donuts" sig, I guess
Action: jcater thought about changing to "Your mom uses GNUe... shouldn't you?"
<jbailey> drochaid: Which part of the is a dire straights name?
<drochaid> just change the spelling a little ;)
<chillywilly> it's a band dewd
<chillywilly> old skewl
<drochaid> :)
<jbailey> Money for nothing and your chicks for free..  'veryone knows them.
<jbailey> I used to have the vinal for brothers in arms. =)
<chillywilly> sorry, how am I supposed to know what ppl in canadia listen to? ;)
<drochaid> thought it was all celine dion?
Action: drochaid ducks and runs
<chillywilly> jcater: I see you're still using sylpheed
<jcater> yeah
<chillywilly> didn't make the switch to evilution yet? ;)
<jcater> evolution still's a little more heavy weight than I want
<chillywilly> a *little*?
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> just
<chillywilly> mutt forever
<jcater> >                                                                           <
<jcater> this much
<chillywilly> gotcha
<jbailey> I like evolution
<chillywilly> it's bloated
<jcater> I do think I'm giving it to my callcenter though
<chillywilly> well it's a nice M$ alternative
<chillywilly> I just couldn't stand it anymore :P
<chillywilly> I don't need html email
<chillywilly> or calendaring
<jbailey> I have severla people who send me html mail. =(
<jbailey> Also, I like how easy it is to auto-file into folders.
<jcater> first thing I do w/all my users
<drochaid> jbailey: shun them!!!
<jcater> go thru and change their "html email" setting
<jcater> to off
<chillywilly> jbailey: procmail ;)
<chillywilly> jcater: :)
Action: jcater is serious
<chillywilly> I believe you
<jcater> no html mail leaves my mail servers
<jbailey> jcater: That is too much work for *me*.
<chillywilly> a smile doesn't mean I think you are joking
<jbailey> chillywilly: I haven't found anything that lets me do three clicks to setup procmail filters.
<chillywilly> who uses a mouse?
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> those are for lusers ;)
<jcater> gah
<jcater> something does not compute
<jbailey> ACtually, you're right.
<jcater> jbailey maintains glibc
<jbailey> Most of the time I don't use the mouse.
<jbailey> I use my pen.
<jcater> and works on hurd
<jbailey> =)
<jcater> but doesn't use procmail vilters
<jcater> filters
<jcater> because they're not 3 clicks?
Action: jcater falls out of his chair
KeithJagrs (trilluser@63.74.24.9) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jbailey> jcater: I pick my battles.
<jbailey> procmail is *not* generally one them
<jbailey> Despite my love of sendmail. =)
<KeithJagrs> hello
Action: chillywilly uses exim with procmail
<chillywilly> exim, procmail, and courier imap
<jbailey> Not mailutils?  bah!
<jbailey> =)

<jcater> roflmao
<jcater> I sent out the gnue-announce notice
<jcater> text only, of course
<jcater> got an email response from postmaster@iximd.com
<jcater> The Mail Server at IXIMD.COM has rejected and discarded an e-mail that APPEARS
<jcater> to have originated from:  Jason Cater <jcater@gnue.org>
<jcater> ....
<jcater> Due to the ever increasing proliferation of e-mail borne viruses, attachments
<jcater> of this type are no longer being accepted or delivered by the servers at IXI.
<jcater> .....
<jcater> so, um, text-only messages are virus-prone now
<jcater> ?
Action: jcater wonders what they do accept

<dneighbo> jcater: did you gpg sign the message?
<jcater> no
<jcater> I don't have that set up at home
<dneighbo> if so dumb ass windows often thinks it an attachment and does well 'odd' things to it
<dneighbo> like assume its a virus
<dneighbo> which i find hilarious
<jcater> that is funny
<dneighbo> you sign a mail to ensure someone knows its from you and windows cans it as a virus
<dneighbo> jcater: you do freshmeat releases or you want me to?
<jcater> you can
<jcater> all I did was gnue-* lists
<jcater> psu usually picks that up and does gnuenterprise.org announce
<dneighbo> cool
Action: dneighbo REALLY wishes gnu.org/software/gnue-sb was in place instead of nongnu.org/gnue-sb
<dneighbo> so i could possibly do some more pr
<dneighbo> maybe tomorrow we can resolve
Action: dneighbo is resolved i think to just checkin to the other cvs
<dneighbo> and see if shows up
<jbailey> What's gnue-sb?
<nickr> small business
<ajmitch> hmmmmm
<Isomer> how is gnue-sb going?
<dneighbo> good
<dneighbo> its commit list is limping
<dneighbo> but it got some serious action today :)
<ajmitch> good :)
<ajmitch> hi Isomer, fancy seeing you here
<jbailey> Why don't you just have gnue-sb under gnuenterprise.org ?
<Isomer> ajmitch: amazing that :)
<ajmitch> jbailey: anoncvs access
<ajmitch> and stuff like that :)
<ajmitch> it was more fun to hassle the savannah people, too
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> jbailey: because we dont want people to think we have abandoned appserver and more robust SAP R/3 type implementation
<dneighbo> we needed something QUICK
<dneighbo> that was two tier and ready to ship within a quarter or two
<dneighbo> i.e. read not something perfect with ultimate planning and documentation
<dneighbo> but something worked and could be extended
<dneighbo> plus its fun to annoy the savannah admins
<jcater> hey
<jcater> it got me root!
<jcater> that was worth it
Action: jcater hides
<jbailey> You got root on subversions?
<jbailey> Wow.
Action: jcater smacks jbailey around
<jcater> I'm not exactly an admin newbie
<dneighbo> yeah, why do you think they gave you access
Action: dneighbo runs from savannah team and jcater ;0
<jbailey> Yeah, but considering the policy is "Why the hell do you think you need a shell account"
<jbailey> The idea of them giving someone root access is phenominal!
<jcater> jbailey: I think I know why
<jbailey> I think the rest of the gnu servers are down to a half dozen or a dozen folks with root.
<jcater> I think they were tired of dneighbo pestering them
<ajmitch> ugh
[23:54] Last message repeated 2 time(s).

<jcater> if they want a LAMP solution
<jcater> there's plenty out there for them to join
Action: jcater shudders at the thought
<jcater> but still...
<ajmitch> it's a phpgw app, by the looks of things
<ajmitch> https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/accwhizz/
<dneighbo> well if its non gnu great
<dneighbo> if its trying to submit for gnu
<dneighbo> you can bet your but i will volunteer for the 'evaluation' :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> afaict it's not going for GNU
<ajmitch> but it's another project you could borrow stuff from :)
<ajmitch> they sort of sound like they know what they're doing
