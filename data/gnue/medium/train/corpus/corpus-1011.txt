<dneighbo> jcater: i just moved gnue-sb from nongnu to gnu for website
<dneighbo> i.e. checked out gnu version
<dneighbo> cp files localy on my machine
<dneighbo> commited to gnu gnue-sb
<dneighbo> so likely they should show up
<dneighbo> if they do you can kill old repository
<ajmitch> lol
<ajmitch> i don't think you'd need to do that
Action: ajmitch cringes as jcater rm -rf's the whole web tree ;)
<dneighbo> hey why not others have fun too ;)
<dneighbo> ok freshmeat updated with all releases
<dneighbo> i had to add navigator i guess i never released it at 0.0.1
<dneighbo> ah piss they are approving them already
<dneighbo> shouldnt they be in bed
<dneighbo> grrr
<dneighbo> i had hoped they would post at like 4am my time
<Isomer> er, why? :)
<ajmitch> err, why not? :)
<dneighbo> um biggest audience is US
<dneighbo> 4am my time is 6am EST
<dneighbo> with a little luck they would stick on the front page till about 12 my time
<dneighbo> i.e. most of the US audience would see them during morning or lunch break
<dneighbo> its sad but freshmeat is a HUGE imprint
<dneighbo> on days we run releases at freshmeat our web traffic jumps WAY up
<ajmitch> that's when jamest turns the AC on for the webserver :)
<dneighbo> it never needed AC it was in KS

<btami> good morning
<btami> psu: may i e-mail a new setup.exe to you if i'm ready ?
<psu> btami: please can you do so in half an hour (i.e. after 9 am your time)
<psu> I can then get it uploaded tonight
<btami> ok, i will try
<psu> are we doing both debug-on and debug-off versions again?
<btami> i think debug-on for pre enough
<btami> then 0.4.1 will be -on and -off
<psu> btami: note that the 0.4.1 are officially released now
<btami> oh
<psu> you might like to get the new zips
<psu> and work off those
<btami> ok
<psu> jcater put them out last night 
<psu> while we were sleeping
<psu> "gnue - your 24/7 project"
<psu> I have just (as of 2 minutes ago) updated website news
<btami> so i can send debug-on and debug-off versions
<psu> yes
<btami> is it ok after 10 too ?
<psu> no problem 
<psu> I won't be able to do anything with them this morning anyway
<psu> as I'm off to work in 15 mins
<psu> and on dial-up, they'll take more than 15 mins to download your mail ;-)
<psu> The official announcement says "Windows .exes later this week" so tonight will be fine
<psu> s/will be/will have to be
<btami> do you know another way to upload somewhere, some public place ?
<btami> it will be 2x10 Mb
<psu> actually, if you e-mail jcater/jamest
<psu> rather than me
<psu> a) they should be on a better connection than me
<psu> b) they can probably upload before I am back from work anyway
Action: psu isn;t trying to avoid work, just take himself as a barrier out of the loop
<btami> which is the best, jcater or jamest ?
<psu> jamest seems to wake up first ;-)
<psu> and jcater had a late night getting the releases out 
<psu> so I guess jamest
<psu> cc to me as a back-up
<btami> ok, i will sent to jamest@gnue.org

<DoctorHook> Good Morning!
<DoctorHook> I have a quick question for anyone who has a moment...  I'm desparately trying to break my M$ habit and one of the biggest obstacles is trying to find a replacement for MS Access.  I just discovered your project a few moments ago and at first glance it appears to be what I've been looking for?
<jamest> ok
ColeMarcus (~klebermas@p5080499B.dip.t-dialin.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<DoctorHook> Sorry, that was a question.  I have built custom apps in Access/VBA that I would like to move to a Linux environment.  Would this be a similar tool?
<jcater> DoctorHook: we are not an access replacement, per se
<jcater> but could definitely be a substitute
<jcater> we are comparable to the Forms and Reports parts of access
<jcater> (only with a lot more power, imho)
<jcater> we don't have a database, so you'd use PostgreSQL, for example, as the database backend
<jcater> (or SAP-DB, ....)
<DoctorHook> I see!  What about the programming part?  I'm NOT a programmer... but I can stumble around with VB or VBA to get done what I need...
<DoctorHook> I'm trying to learn...
<jcater> we use Python for any triggers/events... it's a VERY newbie-friendly language
<jcater> it would be a small step from VBA to Python
drochaid (~drochaid@pc2-kirk1-3-cust16.renf.cable.ntl.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<DoctorHook> Beautiful!  I have looked at Python.  It is very frustrating to move from an environment where I'm more than competent to a brand new one.  There is so much to learn and sometimes don't know where to start!  It's overwhelming, but you've been agreat help!  Thanks!

<dneighbo> piss i missed him
<dneighbo> jcater/jamest always someone coming from msaccess
<dneighbo> suggest that pgadmin has a MIGRATION tool
<dneighbo> that will migrate all tables + data for them
<dneighbo> which is a huge part of the work
<dneighbo> if they have not done anything too 'fancy' code wise (standard vb forms)
<dneighbo> designer will putty in their hands especially with wizards
Action: dneighbo has half considered writing a vb forms (and delphi forms) conversion tool
<jcater> ah
<dneighbo> jamest: can we get logging re facilitated on ash
<dneighbo> jcater: the biggest thing we are missing (and so is pgadmin) is a 'query designer'
<dneighbo> i think eventually it would be nice to have that in designer(schema tools)
<dneighbo> if you all add the quick table view stuff (what someone was calling grid view)
<dneighbo> the 'query designer' would be about only thing we are missing to be close to access replacement (imho)
<dneighbo> and unfortunately i have seen a LOT of access ;)
<dneighbo> jcater: it worked : http://www.gnu.org/software/gnue-sb/
<dneighbo> though the dates are dorked :)
<dneighbo> anyone know how to upgrade to gnome 2?
<dneighbo> and if you do can you still use gnome 1.4 apps?
Action: dneighbo was so impressed with kde fonts/smoothness i would like to see gnome2
<grib> dneighbo: you can still use gnome-1.4 apps with gnome-2.  it's pretty nice, esp from a developer perspective -- gtk2 fixes a good number of b0rkennesses in gtk
<grib> not all of course :) 
<grib> but a good number nonetheless
<dneighbo> you know what is necessary for debian?
<dneighbo> i think i have all the libgtk2 stuff as i got it when i got gphoto2
Action: dneighbo is mostly looking for cleaner fonts
<grib> if you're on unstable, you will automagically get the gnome2 stuff iirc with a debian upgrade
<dneighbo> re: kde fonts
<grib> not sure about what to do on stable
Arturas (~arturas@fmgs-03.vtu.lt) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> wife liked kde 'fonts' but nothing else about it :)
<dneighbo> asked to have gnome back
<dneighbo> yeah i just did upgrade on unstable
<dneighbo> we will see what it brings 
Action: drochaid prefers KDE to Gnome
<drochaid> but not enough to actually care which I use
<grib> dneighbo: one of my fave things about gtk2 is that things like GtkLabels now accept attribute markup on their strings.  so you can do something like <span foreground="red" size=20000><b>Hello</b>, World!</span>
<dneighbo> i use fluxbox so its not a 'me' issue
<dneighbo> its a 'wife' issue ;)
<jcater> dneighbo: what's the odds of getting that demo schema soon? (the music database)
<dneighbo> you want today?
Action: dneighbo can probably pump it out today
<jcater> today would work
<jcater> :)
<grib> my wife is a dedicated mac-o-phile unfortunately.  i'm hoping I can drive her towards linux using macosx :)
<dneighbo> ESPECIALLY if the schema wizard works
<dneighbo> in designer
<dneighbo> as i think i already have the tables created

<Arturas> ra3vat: yes, hi Dmitry
<ra3vat> hello Arturas
<ra3vat> can you look into common/doc/technotes/00002.txt
<ra3vat> i was thinking that encoding param in gnue.conf is only relevant for postgresql
<ra3vat> so it understand specific pgsql names
<ra3vat>  encoding is the client encoding and can be either : SQL_ASCII, EUC_JP, EUC_CN, EUC_KR, EUC_TW, UNICODE, MULE_INTERNAL, LATINX (X=1...9), KOI8, WIN, ALT, SJIS, BIG5, WIN1250. Available encoding depends on your PostgreSQL and libpq version. Refer to PostgreSQL manual for supported encodings for your PostgreSQL.
<Arturas> ra3vat: give me please about 5 mins...
<ra3vat> sure
Action: jcater thinks that belongs in connections.conf if its specific to postgres
<jcater> actually I thought it was already there?
<ra3vat> yes
<ra3vat> "encoding" name is confusing
<ra3vat> jcater: it was done in ancient time when connection.conf was not yet born :)
<Arturas> ra3vat: you mean #hack for db encoding in 00002.txt?

<KeithJagrs> mailing list for Small Business isn't seem to be working
<KeithJagrs> at least the archives
<StyXman> DISCLAIMER: some features added are maybe deprecated. those you think are ugly, pleasse feel fre to discuss them either in your mailing list or in ousr.
<jcater> StyXman: we're gonna need that patch *soon*
<jcater> as we need to make progress on our stuff
<StyXman> jcater: gimme 5 minutes.
<ra3vat> how is mysql sql is produced from schema when only base, oracle and postgresql exist in processors?
<StyXman> is there any locale support for date time entries?
<derek> ra3vat: it isnt :
<derek> )
<lupo> what is gnue sb?
<ra3vat> derek: how it is done in gnue-sb then?
<ra3vat> small business
<derek> currently gnue-sb only supports postgres
<derek> until the gsd tool is fixed to support the other databases
<ra3vat> good thing
<derek> as soon as the tool renders gsd's for a db that db should be supported by gnue-sb
<lupo> aha
<lupo> nobody told me about that! :)
Action: derek will warn if you are wanting to use gnue-sb w/ mysql you are asking for a world of hurt
<ra3vat> lupo: it was kept for christmas :)
<lupo> ra3vat: :)
<derek> mysql is not a kwality kode database for this type of application
<derek> if your restraint is gpl only database please consider sap-db
<lupo> mysql with more than 1:1 and 1:n relationships is a PITA
<lupo> or with more than 5-10 small tables
<jcater> can someone tell me how to do sequences in mysql?
<jcater> or an equivalent?
<jcater> and the first person who says "auto_incremenet"
<jcater> better be wearing a helment
<jcater> helmet
<jcater> as I can't seem to get at the next value reliably
Action: lupo better shuts up
<jcater> that was a serious question, btw
<jcater> I've googled and googled and googled
<jcater> and can't find the answer

<jamest> jcater: i'd bet a dounut you'll have to grop to seed tables
<jamest> drop even
<ra3vat> derek: what about to remove MySQL dir (it is empty really) from there? README could be placed in PgSQL dir though
<derek> ra3vat: i will look into when i disconnect form work
<derek> i need to setup a dcl instance for GNUe SB real soon now (tm)
<jcater> if I can get an answer to my question, I can add mysql support :)
<jcater> jamest: that's gonna be interesting
<derek> mysql uses autoincrement
Action: derek is donning a BIG ole helmet
<nickr> seems like sqlite would replace what a lot of people use mysql for.
Action: jcater thinks sqlite might prove to be really important to gnue-sb
Action: derek shudders
<derek> postgres should be fine
<nickr> anyone who uses mysql for like
Action: derek notes my personal goal for gnuesb is not to be quickbooks
grib (~grib@grib.customer.jump.net) left irc: "I'm too lame to make a quit message"
<nickr> a local database that they never access over a network and only has one person using it
<nickr> or even local database backing a single host website
<derek> if someone wants that i will point them to gnucash small business project
<nickr> seems silly
<nickr> viva sqlite!
<derek> if someone is willing to do local filesystem for a db then gnue-sb is bigger than them (imho)
Action: derek isnt opposed to getting sqllite working, but states strongly that is not the target market for gnue-sb
<jcater> of course not
<jamest> StyXman: you send that yet?
<jcater> but I bet we still see the single business owner strolling in
<jcater> wanting something for his PC
<derek> yes
<nickr> I just think mysql is overused for the wrong things.
<derek> i agree
Action: jcater isn't saying we code for that target
<jcater> but I'm just saying I bet we see it
<nickr> sqlite is simpler to manage than mysql in most circumstances that use mysql. Its so annoying to see a cool thing that uses a databes backing for only one host that uses mysql!
<lupo> nickr: right
<StyXman> jamest: just dpoing thast *now*
<nickr> thats why gnue rules, database neutrality
<nickr> :)
<lupo> lol
<lupo> <nickr> I just think mysql is overused for the wrong things.
<lupo> <nickr> thats why gnue rules, database neutrality
<lupo> btw

<lupo> does/will gnue-sb handle european tax stuff
<lupo> ie tax on sales
<jamest> gack!
<jamest> 143K
<derek> lupo: right now this is my big pain
<StyXman> true
<jamest> that's a lot of diff reading :)
<derek> im torn whether to make gnue-sb US only
<derek> or support foreign stuff
<derek> the problem i have with making it 'anywhere'
<StyXman> there are minor code fixes, and several new features
<derek> is you lose a TON of validation rules US business love
<StyXman> (wow, mail is fast)
<derek> and speed features
<derek> like if US only i can make it so you enter a zipcode and it auto populates city and state
<derek> i can validate phone numbers against states 
<derek> i.e. is that a valid area code for a state 
<derek> etc etc
<derek> as soon as i make it i18n
<derek> i end up with very sloppy validation and very general data entry
<StyXman> jamest: I'm leaving. just read the mail, and I'll be crossing fingers :)
Action: derek realizes there is a huge foreign market and doesnt want to discount that
<StyXman> bye all
<lupo> i see
<lupo> this is the dilemma
<derek> so im torn
StyXman (~mdione@ADSL-200-59-86-17.cordoba.sinectis.com.ar) left irc: "yes!"
<derek> if lots of non us people are willing to help
<derek> and use
<lupo> do either one or the other, just do it right
<derek> likely i will make it i18n
<derek> if not then i will likely make US centric as thats my target market
<lupo> i think having a market at all is better than fulfilling thousand problematic and inconsistent wishes
<lupo> if the resources aren't sufficient, we can still fork
<lupo> currently i just don't have an enterprise customer who wants to make a switch :(
<lupo> so i don't have big ERP reality touch
<lupo> :-((
<lupo> okay, gotta go

<jcater> ra3vat: for notebook pages, that can be the notebook tab caption/label
<jcater> if missing, and you have a notebook page, caption defaults to the name value
<ra3vat> thanks, that is right what i need
<ra3vat> what does transparentBlock attribute mean?
<jcater> If you are on the last field of a block and there is another block in the form
<jcater> then if transparentBlock is true
<jcater> a tab will take you to the next block
<jcater> if false
<jcater> it will take you to the first field of the same block
<ra3vat> if false how can i jump to the next block?
<jcater> as a user?
<jcater> or within a trigger?
<jcater> user == Page Down
<jcater> trigger, I think you can do a form.setFocus(otherBlock)
<jcater> there may also be a form.nextBlock()
<ra3vat> thanks
<jcater> I don't recall about the latter though
<jcater> but there should be if not
<ra3vat> restrictInsert="Y" - is it correct attibute definition?

<jcater> so haven't had time to digest
<siesel> have you time to comment now?
<ra3vat> masterlink="company.id" is it possible syntax?
<jcater> not really :(
Action: jcater is in the middle of a thinking project at work
<jcater> ra3vat: I think that will work
<jcater> is the master datasource a multiple table one?
<ra3vat> i'm about to try that
<siesel> ok. /me don't want to distract the AI.

<derek> siesel: i have comments on it
<derek> just havent been able to formulate them
<derek> been too busy
<derek> im having trouble deciding implementation
<derek> you are right that splits and such should be easy
<derek> but im not sure they shoudl be implemented as you speak or as triggers
Action: derek envisioned htem as triggers
<derek> and nothing would prevent the integrator UI from doing all the work
<derek> to me the tag set you propose seems confusing (and i do lots of integration)
<derek> i have seen the corresponding 'trigger' way to do things it might be even more confusing
<derek> but as i learned from my xslt ventures
<derek> doing complex things in xml SUCKS
<derek> so a simple split is probably much cleaner in XML as would be a simple mapping
<derek> however when things get complex the spec would probably be a nightmare
<derek> i can certainly run through scenarios i see daily and that i saw daily integrating with every known mortgage lending interface on the planet as well as edi
<derek> for now i have to run
<derek> i will be able to cmment further in about an hour
<siesel> hmmm, I'm not very contend with the whole stuff myself
<siesel> ok, cu then.
<siesel> I would like something more mapping orientated then process orientated :(

<ra3vat> how to set scrollbar over myltirow entry?
<ra3vat> jamest: ?
<jamest> ?
<jamest> our code doesn't support scrollbar's yet
<jamest> papo guys seem to have it as part of their patch
<jamest> if time permits I'll be going into the 0.4.1 banch
<jamest> and then into head
<nickr> theres no way to express in SQL the kind of uniqueness that says 'the combination of these two columns must be unique' is there?
<jamest> you mean only pull those rows?
<nickr> No
<nickr> like a constraint
<nickr> like a primary key which must be unique
<nickr> but instead, this row is uniquified by two columns
<nickr> instead of just one
<jamest> sure
<jcater> isn't it just "unique (field1, field2)"
<jamest> you can create a unique index on 2 fields
<ra3vat> jamest: it seemed to me you did some work on scrollbar already?
<jamest> or setup the primary key constraint at the end of the table def instead of behind one field
<jamest> ra3vat: i added the code it display it but never tied it into the event system
<ra3vat> ok
<nickr> is it that simple, really?
<nickr> qjust adding unique (field1, field2) to the create table?
<jamest> nah, we're lying to you
<jamest> :)
<jamest> which DB?
<jcater> nickr: one note, unique does not enforce nullness like primary key does
<jcater> so if you want "unique and not null" you need to specify not null for those columns
<jcater> at least, irrc
<jcater> iirc
<nickr> sqlite of course
<nickr> it says it supports unique constraints
<nickr> shite, what happened to gless!?
<ra3vat> my more then one year old example with three tables mixed in mastter-detail still does not work :(
<ra3vat> properly that is
<nickr> now, this unique constraint will only be triggered if both the values are the same as another row's two values, right?
<nickr> not just one or the other
<jcater> nickr: right
<jcater> I use those a lot
<jcater> example, we sell magazines
<jcater> so we have a table that holds our offers
<jcater> it contains the magazine id and the number of issues
<jcater> we have unique ()  set up on those 2
<jamest> naughty_flag coolean;
<jamest> grrr
<jamest> boolean
<jcater> so only one combination of (magazine, issues) can exist in that table
Action: jcater thinks that's the functionality you are talking about
<jcater> there can be plenty of 12 issue magazines
<jcater> and plenty of offers for People magazine
<jcater> but only one offer for People at 12 issues
<nickr> y6ea
<nickr> exactly
<nickr> I have a table that defines a specific relationship between two rows in two other tables
<nickr> and only one such relationship between those two particular rows must exist
<nickr> ah works as expected.
<nickr> How do I print an exception that just thew me into an except:
<nickr> ?
<jamest> traceback module IIRC
<jamest> hang on
<nickr> er? thheres no exception object that gets assigned or something?
<jcater> yeah
<jamest> or
<jamest> except:
<jamest>     print "Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0]
<jamest>     raise
<ra3vat>   <datasource database="icsinfo" name="dtsCompany" table="company"/>
<ra3vat>   <datasource database="icsinfo" name="dtsEmployee" table="employee, person"
<ra3vat>       master="dtsCompany" masterlink="id" detaillink="employee.org_id" prequery="">
<ra3vat>     <condition>
<ra3vat>       <and>
<ra3vat>         <eq>
<ra3vat>           <cfield name="employee.pers_id"/>
<ra3vat>           <cfield name="person.id"/>
<ra3vat>         </eq>
<ra3vat>       </and>
<ra3vat>     </condition>
<ra3vat>   </datasource>
<ra3vat> what's wrong with that?
<nickr> ah
<nickr> thantks
<jcater> ra3vat: what exception are you getting?
<jcater> oooooo
<jcater> I don't know how prequery="" behaves with child datasources
<derek> definitely i would not prequery a chiled
<derek> er child
<ra3vat> child is empty
<jcater> ra3vat: for one, get rid of prequery
<jcater> then 
<jcater> run with --debug-level
<jcater> and see what "select" statements are being executed
<jcater> and if they look sane
<ra3vat> am i asking about something terrible or just not yet implemented?
<jcater> it should work
<jcater> but we are giving you suggestions to find out why its not
<ra3vat> ok :), the query looks good
<ra3vat> will run it through psql now
<ra3vat> query is ok
<ra3vat>  SELECT pers_id,person.id,employee.id,employee.org_id,employee.pers_id,person.first,person.last FROM employee, person WHERE (((((employee.org_id = '26'))) AND ((employee.pers_id = person.id))))
<ra3vat> why is it nothing shown?
thomasr (~thomas@public2-seve3-4-cust146.walt.broadband.ntl.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ra3vat> after that query one other is in log:
<ra3vat> DB005: [DBdriver:553] SELECT id FROM person WHERE (((id = '31')))
<ra3vat> DB005: [DBdriver:142] Field names set to ['id']
<derek> <ra3vat>   <datasource database="icsinfo" name="dtsEmployee" table="employee, person"
<derek> <ra3vat>       master="dtsCompany" masterlink="id" detaillink="employee.org_id" prequery="">
<derek> is this some new syntax?
<derek> table="employee, person"
<derek> basically im not sure why you are doing this
<jcater> derek: that's an oddity that just works :)
<jcater> it wasn't actually coded to do that
<derek> why not do a view of those tables
<jcater> but it serves as an SQL join
<jcater> (readonly of course)
<derek> i.e. join them as a view
<derek> then use the view
<ra3vat> derek: it is very close to work without view, query is ok. i've pasted it via psql and it worked
<psu> heh just got btami's win exes
<psu> I'll u/l them in the morning unless anyone else beats me to it
Action: psu is deadbeat

<siesel> derek: do you want to discuss the gnue mapping description format now?
<derek> soon
<derek> im still cranking at work
<derek> was doing some 'research' on lost files
dsmith (firewall-u@cherry7.comerica.com) left irc: "later.."
<derek> ok siesel i have some time
<derek> well if you come back i shoudl be here
<jamest> ping
<derek> the thing that struck me was the mapping comment vs process
<derek> i can tell you from my experience RARELY can you just 'map'
<siesel> 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.1 ms
<derek> usually there is some form of conversion process in the middle
<derek> firstname        lastname in one db bcomes
<jamest> siesel: thanks, wasn't sure my dsl was up
<derek> name in the other
<derek> or
<derek> fund   org
<derek> in one table bcomes
<derek> acctingstring in another
<derek> etc etc etc
<derek> i dont have access to my email with what you sent
<derek> so i cant speak directly to those items
Action: derek i guess is most curious how you are going to do integrator, rpc, jsforms and phpforms all at once
<siesel> I don't want to do it at once, but I just need integrator for some stuff NOW.
<derek> ah
<siesel> the next step would be appserver and then I can continue on jsforms/phpforms
<siesel> but back to integrator: with the "mapping<->process" comment I just meant that a "user" would like to define mappings
<siesel> instead of a process
Action: derek is worried that appserver is seen as prequisite for jsforms/phpforms
<derek> siesel: again i state im torn between implmentation and UI
<derek> hopefully a user never sees the 'definition' file
<derek> they see a UI to build mappings
<derek> and those mappings need to be powerful
<derek> i should be able to say
<derek> src1.fielda -> src2.fielda
<derek> src1.fieldb -> src2.fieldb
<derek> src1.fieldc -> src2.fieldc
<derek> as well as
<derek> src1.fielda -> src2.fielda
<derek> src1.fieldb + src1.fieldc -> src2.fieldb
<derek> as well as example only here jsut to convey point ignore syntax
<siesel> I would like to write all these definitions in XML, instead of in a trigger. 
<derek> left(src1.fieldb,3) + '-' + mid(src1.fieldb,4,5) + ' : ' + lower(src1.fieldc) -> src2.fieldb
<derek> you are sadistic
<derek> you lose SO much power by moving that into xml
<derek> we wrote jadeke  basically gnue forms in php that was all xml
<derek> and it was murder
<derek> xslt was my example
<derek> to do easy transformations xml/xslt seems like such a good idea
<siesel> we can do it by trigger too, but then designer has to parse the python commands 
<derek> but start doing complex stuff and you are spending all your time fighting xmll
<derek> siesel: i think the answer is a combination of the two
<derek> some things will make well as xml elements to map
<derek> otehrs will not
<siesel> the last example of yours, f.e. shouldn't be possible with xml
<derek> i dont think i could provide a list of what would and what wouldnt right away
<derek> the first and second examples i gave probably could be all xml
<derek> but the third one would make for some ugly xml
<derek> and lot of complex tags/attributes
<derek> my point in essensce is that i do this stuff almost daily and rarely do i get something like 1 or 2
<siesel> what about that action syntax I've proposed:
<derek> i generally am dealing with #3
<derek> i dont have access to the email to review it
<jcater> http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue-dev/2002-November/000322.html
<siesel> <action name="field" splitmask="@1:@2"><field type="src" name="foobar"><field type="dest" name="foo"><field type="dest" name="bar"></action>
Action: jcater thinks an xml mapping approach quickly degenerates into a lot of clutter outside of 1:1 or other *very* combines
<jcater> err, *very* simple
<jcater> which, I already said that in my email
<derek> that is my fear
<derek> and what i guess i was trying to relay in that sample 1 and sample 2 (both simple) it would likely be ok
<jcater> i.e., we end up with docbook :)
<derek> but sample 3 would be an utter hell of tags and attributes
mdean (~mdean@mkc-65-28-72-76.kc.rr.com) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<jcater> something so complex no one understands even how to do simple stuff
<jcater> s/complex/overwhelming
Action: siesel sees the biggest problem in making trigger a MUST, that we have to parse python scripts to edit mappings with designer
<derek> for me i would need to see the trigger side to tell you which i would prefer
<siesel> <process>
<siesel>    <trigger type="ON-NEWROW">
<siesel>        if in.test[0]=="$":
<siesel>           out.out=in.test[1:]
<siesel>        else:
<siesel>           out.out=in.test
<siesel>    </trigger>
<siesel> </process>
<siesel> could be an example how to do remove a leading "$" with a trigger
<derek> i would be ok with some of this in xml if the designer is writing it all out
<derek> my only demand is i can go to triggers and get dirty if i have to
<siesel> IMHO integerator should support that mergemask, splitmask stuff and nothing more.
<siesel> nothing more in XML.

<siesel> In the second mail: http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue-dev/2002-November/000331.html
<siesel> at the end, I speak of masks to do spliting merging etc. 
<jcater> ok, I missed that part
<siesel> I've changed the syntax a bit, but haven't posted yet.
<jcater> I wasn't giving the second email my full attention as I was at work
<siesel> Now, I would remove all <copy> <split> <merge> etc, and just have an
<jcater> I think I like the idea of a merge/split mask, and anything more complex would be handled by a trigger
<siesel> <action splitmask="" mergermask="">
<jcater> should we make the splitmask capable of handling regular expressions?
<jcater> that could be powerful, but might not be intuitive for regular users
<jcater> (not sure)
<siesel> you mean something like: <process>
<siesel>       <action name="sdsd" splitmask="$@1">
<siesel>          <trigger type="ON-MASKNOTFIT" raise="directcopy">
<siesel>          <field name="test" type="in" datasource="in">
<siesel>          <field name="out" type="out" datasource="out">
<siesel>       </action>
<siesel>    </process>
<siesel>    <action name="directcopy">
<siesel>        <field name="test" type="in" datasource="in">
<siesel>        <field name="out" type="out" datasource="out">           
<siesel>    </action>
<siesel> Possibly putting actions in the trigger name space is a bit too much 
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> I'm not sure I like the <trigger type="ON-MASKNOTFIT" raise="directcopy"> syntax
<jcater> but the overall idea
<jcater> I think may be ok
<jcater> bbias....
Action: siesel couldn't remember how trigger definitions looked in forms ;)
<jcater> well, triggers contain or point to python code
<jcater> not to another xml structure
<jcater> perhaps
<jcater>  <action name="sdsd" splitmask="$@1" on-fail="directcopy">
<jcater> ?
<jcater> or something like that?
<siesel> yes, that sound much better.
<derek> if i go away its cause i tried to use nautilus again
<siesel> ok, another point is how to handle "rowmappings"
<siesel> I mean, in normal case rows are mapped 1:1
<siesel> but I have a table with the fields "id, field, value" with three different possible entrys in "field"
<ajmitch> hi all
<siesel> like  (45,"name","Jan") (45,"zip","...") (45,"sdsd","...") that all should become one row in a table with the fields (id, name, zip, sdsd)
<ra3vat> could anyone provide a pdf for common/doc/Developers-Guide.sxw?
<siesel> hi Ajmitch
<jcater> ra3vat: have you looked at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/docs/common/ ?
<ra3vat> oh
<ra3vat> looking
<ajmitch> yeah, the developers guides are rather useful :)
<jcater> gah!
<jcater> the developer's guide for common came out all centered
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> including the code
<jamest> it likes to do that
<siesel> ajmitch: do you really speak maori?
<jamest> lol

<derek> sup jbailey
<derek> is new gnue in sid?
<jbailey> No - Maybe tommorow or the day after.
<jbailey> Hmm..  Actually might take longer, since I'll be switching the arch: from any to all.
<jbailey> That'll need a change to the overrides file - so it'll be whenever the ftpmasters get around to it.
<jamest> jbailey: i hope to have a 0.4.2 out later in the week or early next
<derek> yeah no pressure or anything
<jamest> to address some issues and include some of the Papo stuff
<jbailey> Cool.
<jbailey> That will solve the versioning problem nicely, then.
<jamest> yeah
<jamest> figured you'd like that
<jbailey> Are the versions in CVS now going to be lexically sane?
<derek> hey i ahvent done much shell scripting someone willing to provide quick syntax for something that basically goes from directory ran in and executes a program in every subdirectory
<derek> i.e. if you were in /foo/
<derek> it would scan /foo/ for directories and then execute a program on that directory
<jbailey> find . -type d -exec (cd '{}' && FOO) \;
<jbailey> should do the trick.
<jbailey> FAiling that:
<derek> is FOO the program?
<jbailey> for x in `find . -type d`
<jbailey> do
<jbailey>   cd $x && FOO
<jbailey> done
<jbailey> Yup!
<jbailey> You need the cd VAR && FOO so that when it exits, you're left in the original directory
<jcater> ooo, and after 0.4.2, I think I'll have 0.5.0 sometime this decade
<jbailey> I had to show someone how to use ed for scripting today.
<jbailey> It was quite scary when I realised I knew how. =)
<derek> jbailey: what if i dont need to go into the directory
<derek> i assume find . -type d -exec myprogram 
<derek> wouuld work
<derek> well let me rephrase taht mabye your second program is what i want
<derek> for x in 
<derek> er
<derek> for x in `find . -type d`
<derek> do
<derek>   myprog -d $x
<derek> done
<derek> that should work nicely i think
<jamest> we're shooting for this decade?
<jbailey> Yup.  The find case is faster, though.
<jbailey> so
<jbailey> find . -type d -exec myprog -d '{}' \;
<derek> ok
<derek> silly question since that was so painless
<derek> any way to make that recursive easily?
<derek> so that it will spider down a tree structure
<jbailey> What does that mean?
<derek> if i had .
<derek>  ./foo/
<derek>  ./foo/bar
<derek>  ./foo/bar/bar
<jbailey> It already does that. =)
<derek> yummy
<jbailey> Just type
<jbailey> find . -type d
Action: derek loves unix
<derek> when there are good unix peopel around
<jcater> and we love you
<jcater> when there's other unix ppl around
<jbailey> Well, if you'd ever care to pay me a rediculous some of money for being a unix admin somewhere, let me know. =)
Action: jcater ducks
<derek> rofl
<derek> i like that one jcater
<derek> well unfortunately most linux people are not unix people 
<derek> thats why this channel is good
<derek> linux demeanor, unix knowledge
<jcater> now if we only had M$ money
<jcater> we'd be set
<derek> what would you do with 40 billion, really
<derek> i wouuld say that would buy tennessee, but its a big money state because of recording industry
<jbailey> Tell you what, you give me half as a down payment, and I'll draft a plan for the rest.
<derek> surely it could buy kansas
<jamest> get some new socks
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> new underwear
<jamest> jcater: really? why?
<jcater> these superman ones from jr high are getting holey
<jamest> these still fit
<jcater> and they stop fitting 4 yrs ago
<jbailey> It's just not computing if you're not computing in the nude.
<derek> jamest: last year this time you would have said, "buy a space heater, cause the guys around here said it woudl have to snow in hell before i got one, and i figured non meltable snow would be expensive"
<jcater> I agree, but wife says
<jcater> "Honey, please put some clothes on... we don't want to see that"
