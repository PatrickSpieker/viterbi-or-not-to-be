<reinhard> top - 17:48:57 up  1:08,  3 users,  load average: 5.87, 4.64, 3.18
<reinhard> Tasks:  62 total,   1 running,  61 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
<reinhard> Cpu(s):  0.0% us,  0.0% sy,  0.0% ni,  0.0% id, 100.0% wa,  0.0% hi,  0.0% si
<reinhard> does anybody know what "100.0% wa" means here?
*** jamest has quit IRC
<jcater> are you asking what it stands for, or what it "means" in practice
<jcater> I know the former, but not the latter
<reinhard> what does it stand for?
<jcater> the time the CPU is spending waiting for IO
<reinhard> oh
<reinhard> so broken hard disk sounds like a reasonable explanation for this 100% wa ?
<jcater> fwiw, I learned that "man vmstat" does a better job of explaining those codes than "man top"
<jcater> probably so :)

<s34n> I'm trying to figure out how far along this project is.
<s34n> How feasible would it be to put a GNUe implementation into production?
<nickr> People are using it in production
<nickr> well components of it
<s34n> nickr: financials?
<s34n> brb
*** s34n has quit IRC
*** s34n has joined #gnuenterprise
<s34n> nickr: I have some clients in small construction
<s34n> just growing to a handful of office staff kind of companies
<s34n> where they are just moving into a networking environment
<s34n> and want more than one person in Quickbooks at the same time.
<s34n> Most of those companies are married to Intuit.
<s34n> But some aren't.
<s34n> I'm looking for alternatives, and I would prefer not to support Windows servers.
<nickr> I think most of the applications that people use are something like what you'd use access for
<nickr> but I'm not really an authority on it
<s34n> :(
<s34n> are you saying that most GNUe implementations right now are access-ish?
<nickr> Er
<nickr> I'm saying the concept of data driven forms with databases behind them are sort of access-ish
<jcater> s34n, what he means by access is that most gnue implementations right now are using the form builder/interface components
<jcater> err, yeah
<jcater> s34n, if you are looking for a complete financials package, then GNUe is not ready for you
<jcater> (unfortunately)
<jcater> if you were looking for tools to easily build an interface to your own database, then gnue would be ready for you
<s34n> jcater: I figured it was more of a framework. not a shrink-wrapped package
<jcater> or, I should say, might be ready for you
<s34n> I was hoping there was some kind of reference implementation
