<jbailey> Haha.  The US threatens Canada again about us decriminalising Mirijuana. =)
<lupo_> jbailey: threaten to do what?
<jbailey> "We would have to respond. We would be forced to respond," said Murray.
<jbailey> Murray didn't spell out what the American response would be, but he invoked images of tie-ups at border crossings and intense bureaucracy. 
<lupo_> war?
<lupo_> :=
<lupo_> :)
<jbailey> Ah, dunno.
<jbailey> Wouldn't surprise me.
<lupo_> BTW, still no weapons of mass destruction found ...
<jbailey> I thought there was reports of a biolab. =)
<lupo_> regarding 9/11, i can recommend to take a look at german history: http://www.weyrich.com/political_issues/reichstag_fire.html

<jamest> ra3vat: cvs forms now supports multiple <dialog> per form
<jamest> sorry for the delay

<ra3vat> delay? sorry?
<ra3vat> it was unexpectedly fast
<ra3vat> jamest: what is on-activation trigger for? how it differs from on-startup?

<jcater> bigbrother!
<jcater> you made it back!
<chillywilly> there, there mr. carter
<ra3vat> jcater: what is on-activation trigger for? how it differs from on-startup?
<jcater> um
<jcater> you'll have to ask jamest for specifics
<jcater> but I *think* on-activation only really applies to "dialog" forms
<jamest> on startup runs at form load
<jcater> iirc, on-activation is fired once each time a form (dialog) is called
<jcater> where as on-startup is when "loaded"
<jcater> ah, and speak of the devil
<jamest> on activation runs each time a form is deisplayed
<jamest> use on-activation to clear the fields from the last time it was called
<jamest> IIRC the built in jump-to uses it to clear out the last values entered
<ra3vat> thanks
