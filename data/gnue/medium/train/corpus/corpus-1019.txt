<IsoosI> can gnue use a ldap backend?
<dimas> siesel committed something about that, but i do not know specifics
<IsoosI> committed even?
Action: IsoosI <- impressed
Action: IsoosI goes poking about
<dimas> gnue/common/src/datasources/drivers/ldap
<ajmitch> ello IsoosI :)
<IsoosI> 'ello aj
<IsoosI> someone's stolen my nick :P
<IsoosI> dimas: thank you very much!
<ajmitch> ooh, that's not nice of them
<IsoosI> dimas: I almost had found it :)
<IsoosI> Excellent
Action: IsoosI goes off to code some gnue forms for ldap :)
<IsoosI> how up to date is the version of gnue in sid?
<ajmitch> see topic
<ajmitch> old one in sid, new one on p.d.o
Action: IsoosI stupi
<IsoosI> d
<IsoosI> thanks
<dimas> IsoosI: report your ldap success here, then :) 
<IsoosI> I intend to
Action: IsoosI ponders cronning apt-get update every night
<IsoosI> save me waiting ages every day for it to complete
Action: ajmitch does it
<ajmitch> apt-get -dy dist-upgrade helps as well
<IsoosI> hmm
<IsoosI> I'm not sure if I'd trust that :)
<ajmitch> why not?
<ajmitch> -dy means to only download 
<IsoosI> oh
<IsoosI> sure
<IsoosI> sorry
<ajmitch> makes it a bit quicker on this sad mockery of broadband
<IsoosI> I don't think I'd trust that not to blow my bandwidth cap :)
<ajmitch> ah
<IsoosI> although
<ajmitch> not so bad when grabbing from NZ mirrors
<IsoosI> soon I'll have wireless to several other people running debian
<ajmitch> mmm, nice
<IsoosI> so in combination with some apt-proxies it might be worth it
Action: ajmitch wants that
<ajmitch> it has been talked about down here
<ajmitch> since there are so many debian users in the LUG
<IsoosI> yeah
<IsoosI> but do you have good LOS to each other?
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> a few of us do
<IsoosI> cool
Action: ajmitch has good LOS to most of the central city & south dunedin
<IsoosI> thats always been our major downfall in hamilton
<ajmitch> dunedin is mainly a cirlce of hills & valleys anyway
Action: ajmitch has great LOS to uni
<IsoosI> the advantage we have is that there is the big wireless project at uni (crcnet)
<ajmitch> I wish we had that
<IsoosI> and the group that is doing that project (wand) says that all members can get on to crcnet if practical
<ajmitch> here we have a number of poor students like myself
<ajmitch> 2 of the guys who aren't students don't have LOS to anywhere useful
<IsoosI> doh
<IsoosI> one of the things is that as soon as you have a practical network
<IsoosI> it's much easier to get people to join it
<ajmitch> wouldn't be so bad if drew could get an AP on top of the new uni building
<IsoosI> heh
<ajmitch> he was considering it
<IsoosI> yeah thats always good
<IsoosI> but difficult to achieve with typical universitys
<ajmitch> he's a sysadmin at black albatross there
<ajmitch> it's not part of the uni as such
<IsoosI> where does connections.conf go for these packages?
<IsoosI> I presume it's not /usr/local/etc anymore?
<ajmitch> hmm
<ajmitch>  /etc/gnue ?
<IsoosI> . /etc ?
<IsoosI> it doesn't ask you to set them up with debconf? :)
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> you could pester jbailey to add that...
<ajmitch> but I doubt he would
<ajmitch> I could try :)
<IsoosI> gnue-designer's looking very nice compared to last time I looked at it
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> has come a fair way
<ajmitch> hmm
<ajmitch> tuesday already, about time I got sleep
<IsoosI> heh
<IsoosI> time flies eh?
<ajmitch> yep
Action: ajmitch heads off to bed
