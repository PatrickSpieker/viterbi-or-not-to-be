<derek> chillywilly: if you are around
<derek> how far is west michigan for you?
<derek> is anyone near michigan or go there on occassion?
<chillywilly> why?
<chillywilly> michigan isn't too far
<chillywilly> is that the UP?
<chillywilly> ack! -> http://www.freethoughtassociation.com/
<jcater> why ack?
<chillywilly> they are making a huge assumption, that having religion decreases the likelihood for you to think freely
<jcater> I'm not sure that's a fair analysis
<chillywilly> read the forums ;)
<jcater> I am
<Vee2d2> Your most unhappy customers are your greatest
<Vee2d2> source of learning.
<Vee2d2> --Bill Gates (1955- )
<Vee2d2>   founder of Microsoft 
<jcater> then he ain't learning, eh?
<Vee2d2> how'd the fair go?
<jcater> windy
<jcater> very very windy
<Vee2d2> that sucks.. =/
<jcater> other than that, pretty good
Action: jcater was a little disappointed with the entertainment
<jcater> nothing but kids singing religious songs
<jcater> s/singing/poorly singing
<jcater> not my first thought of "live entertainment"
<chillywilly> what are you talking about?
<derek> chillywilly: you willing to do presentation in kalamazoo
<derek> the LUG there has requested a presentation if we can send someone
<derek> hi jcater Vee2d2
<chillywilly> it's a bit far away
<Vee2d2> hmm.. I wish credit/debit card transactions were simple and easy to setup on the merchant side.. 
<chillywilly> and I haven't even done one for our own LUG
<Vee2d2> 'sup derek, kid's all ok now?
<chillywilly> much less one in Michigan
<derek> yeah
<derek> i think we are out of sickness phase
<derek> been busy busy busy with work
<derek> probably wont slow down until mid june
<derek> at which point i will be on vacation
<derek> then i shsould be back at things :)
<derek> hope to get some work done maybe this weekend
<derek> problem is i will spend majority of time 're aquanting myself'
<derek> jcater: how feasible is reports for say an address book?
<derek> i know its capable of invoices etc that is fixed page
<derek> but basically by weeks end i need to print church directory
<derek> with images :)
<derek> would LOVE to use gnue reports
Action: derek might revisit the html xsl stuff
<derek> and go that route
<jcater> um
<derek> but didnt know what you had up your sleeve
<jcater> probably doable
<derek> i assume if you cna do labels
<derek> you can do a directory
<derek> as its same concept wrt layout
<derek> you be around at all this weekend?
<jcater> um
<derek> crapola
<jcater> it;s possible
<derek> its 8 gotta run :(

<Vee2d2> man, credit card processors sure seem to be heavy on the little fees.. 
<Vee2d2> $.20 here.. $.35 there.. $1.99ea for that, $1.30ea for this.. 2.49% + $.20 divided by your age.. blech
<jcater> yeah
<chillywilly> wow
<chillywilly> 38 packages just to install gnucash
<chillywilly> gnome has too many stinking libraries
<jbailey> Fees?  For credit cards?
<jbailey> Weird.
<chillywilly> might as well install the entire desktop too
<jbailey> Banks who charge fees here tend to lose all their customers.
<jbailey> (The odd one will do a flat rate for some services and such)
<chillywilly> yes, yes we know Canada is the best country in the world, we should all move to nova scotia
<chillywilly> blah blah ;)
<jbailey> Nova Scotia is a lovely province.
<jbailey> With great passtimes like..
<jbailey> gas sniffing.
<chillywilly> ugh
Action: chillywilly moves to halifax sp? instead
Action: chillywilly moves to alaska
<jbailey> Halifax is in Nova Scotia.
<chillywilly> it's like canada but it
<chillywilly> it
<jbailey> It's not like Canada.
<chillywilly> it's still the US
<jbailey> You guys bought it from the RUSSIANs. =)
