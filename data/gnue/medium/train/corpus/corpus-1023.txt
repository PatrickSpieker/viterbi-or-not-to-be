<nickr> look at the bug list and if it isn't there file an angry bug
<nickr> and then be called a dork
<nickr> but its fun!
<dneighbo> :)
<dneighbo> i saw in DWN that libpng has issues 
<dneighbo> hey i want to be more active in debian (since i am bug masta)
<dneighbo> two questions is there a NON web way to see outstanding bugs for a package?
<dneighbo> and a NON web way to submit bugs for a package
<dneighbo> jbailey mentioned some cool command that i now forget
<dneighbo> reportbug maybe?
<nickr> all bugs are manipulated in a non-web way
<nickr> you only submit bugs though email
<nickr> and indirectly through the bug package which operates via email
<nickr> there is a ref card on getting bug reports via email and such

<nickr> Methods of accessing the bug tracking system logs
<nickr> Accessing active bug reports
<nickr> Each message received at or sent by the bug processing system is logged and made available in a number of ways.
<nickr> The primary access method is to to use the web pages. See the forms on the main BTS page at http://bugs.debian.org/
<nickr> There is a mailserver which can send bug reports as plain text on request. To use it send the word help as the sole contents of an email to request@bugs.debian.org (the Subject of the message is ignored), or read the instructions on the World Wide Web or in the file bug-log-mailserver.txt.
<nickr> Accessing archived bug reports
<nickr> Each closed bug report is archived 28 days after the last message relating to it is received and filed. This means that it is no longer possible to access it or change anything about it using the control and service bots. However, the reports are still accessible for viewing.
<nickr> You can search the bug report archive using the WWW forms at http://bugs.debian.org/, simply select the "archived bugs" option.
<nickr> Note that it doesn't contain the oldest closed bug reports, only those after #40000, approximately.

<ariel_> Arturas: i have a problem with the patch you introduced in GParser.py (encoding)
<ariel_> grcvs does'nt run if the encoding variable is not in gnue. conf
<ariel_> either: 1)give it a default value,
<ariel_> 2) check if it is defined in gnue.conf, if not call in line 220 as pre-patch
<Arturas> ariel_: thank you for the note, but when i first introduced 'formFontEncoding' in gnue.conf i also introduced default value
<Arturas> going to check it...
<ariel_> you can update sample.gnue.conf with the default value?
SachaS_away (~Sacha@203.190.196.77) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<Arturas> it has default value already
<Arturas> (it is there more than for a month if i'm not mistakening)
<Arturas> called
<Arturas> formFontEncoding
<Arturas> default value should be iso8859-1
<ariel_> wait...

ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<ariel_> "no option formFontEncoding in section reports"
<Arturas> well, in form/src/GFConfig.py there is default value
<siesel_work> seems like formFontEncoding is defined in section forms, but not defined in section reports
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> oh
<siesel_work> if you start up reports it uses "section reports" as default section, i.e. you can't access formFontEncoding (see: GConfig.py)
<Arturas> i see
<Arturas> so the reports do not work
<Arturas> now we have code like:
<Arturas>         encoding = gConfig('formFontEncoding')
<Arturas>         # Typecasting, anyone?  If attribute should be int, make it an int
<Arturas>         try:
<Arturas>           attrs[attr] = baseAttrs[attr].get('Typecast',char)(saxattrs[qattr].encode(encoding)) 
<Arturas> would it be good if i add check whether encoding is st
<Arturas> would it be good if i add check whether encoding is set
<Arturas> and if not
<Arturas> would set it to 'iso8859-1'?
<Arturas> ariel_: corrected
<ariel_> ok let me cvs and rebuild
<siesel_work> a much cleaner solution would to add a [gnue] section to the config file 
<jamest> yes, we need a [gnue]
<jamest> i think I started work on this but didn't finish
<jamest> sigh
SachaS_away (~Sacha@dialup-196-178.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> i can do this
<ariel_> it does'nt work!
<Arturas> *&@^%&^@#%$(*@#&($
<Arturas> i added additional checking like:
<Arturas>   if encoding == '':
<ariel_> the error is before, it raises an exception when trying to fetch a variable not defined
<Arturas>       encoding = 'iso8859-13'
<Arturas> in code
<Arturas> encoding = gConfig('bla-bla')
<ariel_> i have also added the var in gnue.conf in report section but i does'nt work.
<Arturas> if bla-bla is not found what will gConfig return?
<Arturas> empty string or nothing?
<ariel_> raises exception (i suspect)
<siesel_work> ariel_: you have to add it to: GRConfig.py
Action: ariel_ is too busy at work now to check further (sigh!)
<siesel_work> jamest: which solution do you prefer: a) fetching all settings with gConfig  b) define a gnueConfig for getting [gnue] settings and don't modify gConfig's behavior
<jamest> i was wanting a global [gnue] section
<jamest> that std gconfig reads first
<jamest> then merges in the specific [forms] [reports] etc
<jamest> so that a person could override specific global settings in certain apps
<siesel_work> hmmm, that's great
<siesel_work> but that specific setting doesn't need to be defined in the forms/reports GFConfig again, or what do you think?
<jamest> ah
<jamest> you're talking in the code base
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> I'd think it should be moved into a generic one in common
<jamest> i _think_
<jamest> i swore I started something w/ default in the config system
Action: jamest doesn't recall the details
Action: siesel_work will look at the code base tonight :)
siesel_work (jan@131.220.92.76) left irc: "going home"
<Arturas> ariel_: it should work now

<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> jcater i thought it was Debian GNU/Jcater now? no?
<dneighbo> stbain: seriously the major components are python 2.x (preferably 2.1), wxPython and a database (Postgres, MySQL, SAP-DB)
<dneighbo> most of the other dependencies have started to go away
<dneighbo> if you want to do reports you will probably want to pick up Sablotron and PySablot
<dneighbo> oh and you will need the python driver for whichever db you choose 
<dneighbo> i like to get wx and python first to verify a normal form works 
<dneighbo> then grab db set it up
<dneighbo> then get its driver test a db form
<dneighbo> then move on to swearing at reports :)

<stbain> just for giggles, I tried to compile GNOME2 from the source on a Cygwin platform last night

<stbain> not that it has anything to do w/ GNUe, but I figured everyone could use a good laugh
<stbain> hola pse
<stbain> err... psu
<Chipaca> stbain: your choice of things to do for giggles are _way_ off base
<psu> good way to keep up/catch up on GNUe => kt.zork.net/GNUe/archives.html
<Chipaca> stbain: for giggles you could try *** ****** *** a ******** with pronged *******, for example
<dneighbo> um it does have to do with gnome
<dneighbo> we have some pygtk2 patches needing applying
<dneighbo> no one here has gnome2 to do testing :)
<psu> Great quote from an old Wired before it was lame "Whenever I want to do something mindless to relax, I reintall Win95"
<dneighbo> how is that relaxing
<dneighbo> when you have to get up every 10 minutes to reboot it :)
<stbain> hehe
<dneighbo> ok stbain im back
<ra3vat> ralaxing may come from mindless nature of this, you don't need brainstorming to reboot
<stbain> OK
<stbain> I have wxPython RPM installed
<dneighbo> ra3vat no but you have to put down your beverage of choice and then get up and reboot
<stbain> should I grab the CVS snapshot?
<dneighbo> stbain yes
<dneighbo> un tar it somewhere
<dneighbo> then in gnue/
<dneighbo> run setup-cvs.py
<dneighbo> and answer questions to your liking (i pretty much just hit enter (i.e. take defaults))
<stbain> ok
<dneighbo> but certainly you can do as you like
<dneighbo> the defaults put everything in your home dir (which makes nice for clean up later)) or running cvs in conjunction with stable
<stbain> ok
<stbain> downloading now
<stbain> ok... installed
<dneighbo> Is there a specific list or page to post suggestions for this great project?
<dneighbo> In case there is not a specific place, here are my suggestions:
<dneighbo> 1.- HTTP downloads (please!!!) of the SAPDB binaries, for all those who
<dneighbo> can't access sapdb.org via FTP! just like me ;)
<dneighbo> could/should we offer sap binaries for download from gnue?
<dneighbo> i.e. be a mirror
<psu> it would fit nicely in our "depends" d/l directory which is a bit bare @ the moment
<stbain> setting up postgresql now
<dneighbo> i know this is a snobby question, but why red hat?
<stbain> because a) its already installed
<stbain> and b) I haven't downloaded woody final yet
<dneighbo> ah a) is enough
<dneighbo> i thought you had said yesterday
<dneighbo> i finally have red hat 7.3 installed and am ready to download gnue
<stbain> plus, I need som debian time to get acquainted w/ apt and whatnot before I start using it for production at work
<dneighbo> you have #gnuenterprise what more do you need :)
<stbain> well... it was installed when I first started here
<stbain> hehe
<stbain> this is true
Action: dneighbo says that not really kidding
<stbain> I'm sure #debian probably wouldn't hurt either :)
<dneighbo> no actually #debian is BAD
<dneighbo> a. they dont answer questions and will probably frustrate you to no end
<dneighbo> b. some of the answers they give are 'dangerous' as they are 'guessing'

<dneighbo> then go to gnue/forms/samples/zipcode/
<dneighbo> do a psql gnue
<dneighbo> then inside psql
<dneighbo> do
<dneighbo> \i pg_zip_code.sql
<stbain> ok
<stbain> hold there a sec
<stbain> have to take a phone call
<dneighbo> or i think you coudl do psql gnue < pg_zip_code.sql as well (i never remember the syntax so do \i w/in psql)
<dneighbo> after that loads do a 
<dneighbo> ~/bin/gfcvs zipcode.gfd
<dneighbo> and see if things work
<stbain> ok
<sledge_> psu?
<sledge_> dneighbo "cat pg_zip_code.sql | psql gnue" is fine, too :)
siesel (jan@dial-194-8-209-11.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<sledge_> siesel!
<stbain> don't I need to createuser on my db server as well?
<sledge_> stbain: i think so
<siesel> hi sledge, hi all
<sledge_> siesel: basic test run of _featuretest doesn't work at the moment?
<dneighbo> stbain i was assuming postgres was configured
<dneighbo> try createuser
<dneighbo> i assume you have a user created or you couldnt have created the db
<stbain> nope
<stbain> I just installed it
<stbain> fresh install
<stbain> haven't even modified hba.conf
<siesel> sledge: should work, I've tried on a fresh cvs
<sledge_> DB000:   File "/home/sledge/Projekte/gnue/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/appserver/_featuretest/atest.py", line 87, in basictest
<sledge_> DB000:     print "on one line by calling instance.formatAddress :\n %s " \
<sledge_> DB000: AttributeError: geasObject instance has no attribute 'formatAddress'
<siesel> you should update the database, with create_tables.sql
<sledge_> mom
<sledge_> nope
<sledge_> still the same error message
<sledge_> though the formatAdress is in the geas_meta_object table
<stbain> hrmmm
<siesel> hmmm, quite strange
<stbain> Error: Driver not installed: pygresql for PostgreSQL [No module named pgdb]
<stbain> I must have missed something somwhere
<sledge_> stbain: ldconfig?
<siesel> sledge: did the show Namespace part work? "gtestcvs 4" then choose 3
<stbain> sledge_: no dice
<stbain> for some reason it's not seeing postgresql-python
<stbain> either that, or postgresql-python has a different driver
<dneighbo> jcater what is the provider name for postgresql-python
<sledge_> siesel: no, AttributeError: geasObject instance has no attribute 'showNamespace'
<jcater> postgresql
<jcater> iirc
<dneighbo>  * PostgreSQL 6.x-7.x [via PyGreSQL, PyPgSQL, Psycopg, and PoPy]
<dneighbo> is it PyPgSQL ?
<jcater> don't think so

<siesel> sledge: you are using the database set up as [gnue] in your connection.conf?
<dneighbo> hmm
<dneighbo> provider=postgresql 
<stbain> hold a sec
<stbain> seeing if the postgresql-python RPM has the files we're looking for
<sledge_> siesel: yep; works for forms and designer
<stbain> lol
<dneighbo> on redhat they have 1.5 and 2.x
<stbain> postgresql-python         /usr/lib/python1.5/site-packages/pgdb.py
<stbain> good call
<stbain> hehe
<dneighbo> :)
<dneighbo> you will need to get proper postgresql rpm
Action: dneighbo forgot to warn that on redhat to pay attention to that
<stbain> yeah... that's one thing I despise about redhat
<stbain> apparently they haven't noticed that the rest of the world is moving on without python 1.5.2
<stbain> hrmmm
<stbain> ok...

<stbain> nope
<stbain> no errors
<stbain> and I have a list of hte states
<stbain> the states were populated in the zipcodes.gfd dropdown selection box as well
<stbain> dunno if that was from a query or not
<dneighbo> states.gfd right
<stbain> yup
<dneighbo> seems zipcodes.gfd doesnt pull data 
<dneighbo> probably would only be in dropdown boxes
<dneighbo> the states.gfd should autopopulate at the top
<dneighbo> if you are getting data loaded
<dneighbo> when you run states.gfd
<dneighbo> then you are workign :)
<dneighbo> you have a workign GNUe System
<stbain> shweet
Action: dneighbo runs before you try to really use it and ask real hard questions
<stbain> ok
<stbain> so where do I download accessmdb2gnuegfd

Action: dneighbo has imagery of sargent handing private a hand grendade and saying here is the pin, if you pull it through it and run....
<stbain> pull left, throw right
<stbain> hehe
<stbain> keep the grenade in your right hand
<dneighbo> stbain : in all seriousness
<dneighbo> go to pgadmin.postgresql.org
<dneighbo> download that application (runs only on windows)
<dneighbo> and download the access migration tool
<dneighbo> this tool will provide mechanism to convert all tables/indexes/keys etc from access into postgres
<dneighbo> which is half the battle
<dneighbo> at which point with some effort you could then rebind their existing access screens/forms to use postgres tables
<dneighbo> then you start on the conversion of access forms to gnue forms :)
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> we have no 'direct' migration tool
<dneighbo> for that part, but it should be fairly easy using our 'wizards' in designer
<dneighbo> since the 'structures' exist
<stbain> ok
<stbain> I'll look into it
<stbain> but I can tell you that the spaghetti code queries and whatnot are going to prove painful
<dneighbo> im not following?
<dneighbo> you mean their existing application will be painful?
<stbain> it already is painful
<stbain> homegrown over the years
<stbain> modified by multiple people
<stbain> no error checking
<stbain> bad data in the tables
<stbain> could take quite some time to get it just to where I can dump it all into Postgres
siesel (jan@dial-213-168-88-35.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> um the pgadmin tool is pretty smooth for dumping the data into postgres
<dneighbo> you may want to do some cleanup
<stbain> left joins, right joins, outer joins, inner joins, heavy replication of data that should be in lookup tables, circular structure w/out hierarchy... it's a mess
<dneighbo> but the dump shoudl be easy
Action: siesel is searching a good debugger for python
<dneighbo> well moving to postgres and rewriting properly are two different tasks :)
<dneighbo> gdb
<stbain> now... what's gncvs?
<dneighbo> navigator
<stbain> what's that do?
<stbain> other than crash?
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> you have to pass it a valid .gpd file
<dneighbo> ~/bin/gncvs gnue/navigator/samples/sample.gpd
<dneighbo> i think woudl work
<stbain> one step ahead of you
<stbain> btw...
<dneighbo> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=NS-My_eGallery&file=index&do=showpic&pid=41
<stbain> w/ gfcvs and gncvs and whatnot... how hard would it be to open a file open dialog selection box whenever they are run w/out a valid command line filename parameter?
<dneighbo> um i think this has been discussed
<dneighbo> i forget the answer
<dneighbo> i think the big answer is UI
<dneighbo> as ultimately there is more thanone ui
<dneighbo> though i suppose we coudl just say if no UI default to wx
<stbain> that brings up my next question
<stbain> how is ncurses support coming along?
<dneighbo> then if no .gfd then launch dialog
<dneighbo> it was going well when gontran was here
<dneighbo> but he got a wild hair up his butt and decided to travel the country (as you can tell im jealous)
<stbain> hehe
<stbain> well... I think I'm going to get a wild hair myself and go home
<stbain> enough work for the day
<dneighbo> so its slowed considerably, but we still very much plan on having it
<dneighbo> :)
<siesel> This GDB was configured as "i386-linux"..."/home/jan/Projects/gnue/gnue/forms/src/GFClient.py": not in executable format: File format not recognized
<stbain> and now that I have a working gnue forms, I guess the next thing is to get appserver up and running... right?
<stbain> now that appserver is ready for primetime
<dneighbo> stbain for that i would have to defer to siesel and his studly gdb proweress
Action: stbain looks at siesel
<stbain> well... at least for now I can create 2 tier apps w/ forms and postgres
<siesel> appserver is working good, but  is not ready for production use
<stbain> I take it navigator is what you use to tie all the forms together?
<stbain> siesel: ok
<stbain> not that I really need it... yet
<siesel> The stuff which broke for sledge was the feature enhanced version of it
<dneighbo> stbain yeah thats the plan for now
<stbain> looks interesting
<stbain> what about authentication and permissions?
<siesel> master of gdb please spend some of valuable time to help a novice 
<stbain> e.g. I only want my finance officer to be able to access the payroll module via navigator
<stbain> any sort of centralized authentication/authorization in place?
<siesel> the only authentification happens in appserver or in db
<stbain> any authorization?
<siesel> and on the file system, so the only way to do something like you want is to move the payroll module into a seperate file (read protected) which will be imported by normal navigator form 
<siesel> nop
<stbain> hrmmm
<stbain> ok
<siesel> (Pdb) I hate you

<stbain> ok... well
<ajmitch> go ask in #debian, they'll tell you the same

<ajmitch> dammit, screen just decided to die on me
<stbain> ok...
<stbain> when I insmod the usbmouse module
<stbain> it gives me: input0: Logitech USB mouse on usb1:2.0
Action: ajmitch would just edit XF86Config-4 & be done with it :)
<nickr> you might need to install that usbmgr package
<stbain> that would be nice if I knew what to put in XF86Config-4 ;)
<stbain> ok
<nickr> doesn't the config thing allow you to choose a usb mouse?
<ajmitch> nickr: do you know why screen would decide to freeze up & not allow me to reattach to it?
