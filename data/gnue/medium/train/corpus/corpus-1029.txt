<stbain> greetz
<stbain> fyi, after reading the KC that psu posted this morning
<stbain> I also work for a non-profit
<ajmitch> ok
<stbain> we're using DonorQuest, but seeing as how I'm trying to convince them to use NOLA for accounting (with the notion of eventually converting it to the GNUe based accounting system), having a GNUe donor program would be great
<ajmitch> yeah, that'd be good
<ajmitch> that referring to what the FSF wants?
<stbain> right
<stbain> I imagine we'd have to tweak it for our use, but I haven't even seen DonorQuest, so I'm not sure what the needs involve
<ajmitch> ok
Action: ajmitch go sleepy byebye :)
<stbain> as it stands, I'm taking my dead-tree version of The Cathedral and the Bazaar to my finance director tomorrow
<stbain> hopefully that will help my plight to use NOLA
<ajmitch> ok, cool
<ajmitch> night
<stbain> night
Action: dneighbo is away: church
