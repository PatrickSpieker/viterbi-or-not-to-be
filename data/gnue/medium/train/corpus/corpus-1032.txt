<ajmitch> damn, this form works on one desktop but dies on the other :)

<ajmitch> my, this is broken

Action: ajmitch kicks wxPython
<chillywilly> that's beatiful
<ajmitch> fix it pls chillywilly
<jamest_> ajmitch: shut off the splashscreen
<chillywilly> ajmitch: no
Action: ajmitch tries
<ajmitch> well, whaddaya know? it works!
<dneighbo> stbain: um me using my brain :)
<dneighbo> i was thinking something in the first query was critical to sorting (with filter) for the second query to work right
<dneighbo> but i was on crack
<dneighbo> all is well now
<dneighbo> ajmitch: what jamest said
<dneighbo> i get that a lot (espeically with a few themes)
<ajmitch> dneighbo: that's a worry
<dneighbo> disabling splash screen makes it disappear
<dneighbo> what is odd is it seems to happen more with certain themes or larger prequeries
<ajmitch> i'd say threading
<dneighbo> id say jacked up splashscreen action in wx* ;)
Action: dneighbo just got a boat load of killer new cd's :)
<ajmitch> yeah, but if something tries to write to the wrong X context die to race issues, it could cause it :)
Action: dneighbo needs to get out grip and get busy
<dneighbo> so i can make personal 'backups' of course
<jamest_> it's when the splashscreen timeout causes the spashscreen to be removed before the login window is up
<jamest_> on a loaded down machine or click to place window manager this happens alot
<jamest_> i'm pretty sure others have looked at it other than me and nothing obvious is wrong in our code

<ajmitch> wassup?

<ajmitch> yeah, nb cleared it up for me
<psu> other way round ;-)
<ajmitch> silly me ;)

<psu> it was already installed ;-)
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> psst, it's an ESR prog
<psu> woody CDs should arrive today
<psu> ajmitch: is that good or bad?
<ajmitch> if you distribute an binary application under LGPL, you are obliged to provide source, right?
<psu> AFAIK, yes
<psu> the diff from "full" GPL is that you cannot enforce that on 
<psu> in the same way
<ajmitch> that's what i thought
<psu> however IANAL
<ajmitch> it's not too much of a hassle, because the descendant from this app will be under GPL+LE anyway
<ajmitch> and will hopefully be GNU :)
<psu> which way around is GNUe CVS?
<psu> i.e. by default do I get the 0.3.0 stable+bugfixes
<ajmitch> nope
<psu> or jcater's brave GNU world of pluggable designer, etc?
<ajmitch> by default you get the fresh & juicy goodness that has been committed
<psu> k()()l
<ajmitch> most people have branches for stable & leave HEAD for development

<stbain> his maintenance crew doesn't have access to a computer to update their WO's w/ timecards, but he's going to click on the add timecard link and just hit print so they can fill out the info on paper and he'll enter it manually

<dneighbo_> cool
<dneighbo_> i had sent sap a list of 'gripes' from slashdot postings

<dneighbo_> http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=37305&threshold=-1&commentsort=1&tid=99&mode=flat&cid=4016958
<dneighbo_> my personal favorite comment
<dneighbo_> Q. Really is difficult, at present, to hack. In general, the code is VERY challenging to work with (particularly the ugly, custom built build system), although it should be said that the SAP internal developers are steadily improving all aspects of the system, and a time WILL come when external developers can see rewards for their hacking efforts.
<dneighbo_> A. True. Although I still object to the notion that make was presented to mankind on the mount Sinai.

<Chipaca> that doesn't sound like microsoft technician, that sounds like any "technician" that is really a helldesk guy, as in from an ISP
<dneighbo_> if only they would send them all to the firing range
<dneighbo_> you could tell a good tech from a bad one by the number of fingers he had left ;)
<dneighbo_> jamest: why do you only have 3 fingers and thumb on your left hand again?
Action: dneighbo_ runs for cover
Action: dneighbo_ suspects the right answer is his aim was off one day and one of the lusers actually got a chance to fire back ;)
<jcater> dneighbo_: I think his BUFH finally bit his middle finger off after seeing it so often
<dneighbo_> roflmao
<dneighbo_> jcater that was a REALLY good one
<jamest> :)
<dneighbo_> this is going to sound dumb, but how do you make a dos bootfloppy from win98?
Action: dneighbo_ seems to remember doing this before, but it was an odd location to do so
<Chipaca> dneighbo_: i can't answer that in public
<jcater> dneighbo_: format a: /s
<jcater> or if it is already a cleanly formatted one

<Chipaca> dneighbo_: right click on the diskette, click on format, and tell it you want to transfer the system files, please.

<blixem> anyone here able to answer a dcl problem perchance?
<jamest> dneighbo_ would be your best bet I imagine
<blixem> I'll throw the question out then in case he stops back by this screen :)
<blixem> I was running DCL 20020215 perfectly fine with PHP 4.2.1, and postgres 7.1.2.  I upgraded PHP to 4.2.2 for the security fix and poof my DCL broke, sortof http://www.jungledrum.co.nz/~brucec/broken-dcl.png shows what happens after I log in.
<blixem> problem is I upgrade DCL to 706, that doesn't fix it.  I roll back PHP and that doesn't fix it.
<blixem> so I completely remove dcl and php, reinstall them both (php 4.2.1) and still get the same thing
<blixem> I even tried connecting to a mysql db instead, to see if it was a postgres problem but it keeps doing the same thing.
<blixem> it does this on windows, IE5.5, Netscape and on Linux Galeon and Opera.
<blixem> any clues?
<dneighbo_>  sigh isa kkicking my butt
<StyXman> dneighbo_: what the problem?
<dneighbo_> poof it broke, cause php turned globals off by default
<dneighbo_> fix php.ini to have Globals turned on and i suspect your problem will releive itself
Action: dneighbo_ thinks mdean is changing some things so we arent dependent on that
<dneighbo_> but silly php changed mid stream and it bit us :(
<dneighbo_> StyXman : i have isa nic
<dneighbo_> i downloaded bootdisk (win98) and driver config tool
<dneighbo_> i turned off plug and play
<dneighbo_> and then configured the irq/io
<dneighbo_> as irq 3 and io 300 (so i assume 0x300)
<dneighbo_> i then in bios configured
<dneighbo_> irq 3 as reserved
<dneighbo_> and
<dneighbo_> io something - something (the one with a 3) as reserved
<dneighbo_> and rebooted
<dneighbo_> used modconf to install ne2000
<dneighbo_> which is ne2 (i think)
<dneighbo_> and when asked for parameters i put
<dneighbo_> irq=3 io=0x300
<dneighbo_> and it failed
<dneighbo_> can someone that knows isa help?
<dneighbo_> am i not passing params correctly?
<blixem> dneighbo_: geezus I swear I tried that before, thanks!
<dneighbo_> no problem
Action: dneighbo_ scared all the pci loving goats away?
<jcater> isn't 3 a COM port irq?
Action: jcater would've chosen 9 or 10 (/me usually uses 10)
<dneighbo_> ok will try 10
<dneighbo_> what io should i use?
blixem (~doraedin@ip-210-54-149-34.orcon.net.nz) left #gnuenterprise.
<StyXman> dneighbo and why did you turned pnp off?
Action: jcater uses 0x300 usually
<StyXman> dneighbo try passing just io=0x300
<StyXman> which kernel version?
<dneighbo_> 2.2.x
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jamest> dneighbo: change irq port and use try ne driver if ne2 doesn't work
<jamest> ooo
Action: jamest just remembered
<StyXman> jamest: ne is for 2.4.x, IIRC
<jamest> i _think_ ne2 is pci card only
Action: jamest doesn't have time to verify

<jcater> sylpheed doesn't support ldap

<StyXman> he, mutt rocks
<jcater> um, yeah
<jcater> I can just see my customer service reps using mutt

<jcater> I'm in the middle of a crisis at work, so no time to look
<dneighbo_> irq 10 still fails
<StyXman> ok
<dneighbo_> grr i think its time to just get a friggin pci card
<StyXman> dneighbo dyd you try passing only the io?
<sledge_> dneighbo_: you got a real prob. what about buying a cheap rtl8139?
<dneighbo_> just hate telling someone else the answer is spend more money :(
<jcater> dneighbo_: um, for $15 or so, I would!
<jcater> what kind of network card is it?
<jcater> are you sure ne2 is the right dirver?
<dneighbo_> passing just io fails
<sledge_> use ne
<dneighbo_> kingston KNE20T
<dneighbo_> sledge_ you rock
<dneighbo_> ne works
<dneighbo_> now if i can get it to do something :)
<sledge_> 'kay :)
<jcater> wtf
<jcater> kmail doesn't support ldap either
<sledge_> lol
<StyXman> jcater: I think kde3's kmail would...
Action: jcater has KDE3
<StyXman> uh.
<sledge_> the moment jcater looks at a mail client, he makes it sound as if it was crap
<jcater> these are the two email clients I have in mainstream use
<jcater> by my users
<jcater> I love both dearly
<dneighbo_> whoo hoo rock
<jcater> but, damn
<dneighbo_> its working
<jcater> no ldap support?
<jcater> and they are as far along as they appear to be?
<dneighbo_> pygmy
<jcater> hell no
<sledge_> i can't believe that none of them supports ldap
<dneighbo_> rofl
Action: dneighbo_ was being funny

<dneighbo_> until looking at it

<dneighbo_> i installed from disks someone gave me labeled 'woody'

<dneighbo_> and teh cdrom sources say potato, but the apt sources it say stable
<dneighbo_> which at the time of the disks woody was stable
<dneighbo_> so im thinking its potato even though the disks said woody 
<StyXman> stable until a week ago (or two) was potato...
<dneighbo_> ok logged out

<dneighbo_> seems like 1 out of 2 times after rebooting into new kernel there are no modules (until you do that magic chant) that im not recalling right now
<nickr> depmod -a
<nickr> it should do it at bootup though
<dneighbo_> nope thats what you said last time :)
<dneighbo_> [05:33] <nickr> there is no possible way if you installed the kernel package that you'd end up without tonnes of modules in there.
<dneighbo_> [05:38] <dneighbo> um
<dneighbo_> [05:38] <dneighbo> im special remember
<dneighbo_> [05:40] <nickr> Yea.
<dneighbo_> then you suggested depmod -a and that didnt work
<dneighbo_> but a reboot did work after doing depmod -a
<dneighbo_> so i did depmod -a and no dice so doing a reboot and we will see
<dneighbo_> piss that didnt work either
Action: ajmitch wonders what magic ability dneighbo_ has
<dneighbo_> im like blink from xanth
<dneighbo_> he had aura that disabled magic
<dneighbo_> i have aura that disables electronics
<dneighbo_> i bet i could make serious coin as a QA tester somewhere ;()
Jayce^ (~jayce@65.204.214.55) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<dneighbo_> sigh i cant get them to show even after reboot
<dneighbo_> most odd
<dneighbo_> actually note upgrading to grub solved this problem before
<jcater> dneighbo_: no, I don't think so as the suicide rate at said company would skyrocket :)
<dneighbo_> dont think the programmers woudl take me to lunch for helping them find bugs?
<dneighbo_> this modules thing is killing me
Mr_You (~car@24.88.217.49) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Mr_You> hi
<chillywilly> hi
<dneighbo_> grr tried update-modules
<SachaS> bye
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-131.wasp.net.au) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
