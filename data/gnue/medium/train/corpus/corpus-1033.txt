<gontran_> damn splits
Nick change: gontran_ -> gontran
<gontran> back
Action: gontran hits irc-logs
<gontran> hmm dry like phoenix
<gontran> +000[01] due online soon
<gontran> i just saw 'Hollywood' with woody allen
<gontran> also saw some idiots :) waiting in line for star wars --
<ajmitch> +0000 due online soon? how do you figure?
<gontran> 5 hours early: and not even for digital!
<ajmitch> Thu May 16 05:13:57 UTC 2002
<gontran> hi ajmitch
<ajmitch> greetings & salutations to you, gontran
<gontran> i mean it's going to be 8am gmt soon (i think) :)
<ajmitch> UTC is +0000
Action: gontran is baffled by timezones _still_
<ajmitch> so it's even early for +0100 people
<ajmitch> hehe
<gontran> :)
<ajmitch> come live in NZ we have +1300 in summer ;)
<gontran> i can't even imagine
<gontran> not +1300 all year?
<ajmitch> no
<ajmitch> +1300 for daylight savings
<ajmitch> +1200 rest of the year
<gontran> 13 is a good number :)
<ajmitch> of course
Action: gontran is configuring a 2.4.19 kernel w/ patches lumped from gentoo
<ajmitch> .19 been release?
<gontran> nosir, i believe its 18 + patches
<ajmitch> oohk
Action: ajmitch is using 2.4.19-pre6
<gontran> ah
<gontran> lets see
<gontran> this one based on 2.4.19-pre7-ac2
<gontran> plus patches
<gontran> xfs 1.1
<gontran> grsecurity (dont' use this one personally)
<gontran> low latency  (pre7)
<gontran> qos
<gontran> some jp10 stuff
<gontran> 3.5 G addrss space
<gontran> acpi patch for toshiba satellite nbk (don't use this either myslef)
<gontran> that's basically it :)
<gontran> I've got xfs on an imac here, but am interested in trying it on a heavier use system like my workstation
Action: ajmitch has a plain -pre6
<gontran> nothing wrong with that mate -- it's not like
<gontran> i'm folding these patches in myself ;)
<gontran> I don't know if i'd dare, or have the time
Action: gontran wonders if mate has a positive connotation in nz
<ajmitch> sure
<gontran> cool

<psu> he's back!
<gontran> anyone tell me where 'true' and 'false' are defined? in common maybe?
<gontran> hi psy
<gontran> s/y/u
<gontran> have i been gone long?
Action: gontran goes greping
<psu> well, I haven't spoken to you in, ooo, 10 hours ;-)
<psu> 'course, I've been asleep most of that time...
<gontran> heh
<gontran> been wasting time constructing character assasinations for local lug :)
<psu> don;t worry, you're allowed
<psu> unless of course, you don't want to be
<gontran> hmm. looks like the true i was referenceing is defined somewhere in wxPython mods ...
<psu> you are also allowed to be not allowed
<gontran> that's the kind of discipline
<gontran> i can apprecieate
<psu> is true not just a python constant?
<gontran> i thought
<gontran> fexing screen
<gontran> looks like it 
<gontran> if i fire up the interpreter and type
<gontran> >>> x=true
<gontran> it raises an exception
<gontran> looking into it
<gontran> well, true is defined in wxPython/wx.py as
<gontran> wxc.true
<gontran> and wxc.so is available, so 
<gontran> it's either off to the source or make my own :)
<psu> "What is truth?" - P. Pilate, c.33AD
<gontran> see what happens when you try to get fancy and 'scripted'...
<gontran> you get crucified
<gontran> truth is police like authority
<psu> Is this related to the problem we had with CORBA booleans
Action: gontran shrugs
<psu> as per several KC discussions
<psu> setting a var to TRUE or FALSE both crashed
<gontran> oh of course I've read all twenty some odd issues. :)
<psu> I believe setting it to MAYBE was tried several times, too
Action: gontran thinks oh capitals
<gontran> nope TRUE still undefined
<psu> They are  a  useful way for new people to catch up ;-)
<gontran> so right
Action: gontran adds more kc reading to todo list
<psu> btw, what's odd about twenty of the issues? ;-)
<psu> or not odd about the other 8 (more likely)?
<gontran> 8)
<gontran> psu you forget: i'm american.  all that fancy talk gets me confused.
<psu> GNUE KC is writting in Englisg English
<psu> about the only times you can tell are words like "colour"
<psu> and my bad -ise'ing habit
<psu> When we get to Financials, I can see some fun
<psu> arguing about how to spell cheques
<gontran> typewriter memories
<gontran> no dammit its checks
Action: gontran practicing
<gontran> English English just makes us that more believable, financially
<gontran> for what that's worth 
<psu> I don't want it checked, dagnabit, I want the actual payment ;-)
<gontran> ooh
<psu> gontran: huh? You figure no English banker ever ripped off someone?
<psu> let me open you an account at the Bank of Credit & Commerce International
<psu> ...
<gontran> psu quite the contrary, i'm sure English bankers are the most theft-prone ..
<psu> you can use it to deposit your dividends from Enron ;-)
<gontran> but ironically evoke the most trust in merica
<gontran> enron owns bush
<psu> FWIW, British banks are probably among the most trustowrthy in the world
<psu> but there's always bad apples
<gontran> i guess i'm speaking from a colonial bias ;)
<gontran> that reminds me, chillywilly's new analogy for gnue has to do with the Boston Tea Party :)
<gontran> iirc

<Harald1> psu: hi, is it normal, that when clicking on kernel cousins in the menu on the webpage it gives you a 404?
<psu> um no
<psu> from which page?
<psu> my bad
<Harald1> from start page
<psu> the link on the front gnuenterprise.org goes to
<psu>  /GNUe/back-issues.html
<psu> shoud be
<psu> http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/archives.html
<psu> I'll see if I can get that fixed
<psu> In the meantime, above URL is the right one
<psu> "The previous link is now inoperative.
<psu> This is now the operative link"
<psu> as Nixon's press secretary would say...
<Harald1> uhm, that's to US-American for me, I don't understand it ;)
<psu> When the Watergate scandel broke,
<psu> press office issued statements that kept contradicting 
<psu> previous ones
<psu> when journalists pointed this out 
<psu> & asked what about the previous statement
<psu> they were told the old, discredited, statements were "inoperative"
<psu> i.e. lies
<psu> I've always thought this would make a good basis for a 404 message
<psu> that and 
<psu> "I'm sorry, I can't do that right now, Dave."
<psu> (2001)
<drochaid> LMFAO
<Harald1> hehe, at least they told the "truth", and didn't say the previous and the actual statements are right (like politicans normally do)...

<chillywilly> ello
<drochaid> hey there
<chillywilly> Episode II rocks
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> my favorite part is when Yoda was fighting count dooku
<drochaid> I liked the bit where the tree moster ate Anekin
<chillywilly> I don't remember that part...
<chillywilly> when was that at?
<drochaid> dunno, haven't seen it yet :)
<jamest> count dooku sounds like a cereal box mascot......."I'm DooKu for DooKu Puffs!"
<chillywilly> drochaid: heh
<chillywilly> drochaid: you faker
<drochaid> jamest: maybe they set it up for future marketing
<chillywilly> it is so funny though when yoda battles him with his light saber, he's like hopping around all over the place
<chillywilly> and then after the guy gets in his ship and flees, he goes and picks up his cane and start hobbling along again
<jamest> after having a group of Grad Students make me see Ep 1 I have more than enough will power to wait for the rental on DVD
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> there's very little Jar Jar in Episode II
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> my guys didn't like Ep 2
Action: jcater will wait for DVD as well
<chillywilly> whatever, I think it was cool how you can see the whole empire starting to form and the reason why there's storm troopers in the origanl trilogy and not battle droids
<dsmith> Count dooku sound like something out of the legend of Zelda.
<dsmith> dooko nuts and all that.
<chillywilly> He's a former Jedi master turned Sith Lord

<jamest> I really want to publicly thank MS for making such a wonderful virus distribution tool called windows
<Isomer> well
<Isomer> mostly only Outbreak Express
<Isomer> You getting "one or two" emails a day from it too eh? :)
<jamest> If their POS OS didn't treat every user as root then I think things like Klez would have a little harder time of it
<Isomer> I doubt it
<Isomer> a user still has access to their own address book
<Isomer> and they still have their own startup folder to run on login
<jamest> I'm mostly a unix shop here so it doesn't effect me or my users
<jamest> but
<Isomer> a "unix virus" could read ~/.addressbook and append itself to ~/.profile
<jamest> since klez is grabbing it's From: line from others addressbooks my users a getting the bounces from klez messages
<jamest> this costs me time reassuring them that it's not their machine
<Isomer> heh
<Isomer> had that one recently too
<jamest> several time over as they get panicy
<Isomer> turn off bounce messages on your mail server, send them only to postmaster 
<Isomer> forward the ones that are valid 
<jamest> um
<jamest> no way
<Isomer> or run a virus scanner on the mailserver? :)
<jamest> i have approx 300 users
<jamest> i'm not a mail filter :)
<Isomer> or, as a local large database development company did in Hamilton recently: Hold all attachments, and only release them by request to the IT team, the IT team of course shouldn't verify that the attachment is a virus, nor should they have virus scanning on desktops.
<Isomer> for extra credit, don't hold attachments on internal<->internal mail.
<jamest> btw
<jamest> i don't think klez would work on a unix system
<jamest> even if installed
<jamest> my users can't have access to smtp ports from their machines
<jamest> well
<jamest> i guess it could work 
<jamest> sigh
<Isomer> hmm, if I was writing klez (which, I might add as a disclaimer I'm not), I'd deliver direct, on failure use HTTP tunnelling, and on failure again, use a smarthost (eg: localhost :)
<jamest> mail is life here
<Isomer> Agreed
<Isomer> have you considered doing some virus checking on the mail server?
<jamest> not seriously, its not my system thats infected
<jamest> we're primarily unix
<Isomer> yeah, but it would stop the infected bounce messages from arriving
<jamest> true
<jamest> know of any good anti-v software for unix?
<Isomer> most of the windows people have unix varients, although difficult to find amongst the mess
Action: jamest doesn't want to spend his (small) budget on anual viri upgrades
<Isomer> theres one (I forget which) which has a per server license, not a per user license
Action: jamest will have to see if campus licenese covers non-windows systems
<Isomer> and it's priced about the same as a 5 user license for other companies
<Isomer> you have to be careful with licensing on them, since the unix varients never appear to check for valid licensing, they assume if you didn't have it, you wouldn't run it
<Isomer> a few people have been bitten by running antivirus software they didn't use anymore
<Isomer> Mailscanner is a package I used to handle the actual intercepting and decoding of mail
<Isomer> alternatively, you can give up on the antivirus package, and just keep md5sum's of viral attachments

<crazymike> please!!!
<crazymike> :)
<dneighbo> um
<dneighbo> crap i dont think i stated this just right
<jcater> what's it look like?
<dneighbo> or maybe i did
<dneighbo> just a second
<crazymike> i am writing a shell script that is like a calculator basically
<fitzix> crazymike: What's the script supposed to do?
<dneighbo> grr
<dneighbo> just a second minor fire
<dneighbo> major question
<jcater> crazymike: 
<jcater> #!/bin/sh
<jcater> cal
<jcater> # eof
<jcater> :)
<crazymike> calc is the name of the program...so at the shell prompt you'd type "calc a 3 4" then it would add 3 +4" or if you type "calc s 3 4" then it would subtract 3 -4
<dneighbo> um jcater:
<dneighbo> in my example abve
<crazymike> I just don
<crazymike> 't know how to declare "a" and "s"
<dneighbo> responsible is the name of the field in the master table
<dneighbo> so if i leave that i bitches thats not a valid field
<dneighbo> if i change it a valid field in the detail table instead it barfs

<dneighbo> not sure
<crazymike> yeah, I have #!/bin/sh
<jcater> sigh
<crazymike> it runs it
<fitzix> crazymike: I know that - what I mean is the syntax.  Your prof is going to look at syntax and I need to know if he's relying on Posix compliant shell or bash 2.x
<crazymike> but it says ./calc: [: a: integer expression expected
<fitzix> crazymike: can you send me the code? (fitzix@sdf.lonestar.org)
<crazymike> sure, but I haven't gotten very far
<fitzix> that's OK :)
<crazymike> ok...I sent it
<crazymike> it is gonna be in ksh
<crazymike> but I have to make it bsh for me to check it while I try and write it
<fitzix> ok - hmm...
<fitzix> your first problem is that the line
<fitzix> if [ $2 -eq a ]
<fitzix> actually, one sec
<fitzix> let me hack on this for a few
<crazymike> yeah, I was just fucking around with that
<crazymike> I had no idea what it was supposed to be
<fitzix> Hmmm... the first two script lines 'number1=integer'
<fitzix> is that ksh syntax?
<fitzix> sh is (pretty much) loosely typed (if you don't count arrays)
<jcater> err, why won't a simple
<jcater> if [ "$2" -eq "a" ]
<jcater> work?
<jcater> s/-eq/=
<fitzix> jcater: it's not ${2} it's ${1} (the arg array starts at 0
<fitzix> IIRC
<fitzix> and that's the other problem
<jcater> $0 = script name
<jcater> $1 = first arg
<fitzix> -eq is for numerical tests, not string equivalency
<jcater> ya, me did a s/-eq/=
<fitzix> jcater: precisely
<jcater> :)
<fitzix> jcater: yeah - that's how I caught the error :)
<fitzix> jcater: thanks :)
Action: jcater makes that mistake frequently
Action: crazymike makes every mistake possible :)
<fitzix> even better design
<fitzix> define functions a and s
<fitzix> then call them with the arg (gotta try that)
<jcater> of course, if you do that, then
<jcater> ./calc 'rm -rf /;a' 1 2
<jcater> would not be a pretty thing
<fitzix> LOL
<fitzix> hehe - well, you test them for good values first
<fitzix> err... OK - maybe the functions are a bad idea
<dneighbo> yeah
<dneighbo> i tie
[21:32] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<fitzix> what do you need?  add subtract divide multiply?
<crazymike> no, just add and subtract
<crazymike> i told you...it is just a gay little script...
<dneighbo> you know what trying to tie 2,143,777,530 to the dollar can be a bitch
<crazymike> since the whole class wasn't about scripting, we didn't go to far in depth
<jcater> dneighbo: what? y'all don't play by the rule that as long as it's within 10%, it's ok???
Action: jcater ducks
<dneighbo> um well we often say
<dneighbo> "close enough for government work"
<fitzix> crazymike: finished - coming your way for your analysis
<dneighbo> well be back later or tomorrow have fun

<crazymike> thank you very much
<fitzix> no problem
<fitzix> I charge by the minute, btw :)
<fitzix> j/k
<crazymike> lol
<fitzix> feel free to play with it so that it's more your style
<fitzix> or the style of the course
<fitzix> if there's anything in there that's not normal for your standard syntax, just change it
<crazymike> ok...thanks again
<fitzix> the let keyword might not work -- export total=$((${2}+${3})) works as well
<fitzix> (or should)
<fitzix> no problem - I've written hundreds of little BS shell scripts like that - it's fun :)
<fitzix> if [ ! $# -eq 3 ]
<fitzix> note the change in logic there
<fitzix> rather than if [ $# -gt 3 ]
<crazymike> yeah, why'd you do that???
<fitzix> now, it complains if the numbers of args isn't exactly 3
<fitzix> with your original code -- if I put in ./calc.sh a 2
<fitzix> I don't get an error
<fitzix> with this, it gives an error
<crazymike> yeah, cool
<fitzix> The '!' means "not"
Action: crazymike needs to finish the rest of the program :)
<fitzix> what's the rest of it?
<crazymike> not sure yet
<fitzix> heh
<fitzix> also,
<crazymike> I think that is pretty much it
<fitzix> a tip - not necessary for this prog
<crazymike> see, I missed that weeks class cause I was in Canada...and the instructor said she'd put it on her webpage for me...
<fitzix> ahh - actually, I have a better design
<crazymike> well, she didn't do it until an hour ago, and I have class at 8 tomorrow morning
<fitzix> this would have been better done with a case statement
<fitzix> anyway - not important
<crazymike> case statement???  like "typeset -u"
<crazymike> or not that kind of case???
<fitzix> case ${1} in
<crazymike> what would that do???
<crazymike> like I said...we learned the very very basics
<fitzix>   a) let total=${2}+${3};;
<fitzix>   s) let total=${2}-${3};;
<fitzix>   *) ;; #add error crap
<fitzix> hehe
<fitzix> esac;
<crazymike> oh...the "numner1" and "number2"...they were for the output...cause the output is supposed to be in this format:
<fitzix> well then, keep that in mind for the more advanced stuff :)
<crazymike> number1 + number2 = sum
<crazymike> number1 - number2 = difference
<fitzix> oh
<crazymike> thats why I needed those
<fitzix> OK
<fitzix> that's easy 
<fitzix> you want a revised one?
<crazymike> only if you want to
<crazymike> :)
<fitzix> sure - what the hell
<crazymike> lol...ok
<crazymike> then I think there is only one other part that I'll need to do, yeah!!!

<crazymike> i really appreciate this

<crazymike> i am not really a programer
<crazymike> never really planned to be
<fitzix> it's not a sin or anything :)
<jcater> crazymike: I wouldn't either
<jcater> there's really not much of a future in it :)
<crazymike> :)
<jcater> just look at chillywilly
Action: jcater ducks
<fitzix> lol
<crazymike> LOL
Action: crazymike applauds jcater
<jcater> but, in all seriousness
<jcater> programming is one of those careers in which you MUST love to program
<fitzix> Otherwise, you will commit suicide at a very early age
<crazymike> yeah, I am not really one to just sit there and do that
<crazymike> I need to be physically doin something
<fitzix> programming is physical...
<fitzix> my fingers have never been stronger
<fitzix> and my wrists hurt like hell 
<fitzix> :)
<jcater> "Let's get physical.. physical"
<jcater> "yeah let's get physical.. physical"
<jcater> err
<jcater> nevermind
<fitzix> of course, it'd be more of a work-out to jerk off...
<fitzix> but we won't go there :)
<jcater> err, you can't do both?
<fitzix> lol
<jcater> err, we won't go there
Action: fitzix pictures jcater jerking off to some C++ code that is particularly artful
<crazymike> lol
<jcater> C++
<jcater> nah, dude
Action: fitzix is actually *NOT* picturing jcater jerking off - he is not gay
<jcater> rofl
<fitzix> question of the day (set this as the topic)
<crazymike> ahhahah
<fitzix> if you could jerk off to one programming language, which one would it be?
<jcater> Ada
<jcater> after all, it is named after a woman
<fitzix> lol
<ajmitch> hehe
<crazymike> fitzix: how would I write this line  [ "${1}" = "a" ] to say if not equal to a or s, well, I know the != is not equal but how would I do the or
<crazymike> ajmitch: how in the hell are ya???
<jcater> [ "$1" != "a" -a "$1" != "s" ]
<jcater> I *think*
<fitzix> if [ "${1}" != "a" -a "${1}" != "s" ]
<stbain> so we ready to take over the world?
<fitzix> jcater: yes
<stbain> of ERP software that is
<crazymike> thanks
<jcater> does ${1} work in sh?
<jcater> I know it works in bash and ksh
<jcater> but in plain ole sh?
<fitzix> I'm not sure
<fitzix> it might not be strictly POSIX
<crazymike> what does the -a actually mean, does it mean "or"
<crazymike> just in case my instructor asks me
<crazymike> :)
<fitzix> "and"
<crazymike> ok, that was my otehr guess
<crazymike> other
<fitzix> jcater: it seems to - I set the shebang to #!/bin/sh --posix 
<fitzix> and it worked
<jcater> ah
<fitzix> that should put bash into posix mode
<fitzix> actually, doesn't it automatically do that if bash is called as sh?
<fitzix> or am I just being wishful in my thinking
<jcater> no
<jcater> don't think it does
<fitzix> well, the --posix sets it

<chillywilly> hi...
Action: Yurik is working on metasystem concept
<chillywilly> why?
<chillywilly> a system about a system?
<Yurik> well, I'd say "system of systems"
<chillywilly> explain
<Yurik> well, not so easy (I mean the issue of using of non-native language :)
<Yurik> but I can try, probably
<chillywilly> you got any pictures?
<chillywilly> ;)
<Yurik> In short. Here by "system of systems" I mean that each atomic element is actual a system (simple system), the composition of element is a system, too. And all these systems are in fact one system. All there systems behaves identically,
<Yurik> owing to simplicity of their ogranization - subject --predicate--> object model
<Yurik> this model looks *very* attractive for my needs, so I'm trying to make its formal specification now :) until I will fall down asleep (4AM here :)

<siesel> hi guys.
<ajmitch> hi siesel
Harald1 (Peter1234@pD9EB0981.dip.t-dialin.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> hi harald.
<Harald1> hi siesel
<siesel> cw,ajmitch: do you know the the short name for the "object server" in neilt's drawing? (like Methods Adapter -> GEMA)
<ajmitch> lemme look at the drawing, etc
<Harald1> is it GEOR?
<siesel> no. GEOR = Object Reposity
<siesel> (holds and provides the definition of objects.)
<ajmitch> see gnue/docbook/Proposals/geasarch/neilt-arch-explanation.txt
<ajmitch> doesn't say tho
<ajmitch> GNUe Object Access Translator (GOAT)?
<siesel> thanks. I already forgot that there is that file...
<ajmitch> GOAT is from reinhard's whitepaper
<siesel> I think there isn't the term "Object Server" in reinhards whitepaper.
<ajmitch> there isn't
<ajmitch> it says that GOAT is the main part of GEAS
<ajmitch> This is the main part of the Application Server.
<ajmitch> GOAT uses GEDI and GEMA to fulfill requests directed at business objects,
<ajmitch> after it has checked the validity of the request against GEOR.
<siesel> i.e. GOAT is similar to the Object Server?
<siesel> Btw. neilt want's a "object server" who has MVC (modell view controller) capabilities. I don't know exactly if this is compatible with standart transaction and locking schemes. (like the ones in an ODBMS) 
<ajmitch> i wouldn't know
<siesel> I think there is the need to make more agreements about the kind of "application server" we want to implement. Everytime beginning with a new component for my "_featuretest" approach, I'm quite unsure if someone agrees with my thoughts.
reinhard (~rm@62.47.246.140) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> hi reinhard
<siesel> morning reinhard.
<reinhard> siesel: morning??
<reinhard> hello all :)=
<reinhard> hello all :)
<siesel> yesterday I've been in town till 3 o'clock. -> 13 Uhr = morning ;)
<ajmitch> heheh
<siesel> reinhard: a question about GOAT as defined in your whitepaper: does real "objects" will exists in any stage of the appserver or does GOAT just simulates objects out of a combination of data stored in sql DB tables and methods provided by GEMA?
<reinhard> hmmm
<reinhard> depends on what you call "real existance" in the field of software :)
<reinhard> my plan was to not have python objects
<reinhard> although it seems as it could be easy so it'd be cool to have
<reinhard> but primarly we will have objects that are accessed through the defined api (via geasInstance)
<siesel> But if you create geasInstance for each table row. why not directly creates an real python object which inherites geasInstance?
<siesel> another question: if you speak of an " defined api" do you mean functions like "get("attribut1")" instead of "getAttribut1()" ?
<reinhard> yes to that "defined api"
<reinhard> re why not create a real python object
<reinhard> that is what i said if it's easy then we will do it
<reinhard> however other languages are not as flexible as python in creating new classes dynamically
<siesel> ok, its ~quite~ easy.
<reinhard> and eventually we will have other language bindings than python for geas
<reinhard> so the geasInstance way will still exist in any case
<reinhard> and anyway the dynamic class will be on client side imho
<reinhard> i.e. the geasInstance will go through the rpc module
<reinhard> and be converted to a e.g. customer object at _client_ side
<reinhard> would you agree there?
<siesel> its quite similar, the only difference is that "geasInstance" stores class information at "user space"  and a real python object has stored his class informations in "system space". -> no big difference.
<siesel> I think this is the basic way we should support it, because it possibly could make the programming of the database adapter easier and it will work with every programming language. But there should be an option to have direct access on the objects. (which is really easy to implement in python)
Action: Yurik is back
<siesel> direct access = you can write something like (" Serv=geas.Connect(); Addr=Serv.getObject("AddressExample"); Addr.printAllAddresses() ..... " something like this)
<reinhard> siesel: yes that looks good and sane
<reinhard> however do you agree that this would be client-side (RPC wise)
<reinhard> ?
<siesel> hmmm. I think that the trigger code wants to use this feature too, so it would be better to implement it "server-side"  
<reinhard> hmmmm
<reinhard> hmmmmmmmm
<siesel> An other possibilty is to write the code once and use it for triggers at the server side and for "getAttribut1" Access at client side
<reinhard> better
<reinhard> i guess we won't get objects of dynamic classes through gnuRPC

<chillywilly> never, I have given in to the dark side
<derek> chillywilly: best i can tell he talks equal crap in FRONT of your back, so thats hardly an argument ;)
<siesel> _featuretest is a trying to implement some ideas from odmg.txt and an book about object servers.
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> what ideas?
<derek> reinhard / siesel / others
<ajmitch> chillywilly: you've watched ep 2?
<derek> no one has responded to my call to drop objects altogether and just get rpc based
<chillywilly> ajmitch: yes
<derek> dbabstraction and triggers
<chillywilly> derek: because it is lame
<derek> so i guess that means it wont happen?
<ajmitch> derek: it'd be nice, but would that not require another revamp to support objects?
<derek> chillywilly: thats ok i can start GEAS v3 in another 6 months when GEAS v2 is still just floundering around like a used slap trout
<reinhard> derek: i still believe that is like saying let's drop apples and only do fruit
<derek> and you bitches are arguing about object fooness
<chillywilly> derek: heh
<siesel> f.e. namespaces, metaobjects, transactions, ... but the main idea is to make everything an object which inheriteds a geasObject.
<reinhard> dbabstraction + triggers == basic object function IMHO
<derek> reinhard: you mis understand me
<derek> i am not saying dont use objects in programming
<derek> im saying dont turn the relational table into objects (well im not really even suggesting that)
<derek> as if you look at forms it turns them into objects
<derek> but at the HIGHEST level
<derek> i.e. im talking no need for a 'gcd'
<derek> initially
<reinhard> derek: where will we define what methods exist and where they are stored?
<siesel> derek: should this GEASv2 you mean support transactions?

<chillywilly> what debates about objects are there anyway? ODL is rather simplistic, so if we use the standard there are no debates, imho
Yurik (~yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jcater> morning all
<chillywilly> seems like I have been up forever or that time is just crawling by
<siesel> the idea of _featuretest is to have a kind of "object server" which
<siesel> is very very simple, but which has objects to implement the rest of
<siesel> the server funtionality. Because this objects are objects of the objects
<siesel> server they can be updated and reloaded on a running system, and the most
<siesel> important: they can be stored and loaded from a database. I.e. you can
<siesel> store session states, class definitions, normal objects with the same
<siesel> code.
<chillywilly> it's only about 10am
<chillywilly> feels like it should be later
<ajmitch> it's only about 3am
<ajmitch> get it right
<chillywilly> don't you have classes ajmitch?
<ajmitch> sure
<chillywilly> when the earliest one?
<chillywilly> when's
<ajmitch> supposedly at 10am
<chillywilly> you should sleep then
<ajmitch> i'll skip it so i can get this java assignment finished
<chillywilly> hehe
Action: chillywilly never done that before ;)
<ajmitch> i should ask you about it - it's multithreading
<chillywilly> Java does things weird with threads
<chillywilly> like every object has a monitor
<ajmitch> this is more threading concepts than details
<chillywilly> ok
<ajmitch> we're using semaphores & crap like that
<chillywilly> k

<ajmitch> uhh, morning derek

<l-fy> hi ppl
<reinhard> hi l-fy
<reinhard> any questions we can answer for you?
<l-fy> well, somehow
<l-fy> one of my friends was start a sap for Linux
<l-fy> and i have tell him to watch at gnue
<reinhard> good advice :)
<l-fy> well, him was try to create something base more on nmoney from a bussines that documents
<reinhard> sorry i didn't understand that
<l-fy> is there something already done in this direction, who can be adapted for frensh contabily
<l-fy> was using reports but not for the bussines only for the money part
<l-fy> not tehnical part
<l-fy> sorry for my english
<reinhard> the money part == accounting?
<reinhard> i think i must explain
<l-fy> yes
<reinhard> gnue is really 2 projects
<l-fy> that part
<l-fy> ???
<reinhard> 1. to build a set of tools (like GNUe Forms, GNUe Reports) that help you build a business application
<reinhard> 2. to build the actual business application by using those tools
<reinhard> currently we are stuck with 1.
<reinhard> so there is no finished application like accounting or invoicing
<l-fy> reinhard > i have read about this
<reinhard> ok
<l-fy> but the first part is not complete
<l-fy> i have tell him to develop more in this direction
<reinhard> _when_ is a program complete? ;)
<l-fy> him want to create an integrate sistem like Scala
<l-fy> reinhard :))), when the buyer buy it
<reinhard> l-fy: gnue forms and report is used in production several times
<l-fy> reinhard > i have seen the screen shots
<l-fy> anyway
ra3vat (ds@195.239.204.226) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<l-fy> i want something so integrated that will have also bayonne, and all good stuff integrated
<reinhard> cool
<l-fy> to control everything in an enterprise with a program
<reinhard> however i think it is still a long way to go
<l-fy> ot really
<reinhard> but exactly this is the goal of gnue
<l-fy> bayonne can be controled from gnue
<l-fy> with some modifications
<l-fy> but i want more, to control back and everything
<l-fy> :s/back/backup/g

<siesel> morning 
<reinhard> hey siesel
<reinhard> i saw your commits
<l-fy> morning siesel 
<reinhard> do they mean forms work with geasv2??
<siesel> hi reinhard,  hi l-fy
Action: reinhard is scared
<siesel> yep. 
<siesel> but just read only. 
<siesel> and without conditions
<reinhard> so i guess i should implement write in appserver :)
<siesel> I think more important are specifications for reading informations about a table, like supported fields, ... 
<siesel> and a specification what kind of arguments are passed to setConditions :)
<siesel> just in case you've plenty of time as all of us ;)
<siesel> I've to write php scripts for changing passwords on a ldap server today :(
<l-fy> question
<siesel> btw. do you think that appserver v.0.1 allready needs Object/ClassDefinitions? Or should it just pass arguments to and from the common dbabstraction layer?
<l-fy> do you have something in the gnue that trasfer all report to the web?
<reinhard> siesel: re informations about a table (correct: class) - i would think we define pseudo-objects
<reinhard> so we can use the same interface to get that information as we use to get real data
<reinhard> re setConditions - agree :)
<reinhard> re appserver v0.1 we have to do a roadma
<reinhard> roadmap
<reinhard> i would say like
<reinhard> 0.0.1 has passthru read/write without class definitions and without methods
<siesel> l-fy: I'm don't know much about reports, but there is a file adapter (to write files into your /var/www directory) and a sablotron filter (to produce html)
<reinhard> 0.0.2 has class definitions
<reinhard> 0.0.3 has methods
<reinhard> that could make up 0.1 as the first version that really makes sense to use
<reinhard> with only basic fields (string, number, boolean, datetime)
<reinhard> then in 0.2 0.3 0.4 etc we add features like reference fields, list fields, indirect fields, calculated fields, triggers
<siesel> ok, when do we implement "objects can have other objects as attributs" ?
<siesel>  = reference fields = 0.3 (f.e.)
<reinhard> that is "reference fields" - i would propose later
<reinhard> um yes you were faster than me :)
<siesel> :) 
<reinhard> i'm not quite sure about when to implement namespaces
<reinhard> and especially on _how_ to implement them
<reinhard> namespaces == modules
<siesel> should appserver access more than one database?
<reinhard> depends on the version
<reinhard> 0.0.1 should not :)
<reinhard> 1.0 should be able to
<siesel> for v. 0.2 (f.e.)
<reinhard> i'd say later
<siesel> ok, does 0.1 already has namespaces?
<reinhard> that's what i'm not sure about
<reinhard> because i'm not sure if we can stay compatible if we add namespaces later
<reinhard> so we might _have_ to do namespaces in first "official" version
<siesel> a namespace could be not more than an "identifier" to "db name" "table name" "class type" mapper
<reinhard> the main issue about a namespace is to allow different modules adding a field to a class with the same name
<reinhard> you've got any ideas about how to implement namespaces?
<siesel> What do you mean by "allow different
<siesel>          modules adding a field to a class with the same name
<reinhard> sorry must go :(
<siesel> l8r.
<reinhard> i'll be back in the evening
<reinhard> l8r

<dtm> ??!?!?!
<dtm> what in the HELL kind of sense is that supposed to make!?
<dtm> this is in a global press release

<dtm> all this report says is that lots of people of many backgrounds and material configurations, wanna indiscriminately blow up as much of the US as they can, any time, anywhere, and they're slipping in every day undetected.  So, like, watch out, or something.
<chillywilly> nice

<chillywilly> just out of curiousity what does it mean to do 'from package import module as blah' ?
<chillywilly> the 'as' part is what I don't get
<chillywilly> you rename it temporarily or something?
<jcater> chillywilly: ya
<jcater> you are specifying an alias for the class/module name you are importing

<reinhard> yes i remember

<reinhard> btw saw your ROADMAP and agree mostly
StyXman (~mdione@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> I thought of adding some more definitions to the whitepaper. like introspection ( i.e. passthru of table definitions in case of v.0.1)
<StyXman> hint: gfcvs cannot open files with spaces in its name.
<StyXman> mdione@tempest:~$ gfcvs src/trash\ \&\ toys/table_against_table-test.gfd
<StyXman> Error: Unable to open file
<StyXman>      [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'src/trash'
<StyXman> :(
<siesel> what do you like to change?
<reinhard> i think there are a few points to add
<reinhard> like you said introspection
<reinhard> or support of more than one database
<reinhard> or security concept
<reinhard> which are all features that will appear in some version
<siesel> i think introspection should be implemented when the GClassDef/GObjDef Stubs are added. that means before v 0.0.2
<reinhard> yes agree
Gezza (Gezza@modem-3166.porcupine.dialup.pol.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<reinhard> if we decide to put class definitions in the database then introspection will be easy anyway
<siesel> I think we have to put very very basic introspection support into v 0.0.1 just to make the dbadapter work.
<reinhard> does forms need that?
<siesel> I've added an "0.0.4   has very basic security support". 
<reinhard> hmmmm
<siesel> The driver seems to need it. But it should work without too.
<reinhard> i wouldn't put security so early
<siesel> ok, i'll change it into "0.0.4   has very basic security support (=login and password check)"
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> :)
<reinhard> we could do a list like
<ajmitch> hi
<reinhard> 0.0.1 ...
<reinhard> 0.0.2 ..
<reinhard> until 0.1.0
<reinhard> then add
<ajmitch> siesel: congrats :)
<reinhard> Later (unsorted):
<reinhard> ------------
<reinhard> * ...
[09:11] Last message repeated 1 time(s).

<siesel> hi ajmitch. thanks.
<reinhard> it looks strange to me to have 0.2 through 0.4 undefined and then 0.5 again defined
<reinhard> :)

<ajmitch> hi jcater
<jcater> hi
<Yurik> jcater: hi
<siesel> I just added "0.5" to say that there will be a important milestone. (=0.5) which is the point where appserver supports transactions. i.e. appserver is getting usable in large enviroments, like 0.1 means usable for a small application.
<siesel> hi jcater.
ToyMan (~stuq@65.167.123.51) joined #gnuenterprise.
<reinhard> siesel: ah
<StyXman> DB000:   File "/home/mdione/src/work/fvl/gnue/src/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/forms/GFDisplayHandler.py", line 717, in __init__
<StyXman> DB000:     self.trueValues =  ('Y','y','T','t','1','x','X', trueValue)
<reinhard> i don't usually see 0.5 as a special version (other than 0.4 or 0.6)
<reinhard> but now i understand what you are after :)
<StyXman> I grep'ed all the sources. no reference ti trueValue. could it be a misspelling?
<siesel> So which from which version number do you think should appserver itself support transactions? 0.6 ? 0.8 ?  
<reinhard> i'm not sold about version numbers
<reinhard> what we could do is just list the post-0.1 features unsorted and decide about the order to implement them later
<reinhard> after talking to jamest and jcater about appserver and what they want to see
<reinhard> and maybe after getting experiences with 0.1 and seeing what is missing most urgently
<StyXman> uh, I changed it to 'self.trueValue', as I see that 3 lines before that member is loaded from the config files. could it be the right fix (tm)?
<reinhard> if we see that we need transactions very bad then maybe 0.2 will support transactions
<reinhard> if we see it's not a big problem then maybe 0.8
<siesel> ok.  I aggree.
<reinhard> "Planung ist die Ersetzung des Zufalls durch Irrtum"
<reinhard> ;)
<reinhard> (sorry don't know the proper translation to english)
<siesel> But I would like to have a "Version 1.0 must have" in the roadmap. just to see what feature is really really needed.
<ajmitch> ah, feature punting :)
<reinhard> yeah
<siesel> "Das Missverstaendnis ist der Ausgangspunkt fuer einen Dialog"
<reinhard> i would say in the "other planned features (unsorted)" we have a line
<ajmitch> so you're gonna have a list of milestones & features to be done by each milestone?
<reinhard> -------- end pre 1.0, start post 1.0 -------
<reinhard> or like that
<siesel> I would do it not quite like that. I don't want to decide which feature is post and which is pre 1.0. I just want to have a "minimum requirements" for release 1.0 list.
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> agree
<siesel> This could be archieved also by adding a "(required for 1.0)" after the feature in the list.
<reinhard> i let you post a ROADMAP and tell you later where i disagree
<siesel> hehe
<reinhard> j/k
<reinhard> ;)
<ajmitch> so are these targets going to be set in DCL?
<ajmitch> would be a nice way of keeping track of things ;)
<siesel> the new ROADMAP is in cvs.

<reinhard> siesel: thanks for ROADMAP
<reinhard> looks good
<reinhard> however i fear after talking to others a few more lines will get the (required for 1.0) remark :)
<ajmitch> especially once jcater & others get to it
<reinhard> i guess it's really my turn now to implement data writing
<ajmitch> the 'customers' ;)
<reinhard> siesel: how is the status with the python-xmlrpc library replacement?
<siesel> possibly we should add an (required for 0.4) and an (required for 0.6) just to make everybody lucky ;)
<reinhard> siesel: lol
<siesel> ajmitch: done.
<reinhard> did i understand correctly that we need xmlrpc to connect forms with appserver?
<ajmitch> what is?
<ajmitch> reinhard: i hope not - it shoudl be able to run without xmlrpc
<ajmitch> for single-server installs
<ajmitch> well, when forms & appserver are on same box
<siesel> ajmitch: But there are still some things to fix. like a garbage collection etc.
<ajmitch> siesel: right
<siesel> reinhard: as I understand it : appserver needs GNURPC to run. but there is only XMLRPC working now.
<reinhard> ah ok
<ajmitch> what other rpc transports could we do?
<reinhard> then it would be great to have a version of gnurpc available with geas 0.0.1
<siesel> SOAP, Corba, piro...
<ajmitch> gnurpc is in common, right?
<reinhard> that doesn't have to be installed from source on usual distributions (= debian)
<ajmitch> hmm, make appserver dependant on gnue-common
<siesel> yep. gnurpc = GComm.py GCommBase.py and drivers from common/commdrivers
<reinhard> ajmitch: it is anyway
<ajmitch> reinhard: then we have nothing to worry about :)
<reinhard> for data access, too
ariel_ (~ariel@ppp-217-133-245-70.dialup.tiscali.it) left #gnuenterprise ("Uscita dal client").
<ajmitch> so there needs to be a driver written so forms can talk to appserver?
<ajmitch> there's an old geas DBDriver
<jcater> how's it going, goys?
<reinhard> ajmitch: siesel has done (parts of) that driver
<siesel> GNURPC has two working xmlrpc drivers now: one supports the python-xmlrpc in debian.
<reinhard> jcater: you sure you want to ask that?
<reinhard> ;)
<ajmitch> morning jcater
<reinhard> siesel: finished that? cool!!
<ajmitch> ok, that's good to know, reinhard :)
<siesel> if you want to know if it works, just start appserver by calling gacvs and choose option 3 from the gtestcvs program
<ajmitch> so what can i do after exams? :)

<dneighbo> if so we have an xml format you could use

<dneighbo> is an example of the html output
<dneighbo> if you click on a table name it expands
<dneighbo> i am looking to make it so you can from a dia ERD document
<dneighbo> push a button and it generates our xml data definition
<dneighbo> which then makes the purdy documentation schema
<dneighbo> as well the scripts to actually create tables
<StyXman> xml? at the beggining was just to remember what we said about the tables. then it become the actual ERD. next time, maybe.

<dneighbo> you can use 'lookup' to get the name of the product from product_structure.product
<StyXman> dneighbo: the problem is: ...
<StyXman> dneighbo: uh?
<dneighbo> and in the list of products you would see the perishable item
<Chipaca> what happens in other situations where we have one table with two masters?
<Chipaca> well, actually, this is one of them. Heh.
<dneighbo> i'm not saying that there is not an issue with forms that might need to be addressed
Action: StyXman weight lookup solution...
<dneighbo> you know the saying
<dneighbo> a man can not serve two masters :)
<StyXman> :))
<Chipaca> you're only saying that because you don't live in Argentina
<StyXman> uh, my problem is not perishable, the problem are the names that should appear at the right.
<StyXman> :)))
<xeroz> Can GNUe client run as standalone and use dbase files on shared folder as backend?
<Chipaca> i.e. the name always shows up in the first textbox
<StyXman> only appears the name of the product related to the row of whip that is being slelcted.
<StyXman> we need the name of *every* qty that appears at the left, as in:
<StyXman> qty 10 name blah
<StyXman> qty 20 name bluh
<StyXman> ...
<StyXman> and so on.
<StyXman> we actually get:
<StyXman> qty 10 name blah
<StyXman> qty 20
<dneighbo> xeroz yes and no
<dneighbo> you would just need to make a driver for dbasefiles
<StyXman> and when I move the 'cursor' to the qty 20, then I get:
<StyXman> qty 10 name bluh
<StyXman> qty 20
<dneighbo> i think someone was toying with using gadfly (or whatever zope's local db is)
<dneighbo> that is because of how you are doing thigns
<dneighbo> make product structure the master
<dneighbo> ditch one of the products
<dneighbo> and turn it into a lookup
<dneighbo> and i think it would fix you problem perhaps
<dneighbo> thoguh i cant look at it live righ tnow
<StyXman> dicht one and turn it into a lookup? I miss the meaning of 'ditch' and don't know about lookups...
<Chipaca> ditch: tirar
<Chipaca> largar, mandar al carajo
<Chipaca> cortar (una novia)
<Chipaca> got it?
<StyXman> eso. skip the spanish lessons.
<dneighbo> leave it, dont use (ditch) :)
<StyXman> *how* do I do lookups?
<dneighbo> um you can do in designer
<dneighbo> i have to go upstairs for a bit i can explain when i get back
<StyXman> uh, I don't like designer yet...
<StyXman> ack.
<dneighbo>  <entry x="2" y="13" field="phone_type" name="ntryPhoneContext"
<dneighbo>              width="20" rows="1" style="dropdown" foreign_key="dtsrcPhoneType.id"
<dneighbo>              foreign_key_description="description"/>
<dneighbo> is an example of a lookup
<dneighbo> its taking the phone_type field and using the phone type table to infer the description
<dneighbo> this woudl be like using your product_structure tables 'product' field
<dneighbo> and using the product datasource to determine the 'name'
<dneighbo> again with out fully understanding the system and what you are wanting to do i hate to make recommendations
<StyXman> dneighbo: the system? you maen gnue?
<dneighbo> but this might be away to work through it until jamest or jcater can look at the actual datasource code
<dneighbo> no i mean the ERP or application you are writing
<dneighbo> must run up stairs to finance will be back
<StyXman> and that would work for just one such fields. sippose we have several... say, not just names, but also price and the likes.
Action: StyXman awaits you just here.
<StyXman> (right here. need to enforce my english.)
<dneighbo> i guess im not seeing why you want single fields a grid and then another grid
<dneighbo> for UI design purposes
<dneighbo> what im saying would make it two grids
<StyXman> wait. I *have* two grids.
<dneighbo> but if you have to look up a ton of stuff i think your schema is wrong
<dneighbo> you have two grids PLUS a non grid
<StyXman> I never thought of lookups.
xeroz (xero@lukio29.ilomantsi.fi) left irc: 
<dneighbo> i.e. nothing should be in your product structure table
<dneighbo> that is in your product table
<dneighbo> as that would be wrong :)
<dneighbo> but i assume you made the first thing because you wanted to see the name
<dneighbo> as an integer isnt really descriptive :)
<dneighbo> but a lookup turns that integer into a descriptions
<StyXman> uh? an integer? which one? ah, you mean the id?
<dneighbo> so you form might look like
<dneighbo> Product Name   Qty
<StyXman> my form should say, among another things:
<dneighbo> ------------ ------
[13:30] Last message repeated 3 time(s).
<dneighbo> Product Name  Perishable
<dneighbo> ------------ ------
[13:30] Last message repeated 2 time(s).
<StyXman> yes, but with a product name above, the one of the product I'm "building"
<dneighbo> ------------ ------
[13:30] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<dneighbo> where the first one is a list of products
<StyXman> forget perishable, is just a test.
<dneighbo> and the second one is a list of product that make up that product
<StyXman> nono, should be like:
<StyXman> composed_product_name: ---------
<StyXman> composition:
<StyXman> qty     product
<StyXman> ----   ---------
[13:31] Last message repeated 3 time(s).
<StyXman> or the like.
<dneighbo> thats fine
<StyXman> *but* qty caomes from ProductStructure and the names from Product
<StyXman> s/caomes/cames/

<dneighbo> right
<dneighbo> i still think what i said will work
<dneighbo> ok i see difference
<dneighbo> you can do that easily too
<dneighbo> i just dont get why you are doing the second grid
<dneighbo> and using product twice

<dneighbo> <StyXman> ----   ---------
[13:34] Last message repeated 3 time(s).
<dneighbo> is a no brainer to do
<dneighbo> its the second grid that is causing you problems
<StyXman> because I need it. leave it there. we may find similar cases involving three tables 
<StyXman> *why*?
<dneighbo> seems like bad UI design to me
<dneighbo> but who i am to judge
<dneighbo> submit a bug to forms-support@gnuenterprise.org
<StyXman> later we can discuse abou=t UI design...
<StyXman> a bug! wow...
<dneighbo> explaining the product and some one can look into it
<dneighbo> well personally i dont think its a bug persay
<StyXman> e.g., me. I dinid't know it was a flaw.
<dneighbo> i think the design might not be right and thats why its not supported
<dneighbo> but i dont think persay we should force our design principles on others
<dneighbo> so it probably should be classified as bug and fixed
<dneighbo> i can try to look at it at home in a few days
<StyXman> hmmmm, I don't think you get the problem, but I tell you, this can happen.
<dneighbo> to verify but dont have the time here :(
<dneighbo> StyXman i think i get the problem
<dneighbo> you have two datasources going against the same table
<StyXman> yes
<dneighbo> and forms is probably only managning a SINGLE cursor for that table
<StyXman> *that's* the problem?
<dneighbo> so its getting confused
<StyXman> nononon, it's not a cursor problem.
<dneighbo> i could be wrong but i believe thats what it is
<dneighbo> forms doesnt like having two datasources pointing to same table
<dneighbo> as i believe i ran into a similar problem before
<StyXman> (just a sec)
<StyXman> (I have *three* datatsources)
<dneighbo> correct and two of them point to same table
<dneighbo> i would just submit the bug
<dneighbo> as jason is moving and jamest is well tied up by rabid users somewhere :)
<dneighbo> and i have limited time to test
<dneighbo> as moving files around here is a hassle :(
<dneighbo> the gfd is a good start
<dneighbo> any way you can do a pg_dump on the tables
<dneighbo> and post as well

<dneighbo> i only see snapshot3.png
<StyXman> there now.
<StyXman> can you take a look?
<dneighbo> it would be easier if i had table dump
<dneighbo> i still think the right answer is to use a lookup
<StyXman> just a sec.
<dneighbo> though that might have similar issue
<Chipaca> you want a table dump, or a schema dump? or is the zot enough?
<dneighbo> pg_dump
<dneighbo> w/ schema and data woudl be best
<dneighbo> but if just schema that would probably work as well
<Chipaca> please check this http://freesoftware.fsf.org/download/papo/zot/PAPO-ER.zot (it might be enough)

<dneighbo> at least not today

<dneighbo> i just commented out the boolean on the form and it works for now
<StyXman> so? you get what happens?
<dneighbo> ok yes
<dneighbo> and it makes sense
<StyXman> what do you think?
<dneighbo> you are saying cantidad is master to prodnam
<StyXman> wait. I forgot the names...
<dneighbo> the way master detail works is by focus (cursor)
<StyXman> yes, cantidad is master of sProdName
<dneighbo> so when you have the the result set for product ok
<StyXman> yes, I realiae that... 
<dneighbo> the first thing is thing#1
<StyXman> yeap.
<dneighbo> and its detail is productstructure WHERE id=1
<dneighbo> so you get two rows back for that datasource
<StyXman> aha.
<dneighbo> id 1 and 2 of productstructure
<dneighbo> and yu then say give me a detail of that
<dneighbo> and it does
<StyXman> yes...
<dneighbo> the detail for id 1 is component 2
<dneighbo> not compnent 2 and 3
<dneighbo> if you move down to the 20.0
<StyXman> what I don't want it to do.
<dneighbo> you will notice the compenent name changes :)

<reinhard> please ask right away
<reinhard> maybe read the faq on the web page first :)
<dneighbo> Chipaca / StyXman also the dropdowns are better for entry in this case as they will only select valid products :)
<Gilbertyoda> surey
<Gilbertyoda> doing that.
<StyXman> dneighbo: yes, it works. but I don't think is what we want.
<Gilbertyoda> what do you do for gnuE btw?
<dneighbo> its what you described no?
<reinhard> Gilbertyoda: i'm the one responsible for breaking code ;)
<ICJ> *g*
<psu__> reinhard - I thought that was dneighbo?
<Gilbertyoda> but you don't really do stuff in python do you?
<Gilbertyoda> I wish you were though :(
<StyXman> yes, but suppose I want more info, and just info, from the slave products. *we don't like it*. :-|
<reinhard> Gilbertyoda: 99.5 % of our code is python
<StyXman> just a sec....
<reinhard> Gilbertyoda: the rest of 0.5 % is shell script ;)
<Gilbertyoda> hmmmm url per favore?
<dneighbo> well i would say suggest a patch or write one that just doesnt do dropdowns
<reinhard> url of what?
<dneighbo> for now you coudl do dropdowns and make fields 'readonly'
<psu__> Gilbertyoda - the original App Server was in C
<Gilbertyoda> well how come the python page is not blowing your trumpet par example.
<psu__> the current re-write is in python
<Gilbertyoda> ah okay.
<psu__> the logic is
<dneighbo> but the concept is the same i think you are just hung up on the dropdown box
<dneighbo> am i correct?
<StyXman> dneighbo: yes... we'll weight the solution. :)
<psu__> a) people write appservers in java, which is if anything slower
<dneighbo> if that form i gave you wasnt a dropdown it woudl be acceptable right?
<dneighbo> i.e. its a visual hangup you have
<psu__> b) if we get serious perf issues, we can optimise the key parts of code in C & link them in 
<psu__> as python is a good C wrapper
<psu__> This was what we were going to do with the Forms client
<psu__> but it never proved necessary
<reinhard> well if you hear psu talk you wouldn't think that he hasn't written a single line of code yet, would you?
<reinhard> ;)
<psu__> I think what clinched us on python for the AppServer rewrite
<Gilbertyoda> hehhe.
<reinhard> j/k psu does absolute valuable work for this project :)
<psu__> reinhard: I said the first day I came here IANAP (I am not a programmer)
<StyXman> dneighbo: yes, I guess it would do... just a sec, we're 'deliberating' :)
<Gilbertyoda> so psu__ what are you?
<psu__> I actually wrote a non-hello world python prog the other day
<Gilbertyoda> no WAY!
<reinhard> psu__: what scares me is that you can talk like a professional senior programmer :)
<psu__> Gilbertyoda - general hanger-on & diarist
<Gilbertyoda> diarist?
<Gilbertyoda> Goodness someone got my job already!

<reinhard> lol
<psu__> Gilbertyoda - http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/archives.html
<psu__> "Everything you never wanted to know about GNUe, and then some"
<Gilbertyoda> okay if I ever want to do anything in GnuE how much python do i need to know?
<dneighbo> StyXman i would think if you are ADDING components to make a product you would want the name to be a combo box like this to only allow valid selectoins
<Gilbertyoda> ie do I just memorize the python manuals and then announce my prescence?
<dneighbo> but then once selected woudl want other fields like price, etc to be auto populated as read only
<ICJ> reinhard:
<StyXman> dneighbo: wait more...
<dneighbo> which you could do via triggers
<ICJ> you didn't understand my hook stuff, right?
Action: psu__ bought the Boy's Bumper Book of Python Fun for Xmas
<Gilbertyoda> psu__:  there is no SUCH book!
<ICJ> In your whitepaper, events are raised (by whatever)
<ICJ> then automatically appropriately named methods are called
<ICJ> in my proposal
<ICJ> events are also thrown
<psu__> Gilbertyoda - well, there should be
<ICJ> s/thrown/raised
<psu__> As I was saying, I think what clinched us on python for the AppServer
<Gilbertyoda> so psu__ do you ever plan on learning python?
<ICJ> and then the listeners registered for the event are called
<psu__> was that we had AppServer accessing d/b in C
<psu__> and the Forms client accesing d/b using a python library we wrote
<ICJ> basically the same
<psu__> and the Forms client was faster 
<psu__> by a lot
<reinhard> yes ICJ
<ICJ> just a little bit more dynamic
<psu__> i.e. good python better than bad C
<psu__> well, not bad C
<psu__> just sub-optimal C
<ICJ> but I did not have the override mechanism in mind
<reinhard> psu__: lol
<Gilbertyoda> but python is a moving target ...
<Gilbertyoda> which version are you using now?
<ICJ> that another module can define a method for an existing one
<psu__> Gilbertyoda - we are standard on version 2
<ICJ> that's it
<psu__> ISTR some issues with 2.1
<reinhard> ICJ: you think the system described in the whitepaper will do the job well enough?
<psu__> but 2.0 & 2,2 are friendly
<psu__> Main problem is that most of the standard distros(esp Debian) are still stuck on 1.5.3
<reinhard> it is imho easier to understand and to handle than a system where hook methods have to be registered
<reinhard> and if we have the choice between two methods that do the job well enough i choose the one that is easier to understand
<psu__> I will probably end up learning python when it becomes no longer necessary
<reinhard> but i value your opinion very much
<ICJ> why is that easier to understand
<ICJ> ?
<reinhard> i understood it ;)
<ICJ> well, the registration would take place automatically
<psu__> i.e. by the time we have the Designer working with AppServer to allow you to graphically create triggers
<Gilbertyoda> psu but upgrading is not a big problema is it?
<psu__> w/o knowing any python at all
<ICJ> you know
<reinhard> seriously
<ICJ> in the definition (XML) there would be something like
<ICJ> <listener>
<ICJ> no
<psu__> Gilbertyoda - Not really. Biggest problem usually is people have stuff that depends on 1.5.3 as well
<Gilbertyoda> well it is up to python to find a migratory path!
<reinhard> we need the mechanism of one module extending classes of the other module anyway
<psu__> so you have to make sure you get the python 2.x executable to run GNUe not 1.5
<Gilbertyoda> reinhard what can I do? I want to do something.
<ICJ> <listener event="base.currency.PriceChange">
<Gilbertyoda> wait this looks like an XML affair!
<psu__> We actually have a shell script somewhere that tells you what pythons you have and what to do about it ;-)

<reinhard> now
<StyXman> import os
<StyXman> os.system 'cv co gnue'
<psu__> Gilbertyoda - if you know HTML, you know XML 
<Gilbertyoda> No I dun think so.
<Gilbertyoda> XML is one ugly mother
<psu__> After all, IANAP and *I* understand XML, at least enuf to write it
<StyXman> while not gnue.undertood():
<StyXman>   gnue.read ()
<ICJ> but not enough to understand what you've written?
<psu__> Eventually, most of the XML will be auto generated
<psu__> already we have Designer set up to produce the XML for Forms definitions
<Gilbertyoda> so is postgresql playing a part in any of this?
<reinhard> yes it's our prefered db backend
<psu__> and intend to use it for Report Definitions, App Server definitions, Navigator menu definitions... oh, and world peace and harmony between the nations
<psu__> (quick python reference for you there)
<Gilbertyoda> okay I am gonna wake up from my dream now... the clock looks a bit fuzzy and I can't turn off the lights.
<Gilbertyoda> psu__ I concur!
<Gilbertyoda> Python shall bring world peace!
<psu__> we work with shed loads of d/bs free and non-free
<ICJ> reminds me of Gnter Grass - Die Rttin
<psu__> SAP-DB is now GPL and hence FSF preferred
<ICJ> the nuclear defence programs "Make peace" and "Peoples' Peace"
<Gilbertyoda> are you kidding psu?
<psu__> but we are a broad church
<psu__> Gilbertyoda - kidding about what? www.sap-db.org
<psu__> SAP have been very helpful making debs and the like
<Gilbertyoda> host not found.
<dneighbo> StyXman should i still be waiting?
<Chipaca> dneighbo: coffee?
<psu__> oops - try w/o the hyphen www.sapdb.org
<dneighbo> Chipaca rofl
<dneighbo> well he told me to wait
<dneighbo> i have email and such 
<Gilbertyoda> Rawk ONNN
<psu__> avoid www.sap.com as it's a pr0n site - cybersquatters
<psu__> or is it the other way around?
<Gilbertyoda> so thats what www.whitehouse.com is also!
<Gilbertyoda> a cybersquatter.
<Gilbertyoda> I thought they were dead.
Action: psu__ hopes Gilbertyoda doesn't find out the hard way
<psu__> pun inintended
<Gilbertyoda> so when are these things gonna be implemented? 
<dneighbo> what things?
<Gilbertyoda> ie when are the companies going to start lining up to hire geeks in droves again?
<dneighbo> um what does that have to do with gnue?
<Gilbertyoda> who is gnue for?
<Gilbertyoda> I thought it was for companies! 
<Gilbertyoda> when is gnue going to be ready enough to start pitching is what I am asking.
<StyXman> Gilbertyoda: everybody! yiu want it? you get it!
<Gilbertyoda> yes indeed, but is the cake ready to eat?
<Gilbertyoda> no that didn't come out quite right.
<Gilbertyoda> Is the cake ready to be eaten?
<reinhard> Gilbertyoda: as most free software projects we have no fixed and planned release dates
<dneighbo> it is for companies but what does that have to with high tide economy?
<Gilbertyoda> ah okay.
<reinhard> it will be sooner if we have more people that help
<reinhard> :)
<dneighbo> you can eat the cake today
<Gilbertyoda> dneighbo:  you missed the point or I miscommunicated my point.
<dneighbo> Gilbertyoda : thats possible
<Gilbertyoda> reinhard how much python do I need to know to help?

<ariel_> can someone help me with forms?
<dneighbo> i think we are trying to get someone to the conference up there
<dneighbo> ariel_ we can only help people that are ready to be helped :)
<dneighbo> j/k
<Gilbertyoda> you have a conference here? just when I am almost about to move to FL?
<dneighbo> whats up
<Gilbertyoda> dneighbo:  tell me more about the conf.
<dneighbo> Gilbertyoda : there is an open source conference i think in toledo
<Gilbertyoda> toledo is 25 minutes away.
<ICJ> how is the Debian packaging status?
<dneighbo> though it might be canceled due to economy sucking
<dneighbo> ICJ ask ajmitch nickr or jbailey
<reinhard> ICJ: i would guess no release == no debian package :)
<ICJ> oh
<Gilbertyoda> the economy sucketh not. just too many unemployed professionals unwilling to do unskilled work.
<ariel_> did you never made a "number" entry against an "int4" field of a postgres database?
<reinhard> because afaik debian only packages released versions
<ICJ> for Mozilla, there are packages for the trunk ...

<dneighbo> um i havent tried
<dneighbo> the number vs int4
<dneighbo> probably wont work
<dneighbo> as i think int4 is like 5 but number woudl be 5.0
<dneighbo> or such
<ariel_> that's it 
<dneighbo> if you dont define a type you can enter what you like and then postgres will be ok ifyou put in valid ints
<dneighbo> you just lose 'validation' so to speack
<dneighbo> but you could do that in a trigger
<dneighbo> also there might be types other than number
<ariel_> when you commit you get: pg_atoi:error in 1.0 can't parse .0
Gilbertyoda (~gilbert@max2-89.dacor.net) left irc: Remote closed the connection

<ariel_> workaraund is changing all int4 or similar fields to numeric.
<ariel_> but if i wont to use a large legacy DB?
<dneighbo> ?
<dneighbo> have you tried other types in yoru form?
<dneighbo> i assume now you have <entry type="number" 
<dneighbo> or such
<dneighbo> have you tried type="integer"
<dneighbo> ?
psu__ (~psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<ariel_> is integer legal? (not in doc - techref)
<ariel_> i'm trying...
<dneighbo> not sure
<dneighbo> somethings are 'undocumented'
<dneighbo> in designer it lists text, date, number

<Gilbertyoda> what is the big question?
<StyXman> dneighbo: do you remember the form?
<StyXman> Gilbertyoda: nevermind. it's related to a long talk before you entered the channel.
<Gilbertyoda> ah neba mind.
Action: ariel_ is away: Sono occupato
<StyXman> ok, for whoever can answer. I have a form. There lies a entry, with, say, 5 rows. can I enlarge or shrink the # of rows, from the form?

<StyXman> dneighbo: yes, that answers. wtong answer, tho.

StyXman (~mdione@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) left irc: "ircII EPIC4-1.1.2 -- Are we there yet?"
<dneighbo> "not at this time"
<dneighbo> there are plans to use real grids which would give you some resizing capabilities
<dneighbo> but really i dont see much value in being able to 'add' more rows
<dneighbo> let me retract that, if you resize the form then i see value
<dneighbo> but resizing columns would be nice
<dneighbo> remember gnue is designed to be highly portable to many platforms and be extremely quick to write applications
<dneighbo> which means generally you will lose some of the 'pretty' fluff microsoft has taught you to love
<Chipaca> dneighbo: I was wondering if there was a way to get ctrees, but we thought nah they mustn't have done that because of the html, but then I saw the dhtml (your dcl_dict i think it was), and I said hey! that's how you do it with html! so where are the ctrees?
<dneighbo> some of that will develop over time, but its not highest priority currently
<dneighbo> trees are same principle
<dneighbo> do a tree on a palm pilot, or curses or with a telephone
<dneighbo> we are not opposed to such items, but because they cause other issues they are not super high on the todo list
<dneighbo> but we would be willing to do or support as much as possible others efforts to do such things
<dneighbo> i hope that makes sense to you
<Chipaca> methinks the curses point is rather moot seing as designer picks up its widget lists from wxwindows
<dneighbo> Chipaca: we made a decision that for now designer would be dependent on wx
<dneighbo> but applications should not
sledge_ (~sledge@B92b3.pppool.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> as we dont see a huge value in having a full fledge IDE for palm or the telephone :)
<dneighbo> we do see value in having applications run there :)
<Chipaca> ok, but if we made the decision that a palm device, or curses, or telephone were out of the question for other reasons, we could hack in ctrees, right?
<sledge_> hi all
<dneighbo> yes thats the point :)
<dneighbo> we plan on putting layers in
<Chipaca> ctrees aren't really trees :)
<dneighbo> so that we can have 'non standard' items
<dneighbo> like a cTree say
<dneighbo> and 'official applications' would not use it
<Chipaca> not unless we came up with a curses way of looking at ctrees
<Chipaca> :)
<dneighbo> and we would disclaim that we cant guarantee that these 'extensions' will be up to date with newest version etc
<dneighbo> but we wouldnt be unfriendly to someone wanting to write an extension
<dneighbo> in fact we woudl like that peopel do that
<dneighbo> you can almost think of it like python modules
<dneighbo> and if a module gets proper support maybe it becomes a part of
<dneighbo> jcater and jamest are best to discuss this with
<dneighbo> to see if cTree and grids are things they wish to include or have as 'external' items and such

<ajmitch> it's not terribly great at the moment :)
<Chipaca_> one question: is there any way to have the database do a transaction, from within gnue?
<siesel> :) the most i miss from NZ is the sea. I've spend a night at maroky boulders (spelled wrong again), which was great.
<ajmitch> oh nice :)

<StyXman> siesel: ok, no, or yes. eventually.

<siesel> cool.
<StyXman> and I'm hacking forms. we try to do a real thing with gnue.
<StyXman> but, we found some things we don't like.
<siesel> one thing I wonder about is: the database doesn't return an autoincrement number during the transaction =
<StyXman> like, the nice toolbar. it's gonna be wiped away.
<siesel> ?
<StyXman> siesel: no, if you're inserting a new record.
<StyXman> and we insert records in master/whip/slave/more/more a lot
<siesel> There is a draft for a GMenu, where you can define you're own Menu and your own toolbar in common/doc/Menues.txt

<siesel> sorry. I meant, you don't receive the number, which you get normaly directly after inserting an record, not directly but after the transaction, so you have to close the transaction on the main object first...
