<xeroz> is there any step-by-step guide for converting access project to GNUe?
<ajmitch> not yet, afaik
<ajmitch> i haven't looked tho
<xeroz> how complex reports can GNUe make? Are subreports possible?
<ajmitch> i think they might be, haven't followed reports progress either :)
<ajmitch> if not, they'd probably be implemented in a couple of weeks ;)
<xeroz> ok

<siesel> late autuum?
<ajmitch> yeah, it is
<ajmitch> it's not terribly great at the moment :)
<Chipaca_> one question: is there any way to have the database do a transaction, from within gnue?
<siesel> :) the most i miss from NZ is the sea. I've spend a night at maroky boulders (spelled wrong again), which was great.
<ajmitch> oh nice :)

<Chipaca_> ICJ: there are two ways of doing that: one is to get the id beforehand, and then write the master and the slaves
<Chipaca_> ICJ: the other is to begin a transaction, and work from there

<StyXman> siesel: ok, no, or yes. eventually.

<siesel> cool.
<StyXman> and I'm hacking forms. we try to do a real thing with gnue.
<StyXman> but, we found some things we don't like.
<siesel> one thing I wonder about is: the database doesn't return an autoincrement number during the transaction =
<StyXman> like, the nice toolbar. it's gonna be wiped away.
<siesel> ?
<StyXman> siesel: no, if you're inserting a new record.
<StyXman> and we insert records in master/whip/slave/more/more a lot
<siesel> There is a draft for a GMenu, where you can define you're own Menu and your own toolbar in common/doc/Menues.txt

<siesel> sorry. I meant, you don't receive the number, which you get normaly directly after inserting an record, not directly but after the transaction, so you have to close the transaction on the main object first...
