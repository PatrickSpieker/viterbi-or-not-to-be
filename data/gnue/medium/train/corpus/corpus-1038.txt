<gontran> ah you a mac hardware fan?
<gontran> or victim of circumstance ? :)
<dtm> both
<dtm> i'm a fan
<dtm> but i'm a fan because of the crazy circumstance that it's the most cost effective and best quality  :-/
<dtm> so how ya like them apples
<gontran> hmm most cost effective ? hows that?
<gontran> heh
<gontran> i've got gentoo running on this revB organge imac
<gontran> (that one there) :)
<dtm> well you take the sticker price of a creatively acquired used Macintosh, and you similarly creatively acquire upgrades for it, and hence an 8-10 yr old mac is about as fast as a current one.
<reinhard> gontran: there is an orange apple?
<reinhard> that sounds weird
<reinhard> :)
<gontran> hehe
<dtm> macs that are falling off of trucks such as the first powermacs, can be upgraded to G3 although are not as fast
<gontran> dtm I'm in the same boat! I got this mac for cheap 200 usd
<gontran> right, seen that
<gontran> reinhard next they'll be blueberry apples, weird!
<dtm> gontran: there ya go
<dtm> gontran:  well those imacs are totally upgradable too
<dtm> firewire, usb, ram, and cpu
<gontran> dtm really?  i had it apart and seemed purty dead end ...
<dtm> some of the old ones (i think including yours) have an obscure slot in it for things like video upgrades
<dtm> the old imacs
<gontran> saw that
<gontran> wondered
<dtm> yeah that's called something like the "Mezzanine slot" or something
<dtm> it's a sheer artifact, declared by apple not to be used
<gontran> it's such a piece of doorstop -- heh messanine
<dtm> so of course instantly a 3rd party market was created to stuff things in it
<gontran> yeah
<dtm> you will find the most absolutely mind numbingly obscure macintosh upgrades

<reinhard> in the database (like the definitions)
<Yurik> reinhard: you mean you'll store code in db?
<reinhard> gcd or xml will only be a means to trasport it

<reinhard> Yurik: yes
<Yurik> reinhard: are the set of language for methods implementation a limited one?
<Yurik> err, s/are/is/
<Yurik> s/language/languages/
<Harald1> reinhard: ok, and what about c++ methods (in a later version), will the compiled methods be stored, or the source code and then on-the-fly compilation?
<Yurik> sleepy a bit =)
<Yurik> yeah-yeah, i was asking about something like Harald1 issued
<Harald1> hehe
alexey_ (~alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<reinhard> support of other languages for methods is very low on priority
<reinhard> and i'm still not sure if it makes sense to support compiled languages for methods
<Yurik> it makes a lot of sense
<Yurik> for the time-critical methods
<Yurik> at leats
<Yurik> at least
<reinhard> as i'm not sure how we would handle things like you have two appservers (with load balancing) where one is a pentium and the other one is a ppc
<reinhard> i don't think compiling method code gains much performance
<reinhard> as opposed to for example optimization of db access
<Harald1> reinhard: ok. does this mean that if two business objects have some methods which are identical, these have to be stored twice?
<Yurik> have you though about separating attributes & methods
<Yurik> ?
<reinhard> i'm open to any ideas
<reinhard> Harald1: yes, however this won't be the case very often (imho)
<Yurik> i can only propose the way we use in Bauss (E/AS Software Foundation project)
<Yurik> it's very simple: attributes & methods are separated. methods are just reffered from the database to their location at services that run that methods
<Yurik> so method could be implemented in any language
<Yurik> the only one thing is that this method wrapper must be able to talk w/ its service
<Yurik> i think that storing code in db is a bad idea
<Harald1> reinhard: I can't think of a good example at the moment but I think this is pretty frequent for tasks which have some subtasks in common 
<Harald1> Yurik: so where are the methods?
<Yurik> Harald1: they are "attached" to "functionality provider" services
<Yurik> and speak only w/ them
<reinhard> Yurik: how do you deploy them?
<Harald1> Yurik: what exactly do you mean by "functionality provider" services
<Yurik> reinhard: what do you mean *exactly*?
<Yurik> Harald1: it's a service that is designed to be plugged with methods
<reinhard> Yurik: i sit in my office an my customer wants a method changed. i can access his server over 28K modem line. What do i have to do to change the method code at his server?
<Harald1> Yurik: as a part of the appserver?
<Yurik> Harald1: well, we have no notion of an appserver. Bauss is highly structured system w/ separate services
<Yurik> reinhard: mostly identically. i can describe precisely, but it will take a lot of time
<reinhard> Yurik: sorry i didn't understand that "mostly identically" - what is identical with what?
<Harald1> Yurik: do I get it right: For example you have a service which construct the business objects from the database and one which holds the methods?
<Yurik> reinhard: sorry, it's my bad. with way that you use in GNUe. 
<Yurik> reinhard: as I can understand it from your words
<Yurik> Harald1: well, if superficially, yes
<reinhard> Yurik: so where is the actual method code stored in E/AS: in the db or in a file?
<Harald1> Yurik: and the "functionality provider" services has to store the methods somewhere, too? where?
<Yurik> reinhard: method code isn't stored. it is running (if look superficially. somewhere some tricks are used to low the system load)
<Harald1> oops same question as reinhard
<reinhard> Yurik: i don't understand
<Yurik> Harald1: yes, first on the file system. May be later will think of another ways
<reinhard> Yurik: ah ok
<Yurik> reinhard: umm... it's my bad. My English is very poor... let me try to explain again
<reinhard> on the file system == in a file?
<reinhard> Yurik: your English is much better than my Russian :)
<Yurik> reinhard: well, first method that will be used - yes, programs will be in files... may be later will add loader from BaussDB
Action: Yurik pointed this topic. important issue to think more
<reinhard> Yurik: how does the server find the file when it needs a method?
<Harald1> Yurik & reinhard: I don't have anything against storing the code in the db. but what I think would be better: don't store the methods with the objects, but just referr to them
<reinhard> Harald1: and store them where?
dres (~dres@mail.lewismoss.org) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Harald1> reinhard: in another table, so that different objects can use the same methods
<Yurik> reinhard: on the method deploy method gets its own OID and OID -> name mapping is added
<reinhard> Yurik: ah
<Yurik> Harald1: In fact, I think to make Bauss able to start method from elsewhere - file system, BaussDB
<Harald1> Yurik: but if you store them in a db, you've got the same problem with compiled code, right?
<Yurik> Harald1: in fact it will be not so complex to implement
<Yurik> Harald1: since code do not migrates from the host it should not raise any problems
<Yurik> Harald1: while deploy method, it's compiled following the rules defined
<Yurik> Harald1: so it seems we'll got no probs
<reinhard> Harald1 and Yurik: in any case i think it is 100% important to make appserver modular so if we want to add another option (to store methods etc.) later, we can do without complete rewrite
<Harald1> Yurik: and then what's the problem with gnue storing code in the db?
<Yurik> Harald1: if i understand correctly, this code is stored and runned on each request, right?
<Yurik> Harald1: (may be i missed something)
<Yurik> Harald1: for me DB is just a way to deploy it and start once
<Yurik> Harald1: so it acts quite like file
<Yurik> Harald1: it acts like storage to start it rarely
Action: Yurik hopes that guys are understanding him
<Harald1> Yurik: afaik it depends, they are run everytime they are run (via hook or direct call).
<Harald1> Yurik: I guess I understand you
<Yurik> Harald1: so they start method code on each request for this method execution?
<Harald1> reinhard: that's obviously a good aim. does storing methods independent of the objects, prehend this?
<Harald1> Yurik: hmm, I'm just getting into the whole appserver stuff, I guess reinhard can give you better answers on such topics
<Yurik> Harald1: ok. hope reinhard will answer :)
<reinhard> sorry i'm in and out
<reinhard> Yurik: i'm not sure about it
<reinhard> i _think_ we should aim at something like
<reinhard> method code can be dynamically changed while server is running
<reinhard> and on next invocation new code is active
<Yurik> yes, could be. but it is no need to start method every time for this need
<reinhard> but appserver caches method code and if not changed
<reinhard> then it can use (precompiled) version in cache
<Yurik> in fact, i've some method to make an update and avoid denial of service
<Yurik> but i need to work on it a little more to formalize and prove it
<reinhard> questions like these depend actually what you want
<reinhard> do you want a perfect system that works in 100 years
<Yurik> yes, i want :)
<reinhard> or do you want a system that's usable in two months and works well enough
<Yurik> and trying to make such a system that have no need to be stopped even for a bit
<reinhard> Yurik: sorry i had bad wording
<reinhard> i meant do you want a system that is ready to use in 100 years (but not earlier)
<reinhard> that needs 100 years development
<Yurik> ah you mean that
<reinhard> :)
<Yurik> no, i'll die in 100 years :) actually I know the terms in which my project could be delivered first time
<reinhard> i _know_ that we can discuss about the best way to store methods for 3 years and not write a single line of code
<reinhard> i know it because the gnu enterprise project worked like this for 3 years
<reinhard> until derek came and kicked our butts :)
<Yurik> well, as for me, i think that i know the way Bauss will use, so for my project there is no big discussions on such kinda things
<reinhard> :)
<reinhard> i also know how geas2 will work
<reinhard> and siesel knows, too
<reinhard> and derek knows, too
<reinhard> however these 3 knowledges are quite different :)
<Yurik> If I'll find good investor, I plan to make first delivery in 2-2.5 years (w/ inter milestones, of course).. so no 100 years of development
<reinhard> Yurik: cool
<Harald1> reinhard: actually object independent method storage is something which should be implementable in a later version, without too much code changes (I think), so I agree that storing the methods with the definition is the best way to do it now
<Yurik> since Bauss project is small (by team), I still keep authoritarian control on its design
<reinhard> Yurik: you are going to work full-time on bauss?
<reinhard> Yurik: that saves a lot of time :)
<Yurik> reinhard: well, I'd like to work full-time on Bauss, but have no possibility now - I nead to buy my bread
<Yurik> reinhard: yeah, really :)
Action: Yurik is listening Lacrimosa

<Yurik> sleepy, really :)
<reinhard> Harald1: you have more questions?
dsmith (~dsmith@cherry7.comerica.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Harald1> reinhard: yes. can/will business objects run automatically or only if the are controlled by a user?
<reinhard> you mean will _methods_ run automatically?
<reinhard> i hope business object don't run
<reinhard> or i'll have to catch them ;)
<Harald1> reinhard: hehe
<Yurik> are you guys crazy? :) GNUe will be totally human-driven system? 
<Harald1> reinhard: I mean something like this: 
<ra3vat> Yurik: bread? obviously your project is quite different - only donuts are allowed here
<reinhard> ra3vat: rofl
<ra3vat> :)
<Yurik> donuts?
<Harald1> reinhard: A company wants to controll its inventory. It wants to do this automatically, but doesn't want the software to place the orders itself. So there's an object monitoring the inventory and if it's below a specified treshold it sends a warning (via email etc.). This could be done by checking the inventory, when taking something out of it (but would slow down each request)
<Yurik> what is donut?
<reinhard> Harald1: ok gotcha
<reinhard> my first thought is
<reinhard> business objects are not business subjects
<reinhard> objects do not act, the are acted upon
<reinhard> however there might be procedures that are run automatically
<reinhard> a method is a method
<reinhard> invoked by the user or invoked by cron doesn't make much difference
<reinhard> but i don't have plans to have "demons" in appserver
<reinhard> disclaimer: appserver doesn't always listen to my plans :)
<Yurik> reinhard: your software has its own life? :)
Nick change: reinhard -> appserver
<appserver> sorry, i can't do that, dave
Nick change: appserver -> reinhard
<reinhard> oops?
Nick change: Yurik -> Bauss
<Bauss> I'm just waiting for my masta to code ;)
Nick change: Bauss -> Yurik
Action: Yurik is out to smoke
<Harald1> reinhard: ahh now I think I understood what's exactly meant by business objects
<reinhard> Harald1: you've read the newspaper?
<reinhard> um
<reinhard> brain damage
<reinhard> i mean
<reinhard> you've read the whitepaper?
<Harald1> reinhard: yes
<reinhard> Harald1: if you have improvements on the explaination what a business object is, please fire off!
<Harald1> though it doesn't really answer that question (what business objects are)
<reinhard> it's really hard to explain such things
<reinhard> Harald1: there has been an update last week
<reinhard> which touches the topic _a_little_
<Harald1> reinhard: correct me if I'm wrong, but I would think of business objects as another "view" on database tables
<Harald1> reinhard: hmm I made the whitepaper this week, but it is from 2002-05-04, is it up-to-date?
Action: drochaid is back (gone 01:52:12)
<reinhard> no
<reinhard> should be 2002-05-21 iirc
<Harald1> I've got another one 2002-05-19
<reinhard> um yes that's current
<reinhard> edition 0.0.5
Action: Yurik is back and drinking mineral water
<Harald1> reinhard: there's a definition of business objects. I think its pretty good. Does the first sentence mean that the data itself is part of the business object, or is it just the definition of the data? To take the example from the whitepaper is a business object for a person the definition of the attributes a person, and of operations to perform on these, or is it the set of all stored persons and operations on these?
<reinhard> business object can actually mean both
<reinhard> a business object class
<reinhard> or a business object instance
<reinhard> i would say business object describes the _concept_ of doing it like this
<reinhard> and if you want to talk about the definition or the actual data
<reinhard> we should use the terms business object class or business object instance

<AthlonTB_01> est-ce qu'il s'agit d'un channel français ici ?
<reinhard> non
<reinhard> c'est un channel anglais
<reinhard> :)
<Harald1> so a business object class is independent of an actual db table, while an business object instance performs actual operations on a table. Am I right?
<reinhard> Harald1: most business object classes will have a db table more or less mapped to them
<AthlonTB_01> reinhard tu es francais ?
<Harald1> reinhard: though only the definition of a table, not the table with the actual content?
<reinhard> i.e. if the business object class "customer" defines that there is a field "name"
<reinhard> then it's probable that there is a table with a column with a very similar name
<reinhard> Harald1: exactly
<reinhard> class relates to table definition, an instance relates to an actual row in the table
<reinhard> AthlonTB_01: non, autrichien
<reinhard> mais j'aime pretender de parler francais :)
Action: reinhard envisions AthlonTB_01 cringing from his bad french
<AthlonTB_01> what I haven't understood what you have said
<reinhard> i wanted to say i like to pretend that i can speak french
<reinhard> but i only pretend :)
<AthlonTB_01> ok 
<Harald1> reinhard: isn't there an "of" missing in "GEAS lets the user define classes of business objects, where the class definition states the data elements(called fields) __of__ objects of this class"?
<AthlonTB_01> reinhard: You are IT analyst ?
<reinhard> Harald1: seems like that, yes
<reinhard> thanks
<reinhard> AthlonTB_01: no, i'm programmer :)
<Harald1> reinhard:  oh no, just a comma
<AthlonTB_01> analyste programmer = IT analyst no ?

<jcater> how's it going, d00d

<Harald1> reinhard: though it makes sense here. without putting "objects of this class will consist of" into commata, I didn't understand what you were talking about
<reinhard> jcater: you good at english grammar?
<Harald1> reinhard: da gibt's ja dann noch mehr Kommata (there's even more commata)
<jcater> I speak it natively
<jcater> but that doesn't mean anything :)
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> Harald1: could you please paste the complete sentence here?
<AthlonTB_01> mdr
<reinhard> i have the text on other machine so can't copy&paste :(

<Harald1> will consist of as well as the functions that will be available to act upon
<Harald1> the objects (called @dfn{methods}).
<Harald1> taken from the source code, pdf used bitmap fonts
<reinhard> Harald1: you could use .txt to copy&paste from if you want
<reinhard> nevermind
<reinhard> jcater: would you say that sentence (please ignore all "@dfn") is missing commas?
<Harald1> reinhard: I've got no makeinfo here
<reinhard> Harald1: huh? what kind of system is that?? ;)
<Harald1> reinhard: windows with most of the unix tools on top
<reinhard> ah so you don't have GNU/Linux, you have GNU/Windows? ;)
<reinhard> i am 99% positive there is makeinfo in cygwin
<reinhard> (i guess you are using cygwin)
<Harald1> reinhard: yes, but it seems that I didn't installed it
<reinhard> nevermind
<reinhard> jcater has gone anyway as it seems :)
<Harald1> reinhard: I guess there aren't any commas missing, but adding them wouldn't be wrong, too
<Harald1> and would clear the meaning of the sentence up
<reinhard> after "fields)" and after "consist of" ?
<jcater> GEAS lets the user define @dfn{classes} of business objects. The class
<jcater> definitions describe both the data elements (called @dfn{fields}) and
<jcater> the available functions (called @dfn{methods}) of the business objects.
<jcater> maybe that's a little more clear?
<jcater> I need to run again
<reinhard> I once wrote a text that was later discussed in a mailing list, and someone commented like "He has good ideas, but his English is very painful"
<reinhard> :)
<reinhard> jcater: thanks a lot
<Harald1> reinhard: because you are writing German English. I tend to do the same, my sentences get longer and longer, and in the end no one knows what I mean
<reinhard> Harald1: the scary thing is that i have the same problem when i write in German ;)

<drochaid> dsmith: I've just re-installed deb woody testing ... all goes fine during install, except "apt-get install aptitude" now returns an error ...
<Chipaca> reinhard: we've been fighting with datasources, cursing that you can't make one access two table at the same time...
<Chipaca> reinhard: ...only that when we were over at my place last night talking about stuff we realized that no, datasources *should* be stupid, because it's the appserver where the intelligence belongs
<reinhard> Chipaca: i'm highly sorry but i have to leave in 15 minutes

<Chipaca> reinhard: one last thing:
<drochaid> is there anything I'm likely to be able to do about this? it never used to cause a problem
<Chipaca> reinhard: how usable is appserver right now? i mean, is it "nothing works as it stands", or is it "only this works" (and where can i find that 'this') (ok that's two questions)
<Chipaca> drochaid: did you try dselect?
<drochaid> never used it
<reinhard> Chipaca: i would say wait a week then some basic functions will be usable
<Chipaca> drochaid: try it: dselect, next 'update', 'select' (just press enter), then 'install' should have fixed it
<drochaid> is it just "dselect" to run the app .. and is it intuitive for a noddy like me to use? ;)
<Chipaca> reinhard: hmm. anything we can do from here to speed that up?
<drochaid> okay, I'll try that .. ta Chipaca
<Chipaca> drochaid: hmm i skipped a couple of 'press psace to close the help screen'

<Chipaca> reinhard: drat. Ok :)
<drochaid> Chipaca: mmm, not a dselect fan ... aptitude has a cleaner, more intuitive interface
<Chipaca> drochaid: maybe. dselect is better at resolving complex depends/conflicts/provides/suggests/craps-on
<drochaid> but the feedback on what it's going to do is confusing
<Chipaca> drochaid: it's BSDish, even ]:)
<drochaid> I'm having a serious problem working out what it wants me to do when it shows the deps to the packages I want to install for example
Action: drochaid cries for aptitude
<drochaid> what twat broke the install :(
<Chipaca> drochaid: apt, aptitude et al break when they have A marked as installed, B to be installed, A and B depended on by C, and A conflicting wiht B.
<Chipaca> to mention one scenario :)
<Chipaca> dselect is smart enough to realize that there's also B++ that provides B and doesn't conflict with A

<StyXman> hello
<dneighbo> Chipaca i dont think geas is your answer
<dneighbo> if the datasources dont do something you need let jamest or jcater know
<dneighbo> as GEAS is SUPPOSED to use the common data level
<dneighbo> which means datasources and such would be the same
<dneighbo> btw: your primary key issue
<dneighbo> there is a builtin method for this
<dneighbo> as well as trigger to support this
<dneighbo>       <trigger name="Trigger_2" type="Pre-Insert">
<dneighbo> blckPerson.autofillBySequence('ntryPK','seq_dcl_contact')
<dneighbo> </trigger>
<dneighbo> is an example (the trigger is in the <block></block> section)
<dneighbo> Pre-Insert is the tryigger type (i.e. this fires on 'insert')
<dneighbo> actually pre insert :)
<dneighbo> and 
<dneighbo> autofillBySequence is the method that gets the next sequence number
<dneighbo> ntryPK is the field to put it into
<dneighbo> normally a 'hidden' field
<dneighbo> and
<dneighbo> sql_dcl_contact is postgres sequence name
Action: dneighbo thinks you or StyXman asked about this the other day

<StyXman> uh, chip would help you better than me...
<drochaid> I can't figure out how to actually install the deps .. it may have been me installing without deps that fuxored it [more than likely was!!]

<Chipaca> drochaid: meaning there is no way to fix the dependancy mess :(

<siesel> hi chipaca :)
<Chipaca> siesel: I mean about the fact that making things like views belongs in datasources and not in geas/appserver
<siesel> reading a log from the end to the begining is quite confusing...
<siesel> chipaca: there are quite different approaches for the appserver.
<Chipaca> siesel: sorry :/
<Chipaca> siesel: meaning?
<siesel> chipaca: I think that in a 3-tier environement the client=forms should as light as possible.
<Chipaca> siesel: I agree completely
<siesel> i.e. in 3-tier env. forms don't need views or something like that. views would live in the middleware = geasV2
yogurt2unge (~charlie@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> if views could be added to the db abstraction layer in common, to make 2-tier support this too. would be great.
<Chipaca> siesel: agreed; well, s/great/ok/ :)
<Chipaca> nobody should be building 2-tier apps :)
<siesel> gnue will give you the choice. ;)
<Chipaca> siesel: that's ok with me, just as long as I don't have to write the view in the datasource for a 3-tier app
<siesel> you point it out. There will be a point where some features, f.e. views, transactions, locking... will be quite difficult to add to the db abstraction in common, and where its more praticable to move it up one layer.
<siesel> just because of programming issues.
<Chipaca> so, in other words, in a 3-tier app, i.e. with geas, all i have to do is define the 'view' or whatever and i'll be able to access it from the forms as if it were a table?
<siesel> yes.
<Chipaca> and this will work even if geas is using a db that doesn't support views?
<Chipaca> and the view will be defined in some xml format?
<siesel> should be. (but don't expect that feature for geas v.0.1 or 0.2)
<Chipaca> siesel: we're willing to make them happen :)
<Chipaca> i.e. code them ourselves
<siesel> there are many formats which are thought about. f.e. ODL 
<Chipaca> but it's your project, so it's your call as to how and where
<Chipaca> (that's a plural 'your')
Action: siesel has joined gnue just 3 month ago.
<Chipaca> siesel: ok, so you're 3 months ahead :)
<Chipaca> well, 2 actually
<siesel> hehe. And i've used them well.
<siesel> the actual issue with geas is that everyone has a different picture of the future appserver. It ranges from DataSource + Methods + RPC up to a full ODBMS.
<Chipaca> siesel: reinhard said we should be ablto to use appserver in one week. Any idea what parts of appserver?
<Chipaca> siesel: heh. AFAICT, it's jboss :)
<siesel> I'm not quite shure if he allready added any new code( since yesterday) but there will be a a working appserver which can handle multiple datasources over XMLRPC.
<siesel> It will have no locking support and will support only one global transaction. It will be not more than the database abstraction out of common to be accessed over RPC.
<Chipaca> siesel: could you expand 'multiple datasources'?
<Chipaca> siesel: I was looking at the sample that's in appserver right now, and it has a lot of hardcoded stuff in it...
Action: Chipaca shouldn't expect other people to follow more than one thread
<siesel> yes, the whole GObjDef stuff isn't implemented yet.
<siesel> but this doesn't matter, if you just use the DataSource over XMLRPC.
<Chipaca> siesel: GObjDef is the way we'll have to define views et al?
<siesel> if you want to see a working test which loads table->object definitions out of a db you have to look into appserver/src/_featuretest
<Chipaca> tks!
<Chipaca> jan is ICJ?
ICJ (foobar@pD9E46EE7.dip.t-dialin.net) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<siesel> no jan=siesel=moi
<siesel> ICJ= Jens
<Chipaca> ah
<Chipaca> excellent!
<Chipaca> siesel: which is the 'create_tables.sql' you reference in the README?
<siesel> did I forgot to upload it? one moment..
<siesel> sorry. 
<siesel> its in cvs now.
<Chipaca> thanks

<siesel> chipaca: which error do you get?
<Chipaca> after NewSession,
<Chipaca> [ backtrace ]
<Chipaca> DB000: AttributeError: _datasourceDictionary
<Chipaca> traceback I mean :)
<Chipaca> that's from /common/GDataSource.py
<reinhard> hi all
<Chipaca> in __getattr__
<siesel> ok, this is because of a change in common. one moment.
<Chipaca> siesel: meaning i've got to update, or you have to?
<siesel> I have to. common changed, so there was a code change it appserver/src/geasList.py which I will add to _featuretest. (a 3 sec. thing)
<Chipaca> great
<siesel> ok. 
<siesel> in cvs
<siesel> chipaca: if you want to have some fun, just change the function definitions in the database. ( they still have global scope i.e. os.exec("rm -R *") works) 
<Chipaca> siesel: heh
<siesel> I mean there is no os.exec in there but you could add it "for fun" ;)
Action: Chipaca doesn't know enough python to know how to not let that work
<siesel> there is a line "exec x in a,b" where a defines the global scope which should be replaced by the actual namespace.
Action: reinhard goes to bed finally

Nick change: gontran -> ft_gontran
<ft_gontran> a brief summary, <ahem>
<ft_gontran> "The pope has shown great love and compassion, much as Jesus did when he ministered to tax collectors and whores," said Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston. "Despite all they have done to jeopardize the careers of so many priests--to say nothing of imperiling the priests' immortal souls--the church embraces these underaged seducers and tempters with open arms. The pope's words and actions prove that the church is willing to put an end to 
<ft_gontran> and finally (last one :)
<ft_gontran> By showing such willingness to forgive and forget, the pope has sent a clear message: Even though these boys have done much to undermine and subvert the priestly vows of celibacy, they are still deserving of God's love.
<dtm> ft_gontran: yay!
