<GilbertBSD> hello
<ajmitch> greetings
<GilbertBSD> how do I talk to gnebot ?
<GilbertBSD> gnuebot
<jcater> you can talk to him all you want... but he won't talk back
<jcater> he is logging only
<GilbertBSD> how do people find out what its about?
<GilbertBSD> um I mean, where does the log go to?
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/
<GilbertBSD> ah.

<siesel> morning
<siesel> hi jcater. anything new about the release? What is still to do?
<siesel> chillywilly: you here?
GilbertBSD (~gilbert@m189.max3.dacor.net) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<chillywilly> yes
<Isomer> does anyone know of any good "Free" Point-Of-Sale software?
Action: chillywilly is watching his bootleg copy of episode II ;)
<siesel> cw: I've had a look on the Feature Request pages for ZODB. 
<Isomer> Tsk Tsk
<Isomer> Naughty cw :)
<siesel> cw: There are some many important things missing....
<siesel> cw: f.e. support for RDBMS as backends, access privileges ...
<chillywilly> interesting
<chillywilly> siesel: well I have been struggling with how to do a python odmg binding as I think in python defining 'interfaces' is not a good way tot go as it is dynamically typed and you don't inherit interface in python because of that
<chillywilly> you inherit implementation
Action: chillywilly is still sorta getting used to python
<chillywilly> there's no need for abstract base classes when you have dynamic typing, imho
<siesel> yep.
<siesel> there is a new debian package called "python-extclass" or something like that. seems to be a way to implement a kind of more powerful classes. I will have a look at it later.
<siesel> bbl

<ajmitch> psu!!
<psu> hi
<ajmitch> how be you?
<psu> not so bad
<psu> mustn't grumble
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> still kicking?
<ajmitch> KC30 hasn't disappeared again?
<psu> v old political joke
<ajmitch> ok
<psu> "So why do you want to go to America, then?"
<psu> "Because there, I *can* grumble"
<psu> nope
Action: ajmitch is just a simple colonial boy at the edge of the Empire ;)
<psu> should be up later on today
<ajmitch> most excellent
Action: ajmitch looks forward to an intellignet summary of the logs with trout-slapping & other crap removed :)
<psu> well, most of the trout slapping removed
<psu> on-topic trout slapping is covered ;-)
<ajmitch> hehe
<dtm> HIGH.
<dtm> HOW ARE YOU GENTLEMEN <i>!!</i>
Action: ajmitch slaps dtm with a large smelly trout

Action: dtm configures the Troutslapper 3015's Advanced Slap-o-Matrix with an array of _small_ smelly trouts
Action: dtm decides it's peace time and goes to bed
<dtm> take care guys
<ajmitch> bye
<dtm> pray for my mom, who's in the air flying to kansas right now at the moment
<dtm> :(
<dtm> via the discount airline, Vanguard
<ajmitch> why would she go there, of all places?
<dtm> that's where we're from.  it's my cousin's graduation
<ajmitch> ah i see
<dtm> she's going to return with her newfound Californian healthy and entrepreneurial ways, and try to beat some sense into some people
<dtm> hey i just had a freaky thought..  what if my family members or someone like that, could do a google searhc for my name and somehow connect all this totally insane blather in #gnuenterprise's web log to me
<dtm> ?
<dtm> it's immortalized
<ajmitch> scary
<dtm> doesn't psu make continuous summaries of the discussions in here, and publish it to something called Kernel Cousin?
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> should be a new one up soon
<dtm> can we have the logs removed from the public after that's done? :)
<dtm> regularly?
<dtm> ;>
<dtm> i dont want alien scientists recovering our data in 3000 years and thinking that chillywilly and I bleating about nonsense is representative of our species
<dtm> of course that'd be better than much of what i've seen
<dtm> it's a dilemma that i leave for you personally to solve, ajmitch
<ajmitch> sure
<dtm> the fate of humanity's memory lies in your hands
Action: ajmitch is busy in #dotgnu
<dtm> KTHXBYE  ^_^_^_^_^
<dtm> nitey nite
