<siesel> reinhard, you here?
<reinhard> here
<siesel> I've a working setup.py for appserver.
<reinhard> saw the commit
<reinhard> cool
<siesel> but it needs a common installed to be tested. so i add the commdrivers subdir to common/setup.py
<siesel> seems to work then. 
<ajmitch> hi
<reinhard> maybe i can set up a clean install to try both setup.py's
<reinhard> hey ajmitch
<reinhard> awake again?
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> it's 11pm
<reinhard> oh
<siesel> hi ajmitch.
<siesel> I'm not so shure if I should add the changes in common/setup.py to CVS, because of the freeze.
<ajmitch> hmm
<ajmitch> where's jcater to hassle when you need him?
<siesel> The main question is if GNURPC should be included in the release.
<ajmitch> yup
<siesel> ok, i've send a mail to gnue-dev and added the patch to add it.
<siesel> reinhard: if you commit the patch from the mail, you can test the installer.
<siesel> btw. the windows installer creation with setup.py doesn't work for any of the packages. Do you know anything about that? Which installer creator is used to create the installers for gnue 1.1
<reinhard> siesel: btw could it be you forgot to attach the attachment?
<reinhard> windows installer was some extra program
<reinhard> IIRC (but not sure) it is named McMilian or like that
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> i've used it
<ajmitch> along with inno setup
<ajmitch> it's all documented in one of the dirs
<ajmitch> see forms/doc/installer/README
<reinhard> siesel: is there a photo of you in the web somewhere?
<siesel> eeh, could be...
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> let us look :)
<siesel> ok, now its your turn:
Action: ajmitch cringes
<reinhard> ajmitch: now your photo?
<ajmitch> hmm, do i have to share? ;)
Action: ajmitch hasn't seen reinhard's photo

<xeroz> hi
<xeroz> how's progress with appserserver?
<xeroz> hmm, appserver :)
<reinhard> xeroz: good progress :)
<xeroz> how good?
<reinhard> you can use appserver for remote data access
<reinhard> without methods
<reinhard> it simply passes through the data requests to the database
<reinhard> doesn't sound sooo great
<reinhard> but if we are honest then it's virtually as much as you could do with geasv1 after 2 years of development :)
<xeroz> so what's left to implement?
<reinhard> we want to do a 0.0.1 release before we implement more stuff
<reinhard> we _might_ implement conditions before 0.0.1
<reinhard> however we must wait for a gnue-common release with gnuRPC before we can release appserver
<reinhard> because appserver depends on gnuRPC
<reinhard> so if you would want to help you might simply test what we have
<reinhard> and tell us about bugs :)
<xeroz> Ok. I'm just looking at different technologies what I could use in future projects: GNUe, Zope, PHP etc...
<reinhard> ok
<xeroz> So with GNUe Windows client, how easy is it to make setup.exe with everything included?
<reinhard> for GNUe Forms we have a setup.exe in our download section IIRC
<xeroz> With current GNUe Forms one maybe needs to transfer form files to client separately, open them etc?
<ajmitch> one can also open forms specified as a URL
<xeroz> Is it possible to encrypt traffic between client and server?
<reinhard> afact not yet
<reinhard> but i will become possible with appserver
<reinhard> because gnuRPC will support it
<ajmitch> unless you run it thru an ssh tunnel, i guess ;)
<reinhard> hehe true

<siesel> I've added a VERSION string to dbdriver/appserver because you can get a bit more information by that. (nobody will know which version of common will work with which version of appserver. but having an dbdriver/appserver version which is the same as the appserver version will fix it.
