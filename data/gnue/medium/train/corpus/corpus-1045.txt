<siesel> morning
<btami> hello seisel
<ajmitch> hey
<siesel> btami: you 're changes are uploaded (py-xmlrpc.sf.net-> sf.net/projects/py....)
<btami> ok, thanks
<siesel> btami: so if you've time you can test appserver's installer again :)
<btami> i want, but waiting a logn time running defrag before
<btami> logn=long
<btami> i'm testing on win2k box
<btami> sometimes on woody
<siesel> I'm don't know how to create win32 installers, so I haven't tried win2k myself. woody should work great
<siesel> *should* :)
<btami> i don't use "installers", just python setup.py install
ignite (~ivan@hlebokom.dp.ua) joined #gnuenterprise.
<btami> i will test on woody too, but haven't installed firebird yet
<btami> it's my favorite db
<btami> becouse it's better then mysql, and have native win32 version
SachaS (~sacha@dialup-196-250.wasp.net.au) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<siesel> cool. Is it as easy to administrate as mysql?
<btami> easyest!
<siesel> how much MByte do I have to download?
<siesel>  /much/many/s
<btami> 2.5 MB
<siesel> hypercool.
<btami> http://firebird.sf.net
Action: siesel will try it after work :)
<btami> you can download a free ibadmin tool (1 MB) from ibphoenix.com too
<btami> another little help: user=SYSDBA passw=masterkey  are the defaults

<siesel> jamest, jcater: I had a look at btami's patch for dbdriver/interbase. It just adds trigger functions (similar to the ones in dbdriver/_pgsql) and won't make the basic driver getting unstable or something like that. Do you have any objection to add it to common now, or should it wait for after the freeze?    
<jcater> I've already added it
<jcater> like 4 minutes ago :)
Action: siesel has to eat more donuts to get a bit faster.. ;)
<siesel> jcater: do you have add the changes to README.database too?
<jamest> it'd be hard to exceed jcater's speed...he's an AI 
<jcater> btami: in the future, could you please submit as patches
<jcater> instead of whole files
<jcater> oops, he's gone
<siesel> btw. what is still to be done before the release of common?
<jcater> well
<jamest> i'd like to look into some issues w/ number fields (common/forms interaction)
<jcater> jamest and my lifes need to calm down
<siesel> :)
<jamest> but honestly that's looking like next weekend and I want to release so badly 
<jamest> yeah, now that we're known for working on GNUe our lives have become one non-stop party.
<jamest>  /msg jcater lies like that may help us attract more developers
<jcater>  /msg jamest well, the non-stop part is at least right
<siesel> jamest, jcater: I hope to see you again in 2-4 hours to discuss some questions about installers and the release... , just to continue that "non-stop" part ;)

<StyXman> wow! jcarter and jamest! just who I need...
<StyXman> (hello all)
<StyXman> if I develop a new widget, what exactly should I do in forms/uidrivers/_base/UIdriver.py?
Action: dneighbo hints to StyXman its cater not carter and nowing the difference will do leaps and bounds in terms of getting a response :)
<dneighbo> s/knowing/nowing
<dneighbo> StyXman probably depends on the widget
<dneighbo> if its a widget that will be fully supported by GNUe long haul it would go same place as others
<dneighbo> if its one that probably wont be i think it will be handled differently
<StyXman> dneighbo: I'm trying to understand a  GFUserInterfaceBase
<dneighbo> though im not sure provisions have been made for that as of yet
<dneighbo> i know it was discussed that we should have a way to handle widgets that might not be 'official' in a sense
<StyXman> it has the _formToUI and _formToUIWidget hashes, along with widgetConstructorFunction.
<StyXman> the latter seems what I need, but I'm not sure.

<ignite> hey are you folks ever rest ?
<dneighbo> no
<dneighbo> that would be silly
<dneighbo> sleep is for the sane
<ignite> ;)
<ignite> i read python tutorial now, handy thing
<ignite> plan to use it for prototyping
<StyXman> sleep is for the weak.
<jamest> StyXman: both are in use 
<jamest> _formToUI is the form tag to UIfoo mapping
<jamest> _formToUIWidget is the mapping to the numerous widgets that can be created by a single UIfoo instance
<jamest> UIfoo = the various forms ui entities
<StyXman> now, I'm near. I just need to reach the form. can I traverse something @ -createWidget time to reach it?
<jamest> um
<jamest> nothing in forms UI system exists w/o have a virtual forms counterpart
<jamest> so the UI is built from the form loaded in memory
<StyXman> jamest: nono, I'm trying to build a toolbar. I need the form to call createToolBar
Chipaca (~john@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<StyXman> hi chip.
<jamest> ah
<Chipaca> StyXman: yo
<jamest> call via a trigger or other?
<StyXman> I'm *amost* there.
<StyXman> trigger? no, I need it @ _createWidget time...
<jamest> ah
<jamest> right now the entire ui system is created from the gfobject tree built by the parser
<jamest> this sounds different though.....off the top of my head 
<StyXman> and my container is a panel, which I don't know why, but it's wrong.
<jamest> i'd think you could easily add a another phased init stage in the form itself
<jamest> whoops 
<jamest> scratch that
<StyXman> in the parser I explicitly said the only forms can have maintoolbar tags and the tag is 'son' of the form tag
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> and the toolbar is a gfobj based?
<StyXman> not the UIMainToolBar (or is it?)
<StyXman> (I already tried findParentOfType...)
<StyXman> I still don't know why the container is a wxPanel...
<Chipaca> why can't I specify the user in connections.conf?
<jamest> which container?
<jamest> the one created by wx or the main window in forms?
<jamest> and I don't recall a UIMainToolBar existing so this is something you added?
<StyXman> jamest: _createWindow is called with a container param. the one passed to my _cW is a wxPanel. should be a sxForm, I gues...
<StyXman> jamest: you bet.
<StyXman> Chipaca: you tired of the login screen? :)
<Chipaca> StyXman: YES
alexey_ (~alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: "Client Exiting"
Action: StyXman too
<Chipaca> StyXman: ok, I'll 'fix' it
<StyXman> I want that fix...
<StyXman> 'gnue', 'gnue'... bah...
<jamest> IIRC the wxForm contains a pannel...i think this is some kind of wx'ism
<jamest> my memory on why isn't that good :)
<Chipaca> OK, so the functionality is there (if you put _username, which is silly but still), but you never actually *check*
<StyXman> almost...
<StyXman> almost!
<StyXman> (shi-t)
<Chipaca> what's the rationale for having '_username' instead of 'username'?
<jcater> um
<jcater> because anything prefixed w/ '_'
<jcater> shouldn't be in the connectiosn.conf file
<jcater> to avoid conflicts
<jcater> it's a notation
<Chipaca> jcater: I understand that; what's the rationale of not allowing one to specify the username in connections.conf?
<jcater> we were, um, being security conscious
<jcater> you could of course add it
<jcater> but I would make GConnections.py check for 'username' and set '_username' if found
<jcater> we were planning to add netrc support iirc
<StyXman> if I have a GFForm, how do I reach the UIForm?
<Chipaca> jcater: what's netrc?
<jcater> ?
<jcater> http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-netrc.html
<Chipaca> jcater: tks
<StyXman> jcater: I can get handle of a GFForm. the form I'm child of. but I need thr UIForm...
<jcater> err
<jcater> I have no clue
<jcater> I'd have to look
<StyXman> shi-t
<Chipaca> jcater: Ok, I'll see if I can leave space for that
<jcater> we planned for the UIForm to never be seen
<jcater> so I'm not sure what you'd have to do
<Chipaca> BUG! <very loud siren>
<Chipaca> if you quit a form before the splash has gone away it *hangs* !
<jcater> err
<jcater> we know :(
<jcater> it's a wx bug
<StyXman> jcater: but the childs could need to reach the form... is there a ToolBar thing?
<jcater> toolbar thing?
<StyXman> 'cause only wxForms can make toolbars...
<Chipaca> jcater: that's easy to fix: don't show the splash
<jcater> Chipaca: there's a setting to stop it
<jamest> Chipaca: both a command line option and a gnue.conf option to shut it off for that very reason
<Chipaca> jamest: if it's buggy, shouldn't the default be off?

<Chipaca> python Q: can you put a try inside a try?
<jcater> yes
<StyXman> ok. tomorrow. bye bye. jamest: think of toolbars. they *need* the wxWindow.
<StyXman> Chipaca: !!!!
<Chipaca> StyXman: ????
<StyXman> Chipaca: obviously *yes*
<Chipaca> StyXman: why?
<StyXman> it's like a while inside a while.
<StyXman> a for inside an if.
<StyXman> a try inside a else:
<StyXman> and so on...
<StyXman> (a if inside a while inside a for inside a try inside...)
<Chipaca> StyXman: I know it *should*, but then again it should also have more than two scopes for variables, or more than one fixed initializer for classes, or ...
<StyXman> ok, bye y'all.

<Chipaca> jcater: in your opinion, should this stuf go in GConnections, or where?
<dneighbo> what is this stuff?
<dneighbo> if you mean username and such i would say that is a bad thing to do
<Chipaca> dneighbo: where then?
<Chipaca> dneighbo: or do you mean the adding of reading in username from connections.conf is bad per se?
Action: Chipaca waits...
Action: Chipaca waits some more
<jamest> i'm thinking netrc support would be a little better
<jamest> if you're putting passwords in there
<jamest> but both places have issues
<Chipaca> if it's security issues, of *course* neither is secure.
<jamest> yes, security issues
<Chipaca> but sometimes I don't really care (as in when I'm developing something and I don't have a password on the database in my closed LAN)
<jamest> putting it in connections.conf you have to have that file readable to the world
<jamest> at least in netrc it only has to be readable to the user of forms
<jamest> er
<jamest> that came out wrong
<Chipaca> jamest: agreed. Is that a reason not to let the user do it if she knows what she's doing?
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> jamest: I understood it anyways
<jamest> i'm really not for or against it
<jamest> i think i was the one looking at adding netrc support for some of my users 
Action: Chipaca thinks having forms authenticate against the databse sucks, anyways
<jamest> yes
<jamest> but
<jamest> it's all we have at this time
<Chipaca> I wonder why dneighbo didn't answer; i'm really interested in having all the cons 
<Chipaca> dneighbo: PING
<Chipaca> jamest: Ok, I'll add netrc and up the diff to gnue-dev
<jamest> Chipaca: dneighbo, jcater, and myself are at our "real jobs" right now
<jamest> so IRC is very, very low priority
<jamest> :(
<jcater> Chipaca: but to answer to your question, *if* it were added to connections.conf, then GConnections.py is the place to add it
<Chipaca> jamest: this *is* my 'real' job :D
Action: Chipaca loves working for free software
<Chipaca> jcater: what about netrc? it seems to fit in exactly here <points>
<Chipaca> hmm
Action: Chipaca hmms
<Chipaca> should netrc override connections, or viceversa?
<jamest> i would think that netrc would override connections
<jamest> so the user could override the system default
<jamest> i guess ;)
<Chipaca> jamest: Ok, works for me
<Chipaca> jamest: I'm thinking about how to specify the hostname
<Chipaca> jamest: I think it should probably something like gnue://host/provider/dbname/
<Chipaca> jamest: which leaves me with this ugly feeling of netrc not being the right place for it :)

<dneighbo> sorry busy :(
<dneighbo> i say if you want to hard code it
<dneighbo> use command line parameters
<dneighbo> and alias you shell to always fire those
<dneighbo> so you do say
<dneighbo> frmdev
<dneighbo> or something
<Chipaca> dneighbo: i think that's ugly :)
<dneighbo> which aliases gfcvs -u chipaca -p mymomma 
<dneighbo> or whatever
<Chipaca> dneighbo: I'd say there is a place for that too, but I still would rather have this functionality in
<dneighbo> its not uglier than putting it in connections.conf
Action: dneighbo thinks its not a good idea to hard code at all
<Chipaca> dneighbo: it's not hard codeing nuthin'
<dneighbo> if you put it in your connections.conf you are hardcoding it
<Chipaca> dneighbo: no, if you put it in Connections.py you're hardcofing it
Action: dneighbo cant see where its that big of a deal to log in every time
<Chipaca> dneighbo: if you put it in your text configuration file, it's the UNIX way
<dneighbo> i would rather see someone work on integration instead
<dneighbo> where it uses your system login first
<Chipaca> dneighbo: I'm scratching my itch :)
<dneighbo> and only if that fails does it prompt
<Chipaca> dneighbo: that comes next ]:)
pattieja (~pattieja@www.pcxperience.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> dneighbo: in fact no, that's wrong :/
<dneighbo> as that is a much better solution to not wanting to have to login :)
<dneighbo> i agree
Action: pattieja is away: I'm busy
<Chipaca> dneighbo: the right way is, in your connections.conf, define a say _auth connection which tells forms how to auth the user
<dneighbo> i think with ERP type applications you shoudl be challenged regardless and never trusted
Action: pattieja is away: I'm busy
<dneighbo> i suppose tehre is no evil in letting connections.conf do it
Action: pattieja is back (gone 00:00:04)
<dneighbo> as its optional
<dneighbo> i just dont like to encourage it
<dneighbo> i.e. if it itches i say scratch it if jamest/jcater dont have issues with it
<dneighbo> but in documentation and elsewhere it should state hey fooey bad idea
<dneighbo> i think a good compromise might be 'remembered' userids
<dneighbo> by machine
<dneighbo> so if i come in and login as dneighbo
<dneighbo> next time i fire up forms
<dneighbo> dneighbo is automatically entered into the user field
<dneighbo> and just have to type my password
<dneighbo> but if im not dneighbo i just type my userid and password
<dneighbo> its not what i 'like', but i could see the lazy wanting it
<dneighbo> its common in many systems

<reinhard> not to mention the mad goats ;)
<jamest> those goats get around
<reinhard> jamest: it's like a disease :)
<reinhard> it's a long weekend here from thursday to sunday

<chillywilly> what is netrc?
<yogurt2unge> chillywilly: http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-netrc.html
<reinhard> siesel: btw yes sabine is my wife :)
<dneighbo> bastards done gone and documented things again
<dneighbo> sigh
<yogurt2unge> chillywilly: jcater's answer
<nickr> documentation!?
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=151394&forum_id=3742
Action: chillywilly thinks that is a funny email
<siesel> reinhard: congratulations.
<reinhard> thanks :)
<reinhard> she keeps telling me it's a bad photo
<reinhard> btw you all heard the story about BMW 7 cars not working correctly due to a bug in the car's software?
<siesel> I haven't met a woman, who knows about a good photo of herself.
<reinhard> siesel: lol
<chillywilly> hehe
<aprono> How do I do to add an image in a button?

<reinhard> night all
reinhard (~rm@M693P012.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: "Anything is good and useful if it's made of chocolate"
<jamest> in a forms button?
<jamest> that isn't supported 
<Chipaca> how do you do it on the toolbar then?
<jamest> ah
<jamest> in wx it's not a problem
<chillywilly> toolbar is hardcoded I think
<jamest> yes
<jamest> forms gfd doesn't support graphical buttons at this time
<aprono> jamest: can i bind a keypress to a trigger?
<yogurt2unge> there are a lot stuff harcoded
<Chipaca> yogurt2unge: that's an understatement
<jamest> aprono: at one time this was possible but i'd have to look in the code to see if it still is
<jamest> it should be supported
<jamest> things like the toolbar are hardcoded until we find the time to replace with more dynamic setup
<jamest> alot of things are also hardcoded to fit the design goal of forms
<jamest> we are not building a glade
<yogurt2unge> In the gdf file must be a flag or something like to activate or not the toolbar
<Chipaca> yogurt2unge: I thing StyXman had that working before he left (or almost)
<jamest> the toolbar is always on right now
<Chipaca> jamest: not in StyXman's tree
<yogurt2unge> jamest: yep
<Chipaca> :)
<jamest> ah

<Chipaca> siesel: he's dead, jim
<chillywilly> [17:03:40] <-- jamest has quit ("[x]chat")
Action: siesel has to go to the ophthalmologist
<chillywilly> I would say ust add it to top-level TODO
<chillywilly> s/ust/just
<chillywilly> there's stuff in there about db drivers
<chillywilly> no reason rpc stuff can't be in there
<siesel> it is twice the size of that toplevel TODO ... so I don't dare
<chillywilly> heh
<siesel> btw. I've added " add an basic example on how to write new commdrivers"
<chillywilly> ok

<dneighbo> siesel none of the above it should go into DCL
<dneighbo> i plan on making TODO's generated from DCL
<siesel> cool.
<siesel> then nobody has to care for removing already done entries out of an TODO
<yogurt2unge> bye
yogurt2unge (~charlie@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<dneighbo> well i suppose until i officially make it work its up to the maintainers if they choose to keep fresh TODO's
<dneighbo> my goal is to get to point where we have somewhere more 'accountable' and better for project management to handle tasks and roadmaps
<dneighbo> and that we generate static files from that data
<dneighbo> maybe im too idealistic in that fashion though
<Chipaca> time to go

<chillywilly> protocol
<ajmitch> someone *please* kickban chillywilly2, for the children's sake... ;)
<ajmitch> haven't updated forms for a few days here
<ajmitch> dneighbo: is all the DCL stuff you've been doing in cvs?
<siesel> yes
Action: ajmitch rebuilds pnet
<chillywilly2> help
<chillywilly2> more than one word
<chillywilly> yay!

<chillywilly> :dneighbo!~dneighbo@tmp-200253.flinthills.com PRIVMSG #gnuenterprise :ajmitch um nope not the reporting stuff

<ajmitch> ok

<chillywilly> no fun
<ajmitch> chillywilly: is that necessary?
<chillywilly> yes, deal with it
<chillywilly> it is for gnue-related work
<ajmitch> you need to do CTCP, iirc, which is 0x01ACTION
Action: ajmitch groans
<ajmitch> an irc gnurpc driver?

<chillywilly> whatever

<chillywilly> blah
<chillywilly> I forgot the colon
<ajmitch> umm, no, you can't just type it in like that
<chillywilly> no shit

<ajmitch> run ethereal while you're on irc, and find out
<ajmitch> in a private channel, preferably :)
<chillywilly> why does it come across as a ':' ?
Action: ajmitch shrugs
<chillywilly> why do I need the ascii value?
Action: ajmitch points chillywilly to #irccrackhouse
<chillywilly> that's lame
<siesel> dneighbo: which oddities do you get? I just have problems with forms searching 'gnue/shared/images/shared/images/gnue-splash.png' even if I add an -nosplash option.
<ajmitch> ah, found the dcl stuff
Action: siesel kicks a stale gnue.conf file. bug fixed
<dneighbo> siesel im running 0516 cvs
<dneighbo> i am trying to close a bug for btami
<dneighbo> and to test i created a form in designer that had a single entry
<dneighbo> no datasources and it failes to run
<dneighbo> i thought it was because it didnt have datasources
<dneighbo> so i added a dummy one and that failed
<dneighbo> added some values to it and still failed
<dneighbo> so thought might have designer issue
<dneighbo> i ran intro.gfd and it failed
<dneighbo> i ran a form with good datasources and it worked
<dneighbo> so i submitted a bug to DCL
<dneighbo> i think this may have come up and is fixed in cvs but not easy to verify from here
<dneighbo> and i dont want to forget
<siesel> btami said something about a ticket 3X which is already fixed.
<siesel> but I would prefere to have these test gfds in a special directory to allow a quite complete testing before a new release
