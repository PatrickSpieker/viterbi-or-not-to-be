<frayed> jcater: it's definitely worth looking at.  Are there design documents attached to it?  The idea is that if it provides a good enough framework for us to start with, we'll be more than happy to work on it too.
Action: dsmith isn't up on ldap, but wan't to be
<jcater> frayed: the schema files exist :)
<jcater> does that count?
<jcater> actually, derek has done most of the stuff in there
<jcater> he is swamped at work being the beginning of the year
<chillywilly> it's not too huge
<jcater> so he's hard to catch
<chillywilly> even I can grokk the schema
<chillywilly> ;)
<frayed> small business doesn't need much.  :)
<jcater> but you won't hurt our feelings if it isn't far enough along :)
<frayed> I'll beat on it tonight for awhile then and see what I come up with.  I was going to work on a personal finance app with GNUe.
<jcater> ooooooo
<jcater> I've wanted to do that
<frayed> jcater: all that matters is that the schema is "good enough" for us.  :)
<jcater> Im working on a rental property management app myself
<jcater> well
<frayed> jcater: I would *so* like to get rid of Quicken right now.  I watched my wife rdp into the windows box to use IE to play games.
<jcater> haven't touched it since november
<jcater> but I *am* working on it, darn it!
Action: jcater keeps telling myself that
<chillywilly> suuure ;)
<frayed> crap, what am I supposed to use from cvs to run a .gpd file?
<jcater> gnue-navigator
Action: frayed hasn't bothered creating a database yet, so is expecting to fail.  :)
<jcater> though you can run the forms files directly
<frayed> command not found
<jcater> err
<jcater> gncvs?
<jcater> ooooo
<jcater> are you running against cvs head?
<frayed> DB000: gnue.common.GParser.MarkupError: Error processing <process> tag [I do not recognize the "description" attribute
<frayed> yes?  :)
<jcater> gnue-sb hasn't been upgraded to the new API
<jcater> why... I'm not sure
<jcater> but it is still running against the releases
<ajmitch> ah yes, must produce patches for 0.4.x & wxpython 2.4
<frayed> aha.  Maybe I should back off versions a bit anyway.  Designer is very unstable under the new API, but I don't know if it's just generally unstable or not.
<ajmitch> jcater: when do you think wx 2.4 might be required for designer? 0.6.x
<ajmitch> ?
<jcater> ajmitch: read the channel topic
<ajmitch> hmm, right
<jcater> ajmitch: probably
<frayed> I suppose I should update or back off.  heh.
<ajmitch> good to see someone's been working (unlike me) :)
<jcater> frayed: yeah, cvs is really being pounded on
<jcater> so for a little while, it may not be ideal for general usage :)
<frayed> how are the other modules for wx 2.4 compatibility right now?
<chillywilly> the 'compatibility' is a one liner or so
<chillywilly> ;P
<jcater> afaik, all the other tools were fine
<frayed> ok.  is there an easy way uninstall the cvs copy I installed, in order to downgrade to the latest stable releases?
<ajmitch> jcater: frayed even volunteered to help with docs! :)
<chillywilly> has there been any commits to cvs cause I don't think I have gotten a commit email in a while and I am wondering what's up with my setup
<jcater> chillywilly: yes, at least 2 today
<chillywilly> hmmm
<jcater> frayed: no need to uninstall
<jcater> http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/gnue-dev/2002-11/msg00033.html
<jcater> btw, gnu.org NEEDS to set up apache mod_rewrites to automatically forward old-style mailing list URLs to the new style
<jcater> this is getting ridiculous
<jcater> frayed: add to that list
<jcater> cd common
<jcater> cvs update -r common-0-4-1-branch
Action: jcater forgot that in this particular email
<frayed> I've got you.  Are those the only 3 components I need to worry about?  I'm still a little fuzzy on the architecture...
<jcater> yeah
<chillywilly> hmmm, I think I forgot to run fetchmail
<chillywilly> after my server reboot
<chillywilly> er, the last one
<chillywilly> woah
<chillywilly> getting butt loads of email
<frayed> lemme guess, you're running an NT server?
Action: ajmitch claps
Action: frayed dodges
<ajmitch> lol
<chillywilly> frayed: uh, no
<ajmitch> frayed: so where are you based?
<chillywilly> Debian GNU/Linux testing
<frayed> seattle (in the backyard of the beast)
<ajmitch> ah
<ajmitch> lucky fella
<chillywilly> frayed: I was rebooting it to make sure some things were setup correctly cause, unlike NT, the only reason my server went down was a hardware failure
<frayed> heh, there's not as much Microsoft sentiments around here as I thought there'd be.  But people are genuinely afraid not to run MS software.
<frayed> chillywilly: aha, I get you.  For a new guy like me, though, the two sentences sounded, well...
<chillywilly> I had to make sure GRUB was installed correctly
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> and that the network interfaces would come up on boot up
<chillywilly> well I suppose I didn't HAVE to
<chillywilly> but I did anyway
<frayed> you know, I've never gotten GRUB to work, for some reason.
<jcater> nor have I
<frayed> hey dude, the reason GNU/LInux servers last so damn long is because we double-check our work.  :)
<jcater> I always decide, "eh, lilo works..."
<chillywilly> I install it form a boot disk usually
<chillywilly> from
<chillywilly> grub boot floppy
<ajmitch> that reminds me, i have to disable the default route on eth0 coming up at bootup :)
<frayed> I've been pretty happy with lilo, but I'm interested in that HURD kernel, and I understand lilo won't boot it.
<chillywilly> it is quirky though
<ajmitch> had a power cut today :(
Action: ajmitch boots his gnu/hurd box beside him...
<chillywilly> The experience of Napster shows that we should also permit

<frayed> same error.  gnue-sb
<jcater> I'd recommand not using the gpd and using the gfd's by themselves
<jcater> :)
<ajmitch> frayed: no, what were you using to load it?
<jcater> I better go to bed
<ajmitch> heh, night jcater
<frayed> I just did the instructions in the post that jcater had me read
<frayed> gnue-navigator
<ajmitch> ok
<frayed> night jcater
<jcater> heh, funny story....
<jcater> last night at about 11:00 my time
<jcater> I feel like it should be 4:00 am or so
<jcater> so I go to bed
<jcater> only to realize that it is 4:00 am or so
<jcater> my son, before I got home
<jcater> had changed my KClock to use Moscow time
<ajmitch> hehe
<jcater> and that's the only clock in my office
<ajmitch> :)
<jcater> so I am really tired tonight
<jcater> :)
<frayed> looks like you need an atomic clock
<jcater> frayed: it updates the time nightly against the naval time service
<jcater> so I usually trust it
<jcater> he just changed my displayed timezone :)
jcater (~jason@cpe-066-061-083-220.midsouth.rr.com) left irc: "sleep"
<frayed> every reason to.  :)  The advantage to these atomic clocks they sell is that you can hang them on the wall out of kids' reach
<frayed> too slow, I was
<chillywilly> that is funny
<frayed> what's a .gsd file, and what do I do with it?
<chillywilly> it's xml markup schema file
<chillywilly> ideally you should translate it to sql with the gnue tools for whatever database you're gonna use
<chillywilly> however, I am not sure that is working right now
<frayed> I discovered that much.  There's an Oracle and Postgres .sql file for creating the database, but no MySQL file
<chillywilly> probably cause mysql isn't too popular around these parts ;)
<chillywilly> in gnue/common/utils there some scripts
<ajmitch> we're talking about databases
<ajmitch> not toys
<chillywilly> be nice ajmitch ;)
<frayed> yeah, well, my real database doesn't work.  ;)
<frayed> trouble getting Postgres to start, which was my first choice.  Since MySQL started, I'm using it right now.
<frayed> when/if we do this, we'll likely setup a dedicated database server with Postgres, because my partner doesn't like MySQL either
<ra3vat> frayed: *  ~/bin/gcvs ~/cvs/gnue/common/src/schema/scripter/Scripter.py schema.gsd postgresql > PgSQL/schema.sql 
<ra3vat> is how to make sql
<frayed> presumable I change "postgresql" to "mysql"?

<ajmitch> yeah, that's a small useful feature :)
<SachaS> if you have a fast connection, only
<frayed> LAN :)
<ajmitch> more so if it's on the local network
<SachaS> otherwise its (X) verrrry slow
<ajmitch> vnc is usable over 128kbps line :)
<ajmitch> even usable on 56k :)
<frayed> ok, I've got postgres running now.  I believe it will continue to run even if I reboot, but I'm not going to reboot to test it.  :P
<chillywilly> are you making fun of me?
<chillywilly> cause if you are you will be beaten senseless by fishies
<frayed> no.  Well, yes.  But also because my server doesn't boot reliably the first time.  I think there's some bad memory in it, and I haven't fixed it.
<frayed> every couple of weeks it kernel panics for no reason....  I'm starting to feel like an NT administrator again.  :(
<chillywilly> you need to get some freakin' ram
<chillywilly> are you waiting for an invitation?!?
<chillywilly> ;)
<frayed> I did, and that's the problem.  I think the motherboard itself is broke and will only let me use one stick, and one specific stick in one specific slot
<frayed> But if I do that, then I can only have 32MB.
<chillywilly> blah
<chillywilly> rofl
<chillywilly> this weightloss infomercial came on and this lady is supposed to be a weightloss expert and she's like a big fat thing
<chillywilly> wtf
<frayed> expected.  After having kids I noticed that everyone around me that didn't have kids were experts on how to take care of them.
<chillywilly> true dat
<frayed> when my wife and I were split up, all the single men around me were experts on how to handle a marriage and get laid.
<frayed> oh yeah, and for some reason, BSA accountants and managers are experts on how to build and administer servers.  Riddle me that one.
<frayed> er, BSA = BA

<chillywilly> man I am kinda tired

<frayed> check your locale setting, dude...
<chillywilly> most managers and suits are incompetent
<chillywilly> I know what time it is
<chillywilly> 1am
<frayed> is not.  It's 11pm.
<chillywilly> no it's 1am CST
<chillywilly> damnit ;)
<ajmitch> is 8pm
<frayed> if I edit my postgres pg_hba file, do I have to restart the server?  (I know that sounds dumb, but you don't have to restart samba...)
<chillywilly> yes you do
<ajmitch> can't recall, i usually did :)
<chillywilly> so samba unnecessarily reads the config file everytime it does something?
<frayed> aha, do a kill-HUP to it, or run pg_ctl reload
<SachaS> bye
<chillywilly> or /etc/ini.d/postgresql restart
<chillywilly> inti.d
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-198.wasp.net.au) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<frayed> no, it just reads it every minute, I believe.  Remember, they're trying to make it act like an NT server.
<chillywilly> blah
<chillywilly> init.d!!!
<chillywilly> whew
<chillywilly> that's is so lame
<chillywilly> NT admins are that lazy?
<frayed> no, NT admins reboot everytime they open the command line.
<frayed> The idea is that it does unnecessary work.  ;)
<chillywilly> yaaay
<chillywilly> I wanna read the config file every second
<chillywilly> hell I wanna rrad it so often that I never actually finish reading it
<chillywilly> it needs to be in a perpetual state of startup
<chillywilly> that would r0x0r
<frayed> I had an app that did that.  Ran it on an old UNICOS system, when the system was brand new.  couldn't figure out how to kill it,
<frayed> so I logged out.
<frayed> Next day I had an email from the administrator saying "do it again and your account will be terminated"
<frayed> I decided not to write back and say "That was a feature, not a bug"

<frayed> good evening
<ajmitch_> ugh
<btami> how goes frayed?
<frayed> aking progress, if I can just figure out how to get postgres to let me connect to it
<chillywilly> you setup your pg_hba.conf yet?
<frayed> that's what I'm working on right now.
<frayed> host    all     192.168.0.0     255.255.255.0   password
<chillywilly> password authentication for all private IPs?
<chillywilly> hmmm
<frayed> yeah, wireless NAT router
<ajmitch_> ah right
<chillywilly> I am just thinking whether you need to specify the bits
<ajmitch_> then you need a password file
Action: ajmitch_ used to have similar, with this:
<chillywilly> erm, or add the person to pg_password
<ajmitch_> host    all     192.168.0.0     255.255.255.0   password passwords
<chillywilly> the admin guide is helpful

<btami> Connecting to PostgreSQL without TCP/IP
<chillywilly> yea, that only helps if it's the sam machine right?

<ajmitch> i found out a couple of weeks ago
<chillywilly> shut the hell up ajmitch
<ajmitch> fine
<chillywilly> I read the whole frellin admin guide last week or so
<frayed> I changed it to "trust" just to see if it would work, and it still didn't connect.  Hmm........
<chillywilly> so lick me
<chillywilly> is it running with -i?
<chillywilly> to enable tcp/ip
<frayed> umm........
<chillywilly> there's an option somewhere
<chillywilly> in one of the configs
<chillywilly> lemme see if I can find it real quick
<chillywilly> tcpip_socket = 1
<frayed> no?
<chillywilly> in postgresql,conf
<chillywilly> .conf
<frayed> hm, added it to the command line, still no
<chillywilly> turn it on in the config file
<frayed> still no, but the config file had every line commented.  So much for default installation, eh?
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> debian default turns tcp/ip on
<chillywilly> do you have a /var/log/postgresql.log file?
<frayed> there's a postgresql directory there, but I have to su to get to it.  Just did that and waiting for authentication (doesn't normally take this long...)
<frayed> I lied, it's a text file, it's just empty
<frayed> no log there
<chillywilly> hmmm
Action: ajmitch sobs
<chillywilly> can you connect locally?
<chillywilly> what's wrong ajmitch?

<chillywilly> ajmitch: ok ;)
<chillywilly> ajmitch: sounds like fun

<frayed> crap, I forget how to specify a port with telnet.

<reinhard> frayed: does postmaster run with -i option?
<chillywilly> I asked him that ;)
<frayed> reinhard: unable to determine for sure?  :)  yes.  I'm certain.
<reinhard> oh sorry

<chillywilly> erm
<chillywilly> that's not what I wanted to paste
<chillywilly> tcp        0      0 *:postgres              *:*                     LISTEN
<chillywilly> my postmaster doesn't even show any options for some reason
<frayed> no postgres listed

<chillywilly> hmmm
<frayed> 23779 ?        S      0:00 postmaster -D /var/postgres
<chillywilly> so first thing you need to get it to listen for tcp/ip
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> no -i
<frayed> yep, looks like it
<frayed> if a firewall were blocking it (I don't think there is) would it still show listening in netstat?
<chillywilly> sure
<chillywilly> but no one would be able to connect
<chillywilly> what distro is this?
<frayed> psql: FATAL 1:  Database "dave" does not exist in the system catalog.
<chillywilly> it tries to connect to a db named as the user by default
<chillywilly> tell it to connect to template1
<frayed> mandrake 9.0, with an already known broken installation of postgres.  I went digging in the postgres docs to figure out how to make the database files
<chillywilly> psql -h host template1
<frayed> psql: FATAL 1:  user "dave" does not exist
<chillywilly> you have to give it a valid user
<frayed> pg_ctl restart -D /var/postgres -o '-i'
<chillywilly> also ;)
<chillywilly> and unless you added one
<frayed> that was the command line that finally got it to do this.  :)
<chillywilly> postgres is th eonly user
<frayed> I thought I'd added one.  I just want the administrative console, that's all.  heh.
<chillywilly> login as pstgres
<chillywilly> psql -U postgres -h host template1
<chillywilly> IIRC
<frayed> something like that, I got it
<chillywilly> yaaaay
<frayed> *phew*
<frayed> now I should create a user and grant him rights to some database, right?  :)
<chillywilly> sure
<frayed> got that done.  phew, this thing's picky isn't it?  won't take a password wrapped in double quotes, has to be single quotes
<chillywilly> yea
<frayed> this is cool.  thanks a lot dude, it's running.  now I don't have to worry about making the schema for gnue-sb in mysql.  :)
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> now the rest of the fellas won't give you a hard time ;)
<frayed> do these schema files typically make the database too, or do I create the database first and then run it?
<chillywilly> ummmm
Action: frayed is relieved not to get a hard time over a stinkin' testbed database server.
<chillywilly> pretty sure you need to have a db
<chillywilly> then you can do a psql < file.sql
<chillywilly> or whatnot
<chillywilly> the schema is just tables and such...erm AFAIK maybe there's syntax for creating a db, but I dunno not that I recall
Action: chillywilly gets off his lazy a$$ and looks
<chillywilly> silly open office files
<frayed> I think not, since postgres won't let you login without specifying a db
<chillywilly> there's an OOo document that explains the format
<chillywilly> right but you can alway connect to temaplate one and still issues create database foo;
<chillywilly> but I don't think the schema stuff covers creating a db
<frayed> well, I did it.  I wonder exactly what it did now.....  :)
<chillywilly> you loaded an sql file?
<chillywilly> btw, GNUe Integrator should handle doing this kinda stuff eventually
<chillywilly> but that's not being developed currently
<frayed> I loaded the schema.sql file for gnue-sb
<chillywilly> also converting between formats and priming the pump with data
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> try the forms?
<chillywilly> are there forms?
<frayed> all the tables are there.  :)  This is beautiful.
<chillywilly> it's been a while since I looked at it
<frayed> there are forms, but first I have to create the connection.  ;)
<chillywilly> right
<chillywilly> in connections.conf
<frayed> I'm starting to understand why it was always so hard to get nt admins to evaluate the software I used to sell them.  heh.
<chillywilly> also
<chillywilly> designer will do db intrspection and lket you build forms on an exisitng database
<chillywilly> erm, if you cna parse that ;)
<frayed> i grokked it.  :)
<chillywilly> existing db and their tables
<chillywilly> why was it hard to get nt admins to evaluate software?
<chillywilly> btw, you could alos write a script that connects, creates a db, and then load the sql file
<chillywilly> we have examples like that in cvs all over the place
<frayed> it was hard because they had to setup a database first, and frequently had to install the server software.  It was the nature of the stuff I was selling.
<chillywilly> HEH
<chillywilly> Lord forbid they should have to do that! ;)
<chillywilly> where's the setup.exe?!?
<chillywilly> omg!!!
<frayed> no shit.  of course, if the software had been good software, it would've been ODBC compliant and allowed them to just point it at an access db.
<chillywilly> the world is coming to and end!!!
<chillywilly> aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!
<chillywilly> true
<chillywilly> dat
<frayed> um, how do I make a connection to point at my postgres installation now?  :)
<frayed> hmm....  I'm probly missing a python module or 3, come to think of it.
<chillywilly> where do you have gnue installed?
<chillywilly>  /usr/local/gnue ?
<frayed> yeah
<chillywilly> go into the etc subdir at that spot
<chillywilly> edit connections.conf
<frayed> did that, and hacked in.  um, here's the error message I've got right now.
<frayed> Error: No database driver found for provider type 'psycopg'
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> install psycopg :)
<chillywilly> python mod
<frayed> that's what I was just thinking.....  :)
<chillywilly> like you said ;)
<ajmitch> or use another one
<chillywilly> psycopg is good
<chillywilly> erm
<chillywilly> with one catch i think
<chillywilly> a certain version doesn't work
<chillywilly> like the lastest one
Action: chillywilly wishes jcater were here
<chillywilly> possibly mandrake doesn't have that one yet
<chillywilly> it broke in debian sid
<frayed> ah well, I'll try it and see what happens.  um, i just downloaded the tarball.....
<chillywilly> (unstable development debian)
<chillywilly> no rpm?
<frayed> didn't even look.  maybe I should.....
<chillywilly> I thought mandrake had the wonderful urpmi ;P
<chillywilly> apt-like package thing
<frayed> mandrake does, and it's wonderful up to a certain point.
Action: chillywilly hugs apt-get
<chillywilly> we are also debian "promoters" here....but it's not to support and have someone using a different distros
<frayed> I'm ready to throw in mandrake and run debian, actually.  I just don' t have the time to do it.  :(
<chillywilly> hehe
<frayed> ok, I went and ran drakconf, which is actually a sweet little program.
Action: chillywilly looks at ajmitch and thinks back to the days when he used to run mandrake
Action: ajmitch luvs mandrake!
<chillywilly> riiiiight ;)
Action: ajmitch rm -rf's debian
<chillywilly> ajmitch: you know more about debian than I now
<chillywilly> being a mad packaging fewl
<ajmitch> heh
Action: ajmitch tired
<frayed> drakconf didn't get cool until 9.0, and it still bugs in a few spots....
<chillywilly> are you looking for a deb?
<chillywilly> did you install 0.4.x tarball of gnue?
<chillywilly> erm, rpm
<chillywilly> I mean
<frayed> me?  no.
<chillywilly> I think I screwed up
<frayed> well, originally.  Then I had to install the cvs to get it working with wxPython 2.4.  Then I backed it off to the 0.4.x from cvs when jcater told me to earlier.  :)
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> that makes sense
<frayed> or rather, he said there's been patches applied to 0.4.x so it works with wxPython 2.4
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> there was an 'import string' that was forgotten in the designer code
<chillywilly> that's the big PATCH ;)
<chillywilly> wxpython used to import it ina  certain place
<frayed> luckily for me there's no PostgreSQL headers on the system, and no PostgreSQL headers package.
<chillywilly> so no one noticed
<chillywilly> until now
<chillywilly> get the -devel package?
<frayed> not one, or if there is, it isn't installed.
<frayed> *think think*
<frayed> you can install just the headers from the postgre tarball, right?
<chillywilly> erm, I mean go get it man! ;P
Action: frayed thinks he read that a few minutes ago
<chillywilly> -devel rpms are the safest
<frayed> I just looked for it
<frayed> I'm taking another look, though
<frayed> *phew*
<frayed> ok, the devel package is already installed.  I'm glad that's settled.
<chillywilly> hmmm
Action: frayed laughs
<frayed> I just need to find the headers, I can pass it to the configure script when I know where they are :)
<chillywilly> I think 1.0.13 is the version that is b0rked
<chillywilly> what do you have?
<frayed> 1.0.14
<frayed> now it needs the mxDateTime.h file.  I swear I installed that already
<chillywilly> right
<chillywilly> I hate rpms
<chillywilly> did I mention that?!? ;P
<chillywilly> rpms are the devil!
<frayed> I'm going to see if there's an rpm for that right now.  :)
<chillywilly> I can't believe there's no damn psycopg rpm for mandrake
<chillywilly> well I don't see one on rpmfind.net
<chillywilly> I love debian
Action: chillywilly hugs debian
<frayed> I wouldn't trust it either.  Since they went to gcc 3.2 all previous rpms are now broke, officially.
<frayed> maybe I didn't install it at all......  hmm.....
<btami> why not use postgresql's own python driver package, i can't recall the correct name
<frayed> eh?  idk....
<chillywilly> they even have debs on the psycopg site
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> well yea you can try something else if you want
<frayed> whatever you do, cw, don't tell me to count all the time I spend dealing with rpm and compare it to the time it would take to change to debian
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> I left rpm hell long time ago
<chillywilly> and I'm a better person for it ;)
<chillywilly> or something
<frayed> ok, I just now installed the egenix-mx package from source, and the ./configure script still didn't find it
<chillywilly> didn't find what?
<frayed> mxDateTime is in the egenix package, right?
<chillywilly> dunno but that sounds pretty right
<frayed> btami: how would I configure a connection in gnue using postgres's python driver?  Not knowing is the reason I'm not doing...  ;)
<chillywilly> python2.2-egenix-mxdatetime - Date and time handling routines for Python 2.2
<chillywilly> guess so ;)
<chillywilly> you need to know the name and there has to be a gnue driver for it
<chillywilly> it might be called postgresql
<frayed> checking if curiosity killed the cat... yes

<chillywilly> subversions
<chillywilly> damnit

<frayed> wow, changed the provider to postgresql and got something.  Login prompt, anyway.  :)
<frayed> haha, kick ass
<frayed> it works.  :)
<chillywilly> cool, yea that seems to be a driver that you don't need any special python modules for
<chillywilly> reinhard: tee

<chillywilly> one sec
<chillywilly> hmmm, maybe that won't work
<chillywilly> it's too frellin' lat reinhard ;)

<chillywilly> that seems pretty rad
<jcater> chillywilly: yes
<jcater> that's why I've been waiting impatiently for 3.1
<jcater> since 2.2
<jcater> as I knew that was coming
<chillywilly> so now you can connect to your users desktops right? ;)
<jcater> yeah
<chillywilly> hrrrm, but do you need to deploy kde 3.1 now?
<chillywilly> on every machine?
<jcater> ha
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> both of them
<chillywilly> heh
<jcater> (2 ltsp servers)
<jcater> that's why I love an ltsp setup
<chillywilly> jcater: is there a way to tell konq to open a url in another tab like you cna with galeon?
<jcater> there is a setting "Open new windows in a tab"
<jcater> that does it all the time
<jcater> otherwise, you have to right-click the link and select Open in Tab
Action: jcater wishes they'd have a 3rd option.... middle-click to open in tab
<chillywilly> well
<chillywilly> I mean for my xchat url handlers I'd like to have a "open in a tab" for konq

<chillywilly> man my foot hurts
<Chipaca> does gnue use more than one connection to the database per form?
<jcater> no
<jcater> unless you are connecting to multiple databases
<Chipaca> not even if there are multiple datasources?
<jcater> correct
<chillywilly> why wouldn't you want to reuse the connection?
<chillywilly> I want konq to import my galeon bookmarks
<jcater> afaiac, we do want to reuse the connection
<jcater> as it provides an implicit transactional mechanism
<jcater> that was a distinct design decision
<Chipaca> the question was because we have seen behaviour that seems to imply otherwise
<Chipaca> i.e. in a master-slave relation whith which we can't use the master-slave infrastructure gnue gives us
<ra3vat> jcater: can you help with an example of using gnue common for standalone apps?
<Chipaca> (if you need more detail on that one, I'd have to call on aprono)
<jcater> ra3vat: have you looked at common's Developer's Guide?
<jcater> it has an example on using gnue-common in a script
<ra3vat> ok, will look again
<ra3vat> oh, i mostly looked at the Forms' one
<ra3vat> do we have rpm packages for gnue tools?
<ra3vat> no one here likes rpms
<jcater> yeah, I thought so
<jcater> someone contributed them a week or so ago

<jcater> (man, time flies)
<ra3vat> where to find them?
<ra3vat> i need to look on a spac file

<frayed> hmmm, maybe I should go get on the mailing list are bring this up here.  What it amounts to is that we want to work on the stuff that's
<ajmitch> that's...?
<frayed> intended to be bundled with GNUe to give it that beautiful out-of-the-box quality it's lacking right now.
<frayed> and we want to do so in such a way that GNUe either adopts it as we do it, or they work with us to make it to their satisfaction (and ours)
<ajmitch> ah, that would be very good
<frayed> and the end-result is a codebase we don't necessarily have to worry about making a long-term commitment to, because GNUe has it.
<ajmitch> then definitely jump on the mailing lists
<frayed> in short, if our business fails, we'd drop out of development to pursue something else.  :)
<ajmitch> heh ok
<frayed> well, I'm gonna go and get on the lists now and bring this up there.  :)  later...

<chillywilly> hi derek
<derek> sup chillywilly
<derek> wow someone has been touching reports
<chillywilly> gee I wonder who
<chillywilly> I should checkout 0.4.x branch

hoppy (~hoppy@cs242221-114.houston.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<hoppy> anybody got a few minutes to spend with a newbie?
<chillywilly> maybe ;)
<hoppy> I'm basically wanting to get started taking a look at this, but haven't really a clue what it is I'm trying to get started.  Is there a good "getting started" floating around?
<chillywilly> ummmm, no
<chillywilly> unfortunately there isn't
<chillywilly> there's the forms developers guide and the gnue common developers guide
<ajmitch> hi
<chillywilly> hey ajmitch
<hoppy> so, assuming I know a bit of python, what exactly should I try to be doing at this point?  I would like to get some idea what it takes to build a form, and see something work.  Where to start?
<chillywilly> form developers guide
<chillywilly> or the many samples in gnue/forms/samples
<hoppy> right, so what does one do with a .gfd file?  What are the basic commands to start stuff up?
<chillywilly> depengding upon hw you installed gnue
Vee2d2 (~vin@c66.169.136.41.ftwrth.tx.charter.com) left irc: Connection reset by peer
<chillywilly> you do gfclient whatever.gfd
<chillywilly> you need connections setup to the db and such
<chillywilly> edit your connections.conf
<chillywilly> in gnue's etc dir
<hoppy> I think I've got a viable connectons.conf; what are the install steps after pulling down cvs and running setup.py?
<chillywilly> first, you don't want HEAD
<chillywilly> you want the 0.4.x branch
<chillywilly> cause HEAD is likely to be broken until the 0.5.0 release
<chillywilly> ajmitch: still here?
<chillywilly> ajmitch: what's the syntax on pulling a specific branch?
<chillywilly> :P
<hoppy> I already know that.
<chillywilly> cvs checkout -r whatever-the-branch-is gnue
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> I'm not sure what
<chillywilly> 's a gd example to setup
<chillywilly> you might want to grab the library.gsd and make some sql file(s) and then with designer via introspection create soem forms
<chillywilly> it's in tutorials
<chillywilly> cause jcater said he was going t rewrite the guide to use that as an example
<chillywilly> to handle master-detail and other thing that the simplistic example does not involve currently
<chillywilly> erm, gnue/samples/tutorials
<hoppy> okay, so I examine the tags in ./forms, and it looks like they are independent from the stuff in the parent directory.  This expected?
<chillywilly> schema
<chillywilly> ?
<chillywilly> I don't understand your question
<hoppy> I was hunting for the branch to use, and was wondering if this is tree wide, or per designer, appserver, reports, etc.?
<chillywilly> oh
<hoppy> do you treat these as more or less separate entities, or one big tree
<chillywilly> they are separate
<chillywilly> our cvs structure is not ideal
<hoppy> heh, who's is?
<chillywilly> gnue
<chillywilly> us
<chillywilly> the place
<chillywilly> of crazy ppl
<hoppy> okay - one more, where does your 'gfclient' command come from - I haven't a whiff of it here
<chillywilly> anyway, I think common and forms, possibly designer are on that branch
<chillywilly> you install it...if you do ./setup-cvs.py in the main gnue dir it will install either local or system wide
<chillywilly> you pick
<chillywilly> and the executable name then is gfcvs I believe
<chillywilly> if you go into each dir and do ./setup.py install
<chillywilly> and install system wide
<chillywilly> then I think the exectable name is
<chillywilly> gfclient
<chillywilly> I usually run it in my home dir and all of it goes un ~/bin and ~/gnue
<chillywilly> erm installing it via ./setup-cvs.py
<hoppy> okay - that seems to be the juju I needed
<chillywilly> I think jcater had a mail about how to check things out
<chillywilly> while HEAD is b0rked
<jcater> b0rked?
<hoppy> would that be in the archives - I just got on the list today
<jcater> we consider it to be "in the process of being blessed"
<chillywilly> jcater: HEH
<jcater> hoppy: it was in the November -02 archives
<jcater> http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/gnue-dev/2002-11/msg00033.html
<chillywilly> now the gfd format is changing right?
<chillywilly> or did 0.4.x change it?
<jcater> however, I left out GNUe-Common in that email
<jcater> so in addition to the steps in that email
<jcater> do:
<jcater> cd common
<jcater> cvs update -r common-0-4-1-branch
<jcater> chillywilly: 0.5.x changes it
<chillywilly> right
<chillywilly> k
<chillywilly> and when is 0.5.x due :)
<jcater> well
<chillywilly> hehe
<jcater> we're reasonably sure before christmas
<jcater> but don't hold us to that
<chillywilly> "when it's ready damnit"
<chillywilly> christmas?!?
<jcater> j/k :)
<jcater> dude
<jcater> one of the issues I'm having
<jcater> is 0.5.0 introduces a lot of changes
<jcater> but the way we have ppl trained now
<jcater> once we release 0.5.0
<jcater> ppl are going to want 0.5.1 to be a bugfix release
<jcater> and 0.5.2 to be one too
<jcater> and so one
<jcater> s/one/on
<jcater> and we aren't ready to freeze 0.5.x
<jcater> :(
<jcater> in many ways, the even/odd versioning really does seem better in practice
<jcater> but I won't rehash that old debate :)
<jcater> but that's part of the holdup of the 0.5.0 release
<jcater> we'd originally planned to do it during christmas holidays
<jcater> so what I've fallen back to doing
<jcater> is just doing periodical prereleases :)
<hoppy> okay, thaks for the help.  Looks like I'm off to battle wxWindows for awhile....
<chillywilly> jcater: what's the issues with the win32 interface?
<chillywilly> jcater: someone was mentioning there was issues there
<jcater> eh?
<jcater> well, the underlying OS would suck
<jcater> that would be issue #1
Vee2d2 (~vin@c66.169.136.41.ftwrth.tx.charter.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> jcater: lol
<chillywilly> that's not my point
<chillywilly> jeff told me win32 interface has issues
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> wx on windows isn't letting us intercept all the events that wx under gtk does
<chillywilly> hmmm
<jcater> so the interaction with the form ends up being inconsistent
<chillywilly> why?
<jcater> not 100% sure
<jcater> but a native Win32 interface is HIGH on our list
<jcater> for forms
<chillywilly> are there python bindings to the win32 api?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> win32all
<jcater> (the same package that provides our ODBC support in windows)
<havoc> wooo
<havoc> 245KBps downloads rule
<jcater> nah
<jcater> Mango Lasse
<jcater> those rule

<frayed> hello?
<jcater> howdy
<frayed> jcater: did you read my post on the developer's list?
<jcater> well
<jcater> I got to the part where you said this was a long email
<jcater> and stopped
<frayed> heh.  want it in a nutshell?
<jcater> :)
<jcater> actually, I was on my way out at the time
<jcater> sure
<frayed> we want to use GNUe, and we want to work on the applications part of the package.  So, we want to work directly
<frayed> with the project and have our code merged into the project.  It would solve a few of our problems if we can work that way,
<frayed> and it would contribute code back to the project.
<frayed> basically, we start with the database schema for the master plan, and when we are all agreed that it is perfect, we'd use it
<frayed> and start coding the specific modules we need.  :)
<frayed> um, all of our code would be turned back to the project.  I think I said that, but I definitely meant it.
<derek> hi frayed
<jcater> *gasp*
<jcater> he lives
<ajmitch> deke!
<frayed> hi derek.  pardon the pause, I'm trying to figure out how to hack together online account access for my own bank account
Action: frayed hopes to take a hammer to his windows terminal server in the coming weeks.
<jcater> frayed: nah
<jcater> just replace it with LTSP
<frayed> reason it's windows right now is because it runs quicken for me.  seriously, if I can get rid of it, I'll turn it into a database server instead.  :)
<jcater> man
<jcater> if you only have one windows app you can't do without
<frayed> looksl ike you can download ofx with http from my bank, if you have a url for one.
<jcater> I'd strongly recommend win4lin
<frayed> win4lin?
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/snapshot2.png
<jcater> is my desktop
<jcater> www.netraverse.com --> win4lin people
<jcater> I normally don't recommend non-free software to people
<jcater> but I do have a few apps I can't get on linux
<jcater> (QuarkXPress being one)
<jcater> and this is a godsend for that
<jcater> only like $40 or so too, iirc
<jcater> runs at native speeds... it's not an emulator
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> only downside to that is
<jcater> wife found my "Windows" icon on my desktop
<jcater> and learned she could isntall Windows Messenger in that
<jcater> so the other day I open win4lin
<jcater> and the damn Messenger auto-starts
