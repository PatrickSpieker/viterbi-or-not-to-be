<derek> ajmitch: you here?
<ajmitch> yes
<derek> you know anything about FSA - Free Software Academy?
<chillywilly> masta!
<ajmitch> how may i help?
<ajmitch> derek: yes, i do
<derek> can you give me 3 or 4 line overview
<chillywilly> HEH, they were just talking about that in #dotgnu
<derek> and your opinion
<ajmitch> the crazies in #dotgnu are discussing it at the moment
<ajmitch> 3-4 line?
<ajmitch> hmm
Action: ajmitch wonders if he knows that much about it
<ajmitch> where'd you hear about this?
<derek> i have free software special mojo powers
<derek> like a 'spidey' sense
<chillywilly> I think it's just an edu-type project
<chillywilly> dewd
<ajmitch> heh
<derek> that somehow tunes into 'whacked' free software schemes ;)
<ajmitch> lemme review the mail a bit :)
<derek> actually someone sent some stuff to our LUG list
<derek> i didnt read in full
<derek> but i saw some reference to dotGNU so thought one of you might know more
<derek> seems very much like free developers
<ajmitch> probably minddig (adam ballai)
<ajmitch> yeah
<chillywilly> hmmm, FD?
<derek> 1. interesting idea (though perhaps over the top)
<ajmitch> but without tony
Action: chillywilly doesn't like the sound of that
<derek> 2. too worried about all this 'structure' and not enough on how to get things done :)
<derek> i.e. delusions of grandeur ;)
<derek> but that is a 10,000 ft view based on speed reading two emails :)
<derek> ajmitch: what do you know about mindog?
<derek> btw: i think that is whom posted it
<ajmitch> he's a good chap
<ajmitch> a #dotgnu regular
minddog (minddog@ip68-98-85-105.ph.ph.cox.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> and here he is
<minddog> hey derek
<minddog> okay... im plotting this out
<derek> give me three minutes
<derek> actually explain what it is
<derek> so i can come back after i drop the kids off at the pool and see whats up ;)
<chillywilly> hehe
<derek> btw: im really getting a drink but i thought chillywilly would get a kick out of that
<chillywilly> what is the FSA idea anyway, I have seen no mails about it
<ajmitch> chillywilly: i've seen 2 mails on the dotgnu list
<ajmitch> that seem to jump in about half-way thru the idea process
<chillywilly> ajmitch: I don't read that list
<chillywilly> it's too much
<ajmitch> right
<ajmitch> it's one list i follow fairly closely
Action: chillywilly jst hits tab in mutt
<chillywilly> <tab>
[00:10] Last message repeated 3 time(s).
<chillywilly> ;P
<ajmitch> nah
<ajmitch> takes 5 or 6 keystrokes to tag & mark all messages as read in a folder :)
<derek> ok back
<chillywilly> and it takes on key stroke to hold tab down
<derek> guess minddog isnt sure what he is plotting
<derek> on windows 2000 if you hold the shift key down for like 10 seconds it does some special action
<minddog> we're gettin the right set of words
Action: derek types so much and when i stop to think for a next sentence often i hold the shift key waiting to start the next sentence
<minddog> i don't want it to be long and drawn out
<derek> and win2k will flip out
Action: minddog forgets about the shift quick often in irc
<derek> and pops a dialog saying im going into some freak mode ok/cancel
<ajmitch> heh
Action: derek is such an irc junkie sadly i think i can talk
<derek> er type
<derek> faster than i can talk
<minddog> The Free Software Academy has the goal to help in removing the proprietary technology from the classroom.  The academy will push institutions towards open standards to enable outside interaction with all types of readers.
<derek> or at least my typing can keep up with my thought process
<ajmitch> derek: agreed
<derek> minddog: have you seen AZOTO at all?
<ajmitch> i've seen you go for 10-15 lines at a time, while the rest of us try & read :)
<minddog> derek: i keep hearing things but no one is doing anything
<derek> minddog: you up for criticism on the FSA thing?
<chillywilly> derek: I thought they stopped making 386s
<minddog> derek: we have a list of 9 goals
<minddog> its tough to get it down to 2 sentences
<minddog> Sure compare/contrst/incrimnate/discriminate
<derek> i would suggest a different name
<ajmitch> minddog: derek's good at providing worthwhile criticism :)
<minddog> oh name yeah, we had a problem
<chillywilly> worthwhile?
<minddog> we couldn't think of anything
<chillywilly> that's debateable ;)
<derek> when i hear Free Software Academy i think of somewhere to learn how to use free software
Action: ajmitch gets same idea
<minddog> thats actually part of one goal
<derek> not some organization to help aid existing learning institutions
<minddog> true
<derek> minddog: i think you woudl be better served to pick one goal or the other to start with
<derek> and put under a more generic name
<minddog> we just put a name on it cuz we needed to get something quick and be done with it
<derek> then if you wanted to start education type services
<derek> put it under the larger umbrella calling it the FSA
<derek> if that makes sense
<ajmitch> too many goals at once == dispersion of resources
<minddog> we were going to be a group to serve the community under a single interface to the rest of the free software community
<derek> ajmitch: yes
Nick change: dimas -> dimas-out
<ajmitch> which is why GNUe isn't doing everything under the sun, but doing some things well :)
<derek> minddog: re: AZOTO, it had a problem in that it lacked goals and focus
<derek> recently the board has been entirely revamped
<minddog> hrmm
<derek> it is meeting monthly and putting things on track
<minddog> derek: we were going to designate chapters
<derek> minddog: now you are scaring me, as this is sounding too much like grand schemes of free developers
<minddog> each chapter is the location of a group of reps who can aid in the support of free software
<ajmitch> minddog: so have you met derek in person? :)
<minddog> nope
<derek> minddog: you sure?
<ajmitch> nope to which question?
<minddog> derek: there will be a government and such, but we're doing this in waves
<chillywilly> minddog: you live in the desert?
<minddog> chillywilly: ya
<minddog> single wave is just a bunch of guys out in the fields 
<minddog> trying to get a bunch of tools to aid in the convergence
<minddog> second wave is when we receive followers from the first wave and are ready to push some organization
<minddog> thats when we'd start adopting other organizations and using them...similar to outsourcing
<minddog> but the first wave is what we're trying to build right now
<minddog> basically we're going to try to push open file formats for university classes
<minddog> gather a small group of local people
<minddog> derek: do you seem interested in helping
<derek> minddog: im more wise than that :)
<derek> its interesting and i wish you best of luck
<derek> but i have my fingers in more pies than i can eat already
<derek> no way i could take on more if i wanted to
<minddog> yes, this, dotgnu, and asu-wig projects have got me done for
Action: minddog sticks a fork in himself
<minddog> derek: do you know any students who complain?
<minddog> those are who i'm looking for
<minddog> i found two already
<derek> most dont complain
<derek> they dont care
<ajmitch> i'd agree with that
<minddog> yeah, i need some heads to help hand out our some small paragraphs of paper
<minddog> "Why should you care?"
<derek> you at ASU?
Action: ajmitch is reminded of mormons & JWs... :)
<derek> if so is there some mandatory 'lab fees' during registration?
<derek> i know at the community colleges there is a 5.00 or 10.00 computer lab fee at registration
<minddog> cse120 requires proprietary documentation be bought 
<derek> minddog: i dont count that
<derek> as you have to buy proprietary physics, philosophy books etc all the time in education
<minddog> all lecture notes on the web are in ppt
<derek> the point im trying to drive at in the "lab fee" example
<derek> is if you go to the university and ask what that lab fee is for
<derek> if any of it is "licensing"
<derek> then one should care as the cost of the education goes up
<minddog> you are required to use proprietary software for math
<derek> remember people dont care about freedom
<derek> the US patriot act wouldnt exist if they did
<minddog> and also required to use proprietary software for turning in your lab reports for ee diagrams
<derek> you have to hit them where it matters
<chillywilly> derek: hear hear
<derek> im going to say who gives a crap if i have to use proprietary software for math
<minddog> oh the u.s. p.a.t.r.i.o.t. act
<derek> i mean for heavens sake all math classes pretty much require a TI 8X caclulator that is non free
<minddog> i have to either go to a asu computer lab ...36miles or buy 100$ software to turn my labs in
<derek> the point is SHOW me the pain baby
<derek> show me how it not being free hurts me
<chillywilly> show me the moneeeey!
<derek> btw: you dont need to show me personally, i care about freedom :)
<chillywilly> oh sorry
Action: chillywilly gtes carried away
<chillywilly> gets*
<minddog> lol
<derek> my point was most students dont understand how software not being free hurts them
<chillywilly> derek: you know what the main arugment I have heard from hardcore conservatives is that if you don't have anything to hide then what does it matter
<minddog> photoshop!
<minddog> illustrator!
<minddog> ms word!
<minddog> ms powerpoint!
<derek> minddog: let me rephrase
<minddog> all being taught in classrooms
<derek> if i go to asu
<derek> i live on campus
<chillywilly> there's also the price misconception which is deeply rooted
<derek> mommy and daddy pay for my school (or uncle sam does)
<derek> and i do all my homework in the lab as i dont own a computer
<chillywilly> students  usually buy computers
<ajmitch> derek: almost exactly like here
<derek> do i really care that they use ms word, ms powerpoint, photoshop and illustrator?
<minddog> they are using proprietary software every day
<chillywilly> even if they can use the lab
<derek> furthermore, if my daddy buys me a computer and preloads all the goodies do i care?
<minddog> this is why am i saying we need a "Why should you care?" before you show everyone
<derek> even if he doesnt
<derek> if my roomate "shares" his copy with me, do i really care?
Action: derek agrees with you, so realize im playing devil's advocate
<derek> just your original question was do i know students who care
Action: minddog just wanted to his ppt files in pdf or ps format so he could view his stuff without a 40meg office install
<minddog> openoffice rather
<derek> my reponse is most do not care
<derek> because there is not a "pratical" problem for them
<derek> there is only a "social" one
<chillywilly> you should care because you deserve equal access to information as the next guy, imho
<derek> and they fail to see the "social" problem
<chillywilly> money shouldn't be a factor
<derek> chillywilly: that is a social issue not a practical issue
<minddog> money has been the only factor for many in education =/
<chillywilly> derek: yea it is
<derek> and most college/high schoolers dont give a piss about social issues
<chillywilly> Free Software Movement is a "social" movement
<minddog> yeah i guess i'm rarea
<derek> unless they come with free beer ;)
<ajmitch> s/social/socialist/ :)
<derek> so unless its a 'practical' issue
<derek> they will be tough to rally
Action: chillywilly has loved free software ever since really learning what the heck GNU was really about
<minddog> derek you're making me feel like i'm going to never make a dent in them
<derek> likely where you coudl get them to good things
<derek> is DRM
<derek> tell them the same things oppressing the classroom is moving to the CD player near them
<minddog> ooo
<derek> i.e. they "socially" share music
Action: minddog forgot about the other environment
<minddog> hrmm
<derek> but if the RIAA/Microsoft and such are successful with DRM
<minddog> Education is the root of society
<derek> it implements a "practical" problem for them
<derek> if you can use this "practical" concern to introduce them to "freedom"
<minddog> if we start those people off with the correct social opinions it can spread like a virus
<derek> you can then carry that forward into other areas
<derek> minddog: bingo
<derek> get them to understand that the same social behavior they have towards music
<derek> should be applied to the software they use for educational purposes
<minddog> hrmm music is the key issue here
<derek> i.e. they see "real" benefits to sharing music
<derek> similar benefits exist in sharing software
<derek> they just dont socially care about a document editor (word) like they do the newest Linkin Park remix
<derek> btw: other political theorists do this all the time
<derek> for example pro-life camps
Action: minddog forgets about how it is to not get excited over a new feature in ViM
<derek> get people to buy into that murder is wrong
<derek> and then gently move people to that if murder is wrong
<derek> and abortion is murder
<derek> then isnt abortion wrong
<minddog> lol
<chillywilly> derek: it is wrong ;)
<derek> i.e. using ideology building blocks from one theory to the next
<minddog> you raise such controversial issues i don't beleive it
<minddog> s/it/in
<derek> chillywilly: you know i think it is murder, and i think murder is wrong, so i think it is wrong
<derek> im just making a point
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> I know I like teasing you
<minddog> I do believe in abortion since I read asimovian stuff
<derek> the opposing camp gets one to buy into scientific definitions of viability
<derek> and slowly drags them down the its ok path
<minddog> if someone isn't born then it reflects everything and its a good thing they had the abortion hehe
<chillywilly> wtf?
<minddog> okay so we have difference of opinion
<derek> but anyhow as we digress
<minddog> urmm cool!
<derek> the point is you are always better off starting on a common ground
<derek> and using it as spring board into thing you are pushing towards

<derek> actually its interesting stuff but i do have to be up at like 6am tomorrow so i should crawl into bed ;)
<S11001001> <S11001001> here are the choices. We can go to RMS and ask to take over the GNU Education activity.
<S11001001> <S11001001> Pro: backing of GNU, some existing infrastructure, uh, backing of GNU.
<S11001001> <S11001001> Con: we have to go to RMS and ask to take over the GNU Education activity.
<S11001001> <S11001001> minddog: the other choice is, start from scratch. Do a quick write-up for intro, tarball everything else we have, and go get the starting resources (savannah, gnufans)
<S11001001> <S11001001> minddog: Pro: don't have to worry about the drag from the GNU Education project (i.e. lack of inertia).
<S11001001> <S11001001> minddog: Con: who the hell are *we* anyway?
<minddog> derek: will you be at the PLUG meeting tomorrow?

<chillywilly> a friend of mine is reading asimov
Action: derek is away: partying with the sandman
<S11001001> right
<S11001001> I think we can wait to tackle the freedom issues until unspecified time.
<S11001001> That's really the DSP's area anyway.
<minddog> Let's take over GNU Educational Solutions
<chillywilly> he says he digs it...talkks about some mathematical model to do something...I forgot now, doh
<chillywilly> predict the future?
<minddog> DSP's ?
<S11001001> Digital Speech Project
<S11001001> there's not much on the web about it, but they are doing campus Digital Freedom groups

<S11001001> ok, so let's do one more headcount?
<minddog> okay!
Action: ajmitch doesn't think many GNUe people are still in the educational field :)

<S11001001> wait
<S11001001> let's not get ahead of ourselves :)
<minddog> well we get a place of communication first! Then we build a set of flyers to hand out on specific days
<S11001001> on the other hand, we do need some examples to tell the gvc about our plans
<minddog> Then we derive speeches at certain locations around the world
<minddog> we'll do it suttle
<minddog> so the public sees whats up
<minddog> I think the DSP is where we should start at
<minddog> we'll talk about everyday things on these fliers

<minddog> Did you know if you give your friend a program that is a $.... dollar fine?
<minddog> they might know this already
<minddog> but they don't think about it everyday!
<minddog> what if we just handed out fliers every couple days for a good month and hang signs
<minddog> Signs would be best
<S11001001> I'm already assuming signs
<S11001001> fliers take alot more effort, which we don't have the resources for *definitely*
<minddog> okay
<minddog> so far...i got two members at my local university
<minddog> just by asking them "Can you hand out fliers"
<S11001001> minddog: so where are we on the fliers?
<minddog> lets create a place for fliers in html or some format

<frayed> hi btami
<frayed> is there some way to get GNUe Navigator to authenticate with the database so that none of the subsequent forms have to?
<btami> hi all
<btami> frayed: there is netrc support in GConnection.py, IIRC
<btami> GConnections.py in common
Action: frayed admits he didn't understand the answer at all.  ;(
<frayed> How would I flag it in my .gpd file?
<frayed> or would I flag it in the connections.conf file?
<btami> if you have a .netrc file in users home dir, it's automatic
<frayed> so I'd have to make a .netrc for each user?  Um, what's .netrc?  ;)
<btami> please look at GConnection.py in gnue.common.src
<btami> it's "documented" there :)
<frayed> :)
<frayed> on my way
<btami> this is all what i know about netrc :)
<frayed> It's all I needed.  It works, thanks.  :)
<frayed> now if we can encrypt the password...
<frayed> of course, chmod 600 is probably secure enough for me.
<btami> there is another
<btami> look at 00005.txt in gnue/common/doc/technotes

<Arturas> Hello
<btami> hi Arturas
<frayed> anybody do any timestamping of records?  I followed the documentation, and it doesn't work.  :(
<btami> it depend on if dbdriver supports getTimestamp()
<btami> but i have to say, i'v never tried it
<frayed> I'm running into the extensions not supported.  Or at least that's where the error is.
<btami> i think all pg drivers supports getTimestamp(), 'cos it's in _pgsql.DBdrivers.py
<btami> what error you get?
<frayed>   File "/home/dave/gnue/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/common/GTrigger.py", line 213, in __getattr__

<btami> frayed: sorry, i have no idea
<frayed> well, thanks.  I'm now poring through python code that I"m not understanding.  Heh.  what does "def" mean?  define function?
<btami> yes
<frayed> the getTimeStamp function is in the class PGSQL_TriggerExtensions.  How do I access that class from within a trigger?
<frayed> and is python case sensitive, like c is?
<btami> yes

<btami> there are some examples in gnue/samples/testcases/trigger dir
<btami> maybe it helps
<btami> i'm not a trigger guru :)
<frayed> hm, nothing that uses the extensions object, or collection, or whatever it is.
<frayed> gnue-sb has timestamping in the schema, but it doesn't look like the forms implement it at all.
<ajmitch> hey frayed, btami
<frayed> hey ajmitch.  ever timestamp a record?
<ajmitch> nope
<btami> huh, hi ajmitch
<ajmitch> frayed: you want intros to python?
<frayed> hm.  done much with triggers?
<ajmitch> i know of a few online..
<ajmitch> nah, not much with triggers yet :)
<frayed> I'm getting it a little at a time.  It resembles Javascript a lot, it seems.
Action: frayed is somewhat familiar with javascript
Action: ajmitch shudders
<ajmitch> python is far far better than to be insulted like that! :)
<frayed> sorry dude, but the comparison will always show up when you access classmembers with strings, rather than pointers.
<ajmitch> heh
<frayed> of course, that could just be the nature of navigating a DOM and not specific to javascript.
<btami> ajmitch: frayed got errors with timestamping from DevGuide, but i can't help
<btami> maybe you can :)
<ajmitch> it could also be that they're both interpreted
Action: frayed gets ready to dodge
<frayed> um, vbscript doesn't act that way
Action: frayed dodges
<ajmitch> vbscript is an abomination :)
<frayed> I've just learned that I must timestamp, because I created the field in the db as NOT NULL.
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> postgresql?
<frayed> yessir
Action: ajmitch ponders
Action: ajmitch thinks we have a lack of people that use the tools in a decent way around here :)
<ajmitch> ie, i dunno, you'd have to ask someone who does ;)
<frayed> hm
<frayed> in, uh, my experience, if you don't timestamp the records, then the records themselves become meaningless eventually
<ajmitch> not surprising
<frayed> here's the problem, just in case you happen to know.  :)
<frayed> the trigger itself is firing, because it generates the error at the appropriate time
<frayed> you're supposed to call the datasource.extension.getTimestamp() method, and that call is what's failing.
<ajmitch> hmm ok
<ajmitch> do you have a copy of the form i can have a look at? :)
<frayed> so, somewhere, then, there has to be a definition of the datasource class with an "extension" member, which in turn has a getTimeStamp() member, right?
<frayed> it fails because "extension" doesn't exist
Action: ajmitch would like to use the python trickiness to have a look at the object tree at that point
Action: frayed thinks that's a great idea
Action: ajmitch has some evil ideas :D
<frayed> is it possible?  and, uh, how?
<frayed> :)
<ajmitch> oh sure it's possible
<ajmitch> this is python :)
Action: frayed reserves pointing out the DOM inspector in Mozilla....
Action: ajmitch is trying to think of the best way to do this
<ajmitch> it's not really the same
<ajmitch> this is more like stopping a program in gdb
<frayed> I was just thinking "I wonder what the python debugger is called"
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> there's a simple one called pydb
<ajmitch> which can be called from within the program
<frayed> let's see...
<frayed> try

Action: psu has been AWOL a few days
<psu> Did your downgrade to wxPython fix the problem with the released versions of GNUe?
<psu> If so, I'd better put an announcement to mail lists 
<ajmitch> no, but jcater did a bugfix 0.4.3 designer
<psu> and website
<psu> cool
<psu> is this going to be in effect a 0.4.4?
<ajmitch> nope
<ajmitch> 0.4.3
<ajmitch> since designer was previously at 0.4.2 :)
<ajmitch> now it matches forms, iirc
<psu> OIC
<ajmitch> well, that's what i think happened
<psu> so forms wasn't b()rked? I didn;t realise
<ajmitch> nah, not afaik
<ajmitch> forms & common got bumped to 0.4.3 in december iirc, due to a couple of buglets
<psu> that's right
<psu> ISTR you found the bugs - mySQL-related IIRC 
<ajmitch> yeah
<psu> well, I can do a mini-announce for Designer 0.4.3 on the website
<ajmitch> i didn't find the bug this time :)
<ajmitch> right
<ajmitch> i think jcater might be planning another 0.5.0 prerelease
<ajmitch> not entirely sure 
<ajmitch> depends on what gets hacked on
<jamest> no more prereleases for a while
<jamest> i don't think anyone tried out the last ones :(
<jamest> and so we moved on
<psu> well, fair comment
<ajmitch> alright
<psu> testing gnue pre-releases is on my list of things to be more pro-active on 
<psu> when I discover a way of making sleep optional ;-)
Action: psu is disappointed that no-one else on the lists can make the time, tho'
<jamest> its ok
<jamest> i think i'll be happier w/ the upcomming 0.5.0 release if it has more of the 0.5.x features in it at the beginning anyway
<psu> I would guess that people aren;t beating down the door for 0.5.0 as the main change is that it breaks backwards compat
<psu> for a good reason, natch
<psu> but still a breakage 
<psu> all the "goodies" in 0.5.x come later
<psu> native UIs, etc
<jcater> psu: of course, no one tested the 0.4.x prereleases either
<jcater> :)
<jcater> as for a while, the prereleases weren't even installable
<jamest> of course
<jamest> it's either cvs or tarball release

<jcater> if you are looking for an out of the box solution today, then GNUe is not ready for what you need

<chillywilly> hmmm?
<chillywilly> well the main thing is nautilus is b0rked anyway, so Gnome kinda sucks

<chillywilly> which only matters on my lappy

<chillywilly> than Gnome stuff does

<jcater> funny you say that
<jcater> because over in #ltsp
<jcater> even the gnome fans
<jcater> will not use gdm
<jcater> I don't even think they'll support ppl who use it
<jcater> because it's so fscked
<jcater> but that may have to do with it's networked support
<chillywilly> yea but it doesn't suck resorces
<jcater> I'm sure it works fine on a single login machine
<chillywilly> it makes my laptop w/160MB ram swap and I have to wait like 3 minutes for it to start
<jamest> the only thing I'd wonder about
<jamest> if gdm is loaded how many gnome libs are loaded that wouldn't normally be?
<jamest> but all in all sounds like you're ok w/ it
<jamest> which is good
<jcater> chillywilly: that's really oddd
<jcater> as I use KDM on my laptop too

<jcater> cause that didn't work
<jcater> :(
<chillywilly> did it fix it?
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> then I dunno
<chillywilly> when was using apt-proxy sometimes those files would only get like half written and I woukld have to rm them and let apt rebuild them
<chillywilly> it would make apt segfault
<jcater> hrm
<jcater> it does it on the "Reading Package Lists..." like
<jcater> well, bugger
<jcater> off to google I go
<chillywilly> see it should rebuild that .bin file
<jcater> it did
<chillywilly> and it still pukes...hmm
<Chipaca> jcater: that happened to me the other day
<Chipaca> dpkg would die, too
<Chipaca> what I did in the end was just overwrite my packages with packages.old (or was it available? one of the two)
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> the packages list is prolly fubarred
<Chipaca> yes
<jcater> where is that located?
<chillywilly> hrrrmmm, but those .bin files are the cached versions of the lists
<Chipaca> jcater: try just apt-get update, maybe taht fixes it
<jcater> Chipaca: that is what is segfaulting
<jcater> ooooooo
<jcater> fixed it
<Chipaca> jcater: doing?
<jcater> I removed /var/lib/apt/lists/*dists*
<jcater> then apt-get update
<chillywilly> ah yea
<Chipaca> jcater: :)
<chillywilly> I forget where all the damn files are
Action: jcater stops sweating
<chillywilly> they're spread all over
<jcater> as this was my callcenter ltsp server

<chillywilly> well I was close
<dsmith> There was just recently an article on Debian Planet about recovering the dpkg database.
<chillywilly> bah apt will pull new lists anyway
<esands> its not a fun thing
<chillywilly> there's nothing really to "recover"
<dsmith> Or maybe it was somewhere else.
<jcater> chillywilly: what about your list of already installed packages and their versions
<jcater> now that would suck big time
<esands> Nah, that article was on dp
<chillywilly> right, but you didn't have a db problem
<chillywilly> just a frelled up listing
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> but I was afraid
<jcater> very afraidf
<chillywilly> heheh
<jcater> anyone use courier imap?
<chillywilly> yes
<dsmith> Here it is: http://www.linuxworld.com/2003/0113.petreley-p2.html
<chillywilly> mail.libertyetech.com runs it
<chillywilly> it beats the hell outta UWIMAP
<jcater> did you start out using it, or did you start out with UWIMAP and convert?
<chillywilly> that's another fat pig
Action: jcater wants to convert
<jcater> but I have a lot of history in UWIMAP I need converted
<chillywilly> I tried UWIMAP
<chillywilly> and I said
<chillywilly> fsck this

<esands> I usually find it handy to keep a backup of dpkg --get-selections
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> good idea
<jcater> I didn't know of that option
<dsmith> esands: Yes. a ver good idea.
<chillywilly> you're also supposed to be able to do
<chillywilly> dpkg --set-selections
<chillywilly> to like pick th esame list f packages to install again
<chillywilly> I walys have to edit that file
<chillywilly> cause it has uninstallable packages in it every time
<esands> Did you prime dselect/dpkg correctly?
<esands> ie. set dselect source as apt. then run an update
<esands> Then do your dpkg --set-selections < file.txt
<dsmith> esands: Have you ever tried to duplicate a box that way?
<esands> several times. Not in the last year though
<esands> I'd run that on the new box, then run a sudo diff -ru /etc /old/bak/etc/ | less
<dsmith> esands: Got any good directions?  I know someone who tried it and failed miserably.  I wasn't around to watch, and I've never done it myself.
<esands> after asking all the install questions to check everything looked good
<esands> Don't know. Just works for me. Mind you, I've used debian so long, some stuff I do with thought.  
<esands> I think its very easy to use get/set selections with Debian/stable.  Maybe not so easy with testing/unstable
<esands> Dependance issues are likley to cause problems.
<esands> The other important thing as I said above is the dpkg/dselect avaliable DB.
<esands> You have to make sure dpkg/dselect can see the same stuff apt can see
<dsmith> esands: Did you use dselect or apt-get ?
<esands> brb
<chillywilly> esands: course I used it like that
<chillywilly> esands: but the package list keeps old cruft around
<chillywilly> and I alway had to handedit it
<esands> dsmith: either I think. Forget actually. Probably dselect
<esands> dselect back-ends onto apt to grab the files
<chillywilly> I don't use dselect...I used aptitude for a while
<chillywilly> now I just use apt-get
<dsmith> esands: I was thinking maybe  "apt-get dselect-upgrade"
<dsmith> esands: But I've never done it.
<esands> chillywilly: I used dselect only for --set-selection and updating dpkg --list
<chillywilly> ok
<esands> dsmith: haven't seen that function before.  Quickly checking the man page.  Yes, I think that might be the option to use
<esands> " dselect-upgrade follows the changes made  by  dselect(8)  to  the  Status
<esands>               field of available packages, and performs the actions necessary to realize that state
<esands>               (for instance, the removal of old and the installation of new packages)."
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> that should pull uninstallable stuff out of the list?
<dsmith> chillywilly: http://panuganty.tripod.com/debiantips/packaging.htm
<dsmith> Intresting stuff.
<esands> chillywilly: dselect and apt have two different on disk DBs.  
<chillywilly> ok
<dsmith> esands: That's why my friend had problems, I think.
<esands> Actually I should say, two different DBs for what files the know are 'avaliable'. Obviously installed packages is a dpkg DB that apt-get re-read each time it runs
<esands> dsmith: yes.
Action: chillywilly always uses make-kpkg
<esands> make-kpkg is nice.  
<chillywilly> that page is pretty helpful
<chillywilly> thanks dsmith 
<chillywilly> hmmm, checkinstall seems like an interesting tool
<dsmith> chillywilly: Google is your friend!  I just found that.

<derek> my favorite canadian able to look at dcl packages yet :)
<jbailey> not much.  Weird day.
<jbailey> dcl?  Oh yeah..
<derek> i ithink 0.9.2 was released
<jbailey> Hmm
<jbailey> I could probably do that now.
<derek> that would be killer as i have to upgrade at work
<derek> and its a debian install
<derek> and so is gnue's
<jbailey> gnue I can probably do at work.  I'm just not sure what I should be tracking for that, though.
<jbailey> What's it under?  It's not showing up in the search on savannah.
<jbailey> I'm typing in 'dcl'
<derek> 0.4.3 i think is current one
<derek> jbailey dcl.sf.net 
Action: derek runs in shame
<derek> we will get it moved eventually

<derek> <dneighbo> then that mail picked up (in the inbox) (i.e. it wasnt server side filtered)
<derek> <dneighbo> ok
<derek> <dneighbo> will restart evolution
<derek> <Chipzz> lewing: ok, but that looks like a corner-corner case ;)

<derek> have a debian box to install for church :)
<jcater> bf2.4
<derek> hmm
<jcater> tabbing will tell you
<derek> bf2.4 gives
<jcater> but dude
<jcater> why?
<derek> Could not find kernel image" bf2.4
<jcater> special hardware?
<derek> why what?
<jcater> tabbing will tell you the options usually
<derek> i want 2.4 kernel and ext3
<dtm> derek: hay dood.  what's the status of dcl contact mgmt?
<derek> mostly ext3 just to save the 5 minutes it takes to reconfig it
<jcater> derek: dude
<derek> i have been happy with 2.4 kernel
<jcater> I wouldn't go that route
<derek> and likely will want usb support
<jcater> bf2.4 kernel is VERY limited
<derek> jcater: ok
<jcater> you'll have to reinstall a decent kernel
<derek> this box will not be connected to net
<derek> so i will defer to your judgement
<jcater> whether you use stock install or bf2.4
<dtm> derek: i need to use DCL for sales force automation and some CRM
<chillywilly> ummm
<derek> need to get ram and NIC in it
<dtm> derek: so i'd like to know if there's a version i can use stably for contact mgmt

<derek> dtm: contact management in dcl wont be ready until 1.0
<derek> gnue contact management is usable
<dtm> derek: ok well is it in any way linked with dcl?
<chillywilly> anyway
<chillywilly> I just had an argument about evolution v. creation and boy it was a blast :-o
<dtm> chillywilly: oh golly
<dtm> derek: so does gnue contact mgmt have a web browser ui?
<dtm> that's required at this juncture
<derek> dtm: yes it will link with dcl
<dtm> derek: what's my best compromise?  i could start a line of DCL Projects, one per org or individual.  and i could implement a timecard for every communication, and a WO for each comm to be scheduled.
<derek> no it does not have a web ui
<dtm> derek: does it currently link
<derek> i loathe them

<derek> and refuse to subjecate my users to them
<dtm> oh really?  tell me about that in the most eviscerating way possible for the four hundredth time?  that's SO FASCINATING
<dtm> derek: so does that sound like the best compromise for pure DCL usage right now for CRM/SFA?
<jbailey> Anyone know why these files are executable in the upstream tarball?
<derek> jbailey: cause its fun
<dtm> derek: coz essentially, SFA and CRM are ongoing projects
<dtm> semi-permanent
<derek> dtm: whatever works best for you
Action: derek noted sarcastically on the web part
<derek> because im shocked you still ask me (is there a web ui)
<dtm> derek: your shock is quite irrelevant in light of the web UI subprojects for gnue
<jbailey> derek: How do I get it fixed upstream?
<dtm> and you can tell chillywilly instead of me all about it next time.  he's my rant-taking liason.
<dtm> He likes it!
<dtm> :)
<dtm> it's motivating.
<dtm> derek: so does Project-based CRM/SFA sound reasonable?
<dtm> derek: the only problem i forsee is that there's a lack of contact mgmt schema at all in there, so it'd be crappy to get the data out later when DCL does get one
<dtm> :/
<dtm> so i should probably use axisgw's existing contact mgmt, and parallel it with DCL
<chillywilly> un, no dtm 
<dtm> chillywilly: no?  well ok

<chillywilly> hoooray
<derek> as for my creation vs evolution beliefs
<derek> i believe there is a divine creator
<derek> part of that creation includes the ability to evolve
<derek> for example bacteria strains over time become resistant to antibotics used to fight them
<derek> our skin becomes darker as we 'tan' in the sun, our fingers calous when we work with our hands etc etc
<derek> i.e. i think the creator makes things "adapt" or "evolve"
<chillywilly> cause it's in the design?
<derek> do we come from monkeys, i wouldnt go that far, but i wouldnt rule it out just yet either
<derek> i will simply say there is a designer (which differs in theory from darwin)
<dsmith> derek: But there are never any "links" between the "kinds".
<chillywilly> right
<chillywilly> like for instance the girrafe
<derek> dsmith: i highly doubt we are from monkeys, but i am a pragmatist to a large extent
<chillywilly> giraffe
<derek> so while i tend to say no way in hell we are from monkeys
<derek> i can't definitely prove we aren't so i wont say no way in hell
<chillywilly> it needs special muscles in its neck to keep it head from bursting when it take a drink
<derek> i will just say highly unlikely
