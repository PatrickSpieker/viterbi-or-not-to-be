<jbailey> Bah.
<jbailey> You put a space in the url. =)
<jbailey> http://www.gavinroy.com/%7Egavinr/SCO%20Response.pdf
<jbailey> (makes it friendly for xchat users. *g*)
<jamest> um
<chillywilly> I just put the %20 in there myself
<jamest> you should just use a browser like konqueror
<jamest> all truely advanced browsers like it can handle the space without issue
Action: jamest ducks
<chillywilly> that has nothing to do with qhat hw said
<chillywilly> what he
<jamest> huh
<jbailey> xchat notices URLs and makes it easy to paste.
<chillywilly> he said xchat couldn't handle the url cause there was a space in it
Action: jamest can cut n paste that url directly from xchat to konquerer w/o issue
<jbailey> Sure, but why should you cut and paste?
<jamest> ah
<chillywilly> it should be url encoded anyway
<jbailey> if you move your mouse over it, it should underline automatically. =)
<chillywilly> not allow for shitty urls
<jamest> bah!
<chillywilly> jbailey: I agree, I had to paste and then add %20 cause i used wget
<jbailey> I did it with wget as: "http://www.gavinroy.com/~gavinr/SCO Response.pdf" - it handles that.
<chillywilly> jamest: that word is not allowed....I thin havoc owns the patent on it
<jamest> you young'uns and yer clicky clicky

<chillywilly> he should be banned from the list too ;P

<ajmitch> I was about to suggest that

<jamest> dammit!
<jcater> good response from Rich though
<ajmitch> or at least that he be put on moderation
<ajmitch> yep
<chillywilly> I posted something ;-/
<jcater> not just the kneebiter part either
<ajmitch> heh
<chillywilly> dunno if it will make it
<chillywilly> is the list moderated?
<jamest> no
<chillywilly> oh, there it is
<ajmitch> chillywilly: certain people can have messages held for moderation
<chillywilly> haha
<ajmitch> so... when's the next gnue release due?
<chillywilly> :-}
<jamest> um
<jamest> er
<jamest> well
<chillywilly> that's my charlie brown smile
<ajmitch> another 0.5.x point release coming out?
<jamest> i imagine so
<jamest> i think development has really slowed lately
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> I noticed that
<jamest> except for appserver
<jamest> i'm making small changes to common as I need them
<jamest> but forms is hardly moving
<chillywilly> la la la ala laaa laaaa laaaaa
<ajmitch> lack of time?
<jamest> designer and reports are dead in the water
<ajmitch> :(
<jcater> my problem
<jcater> is lack of time
<ajmitch> often the way
<jcater> and I get by on their current feature set
<jcater> bad combination
Action: chillywilly pokes the floating carcasses with a stick
<jamest> lack of time, lack of ambition
Action: ajmitch looks at the feature roadmap
<jamest> plus I'm really trying to get this game engine up and running
<chillywilly> jcater lacks ambition? say it ain't so!?!
<ajmitch> if I can find it..
<ajmitch> game engine?
<chillywilly> jamest: are you writing a game engine?
<ajmitch> I've been away for a few weeks so I haven't kept up with any gnue news
<jamest> as I've got a few artists types interested in providing art but they want a playable demo
<chillywilly> what news? ;P
<ajmitch> chillywilly: anything
<ajmitch> at all
<jamest> i'm writing a gnue-common based RPG system
<jamest> www.adrius.org
<ajmitch> ah
<chillywilly> that address doesn't work
<jcater> works for me
<jamest> i can load level def files (.ldf) and walk arround in them
<jamest> i can play bg music and sound effects
<chillywilly> bah, it does
<jamest> i'm working on triggers now
<jamest> http://www.adrius.org/~jamest/wip.png
<jamest> is my working startup screen
<jamest> it's all python based yumminess
<chillywilly> using soay 3d?
<chillywilly> soya
<jamest> yes
<ajmitch> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/forms.html
<ajmitch> so how much of this stuff is done or in progress? :)
<jamest> i believe quite a bit of the 0.5.x series is complete 
<chillywilly> jamest: there's no code to download ;P
<ajmitch> yeah, that's the impression I got at a glance
<jamest> of course not :)
<chillywilly> heh
<ajmitch> I'm sure there was a more detailed plan somewhere...
<jamest> it's all so rough
<ajmitch> probably in the release plan, for the 0.5.x series
<jamest> ajmitch: i think that is our best breakdown
<chillywilly> you guys have a plan?!? ;P
<jamest> yes
<jamest> GNUe Plan
<ajmitch> chillywilly: yeah, funnily enough
<chillywilly> woah
<jamest>  1. Decide to make an ERP
<jamest>  2. Blame Derek
<chillywilly> masta is rubbing off on ya
<jamest>  3. Profit
<ajmitch> jamest: ok, I just recall there being a release plan somewhere for the 0.5.x series
<jamest> step 3 is optional
<chillywilly> heh
<ajmitch> perhaps it was my bad memory, and it's all documented in old KCs
<chillywilly> are you gonna hack on forms aj?
<chillywilly> go aj, go aj!
<jcater> chillywilly: I google for his name and only get the music composer
<chillywilly> really?
<chillywilly> I swear ajmitch and I did it one night and found him acting like an ass in other forums
<jamest> freefrod
<chillywilly> googled that is
<jamest> freefrog that is
<jamest> er
<jamest> nevermind, i give up
<jcater> if I can find the management screen for mailing lists
<jcater> I'll banninate him
<jamest> here

<jamest> whoa
<chillywilly> where?
<jamest> chillywilly was civil in his responce
<chillywilly> haha
<jcater> I know
<jcater> shocked me too
Action: jamest pokes chillywilly with a trout
<chillywilly> I have changed people
<chillywilly> ;)
<jamest> is that really you chillywilly?
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> the real world has gotten to me ;)
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> don't see how I can ban ppl
<jcater> just unsubscribe
<jcater> poo
<jamest> ajmitch: I'm still using gnue daily and have a list of changes I need
<ajmitch> jcater: just a min, I'll find it..
<jamest> just zero desire to make them 
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> me too
<jcater> currently it's "workable"
<jcater> but I could use some new features
<jamest> jcater: it's in membership management
<jamest> there is a mod option i think
<chillywilly> "kneebiter"
<chillywilly> that's classic
<ajmitch> jcater: privacy options on mailman 2.0.x
<jamest> mod -- The user's personal moderation flag. If this is set, postings from them will be moderated, otherwise they will be approved. 
<ajmitch> jamest: ooh, that can be useful too :)
<ajmitch> the mailman I'm playing with is a bit older
<jcater> oops
<ajmitch> that sounded bad
<jcater> I unsubscribed him from gnue-dev
<chillywilly> rofl
<jamest> ajmitch: at least he's not underaged
<jcater> but he's modded on gnue@gnu.org now
Action: chillywilly looks at ajmitch in a funny manner
<jcater> wow
<jcater> we have 491 ppl subscribed to gnue@gnu.org
<jcater> poor saps
Action: ajmitch was referring to the gnu software package, mailman, fyi :P
<ajmitch> jcater: they're just waiting for every crumb of info that you leak to them
<chillywilly> breathless in anticipation
<jcater> jamest: no site updates for a month
<chillywilly> hmm, why do I have the song "secret agent man" stuck in my head?
<jcater> wassup with that?!?!?
Action: jcater ducks
<chillywilly> *quack*
<ajmitch> jcater: btw is anon access to subversion on ash sorted?
<chillywilly> that would most likely be a big negatory good buddy
<ajmitch> ah well
<jamest> what site?
<jcater> adrius
<jamest> i've been meaning to
