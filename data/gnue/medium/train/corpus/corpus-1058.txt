<siesel> hi :)
<chillywilly> yo
<chillywilly> anyone have an example of programitcally using the db abstraction layer in gnue common? ;P
<siesel> there should be one in jcater's public_html dir.
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/common/api/ <-- sweet
<siesel> here it is: http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/demo-datasources.py
<siesel> cw: yeah :)
<chillywilly> cool, thanks
<jcater> it's even easier than that
<jcater> let me upload the script I used to print 1099s this year
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/examples/
<jcater> print_1099s.py is read-only db access
<jcater> print_checks.py is read and write
<jcater> print_checks contains a lot of postscript stuff, though
<jcater> but the db stuff is really simple
<chillywilly> cool
<jcater> to say the least, it's hard for me to write python apps these days
<jcater> without using gnue-common
<jcater> :)
<siesel> hey, seems you're getting old and lazy ;)
<chillywilly> cool
<jcater> no doubt
<chillywilly> postscript is evil
<chillywilly> ;P
<jcater> postscript is evil
<jcater> pcl, epson esc/p, etc are eviler
<chillywilly> do you have to use GClientApp?
btami (~tamas@wrr.napnet.hu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> what is someone were to want to use mod_python ;P
<jcater> GClientApp handles init'ing the connections
<chillywilly> they don't need arg parsing then
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> I see
<chillywilly> alrighty
<jcater> look at GBaseApp though
<jcater> it may be better for you
<jcater> does less
<siesel> hi btami
<btami> hi siesel and all
<siesel> cw: if you want to use it in mod_python, it probably make sense to do the initialisation yourself as you won't need the whole GBaseApp.
<btami> siesel: how goes the exams?
<siesel> I'm through, I'm through,.... YEAHH 
<chillywilly> siesel: provided I can figure out how to do that in a reasonable amount of time ;P
<chillywilly> siesel: w00t
<btami> siesel: congrats
<siesel> thx
<chillywilly> siesel: do you have a masters degree now or something?
<chillywilly> or whatever the foreign equivalent is ;P
<siesel> its a magister, which is the first degree to get (i.e. like bacholor) but qualifies to write a doctor thesis. (i.e. like master)
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> hmmm, need to finsih paperwork
<chillywilly> finish
<siesel> btw. about the session management, I would use some extra modules to implement it.
<chillywilly> mod_python has a Session class
<siesel> f.e. http://snakelets.sourceforge.net/ or something else.
<siesel> sorry, I don't know anything about it :)
<chillywilly> can subclass it...but the mechanism I was thinking of using was after an xmlrpc of a login() it will returna  struct of info (session id, etc.) then the  client would have to send back some http header (http basic auth?) with the session info
<chillywilly> on every subsequent xmlrpc call
<chillywilly> does that sound sane? ;P
<siesel> It will work, but the more xmlrpc calls you get the worser you latency becomes
<chillywilly> xmlrpc call of login()
<chillywilly> how does the appserver handle authentication?
<chillywilly> the gnue appserver
<chillywilly> can't someone basically set any headers they want in HTTP and if the client doesn't understand them it just ignores them?
<chillywilly> doesn't matter though as I will write a client wrapper anyway
<chillywilly> just wondering if the spec allowed it
<chillywilly> protocol
<chillywilly> whatever ;P
<chillywilly> siesel: well it's only 1 xmlrpc call then the session info will be in http headers and will have some timeout value
<chillywilly> 1 extra
<siesel> YOu can do authentification through http headers, or XMLRPC extra fields.
<siesel> but this isn't supported by appserver yet.
<chillywilly> extra method params right?
<siesel> So if you use appserver you need this extra method.
<chillywilly> siesel: what is the session concept in appserver used for?
<siesel> Its like a "WWW session", i.e. someone logs in manipulates data and logs out, i.e. one user, but multiple page accesses
<chillywilly> how do you maintain the state between client and server?
<siesel> through a session_id
<chillywilly> how is that passed in?
<chillywilly> ;P
<siesel> it is passed through as an extra attribute with each xmlrpc call.
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> extra function paramter?
<chillywilly> parameter
<chillywilly> can't type
<siesel> so you could reuse it, but it seems to be better to use the mod_python session to store it
<chillywilly> I'd have to subclass it as I'd like to store session info in the db
<siesel> like load(sess_id,'tablename', bla bla)
<chillywilly> it has a MemorySession and a DbmSession
<chillywilly> children of the Session class
Action: btami thinks chillyilly will play in appserver team again :)
<chillywilly> also has a locking mechanism but I fail to see what the point of that is
<chillywilly> why would you lock a session? anyone?
<chillywilly> my connection seems so laggy
<chillywilly> hmmm, nope just the mod_python site is slow
<chillywilly> la lala la la
<siesel> slow. It's not accessible from here :(
<chillywilly> doesn't want to load for me...bah
<dtm> lallala.
Action: chillywilly watches galeon sit and spin
<chillywilly> round and round she goes
<chillywilly> where she stops nobody knows
<chillywilly> hey dee tee eeeemm
<chillywilly> well I think I have docs installed locally
<siesel> shalalala la .... seems we should create a band: "The GNUe La la LA's"
<ajmitch> nah
<dtm> k
<dtm> hey chillx0r and siesel and ajmitch 
<chillywilly> I'll play the guitart
<chillywilly> guitar
<chillywilly> siesel: you can be lead singer
<chillywilly> dtm: will be on the drums
<chillywilly> and ajmitch can play bass
<chillywilly> derek can be our roadie
<chillywilly> jamest: and jcater are the management
<dtm> k
<dtm> lol
<dtm> derek the roadie.  yeah he's got the hard core look.
<chillywilly> hehehe
<dtm> does he have monster chops these days?
<dtm> i got a buddy at google who had the monster chops
<chillywilly> no idea
<chillywilly> google rocks
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> he works at google/
<chillywilly> ?
<chillywilly> damnit fingers, work
<chillywilly> type the right letters
<dtm> hehe
<dtm> yes he does
<dtm> he's their python guru
<chillywilly> w00t
<chillywilly> google rocks cause they use python
<siesel> hey! that's a good song text: ......brm brm ... dammit fingers work, ... work ,, work.... dammit fingers work ...
<chillywilly> that's all anyone needs to point to, to show the powa of the snake ;P

<TittyTwister> Hi.
<chillywilly> rofl
<chillywilly> nice nick
<TittyTwister> <-- The Name? Yeah.
<TittyTwister> Yours 2. :-)
<chillywilly> what's more power than a tornado?
<chillywilly> powerful
<TittyTwister> Dunno.
<chillywilly> a titty twister!
<TittyTwister> Tata Tata Tataaaa.
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> my dad used to say that right before he practically ripped my nipple off
<TittyTwister> GNUe Question: What's the business with the Appserver? How far is it and WHY is it done? Why not take a finished one allready?
<chillywilly> why is it NOT done?
<TittyTwister> Yeah. Why build a new Appserver? ERP - that's ok. No OSS here. But OSS has Appservers a dime a dozen
<chillywilly> because none fit the criteria?
<siesel> althought its called appserver you can't compare it with jboss f.e. because it 
<siesel> is much more specialized.
<siesel> It focuses on business method + data access only and will bring a new method of defining business modules and combining them.
<TittyTwister> @ siesel: Ok, then. WHat's the deal with the GNUe Appserver? Is it faster? Does it do special stuff? Or is it so specialized that everything else is a hideous bloat, no matter how cool the appserver may be?
<chillywilly> other appserver don't speak gnue formats or protocols ;P
<siesel> f.e. you can define modules which enhance basic modules by adding extra fields to standart tables.
<chillywilly> most of the appserver work was already in gnue-common code base so it was just a matter of putting the pieces together
<chillywilly> sire there's more stuff to be done but the core was implemnted easily by using GNUe's common code base
<siesel> and it is written in python :)
<chillywilly> ;P
<TittyTwister> @ chillywilly: Errmmm... No. Nice try, but no, that's no reason. After all, that's the whole point of Appservers: Being able to latch onto whatever format or protocol you want with minimum hassle.
<TittyTwister> PYthon. Yeah, shure. THe appserver I had in mind (the best imho) is also written in Python. Entirely, almost. (Hint, hint)
<siesel> which one? 
<TittyTwister> It would be way cool for prototyping too.
<siesel> the one similar to your name?
<TittyTwister> Wanna guess?
<TittyTwister> No.
<TittyTwister> ??? (simular to my Nick???)
<TittyTwister> LOL
<ajmitch> zope :P
<TittyTwister> Bingo. 100 point and the washing machine go to <ajmitch>
<dtm> was zope gpl when gnue starteD?
<siesel> Zope is great, but its web based.
<TittyTwister> GNUe started when? Half a year ago? (Thats when I heard of it...)
<dtm> TittyTwister: yeah things start when TittyTwister hears of them.  the world ends on the other side of this door.
<siesel> GNUe is older than zope. even older than the persistent web stuff zope evolved out
<TittyTwister> I did NOT say that GNUe started last year!
<TittyTwister> Ok. Sorry about that. THat explains alot.
<dtm> uh, yeah.  you did.
<TittyTwister> Actually no. I asked a question. Sorry anyway.
jamest (~jamest@adsl-65-71-168-12.dsl.tpkaks.swbell.net) left irc: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)
<siesel> nevertheless, the reason we didn't use zope is, that zope is way too big, and it uses a ODBMS as backend, while we mostly use RDBMS
<siesel> but I don't fully recall. everything is written down in on kernel cousins gnue.
<chillywilly> gnue supports more dbs than zope ;P
<chillywilly> TittyTwister: maybe I misspoke then the point I was getting is that the appserver is done the "gnue" way...it uses the common code base
<TittyTwister> q <chillywilly>:Really? I'd say Zope supports just as much. With a littel scripting anyway. :-)
<chillywilly> I dunno what the big deal about Zope is
<chillywilly> I've looked at it and I am not that impressed
<TittyTwister> The common code base being? A serious GNU thing I surpose? ... Sorry for asking, I'm a GNU n00b.
<chillywilly> gnue-common module
<dtm> TittyTwister: there's a module called "gnue-common"
<TittyTwister> Ok, got it.
<chillywilly> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/common/api
<siesel> TittyTwister: there are many gnue core developers using Zope. Me too, but I don't use it for everything :)
jamest (~jamest@adsl-65-71-168-12.dsl.tpkaks.swbell.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> hi jamest 
<TittyTwister> @ chillywilly: Zope is a slowpoke and obviously hideously bloated for GNUe needs. And since GNUe - as I know now - is brewing since the dawn of manking...errr... since befor Zope was GPLd I understand that this Zope thing is a non-issue.
<jamest> hi
<siesel> hi j
<TittyTwister> Hi.
<siesel> amest 
<siesel> oops. :)
<TittyTwister> @ chillywilly: Yet: Zope roxxors imho. Object relational is the way to go in the future. No DB connectivity crap or that kind of stuff. You just need a solid stat disk and your in butter. :-)
<dtm> mmmMMmmmm  .. buttah!!
<chillywilly> I need to dump my kaddress book and import it into evolution
<dtm> you need to use ldap.
<dtm> set it up with me!
<chillywilly> I could just run my own server ;P
<chillywilly> hmmm, I should do that
<chillywilly> a nice centralized addressbook
<TittyTwister> A general GNUe question (new topic): How is GNUe developing speedwise and what are the current problems? Is real world use of GNUe widespread?
<chillywilly> that would rock
<jamest> we're slow
<jamest> damn slow
<jamest> slower than that actually
<TittyTwister> I thought so.
<chillywilly> molasses?
<jamest> but it used daily in some locations
<ajmitch> slower than continental drift
<chillywilly> oozing puss outta an infected wound
<TittyTwister> Dig this: You started before(!!) Zope was GPLd. LOL
<chillywilly> Zope does not have the same goals as GNUe
<chillywilly> the comparison is retarded
<jamest> we're still slow
<dtm> there was an authoritative company behind Zope, proper
<TittyTwister> Yeah, yeah. I got it. I DID NOT compare the two. Promise: I won't mention the Z word here again. Deal?
<TittyTwister> What are the current 'big issues' with the GNUe developement?
<jamest> we need people willing to work on solutions using gnue
<jamest> we need appserver a bit further along
<jamest> the ui system needs expanded 
<jamest> then polish and a little tlc
<jamest> the tools that exist work well enough 
<jamest> but projects like gnue-sb are going slow
<TittyTwister> INtel: I'm working on a custom ERP / SCM solution for a customer. Compiere creeps me out and I'm a Python guy. I'm considering using an existing ERP framework, if it's easy enough getting into the code. Is GNUe messy or clean? I presume clean, since GNUes taking time. No?
<jamest> lol
<jamest> it's clean enough
<TittyTwister> What's gnue-sb?
<jamest> gnue small biz
<jamest> we've started working on api docs internally
<jamest> and I know jcater started going thru some old code this week and determined we were on crack or something
<jamest> but for the most part it's pretty clean
<jamest> but I'm bias :)
<jcater> it is clean
<jcater> it's just a large code base
<jamest> gnue-common rocks IMHO
<jcater> yes
<TittyTwister> Ah. So small-biz module (LOL) whatever that may be - needs some help. What standards in financial tracking accounts does GNUe support? Or is it all custom?
<jcater> was just telling chillywilly
<jcater> how I can't write a python program these days
<jcater> w/o using gnue-common
<TittyTwister> So GNUe-common == large code base. How may lines aprox?
<jamest> hang on
<jamest> checking
<dtm> TittyTwister: you could download it and run 'wc'
<jamest> dtm: sloccount
<dtm> but of course.
<dtm> HI JAMEST
<jamest> Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 20,433
<jamest> that's for gnue-common
<jcater> wc returns 47K
<jamest> it doesn't include any other gnue-* tools
<jcater> which of course isn't accurate
<jcater> as that's comments, included
<jamest> i think sloccount ignores comments
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> just pointing it out :)
<TittyTwister> 50K lines. That seams reasonable. That's the upside of 'being slow'. :-=
<TittyTwister> ))
<jamest> i'll run the count project wide :)
<TittyTwister> Err... and it _seems_ reasonable too. Don't know about the seams, actually. Maybe they're threading. LOL.
<TittyTwister> What about the site? Sorry, but the visual design is... well, how should I  put it? It's subobtimal.
<jamest> Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 64,726
<jcater> well, we're not web designers
<TittyTwister> Thx.
<jcater> that's the only excuse I can give
<jcater> none of us particularly love the website
<jamest> i blame derek
<jcater> but then again, it works
<jcater> true
<TittyTwister> Care if I pitch in? Who's got the sitecode?

<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> your site looks like a bad acid trip to me ;P
<TittyTwister> Honestly now?
<dtm> chillywilly: roffle
<chillywilly> well the about page is all blurry
<chillywilly> makes me feel like I am trippin'
<dtm> i wouldn't know anything about that.
<ajmitch> DEAR LORD MY EYES!!
<TittyTwister> Well, I get eye-cancer from gnue...org. Really.
<dtm> yeah, reading is hard
<chillywilly> well, I have a graphics artist buddy who can kick ass
<chillywilly> http://ui4.metalexpress.net/metal_mockup.jpg
<dtm> yeah that's coz he's in collusion with the Ass Hospital
<chillywilly> created by him
<dtm> and their primary supplier, Ass Remedies, Inc.
<dtm> how very DISINGENUOUS of him, chillywilly!!

<dtm> TittyTwister: gnue.org
<dtm> chillywilly: i wouldn't dare
<dtm> chillywilly: but i like the current one better
<dtm> imho
<TittyTwister> metal-mockup isn't that a good design. It looks to size and aspect ration dependent IMHO.
<chillywilly> I don't
<dtm> k
<chillywilly> it's just a rough thing, you can change teh size
<chillywilly> the
<TittyTwister> Just for the book: I wouldn't completely redo gnue...org, but change some colors, some fonts and add a little css.
<chillywilly> gnuenterprise.org
<chillywilly> what's so hard about typing that ;P
<chillywilly> gnue.org
<TittyTwister> gnuenterprise.org... thx. No I can copy and paste. :-)
<chillywilly> g-n-u-e-n-t-e-r-p-r-i-s-e.org
<chillywilly> dubya dubya dubya dot gah-new enter piiiize dot org
<TittyTwister> Here are some really good css based designs with zero eye and browser suckage: www.csszengarden.com. There you find the best designers in the world. I personally would suggest something like www.alistapart.com stylewise for gnuenterprise.org. My 2 Eurocents.
<dtm> i'm sure we can discuss something productive :)
<dtm> wasn't someone interested in some solution of some kind
<chillywilly> productive?
<chillywilly> wassat?
<chillywilly> I am much too tired to be productive
<dtm> that's like eating cauliflower with ranch, but with a computer instead.
<dtm> i think
<dtm> wait, no it's not.
<chillywilly> soon the SB will be on then I can sit on the couch like a lump
<dtm> k i dunno
<TittyTwister> <dtm>: I'm starting 2 understand why GNUe takes so long. :-)
<dtm> TittyTwister: YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!!!!
<dtm> :]
<chillywilly> it's sunday for srying out loud
<dtm> TittyTwister: so get to it!
<chillywilly> crying
<siesel> TittyTwister: ccs zen garden, is a great site. I especially like the bonsai theme.
<TittyTwister> What? Designing?
<chillywilly> the limit of my productivity functionas sunday appropaches is equal to 0
<siesel> TittyTwister: btw. did the scm system you plan to do, just focus on basic management, or will it include de-bottleneck optimization stuff?
<TittyTwister> It would probably be _very_ customized. Yet right now we are considering to kick off modularization, so I thought it would be fitting to check out some ERP stuff. There are no de-bottleneck accounts or stuff like that to handle, if that's what you mean.
<siesel> ok, so you mainly need inventory functions and specialized workflows. 
<TittyTwister> Yes.
<TittyTwister> Manly some heavly automized SCM stuff.
<TittyTwister> My client is in the E-Commerce game.
<TittyTwister> And he used Interchange.
<TittyTwister> That over-the-top Perl based webshop.
<dtm> haaa!!!  TittyTwister, does he still use it?
<TittyTwister> Yes.
<dtm> sweet
<chillywilly> IC is pretty nifty
<chillywilly> but complex
<dtm> TittyTwister: what's the url if you are allowed to say
<TittyTwister> We just startet. After ditching that Zope based insult to all software called 'bizarshop'. If you ever run into that: Run far away fast!
<TittyTwister> www.buchelefant.de
<chillywilly> oscommerce sucks too ;P
<chillywilly> run far away from that
<dtm> hahahah "bizarshop"
<jcater> chillywilly: I tried oscommerce a few years ago
<dtm> jcater: :-o
Action: jcater still shudders from the experience
<dtm> YEARS?  when it was even WORSE?
<TittyTwister> oscommerce is cool. But Interchange is older and has more gadgets.
<jcater> dtm: I don't think oscommerce has changed any in those years
<dtm> yes if by "cool" you mean "horribly disfigured excuse for an application"
<jcater> I use interchange for a site now
<jcater> I have mixed feelings though
<dtm> jcater: you must reduce and control your feelings.
<dtm> Clear your mind.
<dtm> Let the force floooowwwww.
<dtm> Or control you, they will!!!
<TittyTwister> YOu think oscommerce sucks? Check this: http://www.bizarsoftware.com/. THe Zope license should forbid this company to use their appserver.
<dtm> jcater is sad coz he hasn't fixed gpg email yet
<dtm> TittyTwister: *snortchortle*
<dtm> hehehe
<chillywilly> heh, stupid slogan
<chillywilly> stupid name too
<TittyTwister> Forget the name and the slogan. The site isn't half bad. But the product is a massive heap of BS.

<dtm> oh i most definately noticed that.  congrats
<dtm> that's what i was thinking
<siesel> TittyTwister: it should be quite easy to build a SCM on the inventory stuff which is already in gnue-sb. 
<TittyTwister> THey've got 26 metric tons of used books to sort and evaluate. They#ve got no time to make-up their site. :-)
<TittyTwister> @ seisel: THX. I'll check into it.
<chillywilly> where the hell does kaddressbook store the data?
<chillywilly> bah
<siesel> The plus of using gnue is, that gnue already has good design tools, which helps with developing custom stuff ...
<ajmitch> chillywilly: use phpgroupware ;)
<chillywilly> I think I will go with LDAP but that doesn't help me now

Action: siesel has to sleep.
<TittyTwister> @ seisel: I suppose it's not too hard to grasp the design tools and that they are ok for building control frontends for bots? cause thats what we're doing: building 'bots.
