<reinhard> hello lsa
<reinhard> any questions we can answer for you?
Action: reinhard saw the ".at" in the signon line
<lsa> hallo reinhard
<lsa> nice to see another .at
<nickr> la de dee
<lsa> no questions except for whether you know a reference project realised in a gnuenterprise suite
<reinhard> dneighbo, jcater and jamest use GNUe Forms, Reports and Designer
<reinhard> in production
<reinhard> for projects they are involved in
<lsa> i see
<reinhard> GNU Enterprise as a whole (read: the end application - finance, supply chain etc) only exists on paper by now
<lsa> what/who the hell are dneighbo, jcater and jamest ?
<reinhard> from what i hear forms/reports/designer can be used fairly well as a m$ access replacement
<jamest> pathetic losers from the US
<reinhard> they are all here as we speak :)
<lsa> :-)
<reinhard> dneighbo and jamest are real persons
<jamest> they look, smell, and act kinda funny most the times
<reinhard> jcater is a coding anderoid
<jamest> powered by donuts
<jamest> he rocks
<lsa> we have been assigned a smaller contract to migrate from a m$ access application and we thought about gnuenterprise as well
<^chewie> I'm not here at all
<reinhard> cool
Action: ^chewie grins
<lsa> but the project had to be web-based and gnuenterprise did not provide this interface
<reinhard> ah
<lsa> so we chose phpgroupware and coding has begun
<^chewie> lsa: we chose zope instead
<lsa> aha
<^chewie> lsa: now, a zope product to gnu enterprise would be pretty cool
<^chewie> ;-)
<jamest> ^chewie: yip
<^chewie> IMHO, PHP is good for quick hacks
<lsa> we didn't like zope because it provides a really thick layer and a stripped-down python
<lsa> (non-standard python) we saw many complaining about the language
<lsa> we dont like big-n-fat apps
<lsa> gets you very much exposed to problems in the middleware
<^chewie> lsa: hmmm...  Not sure I agree with your assessment of zope yet
<^chewie> lsa: but I'll keep an open mind
<^chewie> ;-)
Action: lsa thanks chewie for his opennes
<dneighbo> interesting
<dneighbo> gnue right now is PRIME for replacing access applicatinos
<dneighbo> er applications
<dneighbo> i.e. i think that would be the #1 use as it sits today
<^chewie> the one feature I like most about zope is the templating as opposed to embedded markup
<dneighbo> the 'need web' is interesting
<dneighbo> will your application be GPL?
<^chewie> dneighbo: true, but we don't want to push out libraries w/each client
<^chewie> think thin client as a requirement
<^chewie> super-thin
<lsa> how would you migrate from a damn m$ access apps?
<dneighbo> um yeah mozilla or i.e. are thin
<lsa> dneighbo: of course GPL
<dneighbo> super thin
<^chewie> lynx is thin
<^chewie> w3m is thin
<dneighbo> if you are making people use lynx for a production application i pity your users
<dneighbo> :)
<^chewie> I pity them anyway
<dneighbo> btw: the correct answer is mozilla,i.e. might be thick thin clients
<dneighbo> BUT in our case they are already on the machine
<lsa> many of the users come with their own crap OS
<lsa> with a broken browser.
<^chewie> I never bring focus to a particular HTML rendurer
<lsa> why haven't you pushed the html interface of gnue?
<lsa> (as first interface)
<^chewie> the fact that there are many different HTML rendurers for many different platforms with MOSTLY the same output gives us a LOT of flexibility
<^chewie> they do
<^chewie> but they're experimental
<^chewie> I think there's a PHPForms out there, right?
<lsa> dunno
<dneighbo> there is phpclient in cvs now (iirc)
<dneighbo> also a webware one (though it might not be in cvs)
Action: ^chewie nods
<dneighbo> the main reason we dont/havent pushed it
<^chewie> not familiar w/webware
<dneighbo> is most of our core things webapplications suck
<dneighbo> we fully want gnue to support them
<dneighbo> but we are 'excited' to be coding them :)
<^chewie> they do, but there is a reason for even 'sucky' front ends, such as pushing out portions of software to a web
<dneighbo> an example would be jcater's situation
<dneighbo> 40 nodes using LTSP
<dneighbo> shared gfd's
<dneighbo> shared gnue setup
Action: ^chewie nods
<lsa> gfd?
<dneighbo> why bother complicating stuff with a shitty browser :)
<dneighbo> gnue forms definition
<lsa> aha
<dneighbo> its what gets read by the forms engine to create a gui
<^chewie> the largest reason why client/server apps suck on web browsers is because there is no true MVC model
<^chewie> the protocol doesn't really allow it
<dneighbo> people get too caught up with 'web' model imho
<dneighbo> if you at cvs i think jcater recently checked in 'static' version stuff for gnue
<jamest> yeah! a shitty forms client is so much better!
<dneighbo> so an admin's life is cake to keep clients up to date
<^chewie> heh
<dneighbo> jamest: roflmao
<gontran> <phm>heterogenous os environs demand a web-based solution
Action: jamest is working in forms code today :)
<lsa> dneighbo: sure, but how to provide the interface to people we cannot change the OS&browser of?
<dneighbo> gontran : um thats bull shit :)
<dneighbo> gnue runs on same platforms as browsers :)
<gontran> I'm trying to get it out of my head
<^chewie> more software to push out
<dneighbo> lsa: i dont think gnue cant run on any O/S that there is a browser for
<gontran> dneighbo: yer rite, it's mostly hype
<dneighbo> ^chewie : i just said jcater checking in STATIC ability for gnue
<^chewie> ;-)
<dneighbo> so its 'shared' install
<dneighbo> iirc
<lsa> but then i have to tell 200+ users out there in the country to install a damn client they wont manage it ever
<dneighbo> the only time i see web app having a real advantage
<dneighbo> is if you have LOTS of clients you are not in any control of
<gontran> create a nice installer?
<dneighbo> i.e. CLASSIC web applications
Action: lsa fully agrees with <dneighbo>
<dneighbo> lsa: i just said that is only place where there is advantage of web app is a true disparate system
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> i dont many companies wanting inventory, financials etc shared by the masses of the internet
<dneighbo> most of those applications are behind firewalls and on VPNs where the stuff is controlled (imho)
<^chewie> s/internet/Intranet/
<dneighbo> so when i say i shudder at web accounting
<dneighbo> i see no ADVANTAGE to web
<dneighbo> yet i see a very real disadvantage in ease of use
<dneighbo> a. the widgets are not conduvice to high volume entry/validation
<dneighbo> b. statelessness sucks :)
<dneighbo> that said its EXTREMELY important for gnue to have a webclient :)
<gontran> heh
Action: lsa agrees
<^chewie> brb
<reinhard> bbl
Action: reinhard is away: shower
<lsa> what about java applet clients (i dont like java too much)
<jamest> java!
<jamest> argh!
Action: jamest grabs his mallet
<lsa> how are you going to realise the web client?
<jamest> server side for now
<lsa> what's on the clients side?
<jamest> the browser only
<lsa> plain html, dynamic html, javascript, ...?
<dneighbo> yip
<dneighbo> like normal web application
<dneighbo> btw: an applet is not a web application
<dneighbo> as you have to download .java files to your computer
<lsa> right
<dneighbo> so your argument of 'distribution' to lots of users over the world is then lost
<dneighbo> as every time you upgrade they will have to redownload applet etc.... (iirc)

<Chipaca> hi all
<dneighbo> with geas i think we can have something similar to applets
<dneighbo> you download (via good installer) the client
Action: lsa cites himself: "(i dont like java too much)"

<^chewie> hmm...
<^chewie> I notice that the debian/control file for forms lists the package as python-gnue-forms
<^chewie> the existing package is called gnue-forms (woody)
<^chewie> yet doing apt-get source gnue-forms reveals no debian/. specific files
<^chewie> do you know what the "real" name of the package should be?
<^chewie> I realize that the python naming practice in debian seems to be "python-<something>".
<^chewie> however, since the gnue apps all relate to eachother, I don't see anything wrong w/just leaving it as "gnue-forms" w/the assumption that it's a python app.

<chillywilly> hey did you knwo thwey want to regulate the internet with the FCC?
<dneighbo> doesnt suprise me much
<chillywilly> teySorry, but this is really late notice.  Tomorrow is the last
<chillywilly> day for comments on the FCC's proposal to call the Internet
<chillywilly> an "information service" for the entrenched broadband
<chillywilly> interests.  Ostensibly, this decision is being made in
<chillywilly> preference over classifying broadband internet as a
<chillywilly> "communications medium," which would place it under
<chillywilly> regulations like those phone companies are subject to.  It
<chillywilly> is therefore being characterized as a decision for
<chillywilly> deregulation versus regulation.
<chillywilly> Anybody who can, PLEASE send in a note saying this is not a
<chillywilly> question of whether regulation or deregulation is better
<chillywilly> policy (this is just a smokescreen) -- it's a question of
<chillywilly> the nature of the online medium:  Is it a "content" delivery
<chillywilly> system, or a communications medium characterized by its
<chillywilly> fundamental two-way protocols, one which brings profound new
<chillywilly> capabilities to all citizens?
<chillywilly> *Please* send even just a short note to the FCC at
<chillywilly> ecfs@fcc.gov.
<chillywilly> If you know any other constituencies that would want to put
<chillywilly> a word in on this, please let them know.

<dneighbo> um how does this help you
<jcater> dude
<dneighbo> as you dont want them all sharing the same desktop right?
<jcater> running VNC servers on my remote Win32 machines
<jcater> has saved me hours^Wdays in support
<chillywilly> it helps you amdin them as you can connection and manipulate their desktop
<dneighbo> yes
<chillywilly> remotely
Action: jcater takes control of the user's desktop
<jcater> "well, no, you *didn't* select that option.

<jcater> ah
<jcater> lol
<jcater> no
<jcater> management
<jcater> my users can't leave well enough alone

<jcater> "My computer is broken"
<dneighbo> but as support tool it makes PERFECT sense
<jcater> my guys: Um, no it can't be... you use the EXACT same computer as the other 39 ppl
<jcater> girl: But, it doesn't work right
<jcater> two days later...
<dneighbo> btw: fluxbox has full 'kde tray' support iirc
<jcater> girl: Um, I found out that if I log in under someone else's name, it works fine
<dneighbo> so you could run this right in fluxbox in the 'slit'
<dneighbo> and yes 'slit' is what they really call it
<jcater> my guys: Well, DUH! you can't leave well enough alone!

<dtm> i was intending for that Taco Bell photojournal to be arranged and sent to Pantera -- also a Mexican word, and a band from Texas, and big fans of Taco Bell hence they too share a common bond to your heritage
<dtm> although i think the link to Taco Bell has something to do with constantly smoking weed
<dtm> i'm not sure coz i dont do that

<gontran> w00t, why is tex bad for docs?

<dneighbo> gontran: if its not GPL compatable its bad
<dneighbo> as it means it can not be used in 70% of our community
Action: gontran nods
<dneighbo> i.e. 70% of the community is GPL
<dneighbo> anything not compatiable INSTANTLY bows out of being reused
Action: gontran nods somemore
<gontran> they seem commited to "open-source" with a bsd style implication

<StyXman> I'm trying to run gdesigner under my user only
<StyXman> but no lick
<StyXman> s/lick/luck/
<jamest> what's the error?
<StyXman> NameError: global name '_' is not defined
<StyXman> it says it can't fint the messages for gettext, I think...
<jamest> :(
<jamest> you running latest cvs?
<StyXman> (that's what I guess from the warnings before the bt)
<StyXman> jamest: yeap. but I don't/can't install it in /usr/local. I'm not root here...
<jamest> no need 
<jamest> this is a localization error :(
<jamest> my cvs copy here is trashed at the moment so I can't even test that :(
<jamest> let me see if I can get my copy running again real quick
<StyXman> and I *hate* how my personalizations to files like setup.cfg is written over with setupcfg..in

<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> jcater : do you have functional cvs and a few minutes to test something
<jcater> yes and maybe
<jamest> my cvs is broken at the moment
<jamest> StyXman says that designer will not run but I can't test it
<jcater> um
<jcater> what's the problem
<jcater> it opens for me
<jcater> is it a specific action that's causing it to crash?
<StyXman> gimme just two secs, I'll try another thing
<jamest> NameError: global name '_' is not defined
<jcater> ah
<jcater> I bet he has a locale setting
<jcater> whereas I don't 
<jcater> so mine is falling back to the dummy _
<StyXman> jcater: nope. it's that every path is hardcoded.
<StyXman> everythun points to /usr/local
<jcater> eh?
<jcater> oh
<jcater> lemme look
<StyXman> and I don't have rights there...
<jcater> you running cvs copy, I presume?
<StyXman> yeap
<StyXman> is setup.cfg used for anything?!?
<jcater> not for cvs install
<StyXman> jcater: :( ok, I'll try to point to where it should. if I have some spare time, I'll try to fix local instalatiopn.
<jcater> wait
<jcater> did you run ./setup-cvs.py
<jcater> or the individual ./setup.py scripts in each tool?
<StyXman> should I run './setup.py devel' with sdist or build?
<StyXman> er, I run setup-cvs.py, but it doesn't install designer.
<jcater> ?
<jcater> it should install a gfdes
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I do see a bug in setup-cvs.py
<jamest> i didn't do it!

<jcater> Anyone running CVS copy of tools:
<jcater> Please update your CVS checkout,
<jcater> do a rm -f ~/gnue/translations,

<jcater> err, my commit failed
<jcater> hang on
<jcater> ok, now it's committed
<StyXman> jcater: I just used ~/src/work/fvl/gnue/live 
<jcater> as your base directory?
<StyXman> must it be ~/gnue?
<jcater> no
<jcater> but adapt that statement to your local setup :)
<StyXman> ok, I'lll try now.
<StyXman> ah, ok :)
<jcater> StyXman: btw, this may not solve your problem
<jcater> but then again it may :)
<StyXman> :)
<StyXman> the readme doesn't say anything about designer...
<StyXman> but 'Creating designer/client/gfdes'
<StyXman> came out the script.. crossing fingers..
<Arturas> jcater: what has changed in /translations?
<StyXman> 'Unable to load locale information falling back to dummy _()'
<StyXman> but it loaded..
<jcater> Arturas: I changed the way the symlink was created
<jcater> I didn't actually change anything in there
<jcater> but the way it was
<jcater> each time you ran ./setup-cvs.py, 
<jcater> it would create another level of "translations"
<jcater> i.e., after 4 runs
<jcater> you'd have translations/translations/translations/translations/
<StyXman> with Baa B-baa Baa I mean 'this is darn great!' :)
<Arturas> jcater: my mistake, sorry
<jamest> Arturas: i did change the way the stuff loaded
<jamest> you shouldn't need to import GImport anymore
<jamest> _() should just always work :)
<StyXman> what's _() used for?
<Arturas> when you have string in English
<StyXman> is the translator function?
<Arturas> it shows, that this string has translations
<Arturas> yes
<StyXman> using gettext...
<Arturas> yes
<StyXman> ok, U get it.

<sledge_> hi there
<StyXman> ok, I can ask about designer, right?
<jamest> i dunno
<jamest> does it mean more work for us?
<StyXman> from Desugner.py, I realize that it can handle several instances. I think an instance is like the representation and handler of a form?
<jamest> i believe so
<StyXman> 'believe'?!?
<jamest> i don't know the designer code well 
<jcater> StyXman: yes
<jamest> but it can handle multiple forms open
<jcater> well, technically, it's an instance of a designer object
<jamest> as for how the handlers work I don't knwo
<sledge_> StyXman: yes, from what i've seen
<jcater> with FormsInstances being the only currently implemented type
<jcater> but we'll also have report instances, biz rules instances, etc
<sledge_>  damnit gotta go bye

<jcater> I try not to admit that in public
<StyXman> (are you...? I need to practise more my english... :(
<StyXman> :))
<StyXman> ok, supposse you're not. you'll be hearing a lot from me (mostly just questions) in the following days... sorry to infrom that :)
<StyXman> uh, what does * mean to python? as in 'return c(self, *args, **parms)'
<StyXman> (Designer.py:298)
<jamest> variable number of args and parms passsed to the function c
<jamest> if c is called
<jamest> c(1,2,3,4,5)
<jamest> then args gets them all as (IIRC) a list
<jcater> if you have a list, l, set to ['test','bob','jane'], then c(*l) is the same as c('test','bob','jane')
<jcater> err, what jamest said
<jamest> the parms are filled with a  dict is c is called like
<jamest> c(foo=1,bar=2,jcater=3,donut=4)
<jamest> with keys foo,bar,jcater,donut and values 1,2,3,4 respectively
<StyXman> uf! I got a flashback to C... brrr!
<jcater> well, at least we don't have any
<jcater> asm {

Action: dneighbo was really thinking of trying to make it like a library in a sense
<dneighbo> i.e. categorized, searchable etc etc
<dneighbo> and then i started thinking hey wait some of this stuff is the same thing a lawyer or doctor or xxx might need to get at their 'documents'
<dneighbo> maybe i should be thinking about document management here
<nickr> yea
<nickr> in my current plan
Action: dneighbo wasnt even getting into versioning and such
<dneighbo> just a front end to find whats there
<nickr> it allows youto store a notional docgument as a URL/md5 sum or thhe actual data
<dneighbo> as right now someone says where can get mroe information on X
<nickr> I don't havwe my clipboard here
<dneighbo> and i have to grep and grok and groan to try to remember where all the files are that might be relevant
<nickr> tonight I'll do a dia of the schema I havwe in mind
<nickr> on the metadatabase side
<dneighbo> so even a database that does meta data
<dneighbo> and just stores a url would be a huge win :)
<nickr> the metadatabase and actual storage thing are pretty independent
<nickr> and so is the libarary which is a layer on top of metadatabase
<nickr> I'll start laying out the metadatabase componant when I get the chance
<nickr> its actually kind of neat
<nickr> you recall before that I had a fixed sort of versiniong relationship?
<nickr> I changed that so there are 'relationship objects' which define various classes of relationships between documents
<nickr> eg version-of, derivative-of, etc
<nickr> each would be well defined so you could track the genaelogy of a particular document
<nickr> these rel/ationships could also provide heuristics for inheriting metadata

<jcater> dneighbo: you here?
<reinhard> jcater: may i throw a quick question?
<jcater> can I duck?
<jcater> sure
<reinhard> does the pygresql dbdriver work and is it compatible with the python-pygresql package in debian?
<reinhard> (sorry that's *two* quick questions)
<jcater> um
<jcater> as far as I know it does
<reinhard> ok
<jcater> however, I think jamest was noticing some issues w/pygresql and Postgres 7.2+
<jcater> but I can't confirm or deny that
<reinhard> just seemed to me as most of you use pypgsql
<reinhard> which otoh isn't in debian
<jcater> I use psycopg or pypgsql
<reinhard> (at least not in woody)
<jcater> psycopg is in there
<jcater> and that's what the debian ppl usually use
<jcater> we use pypgsql on Win32 
<jcater> as that's the only pre-compiled win32 lib we can find
<reinhard> ok found python-psycopg thanks
<Arturas> bye :)

<dneighbo> i use pyscopg on gnu/linx
<dneighbo> pygresql on windows
<dneighbo> only cause i cant get anything else to work on windows :)
<gontran> hmm, didn't see pyscopg mentioned in the readmes :)
<sledge_> jcater: packages.debian.org/testing/sound/mp3burn.html -> it does
<jcater> sledge_: cool, thx
<sledge_> btw, some guy at school claimed that there would be lower cpu usage if you decode mp3s just by tuning to lower volume *g*
<jcater> um
<sledge_> s/if you decode/when decoding/
<jcater> this is a dumb question
<jcater> but how do I know which device my cdr uses?

<jcater> so what would my /dev be for cdrecord?
<sledge_> do you have multiple cdrs/cdwriters?
<jcater> nope
<jcater> just a single IDE one
<jcater> kreatecd works just fine
<sledge_> ls -la /dev/cdrom :-)
<jcater> but I don't know what device it is actually using
<sledge_>  /dev/cdrom is default, and it is usually a link to the real device, created by the distribution during installation or upgrade
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> but that's just the cdrom device
<jcater> found it...
<jcater> /dev/sg0 is what it wants
<sledge_> damn, yeah, of course, i forgot that cdwriters are supported through scsi emulation ...
<jamest> the pygresql driver may have some issues
<jamest> with our prefetching of records
<reinhard> hmm
<reinhard> i think i have a problem with my postgres setup
<reinhard> "psql gnue" works
<reinhard> "psql -h localhost gnue" gives me

<jamest> also postgresql 7.2.1 and pypgsql don't seem to get along with text field items
<jamest> you need to modify your pg_hba.conf file
<reinhard> thanks
<reinhard> now i've got gnuef working with a database on this machine
<reinhard> guess it's only a matter of understanding the code to see how common db access works
<jamest> i think I started to doc that

<jamest> I'll see about checking it in this afternoon incomplete
<sledge_> btw, what's the current status with documentation with regard to the doc tools (sgml?)
<reinhard> jamest: thanks
<reinhard> sledge_: you sure you want to ask that?
<reinhard> ;)
<sledge_> can i un-ask that question? :)
<gontran> i worked that openjade like a 5 year old slave-child, and couldn't get any docs out
<jamest> sigh
Action: jamest has mental issues thanks to openjade and jade
<gontran> that's ok though, cause I really should be reading code instead
<gontran> :)
<sledge_> just use plain text files and let some stoopid typesetting guy figure it out for the dead tree versions *eg*
<dneighbo> go to #docbook they will help
<jamest> i'd rather continue fixing up the config system for the 0.3.0 installer's use
<gontran> yeah
<jamest> or staple my nads to a tree
<gontran> would hurt less
<jamest> both seem less painful than my last openjade experience
<sledge_> i see.

<jcater> what gives?
<dneighbo> roflmao
<dneighbo> actually i was up until about 2 am coding last night
Action: dneighbo is so shameful
<dneighbo> i build a mass email tool for a client
<sledge_> spam?
Action: dneighbo had one before that was for a one time or local mailer
<dneighbo> but this is so they can do on demand in higher volumes
<dneighbo> sledge_ not really spam but kind of spam
<dneighbo> they only mail people that are registered to their site (they are a job placement company)
<sledge_> aha, fine
<dneighbo> so basically they email job openings to people
<dneighbo> sledge_ : well im ashamed as i think its wrong
<dneighbo> the right thing woudl be to make that a 'registration' option
<dneighbo> to receive email or not
<dneighbo> and only send if they agree
<dneighbo> i have no problem with it being the default optoin
<dneighbo> but ah well its not a general 'spammer' tool so i dont feel too guilty :)
<dneighbo> jamest will you be around this weekend?
<dneighbo> i hav elots of 'issues' hanging out 
<dneighbo> and jcater defers to your blackbelt primary key skilz
<jcater> dneighbo: we've told you over and over
<jcater> there's nothing jamest can do about the red fetish
<reinhard> jamest: i'm looking forward to the common doc
<dneighbo> reinhard didnt you it?
<dneighbo> i posted uml of it
<dneighbo> and full API
<reinhard> i'm slowly heading towards a state where it would help me
<reinhard> dneighbo: no kidding?
<dneighbo> no kidding
<reinhard> where?
<sledge_> um .. uml? where?
<dneighbo> http://gnuenterprise.org/docs/tools/
<dneighbo> is the API
<dneighbo> http://gnuenterprise.org/docs/tools/common.dia
<dneighbo> is the uml (rough)
<sledge_> fine
<dneighbo> http://gontran.net/pub/gnue/common.dia
<dneighbo> is the cleaned up uml
<sledge_> documentation is like sex ... ;)
<dneighbo> when its good its good
<dneighbo> when its bad its better than nothing/
<sledge_> yep :)
<reinhard> dneighbo: not quite what i am looking for
<reinhard> the documentation i mean (not sex)
<sledge_> rofl
<reinhard> fwict it's reformatted source, isn't it?
<jamest> reinhard: I'm sure we can answer questoins too if you need sooner
<jamest> you have lyx?
<reinhard> iirc "sorta"
<jamest> I'm commiting what I have now (it's a mess still)
<reinhard> i can type "lyx" on the command line and a window pops up
<jamest> committing
<reinhard> jamest: which directory? (sorry can't read commit mail from here)
<reinhard> gnue/common/doc ?
<jamest> common/doc/common-techref.lyx
<jamest> dneighbo: i hope to be here some this weekend but have kids
<sledge_> let the kids do the coding :)
<jamest> we'd end up with Poke'forms
<sledge_> d'oh
<jamest> course that's not far from where we are now I guess
<reinhard> jamest: thanks
<jamest> reinhard: I'm changing the config system alot
<reinhard> jamest: sorry maybe i'm just being dumb
<jamest> so if it's documented ignore it :)
<reinhard> can you tell me in 5 sentences
<reinhard> if i have a database and i want to read data out of it what do i have to do?
<reinhard> (using common of course)
<jamest> ah crap
<jamest> i didn't get as far as an exmaple
<jamest> just a sec
<jamest> ok
<jamest> IIRC
<jamest> first you have to initialize a datasource
<reinhard> ok
<jamest> this will require setting a few vars in a datasource instance then calling it's initialize function IIRC
<jamest> you'll also need to create a connection manager
<jamest> and tell the datasource to use it (this gives you connection pooling)
<reinhard> where can i see the instance vars of datasource?
<jamest> probably the best place to look is in GDataSource.py
<jamest> but not at the code
<jamest> er
<jamest> class
<jamest> look at the bottom of the file in the xmlElements 
<jamest> the attributes are the things that can be set from an xml file
<reinhard> ok gotcha
<jamest> is this for geas2
<jamest> ?
<reinhard> no for another project i'm working at
<jamest> ah
<jamest> ok
<reinhard> j/k
<reinhard> sure for geas v2
<reinhard> :)
<jamest> if this is for geas2 and if we use xml files 
<jamest> then you don't really need to worry much about this
<jamest> as the xml parser does the right thing
<reinhard> use xml files for what?
<sledge_> data transfer?
<jamest> defining the datasources 
<sledge_> ah
<reinhard> jamest: geas will define the datasources dynamically i think
<jamest> reinhard?
<reinhard> let me rephrase
<reinhard> _if_ we use xml files
<reinhard> i don't think the parsing of the file will be at the same time as the creation of the datasource object in memory
<jamest> why is that?
<reinhard> well at least this is how i would think it works:
<reinhard> client requests an object from appserver
<reinhard> appserver checks if class name is valid (needs xml definition for that)
<reinhard> if valid then appserver translates classname into table name
<reinhard> then appserver creates datasource object
<reinhard> and fetches the data
<reinhard> would that sound sane?
<reinhard> we have some translation between the xml definitions (= object definitions)
<reinhard> and the database access (= table definitions)
<sledge_> um, i don't understand the "translates classname to tablename" part
<reinhard> sledge_: the ideas is that appserver shows an object oriented interface to the client
<reinhard> most important translation here is namespace
<reinhard> i.e. we will have "modules" with own namespace
<reinhard> to avoid naming conflicts between parts of the application created by different people
<sledge_> i understand better by now.
<jamest> um
<reinhard> all tables of a module will be prefixed by the module name in the db table
<sledge_> aha
dsmith (~dsmith@208.40.56.34) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> i think I see where you are going
<jamest> you're not wanting to tie up memory with unused datasources
<jamest> is that correct?
<sledge_> i get it too. is that documented / flow-charted? would be nice for those like me who are not app-server insiders but still gives good insight.
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> (to jamest)
<jamest> hmmmm
<reinhard> no
<reinhard> (to sledge_)
<reinhard> jamest: i think a final gnue install could have some 100 tables
<sledge_> that's a realistic number
<jamest> that's not too bad for our datasources as they pool connections
<reinhard> plus it will occur that we need 2 datasources pointing to the same table at the same time
<jamest> all you're really storing is table association
<jamest> why 2?
<reinhard> for example 2 users access the same table at the same time
<sledge_> 2 is just an example, you mean something like "n" = any natural number, right?
<reinhard> yes of course
<jamest> i'm not sure that's needed
<jamest> well
<jamest> it would currently be necessary I guess
<jamest> dang it, youre making me think!
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> actually another reason is that i want appserver to be very modular
<reinhard> i.e. to separate the object repository (where the objects are defined) from the database access part
<sledge_> what about queries and programming comfort? i.e.
<sledge_> i have two tables (master/detail) and want to link them at the appserver level
<sledge_> when i only have two table objects, how do i do sql-like joins or something similar on that?
<reinhard> sledge_: our thinking is like
<reinhard> myorders = a list of order objects
<reinhard> then you can do
<jamest> sledge_: I'd do that in 2-tier mode...datasource definitions do master/detail now
<reinhard> order = myorders.firstinstance()
<jamest> geas is different
<reinhard> print order.customername
<reinhard> print order.comment
<reinhard> orderitems = order.items
<reinhard> oneitem = orderitems.firstinstance()
<reinhard> --
<sledge_> ah! now i get it
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> you sure?
<reinhard> you must be quick :)
<jamest> :)
<reinhard> we have objectlists
<reinhard> objects
<reinhard> and every object has fields
<reinhard> a field can be a text or a number
<sledge_> i have thought about it before and that what you say is precisely the same -- i just didn't know how your thought about that is :)
<reinhard> or another objectlist
<sledge_> a tree?
<sledge_> (in the more general sense of the word)
<reinhard> even more a web
<reinhard> you can have customer.orders -> returns a list of all orders of this customer
<reinhard> and at the same time have
<reinhard> order.customer -> returns a single object, the customer of _this_ order
<sledge_> a "tendencially tree-oriented interlinked structure"
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> lol
<jamest> in any case datasource are biased toward being created by the parser
<sledge_> the appserver concept looks simple (implementation isn't, of course)
<jamest> not that it's required but it'll probably need some polish to make it more friendly to the developer not using a parser
<reinhard> jamest: we won't really have a parser here
<jamest> i need to study geas more but most of what you require is _almost_ in common
<jamest> objects have custom namespaces, executable code can be attached to events
<jamest> etc,
<jamest> however most if it is based upon idea that the parser builds the initial structure of the app
<jamest> so we'll have to make some adjustments in common to do it differently
<reinhard> hmmm
<jamest> I've started working on making common more general now
<reinhard> i actually thought there is a pure database abstraction layer in common
<jamest> GConfig is first
<jamest> looks like data system may need to be second
<jamest> :)
<reinhard> didn't think that the parser is integrated with that
<jamest> the parser builds everything
<jamest> well
<sledge_> cs = myblonde.cupsize() ???
<jamest> i take that back
<jamest> the parser builds an inverted tree of app objects
<jamest> then the GClientApp system callings a phasedInitialization system that lets each object set itself up
<jamest> the datasystem makes just such an assumption
<jcater> Objects can be created/added to a parser tree without GParser
<jamest> as there is no clean API to set this up outside the parse
<jcater> just look at designer/Incubator
<jamest> yes
<jamest> but is it clean?
Action: jamest was thinking it was not
<jcater> um
<jcater> that's a loaded question
<jamest> :)
<jcater> no, it's a nasty, perverted setup
<jcater> j/k
<jcater> in my mind, it's clean
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> just my style
<jamest> gnue me baby
Action: jcater dcc's jamest a parser
<jcater> JTParser.py
<jamest> i feel so cheap
<jamest> but I kinda like it
<reinhard> ok now after i have the datasource
<reinhard> what is next?
<jamest> that should be about it
<jamest> you use it to create resultSets
<jamest> which contain recordSets
<reinhard> getResultSet?
<reinhard> oh no
<jamest> which contains your data
<reinhard> createResultSet
<reinhard> ?
<jamest> checking
<jamest> you should be able to call createResultSet
<reinhard> ok
<jamest> if you pass it a condition tree from GConditions then that'll alter the query to match what you require
<reinhard> sounds much like something i will try tomorrow :)
<jamest> a simple example of this is in forms/src/GFObjects/GFBlock.py
<jamest> I'm sure a more robust example would be in reports
<jamest> as forms just does simple AND queries at this time
<sledge_> reinhard: i have cleaned up our discussion on geas2 internals, would you be interested in that text file, perhaps you can build it into your docs?
<reinhard> sledge_: good that you're not _here_
<reinhard> i think i would kiss you now ;)
<sledge_> reinhard: please hold back and think of your wife. *g*
<jamest> reinhard: what would your wife think
<reinhard> :)
<jcater> reinhard: give me about 10 minutes
<jcater> and I'll do a quick demo file
<jcater> maybe that'd help?
<jamest> oooooo
<reinhard> jcater: you'll get even 8 hours
<jamest> jcater is the datasource masta
<reinhard> as i'll go to sleep now
<jamest> it's design is a reflection on the way he thinks
<jamest> I'll leave that to others to determine if that's a good or bad thing :)
<reinhard> but if i have it by tomorrow it's great
<reinhard> sledge_: thanks a lot; this will find it's way into the whitepaper

<sledge_> i18n looks quite good, though german lang support doesn't work (yet :)
<chillywilly> siesel must be Jan then
<chillywilly> or whatever that nick was
<sledge_> i18n should wait before major production releases, because (at least from my experience) having all translations catch up with the primary language is a nasty issue
<sledge_> i think Jan is siesel - he comes from cologne/germany
<chillywilly> well this is all in cvs and is not released at all

<drochaid> hey dneighbo ;)
<drochaid> and jcater
<jcater> err, http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/demo-datasources.py
<jcater> is the demo he was waiting for
<jcater> drochaid: howdy
<siesel> jcater, jamest: is information available about the status of every driver of the db abstraction layer? like x has feature x,y (i.e. introspection) and y is rather instable....
<jcater> um
<jcater> we have common/README.datases
<jcater> it will need to be updated before our release
<drochaid> hey guys, what do I need to install on deb testing to get php working with apache?
<jcater> but is about the best we have
<siesel> drochaid: episode 2 = good eductation for your daughter. You should take her with you. :)
<drochaid> siesel: I have a daughter?? !!! :-o

<drochaid> hmm, got apache installed [and working] php4 was also installed, but it won't display any php pages :-/
<jcater> n
<jcater> yeah
<siesel> you have to add php4 module include line in http.conf
<ajmitch> hi
<jcater> php4 's isntall scripts licks bag
<jcater> it says it's gonna enable the LoadModule, but it never does
<jcater> you need to edit /etc/apache/httpd.conf
<jcater> and uncomment
<drochaid> oh bollocks ... you mean aptitude won't do this for me? :)
<jcater> # LoadModule php4_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/libphp4.so
<jcater> drochaid: it should
<drochaid> that all jcater?
<drochaid> ta
<siesel> hi ajmitch
<jcater> also, you need to uncomment

<drochaid> I'm not sure if libphp4 is installed ... I'll check

<siesel> ajmitch, you're from downunder? Or do just australians call it this way?

<siesel> from which town do you come? north or south island?
Action: siesel been in NZ once and is still missing it...
<drochaid> jcater: ok, they were still commented, now uncommented ... what's the apache restart command?

<drochaid> hey ajmitch
<drochaid> thanks again jcater
<siesel> the biggest scotish town outside scotland cool.
<ajmitch> hehe :)
<siesel> jcater, i didn't look at the obvious places, and oversaw README.databases. but although its quite complete, i still think their are some informations missing for example, if the database adapter supports introspection. 
<jcater> yeah
<siesel> I dunno much about the db abstraction, so I can't add it myself, but i think its quite important.
<jcater> we will add that before the next release
<jcater> which, for the record, we are targeting at next weekend
<jcater> from memory, though
<jcater> introspection is well tested for
<jcater> all the postgresql and oracle drivers
<jcater> and has been used (but not sure to what extent) for
<siesel> mysql?
<jcater> mysql, db2,

<drochaid> wb jcater
<jcater> why, thank you, sir drochaid
<siesel> how can i split an url into transport, host and port?
<jcater> in python?
<siesel> yep.
<siesel> as easy and fast as possible. 
<siesel> i don't want to use regexp if possible.
<jcater> transport, host, port = string.split(yourstring,':',2)
<jcater> ?
<ajmitch> split on ':' and drop // ?
<siesel> THX
<siesel> eeh but how can i cut off the // from the transport?
<jcater> if host[:2] == '//': host = host[2:]
<jamest_> string.split(string.replace(yourstring,'//',''),':',2)
<jamest_> btw
Action: ajmitch luvs python
<jamest_> you'll have to watch the transport, host, port setting
<siesel> transport, host, port, path = \
<siesel>                    string.split(string.replace(yourstring,'//',''),':',3)
<jamest_> if you're missing 2nd : it'll probably error out
<ajmitch> how does one prepend an item to a list, btw?
<Isomer> a=[1]+a
<Isomer> ?
<siesel> in php i allway used regular expressions, but normally this is overkill
<jcater> um
<jcater> here's an idea
<jcater> file:/usr/local/doc/python-2.0.1/lib/module-urlparse.html
<ajmitch> thx Isomer
<jcater> damn, that's local
<jcater> anywho
<jcater> you can import urlparse
<jcater> Example: 
<jcater> urlparse('http://www.cwi.nl:80/%7Eguido/Python.html')
<jcater>  yields the tuple 
<jcater> ('http', 'www.cwi.nl:80', '/%7Eguido/Python.html', '', '', '')
<jamest_>  foo = [1,2,3]
<jamest_> foo.insert(0,5)

<ajmitch> night
<siesel> jcater, i want to enable the appserver tests per setup-cvs.py, because its to complicated to run them standalone. (you have to set INSTALL_PREFIX (for I18) and PYTHON_LIBRARY_PATH). what do you think? 
<jcater> um
<jcater> on my system, I copied gfcvs to gcvs
<jcater> and changed the last line from
<jcater>      /usr/bin/python2.1 /home/jason/cvs/gnue/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/forms/GFClient.py $*
<jcater> to
<jcater>      /usr/bin/python2.1  $*
<jcater> this lets me run any test script using GNUe's environment
<jcater> I was thinking about having this gcvs automatically created by setup-cvs.py
<jcater> what do you think about that instead?
ToyMan (~stuq@c5300-4-ip157.albany.thebiz.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> instead of typing python mytestfile.py
<jcater> you could just do 
<jcater> gcvs mytestfile.py
<siesel> I thought about putting new commands into setup-cvs.py
<siesel> something like gappserv or gappserv-test ...
<jcater> oh, for appserver
<jcater> sure, that makes sense
Action: jcater was thinking you were talking about DonutFactory, et al
<siesel> for donut-factory it would be great to add a gcvstest which show a list of demos, then you can choose one by pressing a number
<jcater> I must run
<siesel> what do you think, whats a good shortcut for the appserver? gascvs  gacvs ascvs gaservs  
<siesel> ok cu
<jcater> gacvs ?
<jcater> that would probably be fine
<siesel> ok. 
<siesel> you can find it in cvs very soon.

<jamest> odd
<the_grunf> you bet
<jamest> i'd have thought that wxGTK would have used it :(
<the_grunf> so, i've tried to compile and install wxGTK
Action: jamest would be tempted to ln -s libpng.so.3 libpng.so.2 :)
<jamest> and see what happens :)
<the_grunf> i tried that as well... :)
<the_grunf> but seems like configure is smarter than i
<jamest> ah
<jamest> does mandrake use rpms?
<drochaid> yep
<drochaid> and mdk is very weird at times
<the_grunf> as i was saying....i've compiled and installed wxGTK....no probs...but wxPython complains about the same libpng.so.2 and it doesn't even compile
<jamest> but it doesn't have rpms for wxPython
<jamest> :(
<jamest> chillywilly: release == real soon now
<the_grunf> yes it uses rpms, i've downloaded all the dependencies and i'm stuck in this prob
<jamest> hmmm
<the_grunf> drochaid: at times ? always, i think
<drochaid> heh
<drochaid> could be
<drochaid> I just rebuilt a server soley for use with postgresql, apache and php ...
<drochaid> and it didn't install or configure php!!
<the_grunf> php is working here...
<drochaid> I've got it working now, it's just their usual install screwups
<drochaid> I still can't believe they configure pgsql to only accept local connections by default
<drochaid> at least they use pg_ctl instead of postmaster now
<the_grunf> i'd like to be able to configure and install gnue to see if i can contribute to something...i've been working as a developer for some years now for a portuguese company that develops software for stock market
<the_grunf> and some guys in there are developing for psions and palms
<the_grunf> so maybe i could help...if i could install this thing...
<jamest> man
<jamest> i don't see where in wxPtyhon it references libpng :(
<jamest> my source is old though
<jamest> one thing you could try
<jamest> in setup.py change the CORE_ONLY = 1
<jamest> i have to do this on solaris to get wxpython to build
<the_grunf> some new data:  rpm -ihv wxPython-2.3.2.1-1mdk.i586.rpm 
<the_grunf> erro: dependências falhadas:
<the_grunf>  wxGTK = 2.3.2 é necessário pelo wxPython-2.3.2.1-1mdk
<the_grunf>  libwx_gtk-2.3.so.1   é necessário pelo wxPython-2.3.2.1-1mdk
<the_grunf>  libwx_gtk_gl-2.3.so.1   é necessário pelo wxPython-2.3.2.1-1mdk
<the_grunf> that's the new problem....but i've just make & make install the wxGTK src dist
<jamest> doesn't rpm dependency checking only look for installed RPM packages
Action: jamest doesn't use a rpm based distro anymore
<the_grunf> dunno....does it ?
<jamest> IIRC you can tell rpm to ignore dependencies during install
<jamest> i think I used to have to do this when mixing source and rpm installs
<the_grunf> humm....let me see
jbailey (jbailey@CPE014260028338.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<the_grunf> it installed...i've never used --nodeps before cause i had a previous "not to good" experience with suse 6.2 and --nodeps rpm instalations
<the_grunf>  python setup.py install
<the_grunf> Checking for available UI drivers....
<the_grunf>   Pyncurses(Currently not working).... No
<the_grunf>   Curses(Currently not working).... OK
<the_grunf>   wxPython.... No
<the_grunf> No valid UI drivers are installed on this machine:
<the_grunf>   wxPython - www.wxpython.org
<the_grunf>   pyncurses - pyncurses.sourceforge.net
<the_grunf>   python curses - Read python install docs on how to activate
<the_grunf> nope
<jamest> damn
<the_grunf> it says wxPython not available
<jamest> do you have a DISPLAY var set?
<the_grunf> grunf
<jamest> as the checking tries to open an connection to your xserver
<jamest> this burns me all the time on remote installs :)
<the_grunf> yup....i'm running X now...
<the_grunf> and my firewall accepts everything local
<jamest> grrrrrr
<the_grunf> (if it's going through tcp)
<jamest> that's frustrating
<jamest> um
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> not that I know if it'll help
<jamest> but in common/scripts/
<jamest> there is a gnue-diag.sh
<the_grunf> it is
<jamest> it was created to scan installs and find issues
<jamest> but it's fairly old
<jamest> not sure if it still works properly
<the_grunf> grunf....it says i have wxPython installed !!!!!
<the_grunf> but there's something not found:
<the_grunf>   /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/pygresql:  *NOT found*
<the_grunf>   /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/psycopg:  *NOT found*

<the_grunf>   /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/MySQLdb:  *NOT found*
<the_grunf> and something else....
<the_grunf> i have egenix-mx-base-2.0.3-py2.1_1 installed, but it says "mxDateTime:  **Not Installed**"
<jamest> :(
<the_grunf> so why is this gnue-diag saying i have wxPython installed and setup.py doesn't...
<jamest> i just did some searching on groups.google.com
<jamest> it seems that libpng2 and libpng3 are seperate packages and wxPython is linked to one or the other depending upon release
<jamest> are there seperate libpng rpms avail?
<jamest> the gnue-diag looks to see if the file exists via a shell command
<the_grunf> lots of them
<jamest> the setup.py  actually trys to import it
<the_grunf> i've been on rpmfind.net, searched for libpng, and there are lots of them...
<the_grunf> what's the version u have on ur system ?
<jamest> ii  libpng2        1.0.12-3       PNG library - runtime
<jamest> ii  libpng2-dev    1.0.12-3       PNG library - development
<jamest> ii  libpng3        1.2.1-1.1      PNG library - runtime
<jamest> I'm running debian
<jamest> also try this
<jamest> open python
<jamest> then try this command
<jamest> from wxPython.wx import *
<jamest> this way you can see the error wx is hitting

<dneighbo> um yes and no
<dneighbo> whats up
<jamest> the_grunf is having troubles installing on it
<jamest> and my rpm skilz are rusty
<the_grunf> err...sorry i was in another window...
<the_grunf> dneighbo, nice to meet u...my problem is this
<the_grunf> when i try to install wxGTK and it says i've no libpng.so.2 installed...i've compiled and installed wxGTK, but wxPython says i have no wxGTK installed
<the_grunf> so i installed wxPython with --nodeps, but still setup.py says i have no wxPython installed

chillywilly (~danielb@mke-65-29-142-117.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> is your wxGTK in /usr/local/lib
<jamest> if so you might need to rerun ldconfig to have it pick it up
<dneighbo> first its bad to mix and match
<dneighbo> either compile everything or compile nothing
<dneighbo> imho
<the_grunf> i already done that....so now i'm uninstalling everything and try to find that libpng.so.2 to install everything again from scratch
<dneighbo> you going to use rpms or source
Action: dneighbo has installed both ways and gotten it to work
<dneighbo> source install is suprisingly easy
<dneighbo> though i would almost bet that all the dependencies are actually on your mandrake disks
<dneighbo> in rpm format
<dneighbo> if you have even a relatively new mandrake distribution
<jamest> he's running 8.2
<dneighbo> i would say probably everything you need is on your disks then
<the_grunf> well at least wxPython is now installing without complain about anything
ra3vat (ds@ics.elcom.ru) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<the_grunf> grunf...still not working...
<dneighbo> what isnt working
<the_grunf> setup.py says i've got no wxPython, but i've got a clue
<dneighbo> hold up
<dneighbo> i think this is probably a python problem
<dneighbo> you have python 1.5.2 still on this machine?
<dneighbo> if so when you installed wxPython it probably installed for python 1.5.2
<dneighbo> and now the operation you are performing is probably looking for it in python 2.x
<dneighbo> and so rightfully its saying it does not exist
<the_grunf> i think so....because i've dowloaded and installed wxPython for Python 2.1
<the_grunf> or something alike....
<the_grunf> what version should i download for python 2.2 ?
<the_grunf> if i go to wxpython.org...there's some problem that the files come with 8Kb and rpm cannot install them
<dneighbo> what version of python do you have?
<dneighbo> type python
<dneighbo> and paste for me the top of the out put
<the_grunf> 2.2
<the_grunf> Python 2.2 (#1, Feb 24 2002, 16:21:58)

<the_grunf> Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
<dneighbo> ah yes you definitely need wxPython2.2
<dneighbo> give me a second
<chillywilly> python --version works too
<chillywilly> or possibly python -V
<the_grunf> yep, but where can i find it ? rpmfind shows me a lot of versions...wich one should i download
<chillywilly> oops, only -V works
<dneighbo> http://www.rpmfind.net//linux/RPM/cooker/contrib/RPMS/wxPython-2.3.2.1-1mdk.i586.html
<dneighbo> that is the package you need the_grunf
<dneighbo> if you look at the bottom of that link it shows python2.2/ in the files
<dneighbo> the_grunf: any luck getting that package
<the_grunf> i got the package, installed it, but still no work
<dneighbo> what happens

<jamest> um
<jamest> just a sec
<jamest> i'll look at it now
<the_grunf> humm....but the rpm i found on gnuenterprise.org is for python 2.1
<jamest> um
<the_grunf> there can i find for python 2.2 ?
<jamest> setup-cvs.py doesn't seem to do dependency checking
<jamest> at least not for things like wxWindows or mxDateTime
<jamest> i understand the wxWindows not being there but I hit jcater up about mxDateTime when he shows up

<dneighbo> is the file you want
<dneighbo> jamest: piss if its not checking for wx that will probably fail still :(
<dneighbo> we will see
<dneighbo> jamest: you gnue'ing or just lurking today?
<jamest> gnue'n at the moment
<jamest> i have till approx noon i think
jcater (~jason@HubA-mcr-24-165-193-24.midsouth.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> can you look at primary key incrementing for me?
<dneighbo> i catn for the life of me get it to work
<dneighbo> and its critical to all the stuff im doing going forward :(
<dneighbo> i even tried building a form from the wizard
<jamest> let me get the config stuff up at least to level of old stuff
<dneighbo> that had it
<jamest> i'm about there
<dneighbo> and just adding the single line and no dice
<dneighbo> ok i have to do some bills and get the_grunf working :)
<dneighbo> then i will look at making you sample
<dneighbo> the_grunf: how is it going?
<jcater> morning all
<jamest> welcome jcater
<dneighbo> jcater: mxDateTime isnt being checked in setup-cvs.py
<dneighbo> and hello :)
<jcater> setup-cvs.py doesn't do any checking
Action: dneighbo will go create ticket
<jcater> er?
Action: dneighbo stops from creating ticket as it sounds like jcater wants that to be the case
<jcater> well, hadn't considered it before
<dneighbo> it probably is a good idea to do it
<jamest> only if it's something all gnue apps depend upon
<the_grunf> dneighbo: it says something about locale translation...do u want me to paste it here ?
<jamest> like the python check
<jamest> as reports doesn't need wx to live
<jamest> but the db driver system dies w/o mxdatetime
<jamest> i almost think this should be part of the installer
<jamest> and the developer setup shouldn't need it
<jamest> course
<jamest> that implies we need to release 
<dneighbo> yes paste here
<jamest> so that people aren't forced to cvs
<jamest> :)
<dneighbo> i think the developer setup should have it all
<dneighbo> as it INSTALLS all packages
<dneighbo> btw: i speak from gnucash disdain
<dneighbo> i wanted to compile it so that i could add a feature and spent a month doing so
<dneighbo> it would have been nice at compile time to get a list of all things it couldnt 'find'
<dneighbo> i do agree about release so that we dont have people using cvs install

psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> so we still have wx problem
<dneighbo> the_grunf: you opposed to doing wxGTK and wxPython from source?
<jamest> psu: hows the web stuff comming?
<the_grunf> i've tried it, but wxPython could compile, so finally i installed everything from scratch (even that libpng.so.2)
<psu> jamest: not too bad. This weekend is the big push to get it "finished" ie. ready for review
<the_grunf> and now..i'm stuck into this
<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> i hate rpm (its the tool of satan)
<the_grunf> :)
<dneighbo> God only knows what it has done
<the_grunf> more or less like windows installer hum ?
<the_grunf> :)
Action: jcater is working on such
<dneighbo> we really need to retrace all your steps
<dneighbo> and systematically uninstall all you have done relating to wx*
<dneighbo> so we have clean slate
<dneighbo> as best i can tell it looks like its installed just not quite correctly
<dneighbo> i.e. its out there under python2.2
<dneighbo> did you ever install wxwindows?
Action: dneighbo would think that hte wxPython rpm would bitch if you didnt
<dneighbo> or the wxGTK
<dneighbo> then again maybe its only when you compile from source you need both (its been a while)
<the_grunf> i installed wxGTK, but not wxWindows
<dneighbo> i think if you install via rpm you dont have to get wxWindows separately
<dneighbo> only if doing source install
<dneighbo> to hose things up
<the_grunf> let me try everything again
<dneighbo> can i get you to uninstall the rpm for wxPython
<dneighbo> and try this one instead
<dneighbo> http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython-2.3.2.1-Py22.exe
<the_grunf> .exe ????

<the_grunf> oops ...sorry for my language
<the_grunf> wxPython-2.3.2.1-1mdk.i586.rpm ---> doen't work

<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> cool
<dneighbo> so you do
<dneighbo> ~/bin/gfcvs intro.gfd
<dneighbo> and you get a form?
<the_grunf> yup
<dneighbo> btw: when people say rpm is as good as apt
<the_grunf> and setup.py (in forms dir) runs without errors
<dneighbo> my response isnt rpm is a bad packaging system
<dneighbo> its that Debian is MUCH better about QUALITY of its packaging :)
<the_grunf> sometimes it's good...
<the_grunf> sometimes not
<the_grunf> if it works it's good
<dneighbo> i have come to fear rpm packaging unless its directly from the distribution :(
<dneighbo> the_grunf: its not rpm that is bad, its the fact that the package maintainers have no cohesiveness 
<the_grunf> so, now tell me...
<dneighbo> as evidenced by what we saw here today :)
<the_grunf> is gnue only programmed in python/php ?
<dneighbo> only python at this point
<dneighbo> it was python/C
<dneighbo> but the part in C is being refactored in python
<the_grunf> i have some knowledge about php, but i'm still learning python
<dneighbo> dcl (a component) of gnue is in php but its migrating to python over time
<dneighbo> bayonne (another component) is in C++ but can be 'programmed' in python
<dneighbo> if you can do php
<dneighbo> you can do python
<the_grunf> so, where can i help ? 
<dneighbo> i PROMISE
<the_grunf> i bought a book about python, and it seems interesting to me
<the_grunf> is there anyone translating the project to portuguese (that might be a start point, while i learn some usefull python)
Action: dneighbo will be conceited here and say gnue is a darn good project to LEARN python on
<dneighbo> as there are lots of examples of things in the code
<the_grunf> do u recomend any book about python 
<dneighbo> um if you know another language (which you seem to)
<the_grunf> i have o'reilly's programming python
<jamest> the_grunf: that is not a good book :(
<the_grunf> i now use mostly c++ and vb (on windows)
Action: jamest has it too
<dneighbo> i suggest david m beazley's 'Python: essential reference'
<the_grunf> that's the one i found...any way i didn't (and don't) know anything about python...

dres (~dres@mail.lewismoss.org) left irc: Client Quit
<dneighbo> the first few chapters explain how to do things in python (tutorial, lexical conventions, syntax, objects, operaters, expressions, control flow)
<dneighbo> basically its no fluff
<dneighbo> its straight up how do i do X
<the_grunf> why i wonder why i can't ever find any book's isbn on amazon.com
<dneighbo> which if you know another language is all you need :)
<dneighbo> um if you got an ISBN then you might buy it elsewhere for cheaper
<the_grunf> that's the idea, my friend
<dneighbo> you dont want to buy from amazon anyhow :)
<the_grunf> i never buy anything on the net....not by cc
<dneighbo> 0735710910
<dneighbo> is the ISBN number
<the_grunf> i have a library here in portugal (bertrand.pt) where i can order them the books from the net and get them at home

<drochaid> good afternoon/evening
<the_grunf> dneighbo: before learning something usefull in python....is there any help needed somewhere else (c/c++, sql, docs, translation...) ?
<dneighbo> we need help everywhere :")
<dneighbo> the place we need help right now the most is people writing applications 
<drochaid> I know a *really* good psychologist dneighbo :)
<dneighbo> they deal in goat fetishes
<dneighbo> who was it that had the pantera?
<drochaid> no no no, she HAS a goat fetish ... not the same thing at all :)
<drochaid> I've got a couple of Pantera albums
<the_grunf> well learning python shouldn't be so dificult (at least as i saw)
<drochaid> Cowboys from Hell and Far Beyond Driven
<jamest> i have pantera
<drochaid> no you don't, I have them, locked in the basement >:-)

<the_grunf> jamest: is there any chance of finding libuuid without being on .deb format ?
<the_grunf> or installing a .deb package in mandrake ?
<dneighbo> yes
<dneighbo> but you dont need it
<dneighbo> i assuem you are looking at geas?
<the_grunf> yup
<the_grunf> you're right
<dneighbo> which is being refactored and is in the appserver directory
<dneighbo> therefore its obsolete
<the_grunf> ahh, ok
<dneighbo> and the new version will not need libuuid 
<dneighbo> fwiw: you can get libuuid in i think the efs2prog packages
<dneighbo> for rpm
<the_grunf> ok

<psu> GNUe KC #27 is up
<psu> http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/latest.html
<psu> I'll do the official gnue-announce in the morning
<drochaid> what *is* a kernal cousin?
<drochaid> sounds like some sort of inbreeding
<psu> it's a cousin to a kernel ;-)
Action: drochaid glares at psu
<psu> The original mailing list summary was for the Linux kernel mailing list
<psu> summary was known as "Kernel Traffic"
<psu> the other summaries for other projects, such as GNUe, 
<psu> as cousins to the main KT summary
<psu> hence "Kernel Cousins"
<psu> It's a slightly odd nomeculture
<drochaid> ahhhh
<drochaid> thanks psu
<psu> and will be changed eventually
<drochaid> I'll stop glaring now
<psu> so that GNUe KC will become "GNUe Traffic"
<psu> but there are other priorities at the moment
<drochaid> that might be a bad idea ..
<psu> (including finshing the switch from perl to xslt to render the issues
<drochaid> with the amount chillywilly hits that crack pipe, "traffic" might be taken the wrong way ;)
<ajmitch> hiall
<ajmitch> howru?

<ajmitch> yucky

<chillywilly> what more could you want in a son?

<drochaid> but star wars sucks ass
Action: drochaid hides

<psu> flamebait 
Action: drochaid hopes he's never passed on his email adress ;)
<chillywilly> come on now we're not that mental
<chillywilly> mail bombs are lame anyway
<chillywilly> I just remember when I was his age I loved Star Wars too
<drochaid> how old is he?
<chillywilly> I had all the action figures
<chillywilly> 4
<drochaid> when was star wars released initially?
<chillywilly> 1970 somethin'
<drochaid> 1980
<chillywilly> are you sure?
<chillywilly> I thought it was in the 70s
<drochaid> http://us.imdb.com/Title?0080684
<drochaid> so did I until I checked
<drochaid> I couldn't see it when I was 4 .. I feel deprived now :(
<chillywilly> well I saw the first one on cable
<chillywilly> with my grandfather
<chillywilly> couple years after
<drochaid> balls ... that's the wrong one it linked me to
<chillywilly> the next 2 I saw in the theatre
<drochaid> 1977
<drochaid>  that sounds more likely
<chillywilly> yea, that's when I was born ;)
<drochaid> hmm ... I could have watched it when I was 2
<chillywilly> what the dates on the other movies?
<drochaid> episode V was 1980
<chillywilly> I am curious as to how long it took to make another one
<chillywilly> yea
<drochaid> and VI was 1983
<drochaid> so every 3 years
<drochaid> pretty much what they're doing now
<drochaid> but the graphics were better back then ;)
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> all I know is I had a lot of Star Wars figures
<drochaid> I had none
<chillywilly> one time I lost Luke Skywalker in the park
<chillywilly> and this kid down the blovk found it
<chillywilly> but he wouldn't give it back
<drochaid> I didn't know anything about star wars until I was about 12
<chillywilly> it was the black one
<chillywilly> like from return of the jedi
<chillywilly> he was wearing that black outfit I meant
<drochaid> /topic GNUe Creating the Digital Future, as long as it contains Star Wars :-)

Action: chillywilly requests the the topic nazis turn topic lock off
<ajmitch> heh
<chillywilly> or give more people ops ;)
<drochaid> LOL - IMDB already has a listing for episode 3 due in 2005 :)
<chillywilly> brb
<drochaid> well I should definately have ops, because although I'm sod all benefit to the project or chan ... I ran a number of chans very successfully on another network :)
<ajmitch> yeah, well i'm no benefit either, does that mean i shoudl have ops?
<psu> gah, it's Sunday already
<drochaid> ah but did you run other chans successfully on another network as well?

<drochaid> but I think I would have to challenge your postion for adding nothing to the project or chan ... I'm fairly confident I can beat by a wide margin on that point
<ajmitch> hah
<ajmitch> i've been contributing nothing for far longer than you have
<drochaid> but the quality [or lack thereof] of my nothing is of a far greater magnitude than the pathetic nothing that you muster
<ajmitch> oh indeed. i must concede defeat then
<drochaid> there you go then

<dneighbo> hey jbailey didnt see you sneak in
<jbailey> dneighbo: It was only 5 hours ago =)
<dneighbo> i was napping then so makes sense :)
<dneighbo> jbailey: where do we sit on dcl debians?
<dneighbo> can we check into cvs what you have to date?
<jbailey> dneighbo: It's not designed to be used upstream.  Did you want that?  I had developped it as a wrapper so that it knows what to do with an upstream tarball.
<jbailey> That allows me to refer back to /etc for system config stuff.
<dneighbo> im not sure i understand all that :)
<dneighbo> jbailey: you are close to debian
<dneighbo> is there hope of ever having openoffice debs?
<jbailey> Weren't they just announced?
<jbailey> Ah, my misread.
<jbailey> But this is the list to follow: http://lists.debian.org/debian-openoffice/2002/debian-openoffice-200205/threads.html
Action: dneighbo wonders if its worth waiting for the debs
<dneighbo> for now i suppose it is as i am not doing office stuff on this pc

<reinhard> psu: just to be curious - is 9/6/73 your birthday?
<psu> nope - why?
Action: psu wonders which of his p/w reinhard has cracked ;-)
<reinhard> i was trying to figure out why you selected port 9673 for the new website :)
<reinhard> which doesn't work for me btw
<psu> blame one of the j*s - they did the set up
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> works in msie doesn't work in mozilla
<psu> um
<psu> that's bad
<psu> hopefully it's just the port # that's a problem
<psu> as a free s/w project with a site that doesn't work with mozilla would be 
<psu> well, not exactly self-contradictory
<psu> but on the verge ;-)
<reinhard> i am 100% positive it's the port#
<reinhard> my 2 cents (of course euro-cents) to the new site:
<reinhard> imho we need a site that is maintained _in_the_long_run_ and whoever will maintain it over the next months will have the right to choose php vs zope vs static
<reinhard> especially the documentation pages and the "current status" pages need maintainance
<psu> i agree
<reinhard> "Verbatim copying and distribution ... under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License" is a contradiction IMHO
<reinhard> as the GNU FDL says basically you may change the text how you see fit
<reinhard> and verbatim as i understands says you may not change
<psu> IANAL - my fault for cut & pasting the phpnuke bolierplate with GPL.
<psu> Also, I believe FSF house style is not to acknowldge trade marks
<psu> as there's no legal requirement to do so (provided you are careful)
<reinhard> hmmm.. FSF house style is not to _use_ trade marks :)
<psu> well, not trade marks for non-free s/w
<psu> I would guess "Linux is a trade mark of Linus Torvolds" is OK
<psu> This is one of my concerns about mirroring some of this stuff to the 
<psu> www.gnu.org site
<psu> as we may have to fillet some of the news items 
<reinhard> wrt design i like it
<reinhard> the "tabs" at the top of the page could be left away
<psu> i'm not that committed to them, but they do give you a feel for where you are in the site
<psu> plus I crashed zope debugging them ;-)
<reinhard> ahh the active one is always yellow - didn't get that... i guess it's ok then :)
<psu> The "What is GNUe?" is accesible from anywhere for people who come in via search engines
<reinhard> yeah that's a very good idea
<reinhard> i thought about (just as a small gag) the text in the top right corner
<reinhard> we could provide some 5 or 10 lines
<reinhard> and they get exchanged randomly
<psu> i'm sure that's do-able
<reinhard> nevermind just a spontaneous idea
<psu> i just need to think of 5-10 tag lines to rotate ;-)
<psu> that don't look too unprofessional ;-)
<psu> Raiding the "headquotes" from GNUe KC is tempting 
<psu> but probably not wise ;-)
<reinhard> bbl
Nick change: reinhard -> rm-away
<psu> <reinhard> jamest: i think a final gnue install could have some 100 tables

esands (~nic@mdr1-port1.jetstart.win.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<esands> Is there a quick 'howto' for building all the binaries within an alt-root. ie /home/foo/src/gnue/ rather than /usr/local/
<esands> from cvs
<siesel> n8t
siesel (jan@dial-213-168-95-209.netcologne.de) left irc: "KVIrc 2.1.2-pre2 'Monolith'"
<chillywilly> esands: check out cvs and run setup-cvs.py
<chillywilly> it will install things in /home/username/ for you
<chillywilly> This setup script can install GNUe as either a local (per user)
<chillywilly> copy or a system-wide copy.  If you are unsure, choose the
<chillywilly> recommended 'Local' setting.  Installing system-wide will require
<chillywilly> the root password and may force all users on this machine to use
<chillywilly> your copy.
<chillywilly> Perform a [L]ocal/per-user or a [S]ystem-wide install? [L] 
<chillywilly>  
<chillywilly> Where shall I put executable files? [/home/danielb/bin] 
<chillywilly> ...
<esands> That builds symlinks. I assume I then just have to make build in the appropiate cvs sub directories?
<esands> er, ignore that. It forget its python, so it doesn't really need to compile anything. 8)
<chillywilly> it doe sbuild then to .pyc files
<chillywilly> it sets it all up for you
<chillywilly> from cvs
<chillywilly> s/then/them
<esands> Ok.  Now just a matter of figuring out the db setup and trying some of the samples. Thanks.
<chillywilly> your welcome
<chillywilly> btw, I think there's going to be a new release soon ;)
<esands> In what sense?  Isn't every cvs commit a new release? ;)
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> in the sense that there should be better and more upt to date documentation ;)
<chillywilly> and it will be an officially supported version ;)
<chillywilly> not that you can't get support here though :)
<esands> documentation.  Now that is certainly worthy of a release. I was trying to figure if some of the stuff at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/ was really "Updated: 14 Jul 00"
<chillywilly> yea, supposedly the Forms API will be in the new technical reference ;)
<chillywilly> instead of having to grok it form examples, etc.
<esands> I think the best thing someone could do would be to produce a nice article/howto for one of the linux site going into the step-by-step mechanics of setting up a first stage gnue installation. (ie. for doing form development work.)
<chillywilly> er, update techref I should say
<chillywilly> 1. setup database
<chillywilly> 2. use designer
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> 3. make some forms
<chillywilly> 4. write some triggers
<esands> Yes, now add 1000 words. ;)
<chillywilly> :P
<chillywilly> 5. deploy
<esands> Is there a man describing the *.conf files?  
<chillywilly> uh, no
<chillywilly> I dunno I am not a forms guru....I am trying to be soem kinda GEAS architect ;)
<esands> Yeah, I've got a few things (eg. FX management system) in spreadsheets that I want to try make into a form
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> I have a project that I have been meaning to convert so as to learn the rest of the tools
<chillywilly> but geas and othe things keep me busy
<chillywilly> other
<esands> Another thing you guys should setup is a CPAN like place where outside developers can contrib applications so others can see what can be done
<chillywilly> yea
<esands> heh, "better keep writing the core code" the end-user developer says. ;)
<chillywilly> I am not too familiar with CPAN but we plan to have an arhcive of packages built with the tools
<chillywilly> and our core packages
<esands> CPAN stregth is i. its search/archive mechanism, ii. its easy of install using the Makefile.PL system
<esands> Query about connections.conf then (if there is no documentation)
<esands> It basically defines 'connection labels' which are then hard coded into the form.gfd files?
<drochaid> wheee ... #photo had a visitor ... for 6 seconds
<esands> Using the :datasource" tag
<esands> s/:/"/
siesel (jan@dial-213-168-64-111.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> yea, connections.conf defines the DSNs for you
<chillywilly> you can then just use the DSN in your form
<chillywilly> instead of having all these tags like database, etc.
<chillywilly> Data Source Name
<chillywilly> afaict anyway ;)
<esands> of course
<chillywilly> wb jan
<siesel> wb ?
<chillywilly> welcome back
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: siesel is a bit too slow tonight...
<chillywilly> it's ok
<chillywilly> so jan have you looked at the start of my geas architecture document?
<siesel> where is it?
<chillywilly> and also one thing I was wonder wrt to GNURPC is why no one looked at WSDL
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> gune/docbook/Proposals/geasarch/
<esands> How is the database access control stuff specified? ie. user:passwd?
<chillywilly> yea, that is deferred to the database
<chillywilly> however, there's a script somwhere that jcater wrote that sets up and SSH tunnel
<esands> Deferred to the db?  What happens if the db client (form in this case) needs a passwd to access the datasource?  Where is that specified? 
<chillywilly> the client uses a login box to allow you to authenticate to the db
<chillywilly> er, datasource even'
<chillywilly> iirc
<siesel> cw: especially the docbook file is very informative ;)
<chillywilly> outline.txt
<chillywilly> that's where all the goods are right now
<chillywilly> also, gnue/geas/doc/odmg.txt is helpful
Action: siesel is dreaming of a cool docbook editor
<chillywilly> emacs?
<chillywilly> ;)
<drochaid> vi?
<siesel> I've read odmg.txt, but its some time ago. outline.txt is informative, except of the overview at the beginning, it is mostly about odmg and how to describe objects, or how to map  ODL into python objects.
<siesel> I think two other things are also very important at the moment:
<siesel> a) object-relational mapping (you said it)
<siesel> b) more concret definition of the way to access objects
<chillywilly> well the client API is defined in ODMG, imho
<esands> You guys seen http://www.twistedmatrix.com/products/spread? python rpc mechanism
<chillywilly> it just needs to be worked out
<chillywilly> interesting
<siesel> thats the step i'am waiting for
<chillywilly> well I am trying my best ;)
<chillywilly> siesel: did you see ym diagram?
<chillywilly> for the schema compiler
<chillywilly> s/ym/my
<chillywilly> I know it needs more explanation
<chillywilly> s/more//
<chillywilly> I spoke with reinhard about it before
<siesel> which one?
<chillywilly> geas-schema-compiler.dia
<siesel> what are the metaobjects?
<chillywilly> aaaah
<chillywilly> introspection
<chillywilly> objects about obakects
<chillywilly> so you can change the schema on the fly
<chillywilly> object about objects I mean
<chillywilly> the meta object api could be used by designer to create new business objects
<siesel> ok, now i think i got it.
<chillywilly> then form those odl files can be generated and python code stubs can be generated
<siesel> thats cool
<chillywilly> you can go the various ways
<esands> What is the right provider in connections.conf for postgres? 
<siesel> pypgsql?
<chillywilly> we have a number of postgres db drivers
<siesel> popy?
<chillywilly> take your pick
<siesel> be careful popy doesn't support introspection 
<esands> The default one 'psycopg' doesn't seem to work with debians 'python2.1-pgsql
<chillywilly> siesel, and I like how they generate modules/packages in the IDL binding...so it is like geas is adding all the objects on the fly
<siesel> no 'python2.1-pgsql and pypgsql go together
<chillywilly> there's good stuff there man
<chillywilly> I really like ODMG's stuff
<chillywilly> anyway, I must eat dinner

<chillywilly> I thought you were a rogue warrior ;)
<dsmith> heh
<chillywilly> "open systems"
<dsmith> Well, it just two of us.
<chillywilly> really?
<dsmith> "open systems" is ibm speak for unix
<chillywilly> are you affiliated with IBM or just a vendor?
<dsmith> Buisness Partner.
<chillywilly> hmmm
<dsmith> We sell rs6000's
<dsmith> and do tsm (tivoli storage manager) (my main gig)
<chillywilly> I would like to request that you call Linux, GNU/Linux on your servuces page unless you are specifically talking about the kernel ;)
<chillywilly> ;P
<dsmith> I'll talk to the "web developer"
<dsmith> We use Debian pretty much exclusivle.
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> there's no better distro ;)
<dsmith> Yep.
<chillywilly> man how much does it cost to even get on of those rs6000?
<chillywilly> s/on/one
<dsmith> They ar not called rs six THOUSAND's for nothing.
<chillywilly> eeek, you got M$ on your bidness partner's list ;)
<chillywilly> lol
<dsmith> Ya. It's embarrasing.
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> how long are you going to be in Michigan?
<chillywilly> how long have you been there?
<chillywilly> Banks don't want to go the GNU/Linux route?
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> let me know if I am annoying you ;)
<dsmith> Hmm.  I've been there since around feb-march.  My cluster was supposed to go in yesterday.  It's been pushed back to the 18th.
<dsmith> They have standaized on Sun and Solaris.
<chillywilly> "cluster" means what exactly? a server farm of sorts?
<dsmith> At least it a unix.  It's better that any junk that comes from m$.
<chillywilly> yea
<dsmith> Well, my cluster is two sun boxes that have load balancing using something called Stonebeat.
<chillywilly> is tsm like the Linux Volume Manager or RAID?
<chillywilly> ok
<dsmith> TSM is a HUGE backup system.
<chillywilly> I see
<chillywilly> HUUUUUGGGEEEE
<chillywilly> ;)
<dsmith> It's got an enbedded db2 database in it.
<chillywilly> you ever hear of OLAP?
<chillywilly> they use that where da masta werks
<chillywilly> apparently
<chillywilly> to store a shit load of data
<dsmith> Ive seen the acronym, but I'm not familiar with it.
<dsmith> On Line Applications Processing?
Action: chillywilly tries to remember what ti stands for now...;P
<chillywilly> no, I don't think that is it
<chillywilly> it's like an n-dimensional matrix of storage
<dsmith> Overly Large Administivia Procedures
<chillywilly> you were close on the first one
<chillywilly> n-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a category of software technology that enables analysts, managers and executives to gain insight into data through fast, consistent, interactive access to a wide variety of possible views of information that has been transformed from raw data to reflect the real dimensionality of the enterprise as understood by the user. 
<chillywilly> On-Line
<chillywilly> OLAP functionality is characterized by dynamic multi-dimensional analysis of consolidated enterprise data supporting end user analytical and navigational activities including: 
<dsmith> For fun I wrote gkrellmoon and mod-guile.
<chillywilly> http://www.moulton.com/olap/olap.glossary.html
<dsmith> gkrellmoon is a moon clock for gkrellm
<chillywilly> ok
<dsmith> http://gkrellmoon.sourceforge.net/
<dsmith> mod-guile isn't released yet.  It's so you can write apache code in scheme.  Like mod-perl or mod-python.
<chillywilly> I see
<chillywilly> I am not a functional language guy (yet)
<dneighbo> btw: someone said soemthing about pyscopg not working with debian
<dneighbo> i use it religiously on debian with gnue
<dneighbo> so im curious as to the problem
<dsmith> Hmm.  It certainly was working for me.
<chillywilly> was that esands?
Action: chillywilly scrolls back
<chillywilly> bah, too much stuff
Action: chillywilly grep slogs
<chillywilly> May 05 18:25:50 <esands> The default one 'psycopg' doesn't seem to work with debians 'python2.1-pgsql

<No9> hello all
<chillywilly> hi dtm
<chillywilly> ello No9
<No9> one quick questions... cant seems to find it in docs or site.... what language is GNUE based on? and can I use MySQL?
<ajmitch> greetings
<ajmitch> mainly python, and you can use MySQL
<No9> heard of any ERP based on PHP?
<chillywilly> although I have no idea why you would use such a thing ;)
<No9> hee hee
<chillywilly> er, that goes for mysql and PHP ERP ;)
<No9> sorry folks... never touch python before... why that?
Action: rdean thinks it's because of the origin of the name :-)
<rdean> ni!
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> cause Python rocks our socks
<No9> and does anyone have anything to say about Compiere, www.compiere.org
<ajmitch> proprietary dependencies?
<rdean> seriously, though, although I've never delved into python before, it has a reputation for being a rich OO language
<No9> ok guys.. i will go red up on Python now... to me it might as well be cobol... excuse my ignorance. :) 
<rdean> syntax is a lot more elegant than others
<ajmitch> haven't heard many good things about Compiere :)
<chillywilly> I have heard some peope talking crap about it in here before ;)
<chillywilly> only because it has nasty dependencies or something
<ajmitch> Oracle
<No9> No9 at www.python.org now....
<chillywilly> ajmitch: ugh
<chillywilly> we support Oracle
<chillywilly> but we also support a LOT more ;)
<ajmitch> i know, but we don't depend on Oracle
<chillywilly> no we don't
<chillywilly> good point :)
<No9> I think they are working on other RDBMS support as well...
<chillywilly> well we already have tons of db drivers in our abstraction layer
<rdean> just went to compiere.org...they're working on pgsql support
<ajmitch> compiere also requires jdk 1.4 from sun :)
<ajmitch> not sure about licensing
Action: rdean would wait for jdk 1.4 from IBM....their JDKs run circles around Suns :-)
<No9> anyone here in singapore?
<ajmitch> close, i'm in NZ ;)
Action: rdean hrm...they're using JBuilder to write compiere.
<No9> NZ huh? i heard so much about the place... NICE !
<ajmitch> interesting
<No9> i came from Perth.
<No9> working in singapore...
<ajmitch> ok cool
<ajmitch> compiere is under MPL, i think
<chillywilly> Java....ugh
<No9> I have a customer looking at cheap ERP solution... instead of reinventing the wheel... I and looking at using one of the web.
<ajmitch> ok
<chillywilly> or you can hack GNUe ;)
<ajmitch> chillywilly: java, oracle dependencies, and MPL, what more could you want?
<rdean> compiere is under compiere public license (been looking at it for the last few minutes)
<chillywilly> oh God no
<chillywilly> hmmm, so where does this license actually fall then?
<chillywilly> is it BSD-like?
<ajmitch> compiere public license is MPL with only a couple of modifications
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> yea, I am loving it already
<chillywilly> NOT
<ajmitch> Compiere, Inc can roll your changes into a proprietary product
<chillywilly> yipppeee
<No9> GNUE worries me as the site says the application server is not in production stage yet....
Action: ajmitch looks at GNU's license list for details of MPL
<ajmitch> chillywilly: quick! hack the appserver into production status! :)
<chillywilly> yes sir
<No9> hee hee
<rdean> my guess is that the oracle dependencies are probably incurred in SQL....although I haven't looked into the code to see
<ajmitch> chillywilly: http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/netscape-npl.html
<chillywilly> that's not MPL thgouh
<chillywilly> though
<chillywilly> M is Mozilla right?
<ajmitch> read the page
<rdean> yep...
<rdean> oracle specificity is derived from using Oracle extensions to SQL
<chillywilly> blech
<chillywilly> dude, isn't mozilla trying to GPL the code now?
<chillywilly> I thought there was an article where they were trying to track down a couple developers
<chillywilly> so they could make the change
<chillywilly> brb
<No9> has anyone used GNUE commercially?  i mean installed at their own customer site
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> some have
<No9> I realised that most potentials i have been meeting up with wants a Multi national company doing their ERP... do you guys get the same response?

<reinhard> did i commit anything?
Action: reinhard can't remember

<reinhard> yeah
<reinhard> because it's not me who does that :)

<sledge_> btw, i'm heavily messing around with a designer bug
<drochaid> Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons, because you are crunchy and

<sledge_> have you taken your pills today? :-)
<drochaid> I don't have an attitude problem, you have a perception problem.

<drochaid> and many other wise words of wisdom courtesy of Dogbert ;)

<drochaid> Last night I lay in bed looking up at the stars in the sky, and I thought to myself, where the heck is the ceiling?
<sledge_> reality is what you suffer from when you don't take drugs.
<drochaid> please tell me to stop ;)

<drochaid> ah, good enough I suppose :)
<drochaid> well .. almost good enough ...

<sledge_> hi jan!
<siesel> hi sledge.
<siesel> you're surfing with claranet?
<sledge_> wtf is claranet?
<siesel> I just can't remember to which provider pppool.de is connected.
<sledge_> oh
<sledge_> it's mobilcom
<sledge_> pppool provides the dialin afair
<siesel> no flatrate?
<sledge_> nope :(
<siesel> :(
<sledge_> i'm quite uncertain about my future, regarding military service (blargh) and studying
<sledge_> but if i move out, i'll get my dsl :)
<siesel> I suggest to move into a WG with a shared dsl line or to an "studentenwohnheim" with 10/100 Mbit ethernet.
<siesel> jamest, you here?
<sledge_> that'd be nice too
<siesel> hi chilly. 
<jamest_> sorta here
<siesel> sledge: do you know how to get the path of an module at runtime? I want to access a file in the same directory of the module
<sledge_> not without looking into the docs
<sledge_> i remember there is one (i think somewhere in sys or os)
<siesel> jamest: i've made some changes to setup-cvs.py. I'd have liked to ask you for comments before I commited it, so I just did it. Can you have a look over it (when you've time)
<jamest_> sure
<siesel> sledge: thx
<siesel> jamest: good. btw. their is still one problem with the gtestcvs command now. You have to be into common/src/commdrivers/_test to test the rpc server. So if it doesn't work, you know why.
<jamest_> ok
<jamest_> btw you looking for python module path ?
<jamest_> i think the inspect module will give you that
<siesel> jamest: btw. dbdriver/popy introspection support is broken. I have a "bit" dirty fix, and am not shure if i should commit it.
<siesel> ok. I try that.
<jamest_> you already committed the setup stuff?
<siesel> yep.
<jamest_> and what is dirty about the popy stuff
<siesel> popy returns the oid as an string. but the composition of the new query uses a "%d" to insert the oid -> error
<siesel> my patch is dirty, because I patch it in the _pqsql directory and not in the popy code itself.
alexey_ (~alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jamest_> ew
<jamest_> what we've typically done is copy the non-std function from _pqsql into the driver and patch there
<jamest_> what that not work in this case?
<siesel> it will work. I've just been too lasy.
<siesel> server.py is fixed. now the whole test case should work.
<jamest_> cool
<siesel> you've tryed it out?
<jamest_> i can't at the moment
<jamest_> not sure it'll even work on my sparcs here
<jamest_> looked at cvs diff on setup-cvs.py
<jamest_> you just added support for an appserver cvs command right?
<siesel> I've  added "gacvs" which calls "geasRpcServer.py" and gtestcvs which calls "common/GTest.py".
<siesel> GTest.py outputs a menu and you can choose which testcase you like to run (f.e. donut rpc test client, test server, geasRpcClient, or the appserver/test"
<jamest_> :)
<sledge_> okay, i still don't get it. this bug sucks.
<siesel> which bug?
<sledge_> designer: property editor doesn't work when it has scrollbars
Action: siesel hates non properly working GUI librarys
<sledge_> right
<siesel> jamest: another question:  whats about  quoting of table and row identifiers? To my knowledge this is not  done at the moment. Is that right?
<jamest_> for the generated sql?
<jamest_> i probably should

<sledge_> fuck it
<jamest_> sledge_: ?
<sledge_> this designer bug makes me crazy
<sledge_> it's just illogical
<jamest_> ah
<jamest_> yip
<jamest_> the wxpython demo does not suffer from that bug
<sledge_> ah
<jamest_> i keep meaning to compare their code to ours 
<jamest_> but have not done so
<sledge_> i assume that our code has trapped into a side effect
<sledge_> of the wx code
<sledge_> i hade side effects *grrr*
<siesel> i think that every db use a different quoteing style. so there should be a function "quote_identifier" in GDataobjects which can be overwritten by the drivers code
<jamest_> would it go there or in _dbsig
<siesel> dbsig would be ok. I just don't know which object would be the best for that. whats about DBSIG_DataObject?

<dneighbo> im going to be the big devils advocate here
<dneighbo> i see lots of commits, but we still need to release :)
<dneighbo> our dog died today :( but i will be home today because of it
<dneighbo> im half tempted to package what we have an release
<dneighbo> no matter how dorked
<dneighbo> as its barely worse than pointing everyone to cvs
<dneighbo> and since no one will communicate in this channel (only via private messages) no one knows where things stand
<jamest_> sory about the dog
<jamest_> the recent commits are trying to fix some issues prior to release and work final bugs out
<jamest_> as we're jumping to 0.3.0
<reinhard> jamest_: you really want to do even/odd before 1.0?
<jamest_> i don't want even/odd at all anymore
<reinhard> sorry to drop in here but i don't think this makes much sense
<jamest_> but I'm in the minority
<jamest_> :)
<dneighbo> it does
<jamest_> I'd go 0.2.0 but the changes in forms/designer are much greater than a 0.1.0 to 0.2.0 release :)
<jamest_> I'm 1/2 tempted to say this is a 0.5.0 release in alot of ways
<dneighbo> reinhard: it just doesnt seem to make sense cause we never release :)
<dneighbo> jamest_ i have no problem with it being .5
<jcater> dneighbo: we do too
<jcater> just not that often :)
<dneighbo> if anyone asks we simply say its your fault
<dneighbo> from working with sun for so long :)
<dneighbo> that you thought skipping numbers was the 'right' way
<jamest_> :)
Yurik (~yrashk@nss.softerra.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest_> if things release today we have the following issues
<jamest_>   setup.py still installs gnue.conf which isn't needed anymore
<jamest_>   drowdown key errors in the displayHandler
<jamest_>   database issues w/ pypgsql and 7.2.1 postgres (at least for me)
<jamest_>   no windows testing
<jcater>   lots of untested i18n changes
<jamest_>   your trigger issue

<jamest_> the i18n is cake to disable for a release
<jamest_> just modify GBaseApp to always call the dummy _()
<jcater> it's the _() that I was referring too :)
<jcater> don't know what exceptions, if thens, etc, have a _()
<jcater> that we haven't had code run against :)

<jamest_> testing today shows it is
<jamest_> but it should not be
<jamest_> some recent changes to gnue.conf broke my installs
<jamest_> so I got ticked
<dneighbo> ah
<jamest_> the system now has all defaults in a .py file
<jamest_> that can be overridden by gnue.conf
sledge_ (~sledge@B2934.pppool.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<sledge_> hi back
<jamest_> when time permits I'll make the new config system write config files too
<jamest_> it's real close to that today
<jamest_> then our installer can create them on the fly
siesel (jan@dial-213-168-91-70.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest_> if needed
<siesel> cool
Action: siesel read the log
<sledge_> where can one read the log?
<siesel> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log
<dneighbo> jamest_ sounds dangerous to me
<jamest_> ?
Action: dneighbo doesnt think defaults belong in a py file
<jcater> ?
<dneighbo> i propose from now on if we go into a segment where we are getting ready for release we branch the code
<dneighbo> so things like rewriting the conf system and doing i18n and such
<dneighbo> are in the branch
<dneighbo> and we dont have to 'wait'
<dneighbo> to do releases
<dneighbo> as this is always what kills us
<dneighbo> is 'features' not fixes keep getting added in the last push for a release
<dneighbo> this is why we need roadmap more clearly defined
<dneighbo> so we can say xyz will be in next release
<dneighbo> anything not xyz goes in a branch
<jcater> well the config system is where "feature
<jcater> " vs "fix" gets murky
<dneighbo> agree, but it was never in the original 'fix' list for the next release
<ra3vat> siesel:  "You have to be into common/src/commdrivers/_test to test the rpc server." What does it mean? Is it enough to run setup-cvs.py to prepare all things for testing?
<dneighbo> i realize a lot is dictated by 'need'
<dneighbo> but i think if we kept a version branch to help us stay focused it would help
<dneighbo> but wouldnt prevent people from adding stuff that was 100% necessity
<dneighbo> btw: this is the same issue debian woody is having so its not a direct criticism per say
<dneighbo> there may not be a good answer
<siesel> ra3vat: you just run setup-cvs.py as normal and then call gtestcvs

<jcater> yes?
<sledge_> seriously, have you had thoughts about redesigning designer?
<siesel> the gettext initialisation is made in GBaseApp.__init__ , so GBaseApp.__init__ has to be called first in inherited objects. But command line parameters are parsed by GBaseApp.__init__, i.e. they have to come first.

<dneighbo> ra3vat: no
<dneighbo> i COULD do that
<dneighbo> but that doesnt fix the problem
<jcater> sledge_: I've had real work to deal with for the month, so designer UI hasn't been at the top of my list
<ra3vat> i did that and setup-cvs passed 
<dneighbo> i.e. the script needs to be fixed
<ra3vat> agreed
<dneighbo> ra3vat: thats fine, but i dont want to do tech support for everyone that runs setup-cvs.py
<sledge_> jcater: i understand, it was more a general question
<dneighbo> :)
<siesel> sorry. I just tested it on my computer and didn't get a new clean cvs
<dneighbo> someone else want to patch or want me to
<ra3vat> i still can't get gtestcvs working
<siesel> one moment.
<siesel> ra3vat: please update cvs again.
<dneighbo> siesel: you address the setup-cvs ?
Action: siesel ducks
<ra3vat> siesel: now it works, thanks :)
<siesel> dneigbo: to add an appserver/scripts directory to cvs I just have to "cvs add  appserver/scripts" right?
<dneighbo> i believe so
<dneighbo> and from what i can tell that is all that is needed for the fix

<dneighbo> siesel: no it does not
<siesel> server is possible too. 
<dneighbo> siesel: im not saying right or wrong
<dneighbo> im just noticing the tools are 
<dneighbo> name/client/...
<^chewie> it would make sense to have gnue-common, gnue-forms, gnue-designer, gnue-doc (with samples, tests, etc)
<dneighbo> i will defer to jbailey but i prefer
<dneighbo> gnue-forms
<dneighbo> gnue-forms-samples
<siesel> and common/scripts, but common/scripts is just for small tools
<dneighbo> gnue-froms-doc
<dneighbo> siesel: my opinion is if this is just a tester 'script' script is fine
Action: ^chewie nods.
<dneighbo> if it is to actually be the RPC daemon for appserver we should probably make it server or something other than scripts but i would ask jcater/jamest as they created the naming convention :)
<dneighbo> cvs $GNUECVS update -Pd
<dneighbo> going to see if it exists yet
<dneighbo> did you check in the files?

<dneighbo> cvs add filename
<dneighbo> then
<dneighbo> cvs commit filename
<dneighbo> the add wont commit it just queue's it for commit
<siesel> so appserver/server is the choice.

<siesel> please do it quick
<jamest_> what do you need?
<jcater> siesel: what is the appserver/server directory you just added?
<siesel> a directory named "server" in the appserver directory.  nothing else
<jcater> I get that much
<siesel> cool. I hope it fixes that setup-cvs.py issue.
<jcater> but what is it for?

<siesel> possibly the normal setup needs these *.in files.
<jcater> the standard directory is scripts/ not server/
<jcater> just fyu
<jcater> or fyi even
Action: jcater is away: lunch
Action: drochaid offers jcater a intrel or two
<dneighbo> jcater: i was curious then
<dneighbo> why the forms/designer use 'client'
<dneighbo> instead of scripts
<jamest_> legacy
<dneighbo> its my understanding this gacvs is actually the application server (not just a test script)
<dneighbo> jamest_ ok
<jamest_> we should probably fix form/designer
<dneighbo> siesel: so leave as is, as stated before i said we shoudl ask jamest_/jcater as it was their standards :)
<dneighbo> i just wanted to point out there was an inconsistency not that one way or the other was correct :)
<siesel> jamest:  how can i uncommit stuff. or should i just leave it this way for a while?
<dneighbo> siesel: it works now
<dneighbo> but as you now know i screwed up by asking you if it should be server or not
<dneighbo> and no easy way to remove a directory
<dneighbo> jamest: will have to do this on the cvs side
<dneighbo> siesel: what is your sample
<siesel> which sample?

<siesel> xmlrpc or pw_xmlrpc for the client?
<ra3vat> xmlrpc
<siesel> one moment i've to get the cvs version in a seperate tree
<dneighbo> yes to test appserver
<siesel> dneighbo: i got a fresh cvs version, but there is no appserver/server directory in there

<kiOwA> Hi.. I'm taking a peek at GNUe, but I'm finding information about available packages/templates very hard to find. The ~neilt/ links are also outdated..
<psu> hi kiOwA
<psu> the website is out of date - we have a redesign in the works
<kiOwA> Hmm, I might have found a link that actually works now >(
<psu> for the moment
<kiOwA> :)
<psu> just ask away here ;_
<kiOwA> Is there an easy way of just getting a tarball or something for each individual package and see what fits?
<kiOwA> Right now all that seems to be a big mess of what is available and what fits here and there..
<siesel> ra3vat: another i18 error.... I'm tracking the bug down...

<psu> kiOwA: at the moment, the tools are pretty much all we have 
<psu> (Forms, Reports, etc)
<ra3vat> siesel: and another error after fixing that
<psu> if by "package" you mean Financials, HR, Payroll, SCM etc
<psu> then all of those are stalled at the moment
<psu> some we have proposals for, some we don;t
<psu> the sticking point has been 
<ra3vat> siesel:   File "/home/ds/cvs/gnue/gnue/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/common/commdrivers/sockets/CommDriver.py", line 118, in __init__
<ra3vat>     raise AdapterInitializationError, \
<ra3vat> NameError: There is no variable named 'AdapterInitializationError'
<kiOwA> Ah, ok.. From the FAQ and such it seemed as if there were several available for you to try out..
<psu> that although we *could* write packages using two-tier
<psu> ie forms talking direct to database
<psu> we don;t really want to
<psu> we really want to use n-tier
<siesel> sorry forgot to say: sockets doesn't work
<ra3vat> ok
<psu> ie forms talks to appserver talks to database
<psu> however
<psu> the appserver has caused us problems
<psu> the first version was contrib by a company 
<psu> and did what it did well
<psu> but not really what we wanted 
<kiOwA> ok..
<psu> (probably because of lack of input from our part)
<psu> so we have ju7st started an appserver re-write
<psu> once that is bearing fruit 
<psu> we can start on the packages for real
<psu> In the meantime, 2 tier (forms to database) is *very* usable 
Action: dneighbo is away: car work
<psu> for people who want to write their own apps
<kiOwA> Ok...
<psu> hence the frequent jokes about "Microsoft Access replacement"
<psu> i.e. we are that even today
<kiOwA> And using the forms-thingie that shouldn't really pose much of a problem you mean ;)
<psu> but no-one in their right mind would write a full ERP package 
<psu> in M$Access 
<kiOwA> There are many who are not.. 
<kiOwA> Probably..
<psu> kiOwA: No - several of the guys here use Forms in production
<drochaid> psu: you mean I should stop my current project? :o
<psu> for what I would call "mini-distributed" business apps
<psu> i.e. anything where you need a slightly bigger set up than Access, FoxPro or the like
Yurik (~yrashk@nss.softerra.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<psu> but having to maintain the clients isn't too big an issue
<kiOwA> I don't use M$-ware.. And I program in python, so your project seemed like my best bet ;)
<psu> either because you don't have many client PCs
<psu> or because you use something like LTSP
<psu> kiOwA: we live & breathe python here
<psu> even I've become infected
<psu> needed to do a simple file splitter the other day
<psu> in my former naughty life, I would have used QBASIC or M$ Excel macros
<kiOwA> Ehh..
<psu> instead I broke out the python book & did myself a quick 6-liner
<kiOwA> Just opening a filedescriptor with x bytes ;)
<psu> found myself with an insatiable craving for donuts after I'd finished...
Action: psu cues X-files style music...
<psu> The other benefit of hopping onto GNUe now
<siesel> ra3vat: the error messages i18 problems are fixed. It will tell you now which files you have to download to get pw_xmlrpc running
<psu> is that if you write an app in 2-tier (i.e. forms talks to d/b)
<psu> once the appserver is ready to rumble 
<psu> moving to 3-tier (forms talks to appserver talks to d/b) 
<psu> should be an easy conversion
<kiOwA> Ok.. nice..
<psu> basically take all your triggers and business logic out of forms
<psu> and put it into appserver
<psu> depending how it works, we might even be able to write an automatic sucking script
<kiOwA> Guess I'll have to take a closer peek at your work later on then. It might be what we're looking for (even if it does involve a bit more coding then we anticipated).
Action: psu looks at that and wonders if he should change that for the benefit of the US guys
<psu> basically, if you need an off the shelf ERP package to go live tomorrow
<psu> then no, we're not that
<psu> If you need a convenient toolkit to write database apps of simple to mid complexity
<psu> we're here already 
<kiOwA> I was looking for something that I could customize the hell out of... And shrink-wrapped isn't my kind of style.
<psu> We like customisation
<psu> as GNUe packages will be GPL, nothing to stop you re-writing source 
<psu> but 
<psu> even beyond that, we already have concept of "templates"
<psu> which you can apply to packages
<psu> e.g. in UK, we have a complicated tax deduction system for building works
<psu> called CIS
<psu> I would anticipate that UK users 
<psu> would just apply the CIS template over top of AP
<psu> and have full CIS functionality
<psu> same for US oddities like 1099 reporting
<ra3vat> siesel: ok, downloading now
<psu> (someone must explain what that is to me someday)
<kiOwA> I'm neither us or uk, so ;) .no here..

Action: jcater is back (gone 01:03:02)
<psu> we have a PHP-based web client in CVS 
<psu> not sure of current status
<psu> & the guy who wrote it just left before you said that ;-)
<psu> In general, I would say that 
<psu> if the database connectivity is the significant part of your project
<kiOwA> Well, it won't be a problem for us as long as python is runtime both on m$ and linux.
<psu> we are definantly what you want
<kiOwA> It's very reliant on the db, yes..
<ra3vat> psu: and also forms driver for webware with the same status :(
<psu> as all the d/b connectivity is built in
<psu> The Forms client works on both GNU/Linux and Windows
<psu> ra3vat: I'd forgotten that one. Is it in CVS?
<ra3vat> psu: no, it did not get there
<psu> In fact, M$ Windows is probably marginally easier to install at the moment
<kiOwA> Well, we have debs, so ;)
<psu> Not sure what the status of our debs are - I know nickr has been working on them
<psu> debs = debian packages, not debutantes ;-)
<kiOwA> Well, they seem to be working fine here, so..
<psu> before nickr reaches for the libel writ...
<ra3vat> well, pw_xmlrpc test works reporting: Sending glazed yeast donuts to Jason Cater

<psu> hi siesel. just after you left, kiOwA was
<psu> asking about web clients
<psu> how is the PHP one going?
Action: psu is too lazy to read commit-gnue
<siesel> PHP is working great in combination with postgresql. 
<psu> cool
<psu> does it use GNUe Common or is that "planned"?
<siesel> now its standalone. just copy the two php files into your web directory and it should work
<siesel> but i've planned to use python common over RPC. so I begann to add an modular database adapter system, and worked a bit on the RPC stuff...
<StyXman> if I was to add a new widget, where should I add the description suitable for Incubator to work?
Action: drochaid is back (gone 00:24:20)
<siesel> RPC is now running, but it makes not much sense to use the actual common/dbadapters per RPC in the phpclient. I.e. phpclient will just work with postgres for a while.
<drochaid> psu: any thoughts on my question?
<psu> I don't know
<drochaid> good answer :)
<siesel> but as soon as possible i will commit my new version to cvs. 
<psu> I guess I would perceive it as an add-on
<psu> main issue is that most clients today are PCs and have no biometric support
<psu> unless you buy the £50 fingerprint detector
<psu> I know sklein is the main player on security issues
<psu> but he rarely shows up in IRC
<psu> he obviously has a life ;-)
<drochaid> shocking ;)
<siesel> psu: do you mean life or wife? ;)
<psu> siesel: maybe both ;-)
<drochaid> surely if he had a wife he'd be on IRC as much as possible :)
<siesel> rofl
<psu> biometrics are a possible solution to a real problem
<psu> in that some orgs have a culture of password sharing

<drochaid> I firmly believe a person should be identified by who they are, and not what they know
<psu> at my old place, the payroll system had passwords as a primary key on the d/b
<drochaid> :o
<psu> that was how we found out that one user's cat had the same name as another user's son in my office
<psu> not that they should have been using either as p/w
<drochaid> LMFAO

<drochaid> 6 chars MAX??

<reinhard> note to siesel (hope you read log)
<jamest_> cool
<reinhard> i broke the geasRpc* code
<reinhard> the interface of geasSession has changed
<reinhard> should be no biggie to fix it again
<jamest_> broken cvs?...in GNUe?....how strange
<reinhard> if i can help you please let me know
<reinhard> however RPC doesn't work here (missing packages) so it'd be cool if you could fix it :)
<reinhard> ********************************
<reinhard> jamest_: is that correct that most of our objects have the same name as the module?
<reinhard> um i mean things like
<reinhard> GDataSource.GDataSource
<reinhard> etc.
<reinhard> this is because we have a source file per class, right?
ToyMan (~stuq@65.167.123.51) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jcater> reinhard: not necessarily
<jcater> but there was enough code for Datasources to justify their own module
<jcater> we don't have strict rules governing what's in a module
<jcater> other than neither of us like 1000+ line files
<reinhard> did i understand correctly that 1 file == 1 module ?
<jcater> for the most part, yes
<jcater> in python terms
<reinhard> ok
<jcater> a module is either
<jcater> 1) a directory with an __init__.py file
<jcater> or a .py file
<jcater> err
<jcater> or 2) a .py file
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> and 1) consists of a lot of 2)'s
<reinhard> ?
<jcater> yes
<reinhard> i can't do import gnue.common right?
<reinhard> i have to do from gnue.common import <filename>?
<jcater> well
<jcater> there's stuff in gnue/common/__init__.py

<jamest> yip
<jamest> use = disable on 2 systems as they didn't work with it and have extremely bad luck with the 1 dual I'm still running with it on
<jcater> ah
<jcater> that acpi
<jcater> yeah, same experience as jamest
<dsmith> jamest: what kernel
<jcater> I disabled them as soon as possible :)
<jamest> 2.4.17 disabled
<jamest> 2.4.18 attempted to disable but it ignores me
<esands> Where is the path defined for the images for gfcvs? I'm getting this error: "No such ... /home/nic/gnue/shared/images/shared/images/gnue-splash.png".  Obviously should be /home/nic/gnue/shared/images/gnue-splash.png and is "shared/images" is being double for some reason
<jamest> this is a issue w/ old gnue.conf
<jamest> the one that ticked me off enough to attempt to get rid of gnue.conf
<jamest> :)
<esands> heh. So is there a fix?
Action: jcater takes full credit for that one
<jamest> yip
<jamest> you running the latest cvs?
<esands> using yesterday's (NZST) cvs version
<jamest> hmmmmm
<jamest> you can try 2 things
<esands> Should I just update and rerun setup-cvs.py?
<jamest> edit your gnue.conf to remove the shared/images part from the entries in gnue.conf
<jamest> or if you're new enough cvs 
<jamest> just remove them from the gnue.conf
Action: jamest smacks jcater with a smelly gnue.conf
<esands> Yep, but: 'grep images ~/gnue/etc/gnue.conf' gives me nothing
Action: jamest is confused now
<jamest> that is where the double is comming from
<jamest> as it's hard coded in the app and it's in the gnue.conf
<esands> I'm just using the defaults from the setup-cvs.py install
<jamest> hmmmm
<jamest> it's gotta be there :(
<esands> What's the right-side of the option define in gnue.conf?
<esands> er, left side sorry
<jamest> tb_delete
<jamest> tb_something
<jamest> IIRC
<esands> This: splashScreenPNG=gnue-splash.png ?
<jcater> if you didn't manually edit the gnue.conf
<jcater> you can just delete it altogether
<jamest> jcater: I'm still having issues w/ no gnue.conf
<jamest> :(
<jamest> working on it now
<jcater> oh
Action: jcater smacks jamest with a smelly (stale) gnue.conf
<jamest> it can be empty!
<jamest> just still has to have a forms section :)
<esands> That line?  There don't seem any references to path definitions in my (from sample) gnue.conf.  Except for GEASDIR=/usr/local/
<esands> Where Hmm, I guess its time to hit it with the hard hammer: "[nic@thunder:~/devel/gnue/gnue/forms] grep -rs shared ." ;)
<jamest> :)
<esands> Where is prefix defined?  I'm guessing this "./src/GFConfig.py:    'Default'    : '%(prefix)s/shared/images/gnue-splash.png' }, " means that prefix for the setup-cvs.py version I've installed is being defined as "/home/nic/gnue/shared/images/"
<jamest> um
<jamest> er
<jamest> that's the bug I'm working on now 
<jamest> if in your gnue.conf you put
<jamest> [forms]
<jamest> prefix=/usr/local
<jamest> it may work
<jamest> or give me a few minutes :)

<jamest> i'm testing 
<drochaid> for now I need some sleep :)

<esands> Time learn some python, methinks, and do some debuging.  What's equiv to perl's print "$var\n"; ?
<jamest> um
<jamest> print varname
<jamest> but I'm fixing it now honest
<ajmitch> greetings
<jamest> also
<jamest> you can do 
<jamest> gfcvs --interactive-debugger
<jamest> to run the app inside a dubugger
<jamest> gnueapp --interactive-debugger should work with any gnue common based app
<esands> That implies knowledge of python's debugger though. 8)
<jamest> of course :)
<jamest> give me a sec though
<jamest> as I'm finding missing config options that aren't in the code
<jamest> that removal on gnue.conf is making unhappy
<esands> No problem.  I should start learning some python anyway. 
<jcater> I'm working on a
<jcater> gnueapp --ignore-jcater-mistakes option
<jcater> but I keep making mistakes in it
<jcater> which leads to an infinite loop
<jamest> i'd be happy to rebug it for you :)
<jcater> rebug it for me?
<jamest> yip
<jamest> rebug it
<jcater> I can handle my one rebugging :)

<jamest> oooo
<jamest> it's working
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> esands: try cvs now
<jamest> then just delete your gnue.conf
<jamest> or rename it :)
<jamest> i know gettext is init'ing twice now
<jamest> i'm looking at it
<jamest> but we're in a storm so I wantted to get this commited prior to losing power :)
<esands> jamest: Hmm, no luck. "mv ~/gnue/etc/gnue.conf ~/gnue/etc/gnue.conf.old; gfcvs simple/form.gfd" and same error
<esands> Can someone tell me where in Programming Python is explains "%(prefix)s..."
<jamest> um
ToyMan (~stuq@c5300-5-ip243.albany.thebiz.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jamest> that should be gone now in current cvs
<jamest> it's part of the configparser module
<jamest> http://www.python.org/doc/current/
<jamest> in the global modules section
<esands> Sure, but I look at GFConfig.py and see this references to 'prefix' but they doesn't seem to be an indication of where prefix is defined?  So I'm wondering how that operator works and if prefix is being pulled from a global namespace.  (I have about 10 mintues of python experience, now. ;)
<jamest> it was part of the gnue.conf but was removed
<jamest> are you running gfcvs?
<esands> sure
<jamest> and you have no 
<jamest> ~/gnue/etc/gnue.conf
<jamest> ~/.gnue/etc/gnue.conf
<jamest> er
<jamest> ~/.gnue/gnue.conf
<esands> That was the one I hadn't known about: ~/.gnue/gnue.conf. 
<jamest> in gnue apps you have 3 config files
<jamest> $INSTALL_PREFIX/gnue.conf
<jamest> $HOME/.gnue/gnue.conf
<jamest> $INSTALL_PREFIX/gnue.conf.fixed
<jamest> read in that order
<esands> I see
<jamest> so the admin can set system wide prefs
<jamest> and force things in fixed so that users can not override
<esands> Seems like a good system.  Now onto my next issue.  ;)
<jamest> yes?
<esands> After replacing 'psycopg' with 'pypgsql' I've got gfcvs inventory/forms/company.gfd running with the appropiate images (thanks to you ;)
<esands> Actually let me think about this some. 8) 
<esands> My mistake. Didn't have an indentd server running. So postgres wasn't able to auth vis ident correctly. 
<esands> Thanks for your help. 8)
<jamest> no prob
<dneighbo> esands: seems your preliminary issues are resolved?
<esands> dneighbo: Yep. Pretty much.  Fiddling around with the sample forms at the moment.

<dneighbo> dont let the authorities catch you 'fiddling' yourself, you coudl get in trouble :))
<esands> 8)
Nick change: gontran_aw -> gontran
<esands> Seems to be an issue with the sample/inventory/forms/company.gfd form.  When I type in the "City" field is gets entered into the "Phone" field.
<dneighbo> that form is probably REALLY old
<dneighbo> as it was done pre-trigger rewrite
<gontran> what would be the reason for doubly importing?  EG, 'from contants import *'\nfrom contstants import *'
<esands> 2001-11-04
<dneighbo> iirc you were only supposed to enter into the ZIPCODE field
<esands> I see
<dneighbo> and a trigger would go and load the city and state for you
<dneighbo> it was quite spiff actually
<jamest> drochaid: is that us?
<dneighbo> gontran: will it even let you double import?
<jamest> er i mean gontran
<jamest> sorry
<esands> Thus the readonly="" modifier.  Still should it just beep at you when you put the cursor and try enter something into that field
<jamest> derek: yes
<gontran> dneighbo :hmm, good question.
<jamest> but if doesn't do anything
<dneighbo> jamest: is the readonly="" busted in forms
<dneighbo> re: esands question
<dneighbo> esands: let me look at the form as well, see if i can bring it up to date
<dneighbo> or you can if you so desire :
<jamest> um
<dneighbo> :)
<gontran> sources OK.  nm
<jamest> i'm pretty sure readonly works 
<dneighbo> jamest: just like prequery does ;)
<esands> jamest: Seems to just enter the data in the previous field the "cursor" was in.
<jamest> "works for me"
<jamest> :)
<jamest> i'll look in a sec...cleaning up some i18n stuff
<esands> ie. UI cues arent there
<jamest> amazing considering I barely know my native tounge
<dneighbo> oh i though you were putting in ksKS
<jamest> i R pr0grammher
<jcater> we also need a translations/PHB :)

<esands> jamest: Has your conf stuff broken the designer?

derek (~derek@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) joined #gnuenterprise.

<jamest> oooo
<jamest> didn't hit that one 
<esands> Oh well, I guess that means its a good time for lunch and some other tasks
<jamest> i'll have it fixed in a jiffy
<esands> Bleedy edge code, test cycle. 8)
<jamest> normally our cvs is a little more stable
<jamest> as a few of us use it at work
<esands> er that should be, code, distribute, test, bug developer.
<jcater> yeah, but we are gearing up for a release
<jcater> hence the unusually buggy code
<derek> i thought this was free software thusly
<jcater> (and yes that was sarcastic :)
<jamest> so we're cramming as many bugs in as possible
<derek> distribute, bug developer, code, test
<jamest> test?
<jamest> what is this "test" thing you speak of?
<derek> jamest: im going on most sf projects die at the 'distribute' phase
<derek> jamest: see 'compile' in your computer science books
<derek> we call that 'testing'
<derek> if it compiles it passes the 'test'
<esands> jamest: Obviously your've been reading microsoft internal relase documentation.

<Mr_You> derek, you interested in checking out hr-xml.org to see if its license may allow us to use some of their definitions?
<derek> as long as we have permission 'technically' we could use a definition
<derek> as its not code
<Mr_You> they require copyright notifications
<derek> but i dont know if its a good thing to do per say
<derek> Mr_You: rms or eben woudl be the authority to ask
<derek> but at this point unless someone is pursuing an HR package and jumping on it
<Mr_You> ok..
<derek> i would rather not go there
<Mr_You> it looks pretty GPL compatible to me but I just glanced
<derek> GPL compatiablity is pretty tough
<Mr_You> go where?
<derek> free software is pretty easy to obtain, just follow the rules to freedom
<derek> GPL compatiable is more tough as it requires something to be more copyleft and any thing that 'demands' acknowledgement or has odd verbiage is usually tossed
<Mr_You> I don't understand clearly.. it seems to me.. that hr-xml could be our HR package
<derek> i.e. many a licenses deemed non compatiable because the authors wanted some attribution or logo dispersed with code
<derek> BSD/Zope are two that come to mind
<Mr_You> pretty sure they just require copyright notices 
<derek> hr-xml during my last look ONLY had hiring portion spec'ed
<derek> i.e. they had format for resumes
<Mr_You> either way, its cool, cause if a biz wants that.. well they can do it
<Mr_You> they have a bunch now
<derek> and exchanging job availability
<Mr_You> a bunch
<derek> the rest were just in the 'talking' phase
<Mr_You> version numbers and all
<derek> much like one can look at us and say we have a lot (if you look at the webpage) :)
<Mr_You> yeah, but these are just XML files ;-)
<Mr_You> just bringing it up.. I imagine some biz will want it in the future
<Mr_You> or will require it per interfacing with Manpower, etc, etc
<Mr_You> if XML becomes what everyone wants it to be
<jcater> Mr_You: isn't it already
<jcater> after all, haven't you seen CancerCure.dtd ?
<Mr_You> heh
<Mr_You> XML will be great if too many protocols don't mess it up
<Mr_You> guess thats not so bad, just ignore the ones you don't want, but reinventing the wheel is waste
Action: Mr_You creates an XML telnet client/server.
<jamest> ok
<jamest> to run designer you do need a gnue.conf file with forms section
<jamest> it's the only app that loads multiple configs and it's not working properly
<jamest> i have to run but will tackle tomorrow

<btami> i'm praying for pdf docs
<jamest> argh!
<jamest> dude, I'm sorry
<drochaid> PDF PDF PDF!!! :-D
<btami> i can't print from lyx :(
<jamest> was working on i18n issues last nite
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> let me see what I can do
<jamest> which doc you after?
<btami> techref-common
<drochaid> jamest: I know very little about linux doc formats, but if I can read them on Windows, I'd be happy to write them to pdf
<btami> i can read it on linux, but want print :)
<drochaid> what format are the docs in btami?

<StyXman> good morning...
<^chewie> morning
<StyXman> uh, who is responsible of designer, again?
<StyXman> (sorry, I sometimes have bad memory)
<StyXman> could be jamest or jcater?
<btami> maybe jcater :)
<StyXman> ack
<StyXman> ok, I've been poking into designer' code. 'vrything looks good, except for Incubator. I can't fond where elemwnts is defined.
<StyXman> s/fond/find/
<StyXman> s/elemwnts/elements/
<jamest> which elements
<jamest> the entry, box, etc?
<StyXman> elements as in Incubator.py:46

<StyXman>   try:
<StyXman>     objclass = elements[tag]['BaseClass']
<StyXman>                 ^that one.
<jamest> same file line 133 i think
<StyXman> oh, shit. yes, there. tnx
<jcater> those are pulled directly from forms/src/GFParser.py
<jcater> iirc
<jamest> they are

jbrite (~jbrite@65.216.32.46) left irc: Client Quit
<StyXman> jamest: it's me, or all the available widgets are *hardcoded* in that file? I thought you loaded from some xml file...
<jamest> That file is the xml to internal widget mapping so is hard coded
<jamest> but that file is only the parser mapping
<StyXman> uh, I'm rather lost. gimme a sec.
<Arturas> what does it do:
<Arturas> self.handleStartupError('Error ..... ')
<Arturas> (from gfclient)
<Arturas> does it only prints error on screen
<Arturas> or does it take additional actions according to the string?
<jcater> no actions based on the string
<jcater> it just displays the string in a fancy format
<Arturas> thank you :)
<jcater> (i.e., neatly on the screen or, in the future, using a popup box)
<StyXman> ok, whar does that big structure mean? I see that Attributes list the valid attributes, and some mappings, but what do the rest of keys mean?
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> i thought that was documented somewhere
Action: jamest looks
<jamest> guess not
<jamest> BaseClass = python class to map to
<jamest> Required = must exist in file
<jamest> SingleInstance = only create one
<jamest> ParentTags = container object in the xml file (example block can contain entry but entry cannot contain block)
sledge_ (~sledge@B2bbe.pppool.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<StyXman> and where are the available widgets defined? I see that those are just for loading already built forms...
<sledge_> Incubator.py worries me
<StyXman> sledge_: me too. why exactly?
<sledge_> it is not OO, beside that fact that it functionality would fit quite nicely in an object
<sledge_> s/in/into/
<sledge_> btw, it is defined in line 133
<jcater> why?
<sledge_> why, why?
<jcater> <sledge_> Incubator.py worries me
<sledge_> the functionality is here, but i miss the readability :)
<StyXman> which why?
<StyXman> (just kidding)
<sledge_> which what -> /usr/bin/what
<jamest> StyXman: all publicly available (via the gfd) widgets are defined in there
<jamest> they are implemented in forms/src
<jamest> sledge_: not OO != bad
<sledge_> jamest: yep, i just mean that it could have been written more clearly; i don't say the code is bad!
<jamest> Incubator does something that will eventually be cleaned up but it works for now
<sledge_> then, i'm happy
<jamest> we have no clean API for designer to work with a form yet
<sledge_> is gnue.common documented?
<jamest> starting to be
<sledge_> you mean, an api which allows for the manipulation of forms? and designer as a front-end to that api?
<sledge_> great (docs rule!)

<StyXman> jamest: what you mean '(via the gfd)'
<StyXman> (remember I'm truly new, and that I already warned you about me :)
<jcater> well, I'm not sure that's a fair statement, jamest
<jcater> I think designer plays nicely with forms objects
<jcater> the big API deficiency
<jcater> is in drawing the objects
<sledge_> gfd: gnue forms definition, an xml file which contains the definition of a gnue form, created by designer (or by hand) and processed by the forms client
<jcater> i.e., the wx driver needs a better designer-compat api
<wilco> Have you guys looked at using HappyDoc for generating API docs?
<jcater> but I don't foresee Incubator changing too terribly much
<jcater> (as it works w/forms, reports, ....)
<jcater> wilco: yes, I think someone has HappyDoc's of Common somewhere
<jcater> but I'm not sure where
<jcater> we were looking into that last week as a matter of fact :)
<wilco> I noticed there was talk in KC about it
<wilco> Er, about documentation with DB
<jamest> jcater: my bad, i was speaking of the hacks to draw things
<sledge_> well, my problems with designer are (a) few comments (b) the data processed by designer has very implicitly-seeming structures
<jcater> (b) is an extension of (a)
<jcater> as I don't see (b) changing due to the nature of designer
<jamest> i guess that's layoutEditor though isn't it
<jcater> but more of (a) would certainly help aleviate it
<sledge_> damn :)
<jcater> the beauty of designer is that if jamest adds a l33t new widget to the Forms client, 
<jamest> sledge_: we accept patches :)
<jcater> then designer can create/modify that widget without any programming in designer
<sledge_> i see
<jcater> but, I do agree that the interactions need to be better documented
<jcater> s/better/
<gontran> who can i speak with about nstti?
<jcater> that'd be jamest 
<gontran> :)
<sledge_> jcater: if i wanted to document designer's code, (a) how to do (doc strings sufficient?) (b) simply submit as a patch?
<jcater> sure
<jcater> works for me
Action: jcater is away: lunch
<sledge_> well :)
<gontran> jamest: is nstti dusty?  would you mind if i mucked about adding doc strings (for happydoc:) and cleaning up --
<gontran> right now the test script fails in numerous ways
<sledge_> what's nstti?
<sledge_> (sorry for my ignorance)
<jamest> nstti has barely started
<gontran> sledge_: curses implementation
<jcater> gontran: I'd imagine dusty is the wrong word... perhaps "is nstti still swimming in embryonic juices?"
<sledge_> ah. terminal stuff :)
<jamest> it's working w/ a copy of nstti that isn't even availble to the public
<gontran> heh
<gontran> well, i dloaded from viewcvs the tarball and have been cleaning up -- in order to understand and document. From there
<gontran> i'd like to , you know, fix it. :)
<jamest> that would be wonderfull
<jamest> however where are you getting nstti from ?
Action: gontran coughs
<gontran> from view cvs
<gontran> at gnue.org
<gontran> :)
<jamest> um
<gontran> got a fresher tball?
<jamest> we link to that somewhere?
<gontran> must have
<gontran> maybe in the docs on cvs
<gontran> speaking of -- where's the directory reinhard referred to on gnue-dev?
<Arturas> what GFConfig.py (from /forms/src) is responsible for?
<jamest> it takes the place of gnue.conf for providing defaults to an app
<jamest> gontran: nstti status 
<jamest> the author let me put in our cvs as he doesn't have time to work on
Action: gontran nods
<jamest> i started looking at what it would take to make an nstti driver for forms
<jamest> nstti is going to need work before it'll work properly
<gontran> looked a bit like wxUidriver copied over and commented .. yeah.
<gontran> that's what i figured
Action: gontran ADORES curses
<gontran> um, as a user.:)
<sledge_> bye, gotta go.

<siesel> so, if we could add some code, f.e. some example transaction code, to the example, it would be easier to understand for others, and we could decide if it makes sense or not.

<ajmitch> could be a good idea to get something working

<jamest> where are we at wrt to release?
Action: jamest is back (gone 00:32:35)
<jcater> well
<jcater> jamest would probably know best
<jcater> might want to ask hi....
<jcater> oh, hi jamest
<jamest> hi
<jcater> well, the biggies iirc were gconfig support
<jcater> derek's trigger troubles
<jcater> which are probably a lack of understanding of the new way
<jamest> i'd say if our development team were not so worthless then we'd be done by now
<jcater> which implies better documentation
<jamest> considering I don't recall the right way I'll cut him some slack :)
<jcater> have we updated docs to reflect trigger support yet?
<jamest> um
<jcater> I don't recall
<jamest> better ask jame....er
<jamest> i don't recall
<jcater> hey
<jcater> that's my line
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> ask jcater
<jamest> that's my line
<dneighbo> i really think we need
<jamest> sounds like we have release issues covers
<jamest> jamest: ask jcater
<dneighbo> prequery support added back in boer release if its not major
<jamest> jcater: I dont recall
<jcater> rofl
<dneighbo> s/boer/before
Action: dneighbo insertints 'total recal' disk to jcater's onboard memory
<jcater> um
<jcater> prequery support
<dneighbo> wtf: general protection fault?
<jcater> well
<jcater> tjat'
<jamest> old arnold flicks will only confuse him
Action: dneighbo smacke jcater
<dneighbo> hmmm
<jcater> that's not just a bug fix
Action: dneighbo calls AI bot support
<dneighbo> darn line is busy
<dneighbo> jcater: tecnically it is
<dneighbo> as it used to work
<dneighbo> so it being broken is a bug :)
<jcater> well
<jcater> last time it worked was one year ago this month
<dneighbo> but as stated only if its not major
<dneighbo> i dont want to hold a release for it
<jamest> i don't recall (tm jcater) the issue
<jcater> it's probably not major
<jcater> but I can almost promise we'll introduce bugs by doing it :)
<jamest> but prequery has to work or dropdowns wouldn't work today
<dneighbo> jcater: ive been complaining about it for 7 months
<jcater> prequery DOES work
<dneighbo> so i was only 5 months slow in noticing it :)
<jamest> jcater: did you hear something?
<jcater> but it's not doing like it did last year
<dneighbo> jcater: just not for ui :)
<jcater> jamest: no?
<jamest> neither did I
<jamest> damn we're good
<jamest> i'm looking at the sequence thing now
<jcater> we will need to remove the
<jcater> if os.environ['LOGNAME'] in ('dneighbo','derek'): self._prequerySupport = None
<jcater> line
<jcater> because that's buggy
<jcater> we really need
<jcater> if os.environ['HOSTNAME'] == 'latitude': self._prequerySupport = None
<jcater> as we may attract other "derek"'s with the next release
<ajmitch> ah
<jamest> yeah
<ajmitch> that's a good idea
<jamest> man that's all done with ordnals and lambadas though isn't it 
<jamest> so it'll be a pain
<jamest> sigh
<ajmitch> what do you have in place for chillywilly?
<jamest> can you can care of that part jcater
<jcater> if os.environ['LOGNAME'] == 'chillywilly': 
<jcater>   print "Oh my gawd, hell froze over and chilly's running our programs!"
<jamest> rofl
<jcater>   raise "Unexpected Fault"
<jamest> oooo
<jamest> typo
<jcater> err
<jcater>   raise _("Unexpected Fault")
<ajmitch> he uses 'danielb' as username
<jamest> raise _("TotallyUnexpected Fault")
<jamest> this sucks
<jamest> i've lost my autofillBySequence test form
<jamest> and I don't recall how it works :)
Action: jamest jumps into .py files
<dneighbo> rofl
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> to the things
<jcater> autoFillBySequence is overkill imho
Action: dneighbo is nice and submits patches
<jcater> as you should simply be able to create a block-level "pre-insert"
<jamest> with 
<dneighbo> a. its ['HOSTNAME'] == 'latitude' OR ['HOSTNAME'] == 'aegagrus'
<jamest> entryname.autofillBySequence('sequencename')
<jamest> by the looks of the code
<dneighbo> b. definitely dneighbo/derek wont work as i use 'laurie' account way to much
<dneighbo> jaemst: that is what you told me :)
<jcater> and have self.myfield = dtsMine.extensions.getSequence('sequenceName')
<jamest> ?????
<dneighbo> jcater: hmmm
<jcater> but I think jamest is rught
<dneighbo> perhaps this is why my form doesnt work :)
<jamest> that's old school jcater
<dneighbo> ah
<dneighbo> i ahve autofillbySequence
<dneighbo> and it no working
<jcater> jamest: no, it uses my l33t pre-insert
<dneighbo> anyhow will be back later
dneighbo (~dneighbo@tmp-200253.flinthills.com) left irc: "[BX] *PHEAR MY BITCHX-NESS!* BOW TO ME!"
<jcater> so it's a combination of old-skewl and l33t new code
<jcater> he really should find a better solution than bitchx
<chillywilly> hardy har har
<chillywilly> I am just a wannabe GNUer
<chillywilly> some day when I grow up I'll GNUe
