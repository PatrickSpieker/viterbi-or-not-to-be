<reinhard> hello lsa
<reinhard> any questions we can answer for you?
Action: reinhard saw the ".at" in the signon line
<lsa> hallo reinhard
<lsa> nice to see another .at
<nickr> la de dee
<lsa> no questions except for whether you know a reference project realised in a gnuenterprise suite
<reinhard> dneighbo, jcater and jamest use GNUe Forms, Reports and Designer
<reinhard> in production
<reinhard> for projects they are involved in
<lsa> i see
<reinhard> GNU Enterprise as a whole (read: the end application - finance, supply chain etc) only exists on paper by now
<lsa> what/who the hell are dneighbo, jcater and jamest ?
<reinhard> from what i hear forms/reports/designer can be used fairly well as a m$ access replacement
<jamest> pathetic losers from the US
<reinhard> they are all here as we speak :)
<lsa> :-)
<reinhard> dneighbo and jamest are real persons
<jamest> they look, smell, and act kinda funny most the times
<reinhard> jcater is a coding anderoid
<jamest> powered by donuts
<jamest> he rocks
<lsa> we have been assigned a smaller contract to migrate from a m$ access application and we thought about gnuenterprise as well
<^chewie> I'm not here at all
<reinhard> cool
Action: ^chewie grins
<lsa> but the project had to be web-based and gnuenterprise did not provide this interface
<reinhard> ah
<lsa> so we chose phpgroupware and coding has begun
<^chewie> lsa: we chose zope instead
<lsa> aha
<^chewie> lsa: now, a zope product to gnu enterprise would be pretty cool
<^chewie> ;-)
<jamest> ^chewie: yip
<^chewie> IMHO, PHP is good for quick hacks
<lsa> we didn't like zope because it provides a really thick layer and a stripped-down python
<lsa> (non-standard python) we saw many complaining about the language
<lsa> we dont like big-n-fat apps
<lsa> gets you very much exposed to problems in the middleware
<^chewie> lsa: hmmm...  Not sure I agree with your assessment of zope yet
<^chewie> lsa: but I'll keep an open mind
<^chewie> ;-)
Action: lsa thanks chewie for his opennes
<dneighbo> interesting
<dneighbo> gnue right now is PRIME for replacing access applicatinos
<dneighbo> er applications
<dneighbo> i.e. i think that would be the #1 use as it sits today
<^chewie> the one feature I like most about zope is the templating as opposed to embedded markup
<dneighbo> the 'need web' is interesting
<dneighbo> will your application be GPL?
<^chewie> dneighbo: true, but we don't want to push out libraries w/each client
<^chewie> think thin client as a requirement
<^chewie> super-thin
<lsa> how would you migrate from a damn m$ access apps?
<dneighbo> um yeah mozilla or i.e. are thin
<lsa> dneighbo: of course GPL
<dneighbo> super thin
<^chewie> lynx is thin
<^chewie> w3m is thin
<dneighbo> if you are making people use lynx for a production application i pity your users
<dneighbo> :)
<^chewie> I pity them anyway
<dneighbo> btw: the correct answer is mozilla,i.e. might be thick thin clients
<dneighbo> BUT in our case they are already on the machine
<lsa> many of the users come with their own crap OS
<lsa> with a broken browser.
<^chewie> I never bring focus to a particular HTML rendurer
<lsa> why haven't you pushed the html interface of gnue?
<lsa> (as first interface)
<^chewie> the fact that there are many different HTML rendurers for many different platforms with MOSTLY the same output gives us a LOT of flexibility
<^chewie> they do
<^chewie> but they're experimental
<^chewie> I think there's a PHPForms out there, right?
<lsa> dunno
<dneighbo> there is phpclient in cvs now (iirc)
<dneighbo> also a webware one (though it might not be in cvs)
Action: ^chewie nods
<dneighbo> the main reason we dont/havent pushed it
<^chewie> not familiar w/webware
<dneighbo> is most of our core things webapplications suck
<dneighbo> we fully want gnue to support them
<dneighbo> but we are 'excited' to be coding them :)
<^chewie> they do, but there is a reason for even 'sucky' front ends, such as pushing out portions of software to a web
<dneighbo> an example would be jcater's situation
<dneighbo> 40 nodes using LTSP
<dneighbo> shared gfd's
<dneighbo> shared gnue setup
Action: ^chewie nods
<lsa> gfd?
<dneighbo> why bother complicating stuff with a shitty browser :)
<dneighbo> gnue forms definition
<lsa> aha
<dneighbo> its what gets read by the forms engine to create a gui
<^chewie> the largest reason why client/server apps suck on web browsers is because there is no true MVC model
<^chewie> the protocol doesn't really allow it
<dneighbo> people get too caught up with 'web' model imho
<dneighbo> if you at cvs i think jcater recently checked in 'static' version stuff for gnue
<jamest> yeah! a shitty forms client is so much better!
<dneighbo> so an admin's life is cake to keep clients up to date
<^chewie> heh
<dneighbo> jamest: roflmao
<gontran> <phm>heterogenous os environs demand a web-based solution
Action: jamest is working in forms code today :)
<lsa> dneighbo: sure, but how to provide the interface to people we cannot change the OS&browser of?
<dneighbo> gontran : um thats bull shit :)
<dneighbo> gnue runs on same platforms as browsers :)
<gontran> I'm trying to get it out of my head
<^chewie> more software to push out
<dneighbo> lsa: i dont think gnue cant run on any O/S that there is a browser for
<gontran> dneighbo: yer rite, it's mostly hype
<dneighbo> ^chewie : i just said jcater checking in STATIC ability for gnue
<^chewie> ;-)
<dneighbo> so its 'shared' install
<dneighbo> iirc
<lsa> but then i have to tell 200+ users out there in the country to install a damn client they wont manage it ever
<dneighbo> the only time i see web app having a real advantage
<dneighbo> is if you have LOTS of clients you are not in any control of
<gontran> create a nice installer?
<dneighbo> i.e. CLASSIC web applications
Action: lsa fully agrees with <dneighbo>
<dneighbo> lsa: i just said that is only place where there is advantage of web app is a true disparate system
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> i dont many companies wanting inventory, financials etc shared by the masses of the internet
<dneighbo> most of those applications are behind firewalls and on VPNs where the stuff is controlled (imho)
<^chewie> s/internet/Intranet/
<dneighbo> so when i say i shudder at web accounting
<dneighbo> i see no ADVANTAGE to web
<dneighbo> yet i see a very real disadvantage in ease of use
<dneighbo> a. the widgets are not conduvice to high volume entry/validation
<dneighbo> b. statelessness sucks :)
<dneighbo> that said its EXTREMELY important for gnue to have a webclient :)
<gontran> heh
Action: lsa agrees
<^chewie> brb
<reinhard> bbl
Action: reinhard is away: shower
<lsa> what about java applet clients (i dont like java too much)
<jamest> java!
<jamest> argh!
Action: jamest grabs his mallet
<lsa> how are you going to realise the web client?
<jamest> server side for now
<lsa> what's on the clients side?
<jamest> the browser only
<lsa> plain html, dynamic html, javascript, ...?
<dneighbo> yip
<dneighbo> like normal web application
<dneighbo> btw: an applet is not a web application
<dneighbo> as you have to download .java files to your computer
<lsa> right
<dneighbo> so your argument of 'distribution' to lots of users over the world is then lost
<dneighbo> as every time you upgrade they will have to redownload applet etc.... (iirc)

<Chipaca> hi all
<dneighbo> with geas i think we can have something similar to applets
<dneighbo> you download (via good installer) the client
Action: lsa cites himself: "(i dont like java too much)"

<^chewie> hmm...
<^chewie> I notice that the debian/control file for forms lists the package as python-gnue-forms
<^chewie> the existing package is called gnue-forms (woody)
<^chewie> yet doing apt-get source gnue-forms reveals no debian/. specific files
<^chewie> do you know what the "real" name of the package should be?
<^chewie> I realize that the python naming practice in debian seems to be "python-<something>".
<^chewie> however, since the gnue apps all relate to eachother, I don't see anything wrong w/just leaving it as "gnue-forms" w/the assumption that it's a python app.

<chillywilly> hey did you knwo thwey want to regulate the internet with the FCC?
<dneighbo> doesnt suprise me much
<chillywilly> teySorry, but this is really late notice.  Tomorrow is the last
<chillywilly> day for comments on the FCC's proposal to call the Internet
<chillywilly> an "information service" for the entrenched broadband
<chillywilly> interests.  Ostensibly, this decision is being made in
<chillywilly> preference over classifying broadband internet as a
<chillywilly> "communications medium," which would place it under
<chillywilly> regulations like those phone companies are subject to.  It
<chillywilly> is therefore being characterized as a decision for
<chillywilly> deregulation versus regulation.
<chillywilly> Anybody who can, PLEASE send in a note saying this is not a
<chillywilly> question of whether regulation or deregulation is better
<chillywilly> policy (this is just a smokescreen) -- it's a question of
<chillywilly> the nature of the online medium:  Is it a "content" delivery
<chillywilly> system, or a communications medium characterized by its
<chillywilly> fundamental two-way protocols, one which brings profound new
<chillywilly> capabilities to all citizens?
<chillywilly> *Please* send even just a short note to the FCC at
<chillywilly> ecfs@fcc.gov.
<chillywilly> If you know any other constituencies that would want to put
<chillywilly> a word in on this, please let them know.

<chillywilly> hey dneighbo
<dneighbo> hi chillywilly
<dneighbo> i hate tv
Action: dneighbo started to watch diamondbacks then got up and took video games back to blockbuster
<dneighbo> went to say night to wife before coming in the office and CSI was on and i got sucked in
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> :P
<jcater> hey all
Action: jcater found another reason to love KDE in my remote office
<jcater> http://www.tjansen.de/krfb/
<dneighbo> um free donuts?
<jcater> hehe
<jcater> that's gonna be my new tagline
<jcater> instead of "Free as in beer? or free as in speech?"
Action: jcater will have
<jcater> "Free as in Donuts? or Free as in Donut Recipes?"
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> um how does this help you
<jcater> dude
<dneighbo> as you dont want them all sharing the same desktop right?
<jcater> running VNC servers on my remote Win32 machines
<jcater> has saved me hours^Wdays in support
<chillywilly> it helps you amdin them as you can connection and manipulate their desktop
<dneighbo> yes
<chillywilly> remotely
Action: jcater takes control of the user's desktop
<jcater> "well, no, you *didn't* select that option. 
<jcater> You need to click *here* <jcater remotely moves their mouse to the correct
<jcater> position>"
<dneighbo> * jcater found another reason to love KDE in my remote office
<dneighbo> i mis read this
<chillywilly> misread even
<jcater> all the VNC server's for Unix I've seen start up a whole new X session
<jcater> which certainly has been useful for me too
<dneighbo> i was thinking you were saying you liked this because it helped 'performance' re: our earlier discussion
<jcater> ah
<jcater> lol
<jcater> no
<jcater> management
<jcater> my users can't leave well enough alone
<dneighbo> and im thinking how the hell do 40 people share the same desktop and be productive :)
<jcater> and have customized the hell out of kde
<jcater> one of our customer service reps keeps calling
<jcater> "My computer is broken"
<dneighbo> but as support tool it makes PERFECT sense
<jcater> my guys: Um, no it can't be... you use the EXACT same computer as the other 39 ppl
<jcater> girl: But, it doesn't work right
<jcater> two days later...
<dneighbo> btw: fluxbox has full 'kde tray' support iirc
<jcater> girl: Um, I found out that if I log in under someone else's name, it works fine
<dneighbo> so you could run this right in fluxbox in the 'slit'
<dneighbo> and yes 'slit' is what they really call it
<jcater> my guys: Well, DUH! you can't leave well enough alone!
Action: dneighbo still trips on the 'just put it in your slit' references
<jcater> sigh
Action: jcater has horrible, horrible flashbacks to "American Pie" and the band chick
<dneighbo> this one summer at band camp....
<dneighbo> ok time to get down to bidness
<chillywilly> sheeeeeit
<dneighbo> jcater you able to do any real time bug squashing
<jcater> um
<dneighbo> (although i think i ran issues by you and they are more 'jamest' arena)
Action: jcater isn't feeling well and took 3 Tylenol PMs 20 minutes ago
<jcater> so not sure how long I'm here
<jcater> probably not much longer
<dneighbo> grab a lemonade and sit right down, you are at optimal working power :)
Action: dneighbo cant get that glass bottle through the internet, and they call this 'broadband'. ha.
<jcater> http://www.software.hp.com/blade-servers/debian_img.htm
<dneighbo> kick butt
<dneighbo> having perens there tends to do that :)
