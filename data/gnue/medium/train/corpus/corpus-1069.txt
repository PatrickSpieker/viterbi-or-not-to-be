<StyXman> hi, peop.
<jamest> hi
<StyXman> I'm trying to run gdesigner under my user only
<StyXman> but no lick
<StyXman> s/lick/luck/
<jamest> what's the error?
<StyXman> NameError: global name '_' is not defined
<StyXman> it says it can't fint the messages for gettext, I think...
<jamest> :(
<jamest> you running latest cvs?
<StyXman> (that's what I guess from the warnings before the bt)
<StyXman> jamest: yeap. but I don't/can't install it in /usr/local. I'm not root here...
<jamest> no need 
<jamest> this is a localization error :(
<jamest> my cvs copy here is trashed at the moment so I can't even test that :(
<jamest> let me see if I can get my copy running again real quick
<StyXman> and I *hate* how my personalizations to files like setup.cfg is written over with setupcfg..in

<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> jcater : do you have functional cvs and a few minutes to test something
<jcater> yes and maybe
<jamest> my cvs is broken at the moment
<jamest> StyXman says that designer will not run but I can't test it
<jcater> um
<jcater> what's the problem
<jcater> it opens for me
<jcater> is it a specific action that's causing it to crash?
<StyXman> gimme just two secs, I'll try another thing
<jamest> NameError: global name '_' is not defined
<jcater> ah
<jcater> I bet he has a locale setting
<jcater> whereas I don't 
<jcater> so mine is falling back to the dummy _
<StyXman> jcater: nope. it's that every path is hardcoded.
<StyXman> everythun points to /usr/local
<jcater> eh?
<jcater> oh
<jcater> lemme look
<StyXman> and I don't have rights there...
<jcater> you running cvs copy, I presume?
<StyXman> yeap
<StyXman> is setup.cfg used for anything?!?
<jcater> not for cvs install
<StyXman> jcater: :( ok, I'll try to point to where it should. if I have some spare time, I'll try to fix local instalatiopn.
<jcater> wait
<jcater> did you run ./setup-cvs.py
<jcater> or the individual ./setup.py scripts in each tool?
<StyXman> should I run './setup.py devel' with sdist or build?
<StyXman> er, I run setup-cvs.py, but it doesn't install designer.
<jcater> ?
<jcater> it should install a gfdes
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I do see a bug in setup-cvs.py
<jamest> i didn't do it!
Action: jamest runs
<StyXman> :)))
<StyXman> so, do I wait? or can you point me to it?

<jcater> Anyone running CVS copy of tools:
<jcater> Please update your CVS checkout,
<jcater> do a rm -f ~/gnue/translations,
<jcater> and then rerun setup-cvs.py
<jcater> **************************************
<jcater> err, my commit failed
<jcater> hang on
<jcater> ok, now it's committed
<StyXman> jcater: I just used ~/src/work/fvl/gnue/live 
<jcater> as your base directory?
<StyXman> must it be ~/gnue?
<jcater> no
<jcater> but adapt that statement to your local setup :)
<StyXman> ok, I'lll try now.
<StyXman> ah, ok :)
<jcater> StyXman: btw, this may not solve your problem
<jcater> but then again it may :)
<StyXman> :)
<StyXman> the readme doesn't say anything about designer...
<StyXman> but 'Creating designer/client/gfdes'
<StyXman> came out the script.. crossing fingers..
<Arturas> jcater: what has changed in /translations?
<StyXman> 'Unable to load locale information falling back to dummy _()'
<StyXman> but it loaded..
<jcater> Arturas: I changed the way the symlink was created
<jcater> I didn't actually change anything in there
<jcater> but the way it was
<jcater> each time you ran ./setup-cvs.py, 
<jcater> it would create another level of "translations"
<jcater> i.e., after 4 runs
<jcater> you'd have translations/translations/translations/translations/
<StyXman> with Baa B-baa Baa I mean 'this is darn great!' :)
<Arturas> jcater: my mistake, sorry
<jamest> Arturas: i did change the way the stuff loaded
<jamest> you shouldn't need to import GImport anymore
<jamest> _() should just always work :)
<StyXman> what's _() used for?
<Arturas> when you have string in English
<StyXman> is the translator function?
<Arturas> it shows, that this string has translations
<Arturas> yes
<StyXman> using gettext...
<Arturas> yes
<StyXman> ok, U get it.
<StyXman> s/U/I/

<sledge_> hi there
<StyXman> ok, I can ask about designer, right?
<jamest> i dunno
<jamest> does it mean more work for us?
<StyXman> from Desugner.py, I realize that it can handle several instances. I think an instance is like the representation and handler of a form?
<jamest> i believe so
<StyXman> 'believe'?!?
<jamest> i don't know the designer code well 
<jcater> StyXman: yes
<jamest> but it can handle multiple forms open
<jcater> well, technically, it's an instance of a designer object
<jamest> as for how the handlers work I don't knwo
<sledge_> StyXman: yes, from what i've seen
<jcater> with FormsInstances being the only currently implemented type
<jcater> but we'll also have report instances, biz rules instances, etc
<sledge_>  damnit gotta go bye

<jcater> I try not to admit that in public
<StyXman> (are you...? I need to practise more my english... :(
<StyXman> :))
<StyXman> ok, supposse you're not. you'll be hearing a lot from me (mostly just questions) in the following days... sorry to infrom that :)
<StyXman> uh, what does * mean to python? as in 'return c(self, *args, **parms)'
<StyXman> (Designer.py:298)
<jamest> variable number of args and parms passsed to the function c
<jamest> if c is called
<jamest> c(1,2,3,4,5)
<jamest> then args gets them all as (IIRC) a list
<jcater> if you have a list, l, set to ['test','bob','jane'], then c(*l) is the same as c('test','bob','jane')
<jcater> err, what jamest said
<jamest> the parms are filled with a  dict is c is called like
<jamest> c(foo=1,bar=2,jcater=3,donut=4)
<jamest> with keys foo,bar,jcater,donut and values 1,2,3,4 respectively
<StyXman> uf! I got a flashback to C... brrr!
<jcater> well, at least we don't have any
<jcater> asm {
<jcater> }

<nickr> I layed out a good schema for it on the plane
<dneighbo> i am seeing a need for us internally to have a way to manage our documentation

<nickr> X shouldn't care about sounds in the slightest

<nickr> I'm pretty sure I've called it much worse.
<nickr> dneighbo: so what is GNUe looking for from a docustore?
<^chewie> hmm
<dneighbo> well what i was thinking (at first)
<dneighbo> was i need a nice web interface (or forms interface) to our documentation
<dneighbo> so it can be stored 'physically' all over the server (if so desired)
<dneighbo> but have a unified way to get at it
Action: dneighbo was really thinking of trying to make it like a library in a sense
<dneighbo> i.e. categorized, searchable etc etc
<dneighbo> and then i started thinking hey wait some of this stuff is the same thing a lawyer or doctor or xxx might need to get at their 'documents'
<dneighbo> maybe i should be thinking about document management here
<nickr> yea
<nickr> in my current plan
Action: dneighbo wasnt even getting into versioning and such
<dneighbo> just a front end to find whats there
<nickr> it allows youto store a notional docgument as a URL/md5 sum or thhe actual data
<dneighbo> as right now someone says where can get mroe information on X
<nickr> I don't havwe my clipboard here
<dneighbo> and i have to grep and grok and groan to try to remember where all the files are that might be relevant
<nickr> tonight I'll do a dia of the schema I havwe in mind
<nickr> on the metadatabase side
<dneighbo> so even a database that does meta data
<dneighbo> and just stores a url would be a huge win :)
<nickr> the metadatabase and actual storage thing are pretty independent
<nickr> and so is the libarary which is a layer on top of metadatabase
<nickr> I'll start laying out the metadatabase componant when I get the chance
<nickr> its actually kind of neat
<nickr> you recall before that I had a fixed sort of versiniong relationship?
<nickr> I changed that so there are 'relationship objects' which define various classes of relationships between documents
<nickr> eg version-of, derivative-of, etc
<nickr> each would be well defined so you could track the genaelogy of a particular document
<nickr> these rel/ationships could also provide heuristics for inheriting metadata

<reinhard> jcater: may i throw a quick question?
<jcater> can I duck?
<jcater> sure
<reinhard> does the pygresql dbdriver work and is it compatible with the python-pygresql package in debian?
<reinhard> (sorry that's *two* quick questions)
<jcater> um
<jcater> as far as I know it does
<reinhard> ok
<jcater> however, I think jamest was noticing some issues w/pygresql and Postgres 7.2+
<jcater> but I can't confirm or deny that
<reinhard> just seemed to me as most of you use pypgsql
<reinhard> which otoh isn't in debian
<jcater> I use psycopg or pypgsql
<reinhard> (at least not in woody)
<jcater> psycopg is in there
<jcater> and that's what the debian ppl usually use
<jcater> we use pypgsql on Win32 
<jcater> as that's the only pre-compiled win32 lib we can find

<sledge_> jcater: packages.debian.org/testing/sound/mp3burn.html -> it does
<jcater> sledge_: cool, thx
<sledge_> btw, some guy at school claimed that there would be lower cpu usage if you decode mp3s just by tuning to lower volume *g*
<jcater> um
<sledge_> s/if you decode/when decoding/
<jcater> this is a dumb question
<jcater> but how do I know which device my cdr uses?

<jcater> so what would my /dev be for cdrecord?
<sledge_> do you have multiple cdrs/cdwriters?
<jcater> nope
<jcater> just a single IDE one
<jcater> kreatecd works just fine
<sledge_> ls -la /dev/cdrom :-)
<jcater> but I don't know what device it is actually using
<sledge_>  /dev/cdrom is default, and it is usually a link to the real device, created by the distribution during installation or upgrade
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> but that's just the cdrom device
<jcater> found it...
<jcater> /dev/sg0 is what it wants

<reinhard> now i've got gnuef working with a database on this machine
<reinhard> guess it's only a matter of understanding the code to see how common db access works
<jamest> i think I started to doc that

<jamest> I'll see about checking it in this afternoon incomplete
<sledge_> btw, what's the current status with documentation with regard to the doc tools (sgml?)
<reinhard> jamest: thanks
<reinhard> sledge_: you sure you want to ask that?
<reinhard> ;)
<sledge_> can i un-ask that question? :)
<gontran> i worked that openjade like a 5 year old slave-child, and couldn't get any docs out
<jamest> sigh
Action: jamest has mental issues thanks to openjade and jade
<gontran> that's ok though, cause I really should be reading code instead
<gontran> :)
<sledge_> just use plain text files and let some stoopid typesetting guy figure it out for the dead tree versions *eg*
<dneighbo> go to #docbook they will help
<jamest> i'd rather continue fixing up the config system for the 0.3.0 installer's use
<gontran> yeah
<jamest> or staple my nads to a tree
<gontran> would hurt less
<jamest> both seem less painful than my last openjade experience
<sledge_> i see.
Action: gontran scratches at scabs on hands
<sledge_> why do you scratch at scabs on hands?

<jcater> what gives?
<dneighbo> roflmao
<dneighbo> actually i was up until about 2 am coding last night
Action: dneighbo is so shameful
<dneighbo> i build a mass email tool for a client
<sledge_> spam?
Action: dneighbo had one before that was for a one time or local mailer
<dneighbo> but this is so they can do on demand in higher volumes
<dneighbo> sledge_ not really spam but kind of spam
<dneighbo> they only mail people that are registered to their site (they are a job placement company)
<sledge_> aha, fine
<dneighbo> so basically they email job openings to people
<dneighbo> sledge_ : well im ashamed as i think its wrong
<dneighbo> the right thing woudl be to make that a 'registration' option
<dneighbo> to receive email or not
<dneighbo> and only send if they agree
<dneighbo> i have no problem with it being the default optoin
<dneighbo> but ah well its not a general 'spammer' tool so i dont feel too guilty :)

<jamest> just a sec
<jamest> ok
<jamest> IIRC
<jamest> first you have to initialize a datasource
<reinhard> ok
<jamest> this will require setting a few vars in a datasource instance then calling it's initialize function IIRC
<jamest> you'll also need to create a connection manager
<jamest> and tell the datasource to use it (this gives you connection pooling)
<reinhard> where can i see the instance vars of datasource?
<jamest> probably the best place to look is in GDataSource.py
<jamest> but not at the code
<jamest> er
<jamest> class
<jamest> look at the bottom of the file in the xmlElements 
<jamest> the attributes are the things that can be set from an xml file
<reinhard> ok gotcha
<jamest> is this for geas2
<jamest> ?
<reinhard> no for another project i'm working at
<jamest> ah
<jamest> ok
<reinhard> j/k
<reinhard> sure for geas v2
<reinhard> :)
<jamest> if this is for geas2 and if we use xml files 
<jamest> then you don't really need to worry much about this
<jamest> as the xml parser does the right thing
<reinhard> use xml files for what?
<sledge_> data transfer?
<jamest> defining the datasources 
<sledge_> ah
<reinhard> jamest: geas will define the datasources dynamically i think
<jamest> reinhard?
<reinhard> let me rephrase
<reinhard> _if_ we use xml files
<reinhard> i don't think the parsing of the file will be at the same time as the creation of the datasource object in memory
<jamest> why is that?
<reinhard> well at least this is how i would think it works:
<reinhard> client requests an object from appserver
<reinhard> appserver checks if class name is valid (needs xml definition for that)
<reinhard> if valid then appserver translates classname into table name
<reinhard> then appserver creates datasource object
<reinhard> and fetches the data
<reinhard> would that sound sane?
<reinhard> we have some translation between the xml definitions (= object definitions)
<reinhard> and the database access (= table definitions)
<sledge_> um, i don't understand the "translates classname to tablename" part
<reinhard> sledge_: the ideas is that appserver shows an object oriented interface to the client
<reinhard> most important translation here is namespace
<reinhard> i.e. we will have "modules" with own namespace
<reinhard> to avoid naming conflicts between parts of the application created by different people
<sledge_> i understand better by now.
<jamest> um
<reinhard> all tables of a module will be prefixed by the module name in the db table
<sledge_> aha
dsmith (~dsmith@208.40.56.34) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> i think I see where you are going
<jamest> you're not wanting to tie up memory with unused datasources
<jamest> is that correct?
<sledge_> i get it too. is that documented / flow-charted? would be nice for those like me who are not app-server insiders but still gives good insight.
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> (to jamest)
<jamest> hmmmm
<reinhard> no
<reinhard> (to sledge_)
<reinhard> jamest: i think a final gnue install could have some 100 tables
<sledge_> that's a realistic number
<jamest> that's not too bad for our datasources as they pool connections
<reinhard> plus it will occur that we need 2 datasources pointing to the same table at the same time
<jamest> all you're really storing is table association
<jamest> why 2?
<reinhard> for example 2 users access the same table at the same time
<sledge_> 2 is just an example, you mean something like "n" = any natural number, right?
<reinhard> yes of course
<jamest> i'm not sure that's needed
<jamest> well
<jamest> it would currently be necessary I guess
<jamest> dang it, youre making me think!
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> actually another reason is that i want appserver to be very modular
<reinhard> i.e. to separate the object repository (where the objects are defined) from the database access part
<sledge_> what about queries and programming comfort? i.e.
<sledge_> i have two tables (master/detail) and want to link them at the appserver level
<sledge_> when i only have two table objects, how do i do sql-like joins or something similar on that?
<reinhard> sledge_: our thinking is like
<reinhard> myorders = a list of order objects
<reinhard> then you can do
<jamest> sledge_: I'd do that in 2-tier mode...datasource definitions do master/detail now
<reinhard> order = myorders.firstinstance()
<jamest> geas is different
<reinhard> print order.customername
<reinhard> print order.comment
<reinhard> orderitems = order.items
<reinhard> oneitem = orderitems.firstinstance()
<reinhard> --
<sledge_> ah! now i get it
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> you sure?
<reinhard> you must be quick :)
<jamest> :)
<reinhard> we have objectlists
<reinhard> objects
<reinhard> and every object has fields
<reinhard> a field can be a text or a number
<sledge_> i have thought about it before and that what you say is precisely the same -- i just didn't know how your thought about that is :)
<reinhard> or another objectlist
<sledge_> a tree?
<sledge_> (in the more general sense of the word)
<reinhard> even more a web
<reinhard> you can have customer.orders -> returns a list of all orders of this customer
<reinhard> and at the same time have
<reinhard> order.customer -> returns a single object, the customer of _this_ order
<sledge_> a "tendencially tree-oriented interlinked structure"
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> lol
<jamest> in any case datasource are biased toward being created by the parser
<sledge_> the appserver concept looks simple (implementation isn't, of course)
<jamest> not that it's required but it'll probably need some polish to make it more friendly to the developer not using a parser
<reinhard> jamest: we won't really have a parser here
<jamest> i need to study geas more but most of what you require is _almost_ in common
<jamest> objects have custom namespaces, executable code can be attached to events
<jamest> etc,
<jamest> however most if it is based upon idea that the parser builds the initial structure of the app
<jamest> so we'll have to make some adjustments in common to do it differently
<reinhard> hmmm
<jamest> I've started working on making common more general now
<reinhard> i actually thought there is a pure database abstraction layer in common
<jamest> GConfig is first
<jamest> looks like data system may need to be second
<jamest> :)
<reinhard> didn't think that the parser is integrated with that
<jamest> the parser builds everything
<jamest> well
<sledge_> cs = myblonde.cupsize() ???
<jamest> i take that back
<jamest> the parser builds an inverted tree of app objects
<jamest> then the GClientApp system callings a phasedInitialization system that lets each object set itself up
<jamest> the datasystem makes just such an assumption
<jcater> Objects can be created/added to a parser tree without GParser
<jamest> as there is no clean API to set this up outside the parse
<jcater> just look at designer/Incubator
<jamest> yes
<jamest> but is it clean?
Action: jamest was thinking it was not
<jcater> um
<jcater> that's a loaded question
<jamest> :)
<jcater> no, it's a nasty, perverted setup
<jcater> j/k
<jcater> in my mind, it's clean
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> just my style
<jamest> gnue me baby
Action: jcater dcc's jamest a parser
<jcater> JTParser.py
<jamest> i feel so cheap
<jamest> but I kinda like it
<reinhard> ok now after i have the datasource
<reinhard> what is next?
<jamest> that should be about it
<jamest> you use it to create resultSets
<jamest> which contain recordSets
<reinhard> getResultSet?
<reinhard> oh no
<jamest> which contains your data
<reinhard> createResultSet
<reinhard> ?
<jamest> checking
<jamest> you should be able to call createResultSet
<reinhard> ok
<jamest> if you pass it a condition tree from GConditions then that'll alter the query to match what you require
<reinhard> sounds much like something i will try tomorrow :)
<jamest> a simple example of this is in forms/src/GFObjects/GFBlock.py
<jamest> I'm sure a more robust example would be in reports
<jamest> as forms just does simple AND queries at this time
<sledge_> reinhard: i have cleaned up our discussion on geas2 internals, would you be interested in that text file, perhaps you can build it into your docs?
<reinhard> sledge_: good that you're not _here_
<reinhard> i think i would kiss you now ;)
<sledge_> reinhard: please hold back and think of your wife. *g*
<jamest> reinhard: what would your wife think
<reinhard> :)
<jcater> reinhard: give me about 10 minutes
<jcater> and I'll do a quick demo file
<jcater> maybe that'd help?
<jamest> oooooo
<reinhard> jcater: you'll get even 8 hours
<jamest> jcater is the datasource masta
<reinhard> as i'll go to sleep now
<jamest> it's design is a reflection on the way he thinks
<jamest> I'll leave that to others to determine if that's a good or bad thing :)
<reinhard> but if i have it by tomorrow it's great
<reinhard> sledge_: thanks a lot; this will find it's way into the whitepaper
<reinhard> soon

<jcater> we have common/README.datases
<jcater> it will need to be updated before our release

<ajmitch> hi
<jcater> php4 's isntall scripts licks bag
<jcater> it says it's gonna enable the LoadModule, but it never does

<siesel> jcater, i didn't look at the obvious places, and oversaw README.databases. but although its quite complete, i still think their are some informations missing for example, if the database adapter supports introspection. 
<jcater> yeah
<siesel> I dunno much about the db abstraction, so I can't add it myself, but i think its quite important.
<jcater> we will add that before the next release
<jcater> which, for the record, we are targeting at next weekend
<jcater> from memory, though
<jcater> introspection is well tested for

<drochaid> wb jcater
<jcater> why, thank you, sir drochaid
<siesel> how can i split an url into transport, host and port?
<jcater> in python?
<siesel> yep.
<siesel> as easy and fast as possible. 
<siesel> i don't want to use regexp if possible.
<jcater> transport, host, port = string.split(yourstring,':',2)
<jcater> ?
<ajmitch> split on ':' and drop // ?
<siesel> THX
<siesel> eeh but how can i cut off the // from the transport?
<jcater> if host[:2] == '//': host = host[2:]
<jamest_> string.split(string.replace(yourstring,'//',''),':',2)
<jamest_> btw
Action: ajmitch luvs python
<jamest_> you'll have to watch the transport, host, port setting
<siesel> transport, host, port, path = \

<jamest_> if you're missing 2nd : it'll probably error out
<ajmitch> how does one prepend an item to a list, btw?
<Isomer> a=[1]+a
<Isomer> ?
<siesel> in php i allway used regular expressions, but normally this is overkill
<jcater> um
<jcater> here's an idea
<jcater> file:/usr/local/doc/python-2.0.1/lib/module-urlparse.html
<ajmitch> thx Isomer
<jcater> damn, that's local
<jcater> anywho
<jcater> you can import urlparse
<jcater> Example: 
<jcater> urlparse('http://www.cwi.nl:80/%7Eguido/Python.html')
<jcater>  yields the tuple 
<jcater> ('http', 'www.cwi.nl:80', '/%7Eguido/Python.html', '', '', '')

<siesel> jcater, i want to enable the appserver tests per setup-cvs.py, because its to complicated to run them standalone. (you have to set INSTALL_PREFIX (for I18) and PYTHON_LIBRARY_PATH). what do you think? 
<jcater> um
<jcater> on my system, I copied gfcvs to gcvs
<jcater> and changed the last line from
<jcater>      /usr/bin/python2.1 /home/jason/cvs/gnue/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/forms/GFClient.py $*
<jcater> to
<jcater>      /usr/bin/python2.1  $*
<jcater> this lets me run any test script using GNUe's environment
<jcater> I was thinking about having this gcvs automatically created by setup-cvs.py
<jcater> what do you think about that instead?

<jcater> instead of typing python mytestfile.py
<jcater> you could just do 
<jcater> gcvs mytestfile.py
<siesel> I thought about putting new commands into setup-cvs.py
<siesel> something like gappserv or gappserv-test ...
<jcater> oh, for appserver
<jcater> sure, that makes sense
Action: jcater was thinking you were talking about DonutFactory, et al
<siesel> for donut-factory it would be great to add a gcvstest which show a list of demos, then you can choose one by pressing a number
<jcater> I must run
<siesel> what do you think, whats a good shortcut for the appserver? gascvs  gacvs ascvs gaservs  
<siesel> ok cu
<jcater> gacvs ?
<jcater> that would probably be fine
<siesel> ok. 
<siesel> you can find it in cvs very soon.
Nick change: jcater -> jc-Spiderman
