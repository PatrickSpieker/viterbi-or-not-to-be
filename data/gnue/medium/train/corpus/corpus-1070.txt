<drochaid> shame I absolutely hate coffee ... can I change the name please? :)
<Ford_> Is there a GnuForms developer around 
<Ford_> ?
<drochaid> not I
Action: chillywilly points at jamest
<drochaid> hey chillywilly
<chillywilly> hey
<chillywilly> and it's GNUe Forms dude
<Ford_> chillywilly: I beg you pardon ... gnu'E' Forms of course :P
<drochaid> no no no Ford_ .. GNUe Forms ... not gnuE Forms ;)
<Ford_> :PPP :)
<drochaid> heh
<chillywilly> took the workds out of my mouth
<chillywilly> or characters off my keyboard
<chillywilly> as I can't type now ;)
<chillywilly> it's all your fault drochaid
<Ford_> that forms lib is ready for 2-tier applications right ?
<chillywilly> yep
<drochaid> it always is chillywilly, I accept full responsibility
<chillywilly> hehe
<Ford_> is there a documentation on what kind of triggers would be able to configure ?
<chillywilly> there's a forms technical reference
<Ford_> I read that
<chillywilly> and user's guide
<Ford_> User's Guide... hmm
<chillywilly> there should be more up to date docs coming shortly with the next release
<chillywilly> hey jamest when it the release planned?
Action: chillywilly waits...
Action: drochaid waits as well...
<chillywilly> s/it/is
<Ford_> okay... now printing the developers guide
<chillywilly> some of these guys are just too busy to reply ;)
<Ford_> the complete source code is C++ ?
<chillywilly> for forms?
<chillywilly> all our current tools are written in python
<chillywilly> current being == cvs ;)
<Ford_> Everything in Python? phew...
<chillywilly> you're relieved?
<Ford_> even the GEAS ? And that Corba stuff ?
<chillywilly> geas is being rewritten in python
<chillywilly> the old GEAS is in C
<chillywilly> and that was the only thing that was written in C
<chillywilly> but now we have the start of the new geas call "appserver" in cvs which is Python
<Ford_> why python ?
<jamest> it's simple to understand
<jamest> it's fairly powerfull

<the_grunf> hey
<jamest> and it integrates w/ C if we need the performance
<the_grunf> anyone free 4 a question here ?
<jamest> we can try and answer
<drochaid> but if the question is about thai currys .. you'd be better off in #openbeos :)
<the_grunf> i'm using mandrake 8.2, and there's no way i can install wxGTK...it says i need libpng.so.2
<the_grunf> drochaid: anything against curry ? ;)
<drochaid> not at all .. we were discussing it there extensively a couple of days ago ;)
<Ford_> cul8er
Ford_ (~weopq@62.180.228.2) left irc: "Doh!"
<jamest> so does that mean that libpng.so.2 is not availabe
<the_grunf> humm...looks good...but i've just finished lunch now
<jamest> and it can't be installed
<jamest> ?
<drochaid> gimmie a mo and I'll check if it's in the default lists
<the_grunf> james: well yes i've libpng.so.3
<jamest> odd
<the_grunf> you bet
<jamest> i'd have thought that wxGTK would have used it :(
<the_grunf> so, i've tried to compile and install wxGTK
Action: jamest would be tempted to ln -s libpng.so.3 libpng.so.2 :)
<jamest> and see what happens :)
<the_grunf> i tried that as well... :)
<the_grunf> but seems like configure is smarter than i
<jamest> ah
<jamest> does mandrake use rpms?
<drochaid> yep
<drochaid> and mdk is very weird at times
<the_grunf> as i was saying....i've compiled and installed wxGTK....no probs...but wxPython complains about the same libpng.so.2 and it doesn't even compile
<jamest> but it doesn't have rpms for wxPython
<jamest> :(
<jamest> chillywilly: release == real soon now
<the_grunf> yes it uses rpms, i've downloaded all the dependencies and i'm stuck in this prob
<jamest> hmmm
<the_grunf> drochaid: at times ? always, i think
<drochaid> heh
<drochaid> could be
<drochaid> I just rebuilt a server soley for use with postgresql, apache and php ...
<drochaid> and it didn't install or configure php!!
<the_grunf> php is working here...
<drochaid> I've got it working now, it's just their usual install screwups
<drochaid> I still can't believe they configure pgsql to only accept local connections by default
<drochaid> at least they use pg_ctl instead of postmaster now
<the_grunf> i'd like to be able to configure and install gnue to see if i can contribute to something...i've been working as a developer for some years now for a portuguese company that develops software for stock market
<the_grunf> and some guys in there are developing for psions and palms
<the_grunf> so maybe i could help...if i could install this thing...
<jamest> man
<jamest> i don't see where in wxPtyhon it references libpng :(
<jamest> my source is old though
<jamest> one thing you could try
<jamest> in setup.py change the CORE_ONLY = 1
<jamest> i have to do this on solaris to get wxpython to build
<the_grunf> some new data:  rpm -ihv wxPython-2.3.2.1-1mdk.i586.rpm 
<the_grunf> erro: dependências falhadas:
<the_grunf>  wxGTK = 2.3.2 é necessário pelo wxPython-2.3.2.1-1mdk

<the_grunf>  libwx_gtk_gl-2.3.so.1   é necessário pelo wxPython-2.3.2.1-1mdk
<the_grunf> that's the new problem....but i've just make & make install the wxGTK src dist
<jamest> doesn't rpm dependency checking only look for installed RPM packages
Action: jamest doesn't use a rpm based distro anymore
<the_grunf> dunno....does it ?
<jamest> IIRC you can tell rpm to ignore dependencies during install
<jamest> i think I used to have to do this when mixing source and rpm installs
<the_grunf> humm....let me see
jbailey (jbailey@CPE014260028338.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<the_grunf> it installed...i've never used --nodeps before cause i had a previous "not to good" experience with suse 6.2 and --nodeps rpm instalations

<the_grunf> Checking for available UI drivers....
<the_grunf>   Pyncurses(Currently not working).... No

<the_grunf> nope
<jamest> damn
<the_grunf> it says wxPython not available
<jamest> do you have a DISPLAY var set?
<the_grunf> grunf
<jamest> as the checking tries to open an connection to your xserver
<jamest> this burns me all the time on remote installs :)
<the_grunf> yup....i'm running X now...
<the_grunf> and my firewall accepts everything local
<jamest> grrrrrr
<the_grunf> (if it's going through tcp)
<jamest> that's frustrating
<jamest> um
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> not that I know if it'll help
<jamest> but in common/scripts/
<jamest> there is a gnue-diag.sh
<the_grunf> it is
<jamest> it was created to scan installs and find issues
<jamest> but it's fairly old
<jamest> not sure if it still works properly
<the_grunf> grunf....it says i have wxPython installed !!!!!
<the_grunf> but there's something not found:
<the_grunf>   /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/pygresql:  *NOT found*
<the_grunf>   /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/psycopg:  *NOT found*

<the_grunf>   /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/MySQLdb:  *NOT found*
<the_grunf> and something else....
<the_grunf> i have egenix-mx-base-2.0.3-py2.1_1 installed, but it says "mxDateTime:  **Not Installed**"
<jamest> :(
<the_grunf> so why is this gnue-diag saying i have wxPython installed and setup.py doesn't...
<jamest> i just did some searching on groups.google.com
<jamest> it seems that libpng2 and libpng3 are seperate packages and wxPython is linked to one or the other depending upon release
<jamest> are there seperate libpng rpms avail?
<jamest> the gnue-diag looks to see if the file exists via a shell command
<the_grunf> lots of them
<jamest> the setup.py  actually trys to import it
<the_grunf> i've been on rpmfind.net, searched for libpng, and there are lots of them...
<the_grunf> what's the version u have on ur system ?
<jamest> ii  libpng2        1.0.12-3       PNG library - runtime
<jamest> ii  libpng2-dev    1.0.12-3       PNG library - development
<jamest> ii  libpng3        1.2.1-1.1      PNG library - runtime
<jamest> I'm running debian
<jamest> also try this
<jamest> open python
<jamest> then try this command
<jamest> from wxPython.wx import *
<jamest> this way you can see the error wx is hitting

<jamest> is your wxGTK in /usr/local/lib
<jamest> if so you might need to rerun ldconfig to have it pick it up
<dneighbo> first its bad to mix and match
<dneighbo> either compile everything or compile nothing
<dneighbo> imho
<the_grunf> i already done that....so now i'm uninstalling everything and try to find that libpng.so.2 to install everything again from scratch
<dneighbo> you going to use rpms or source
Action: dneighbo has installed both ways and gotten it to work
<dneighbo> source install is suprisingly easy
<dneighbo> though i would almost bet that all the dependencies are actually on your mandrake disks
<dneighbo> in rpm format
<dneighbo> if you have even a relatively new mandrake distribution
<jamest> he's running 8.2
<dneighbo> i would say probably everything you need is on your disks then
<the_grunf> well at least wxPython is now installing without complain about anything
ra3vat (ds@ics.elcom.ru) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<the_grunf> grunf...still not working...
<dneighbo> what isnt working
<the_grunf> setup.py says i've got no wxPython, but i've got a clue
<dneighbo> hold up
<dneighbo> i think this is probably a python problem
<dneighbo> you have python 1.5.2 still on this machine?
<dneighbo> if so when you installed wxPython it probably installed for python 1.5.2
<dneighbo> and now the operation you are performing is probably looking for it in python 2.x
<dneighbo> and so rightfully its saying it does not exist
<the_grunf> i think so....because i've dowloaded and installed wxPython for Python 2.1
<the_grunf> or something alike....
<the_grunf> what version should i download for python 2.2 ?
<the_grunf> if i go to wxpython.org...there's some problem that the files come with 8Kb and rpm cannot install them
<dneighbo> what version of python do you have?
<dneighbo> type python
<dneighbo> and paste for me the top of the out put
<the_grunf> 2.2
<the_grunf> Python 2.2 (#1, Feb 24 2002, 16:21:58)

<the_grunf> Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
<dneighbo> ah yes you definitely need wxPython2.2
<dneighbo> give me a second
<chillywilly> python --version works too
<chillywilly> or possibly python -V
<the_grunf> yep, but where can i find it ? rpmfind shows me a lot of versions...wich one should i download
<chillywilly> oops, only -V works
<dneighbo> http://www.rpmfind.net//linux/RPM/cooker/contrib/RPMS/wxPython-2.3.2.1-1mdk.i586.html
<dneighbo> that is the package you need the_grunf

<dneighbo> mxDateTime dependency lets fix that for you :)
<dneighbo> jamest: should i file bug that setup-cvs.py didnt catch that?
<jamest> um
<jamest> just a sec
<jamest> i'll look at it now
<the_grunf> humm....but the rpm i found on gnuenterprise.org is for python 2.1
<jamest> um
<the_grunf> there can i find for python 2.2 ?
<jamest> setup-cvs.py doesn't seem to do dependency checking
<jamest> at least not for things like wxWindows or mxDateTime
<jamest> i understand the wxWindows not being there but I hit jcater up about mxDateTime when he shows up
<dneighbo> http://www.egenix.com/files/python/eGenix-mx-Extensions.html#Download-mxBASE
<dneighbo> #  egenix-mx-base-2.0.3-py2.2_1.i386.rpm (Binary RPM, i386, Python 2.2) 
<dneighbo> is the file you want
<dneighbo> jamest: piss if its not checking for wx that will probably fail still :(
<dneighbo> we will see
<dneighbo> jamest: you gnue'ing or just lurking today?
<jamest> gnue'n at the moment
<jamest> i have till approx noon i think

<dneighbo> can you look at primary key incrementing for me?
<dneighbo> i catn for the life of me get it to work
<dneighbo> and its critical to all the stuff im doing going forward :(
<dneighbo> i even tried building a form from the wizard
<jamest> let me get the config stuff up at least to level of old stuff
<dneighbo> that had it
<jamest> i'm about there
<dneighbo> and just adding the single line and no dice
<dneighbo> ok i have to do some bills and get the_grunf working :)
<dneighbo> then i will look at making you sample
<dneighbo> the_grunf: how is it going?
<jcater> morning all
<jamest> welcome jcater
<dneighbo> jcater: mxDateTime isnt being checked in setup-cvs.py
<dneighbo> and hello :)
<jcater> setup-cvs.py doesn't do any checking
Action: dneighbo will go create ticket
<jcater> er?
Action: dneighbo stops from creating ticket as it sounds like jcater wants that to be the case
<jcater> well, hadn't considered it before
<dneighbo> it probably is a good idea to do it
<jamest> only if it's something all gnue apps depend upon
<the_grunf> dneighbo: it says something about locale translation...do u want me to paste it here ?
<jamest> like the python check
<jamest> as reports doesn't need wx to live
<jamest> but the db driver system dies w/o mxdatetime
<jamest> i almost think this should be part of the installer
<jamest> and the developer setup shouldn't need it
<jamest> course
<jamest> that implies we need to release 
<dneighbo> yes paste here
<jamest> so that people aren't forced to cvs
<jamest> :)
<dneighbo> i think the developer setup should have it all
<dneighbo> as it INSTALLS all packages
<dneighbo> btw: i speak from gnucash disdain
<dneighbo> i wanted to compile it so that i could add a feature and spent a month doing so
<dneighbo> it would have been nice at compile time to get a list of all things it couldnt 'find'
<dneighbo> i do agree about release so that we dont have people using cvs install
<the_grunf> Unable to load locale information falling back to default English language translations.
<jamest> the_grunf: that's fine
<the_grunf> and nothing else
<dneighbo> that should be ok
<jamest> basically you haven't set an localization 
<dneighbo> when you ran ~/bin/gfcvs intro.gfd
<jamest> or our system doesn't know your localization
<dneighbo> that is all you get?
<the_grunf> yup
<jamest> that is very much a work in progress
<dneighbo> you dont get a window pop up?
<the_grunf> nope
<dneighbo> you dont get any other error messages?
<dneighbo> do
<the_grunf> nope

<dneighbo> ok
<jamest> sigh
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> so we still have wx problem
<dneighbo> the_grunf: you opposed to doing wxGTK and wxPython from source?
<jamest> psu: hows the web stuff comming?
<the_grunf> i've tried it, but wxPython could compile, so finally i installed everything from scratch (even that libpng.so.2)
<psu> jamest: not too bad. This weekend is the big push to get it "finished" ie. ready for review
<the_grunf> and now..i'm stuck into this
<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> i hate rpm (its the tool of satan)
<the_grunf> :)
<dneighbo> God only knows what it has done
<the_grunf> more or less like windows installer hum ?
<the_grunf> :)
Action: jcater is working on such
<dneighbo> we really need to retrace all your steps
<dneighbo> and systematically uninstall all you have done relating to wx*
<dneighbo> so we have clean slate
<dneighbo> as best i can tell it looks like its installed just not quite correctly
<dneighbo> i.e. its out there under python2.2
<dneighbo> did you ever install wxwindows?
Action: dneighbo would think that hte wxPython rpm would bitch if you didnt
<dneighbo> or the wxGTK
<dneighbo> then again maybe its only when you compile from source you need both (its been a while)
<the_grunf> i installed wxGTK, but not wxWindows
<dneighbo> i think if you install via rpm you dont have to get wxWindows separately
<dneighbo> only if doing source install
<dneighbo> to hose things up
<the_grunf> let me try everything again
<dneighbo> can i get you to uninstall the rpm for wxPython
<dneighbo> and try this one instead
<dneighbo> http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython-2.3.2.1-Py22.exe
<the_grunf> .exe ????
<dneighbo> grr sorry

<the_grunf> can u believe this shit ???????????????
<the_grunf> oops ...sorry for my language
<the_grunf> wxPython-2.3.2.1-1mdk.i586.rpm ---> doen't work
<the_grunf> wxPython-2.3.2.1-1-Py22.i386.rpm ---> works
<the_grunf> so i've got that window
<dneighbo> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> cool
<dneighbo> so you do
<dneighbo> ~/bin/gfcvs intro.gfd
<dneighbo> and you get a form?
<the_grunf> yup
<dneighbo> btw: when people say rpm is as good as apt
<the_grunf> and setup.py (in forms dir) runs without errors
<dneighbo> my response isnt rpm is a bad packaging system
<dneighbo> its that Debian is MUCH better about QUALITY of its packaging :)
<the_grunf> sometimes it's good...
<the_grunf> sometimes not
<the_grunf> if it works it's good
<dneighbo> i have come to fear rpm packaging unless its directly from the distribution :(
<dneighbo> the_grunf: its not rpm that is bad, its the fact that the package maintainers have no cohesiveness 
<the_grunf> so, now tell me...
<dneighbo> as evidenced by what we saw here today :)
<the_grunf> is gnue only programmed in python/php ?
<dneighbo> only python at this point
<dneighbo> it was python/C
<dneighbo> but the part in C is being refactored in python
<the_grunf> i have some knowledge about php, but i'm still learning python
<dneighbo> dcl (a component) of gnue is in php but its migrating to python over time
<dneighbo> bayonne (another component) is in C++ but can be 'programmed' in python
<dneighbo> if you can do php
<dneighbo> you can do python
<the_grunf> so, where can i help ? 
<dneighbo> i PROMISE
<the_grunf> i bought a book about python, and it seems interesting to me
<the_grunf> is there anyone translating the project to portuguese (that might be a start point, while i learn some usefull python)
Action: dneighbo will be conceited here and say gnue is a darn good project to LEARN python on
<dneighbo> as there are lots of examples of things in the code
<the_grunf> do u recomend any book about python 
<dneighbo> um if you know another language (which you seem to)
<the_grunf> i have o'reilly's programming python
<jamest> the_grunf: that is not a good book :(
<the_grunf> i now use mostly c++ and vb (on windows)
Action: jamest has it too
<dneighbo> i suggest david m beazley's 'Python: essential reference'
<the_grunf> that's the one i found...any way i didn't (and don't) know anything about python...
dres (~dres@mail.lewismoss.org) joined #gnuenterprise.
<the_grunf> let me see
dres (~dres@mail.lewismoss.org) left irc: Client Quit
<dneighbo> the first few chapters explain how to do things in python (tutorial, lexical conventions, syntax, objects, operaters, expressions, control flow)
<dneighbo> basically its no fluff
<dneighbo> its straight up how do i do X
<the_grunf> why i wonder why i can't ever find any book's isbn on amazon.com
<dneighbo> which if you know another language is all you need :)
<dneighbo> um if you got an ISBN then you might buy it elsewhere for cheaper
<the_grunf> that's the idea, my friend
<dneighbo> you dont want to buy from amazon anyhow :)
<the_grunf> i never buy anything on the net....not by cc
<dneighbo> 0735710910
<dneighbo> is the ISBN number
<the_grunf> i have a library here in portugal (bertrand.pt) where i can order them the books from the net and get them at home

<drochaid> good afternoon/evening
<the_grunf> dneighbo: before learning something usefull in python....is there any help needed somewhere else (c/c++, sql, docs, translation...) ?
<dneighbo> we need help everywhere :")
<dneighbo> the place we need help right now the most is people writing applications 
<drochaid> I know a *really* good psychologist dneighbo :)
<dneighbo> they deal in goat fetishes
<dneighbo> who was it that had the pantera?
<drochaid> no no no, she HAS a goat fetish ... not the same thing at all :)
<drochaid> I've got a couple of Pantera albums
<the_grunf> well learning python shouldn't be so dificult (at least as i saw)

<jamest> i have pantera

<the_grunf> jamest: is there any chance of finding libuuid without being on .deb format ?
<the_grunf> or installing a .deb package in mandrake ?
<dneighbo> yes
<dneighbo> but you dont need it
<dneighbo> i assuem you are looking at geas?
<the_grunf> yup
<the_grunf> you're right
<dneighbo> which is being refactored and is in the appserver directory
<dneighbo> therefore its obsolete
<the_grunf> ahh, ok
<dneighbo> and the new version will not need libuuid 
<dneighbo> fwiw: you can get libuuid in i think the efs2prog packages

<drochaid> sounds like some sort of inbreeding
<psu> it's a cousin to a kernel ;-)
Action: drochaid glares at psu
<psu> The original mailing list summary was for the Linux kernel mailing list
<psu> summary was known as "Kernel Traffic"
<psu> the other summaries for other projects, such as GNUe, 
<psu> as cousins to the main KT summary
<psu> hence "Kernel Cousins"
<psu> It's a slightly odd nomeculture
<drochaid> ahhhh
<drochaid> thanks psu
<psu> and will be changed eventually
<drochaid> I'll stop glaring now
<psu> so that GNUe KC will become "GNUe Traffic"
<psu> but there are other priorities at the moment
<drochaid> that might be a bad idea ..
<psu> (including finshing the switch from perl to xslt to render the issues
<drochaid> with the amount chillywilly hits that crack pipe, "traffic" might be taken the wrong way ;)

<drochaid> how old is he?
<chillywilly> I had all the action figures
<chillywilly> 4
<drochaid> when was star wars released initially?
<chillywilly> 1970 somethin'
<drochaid> 1980
<chillywilly> are you sure?
<chillywilly> I thought it was in the 70s
<drochaid> http://us.imdb.com/Title?0080684
<drochaid> so did I until I checked
<drochaid> I couldn't see it when I was 4 .. I feel deprived now :(
<chillywilly> well I saw the first one on cable
<chillywilly> with my grandfather
<chillywilly> couple years after
<drochaid> balls ... that's the wrong one it linked me to
<chillywilly> the next 2 I saw in the theatre
<drochaid> 1977
<drochaid>  that sounds more likely
<chillywilly> yea, that's when I was born ;)
<drochaid> hmm ... I could have watched it when I was 2
<chillywilly> what the dates on the other movies?
<drochaid> episode V was 1980
<chillywilly> I am curious as to how long it took to make another one
<chillywilly> yea
<drochaid> and VI was 1983
<drochaid> so every 3 years
<drochaid> pretty much what they're doing now
<drochaid> but the graphics were better back then ;)
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> all I know is I had a lot of Star Wars figures
<drochaid> I had none
<chillywilly> one time I lost Luke Skywalker in the park
<chillywilly> and this kid down the blovk found it
<chillywilly> but he wouldn't give it back

<drochaid> oh well then .. you should definately gain ops here as well :)
<drochaid> but I think I would have to challenge your postion for adding nothing to the project or chan ... I'm fairly confident I can beat by a wide margin on that point
<ajmitch> hah
<ajmitch> i've been contributing nothing for far longer than you have
<drochaid> but the quality [or lack thereof] of my nothing is of a far greater magnitude than the pathetic nothing that you muster
<ajmitch> oh indeed. i must concede defeat then
<drochaid> there you go then
<ajmitch> for you've entertained the channel with your language & phrases thereof
<drochaid> now I KNOW you are fully aware of what you can kiss on behalf of that comment
<drochaid> what do you have to do to get kicked from this chan? ;)
<ajmitch> i don't knoe
<drochaid> personally I think GNUe should be ported from python to MS Access
Action: drochaid waits ...
<ajmitch> would be fun editing that VBA
<drochaid> now, I would have expected an auto-kick for that one
<ajmitch> jcater would love it for sure!
<drochaid> heh
<drochaid> I'm bored ... can we discuss photography?
<ajmitch> nope
<drochaid> :(
<ajmitch> how about we gang up on chillywilly?

<chillywilly> he's always talking to me
<chillywilly> he just never shuts up
<drochaid> yes, with drochaid ... and his claymore >:)
<ajmitch> doesn't talk to me :'(
Action: chillywilly stuff drochaid's claymore up his bum
<drochaid> let the claymore talk to you ajmitch
<drochaid> bring your ear closer a little ...
<ajmitch> chillywilly: you know how much that would hurt?
<drochaid> chillywilly: all of it or just a little?
<drochaid> since I'm 6ft and it's bigger than me [the claymore, I'm not bragging :) ]
Action: fitzix chops drochaid's hand off with his axe in a surprise move - drochaid's claymore falls into a cyberabyss
<chillywilly> all the way, to the hilt
<fitzix> heheh
<chillywilly> do not pass go
<ajmitch> drochaid: you have one with you then?
<chillywilly> do not collect $100
<drochaid> all the way to the hilt? feckle ... that means there's about 4 feet sticking out my head then
<chillywilly> thanks for the mental image
<chillywilly> I appreciate it
<fitzix> A CD archive of ftp.gnu.org in one hand, a claymore in the other
<drochaid> no problem :)
<fitzix> that'll stop proprietary!
Action: ajmitch guesses drochaid is using windows right now? :)
<ajmitch> fitzix: read the relevant parts of the KC?
Action: chillywilly reads it
<drochaid> windows, and deb linux, and mandrake linux, and beos and ipcop firewall
<fitzix> ajmitch: I'm still reading - damn you people are busy :)
<ajmitch> yeah
<drochaid> fitzix: but proprietory software is the best thing you can get :)
Action: drochaid is still trying to get /kick'ed
<ajmitch> drochaid: not enough ops
<drochaid> :(
<drochaid> someone paste my comments when ops turn up please
<fitzix> hehe
<drochaid> just tell me if I got kicked when I return ;)
<ajmitch> fitzix: so what have you been up to?
<fitzix> the crux of the entire KC discussion: Andrew said "i just wanted to
<fitzix> keep these nice people in mind :)" Daniel agreed.
<chillywilly> :P
<ajmitch> haha

Action: drochaid checks
<drochaid> well, it almost shows my full name
<drochaid> in fact ... if you take ajmitchs first name, ignore the middle and use the first letter of his surname ....
<drochaid> you get the same as ignoring my first, taking my middle and the first letter of my surname
<ajmitch> ah crap sawfish died & screwed up
<drochaid> use windows dood :)
<chillywilly> yea dn if you take my first name reverse it then rot13 encode it combine it with ajmitch's mother's sister's maiden name....uuh wtf was I talking about?

<dneighbo> jbailey: where do we sit on dcl debians?
<dneighbo> can we check into cvs what you have to date?
<jbailey> dneighbo: It's not designed to be used upstream.  Did you want that?  I had developped it as a wrapper so that it knows what to do with an upstream tarball.
<jbailey> That allows me to refer back to /etc for system config stuff.
<dneighbo> im not sure i understand all that :)
<dneighbo> jbailey: you are close to debian
<dneighbo> is there hope of ever having openoffice debs?

<reinhard> psu: just to be curious - is 9/6/73 your birthday?
<psu> nope - why?
Action: psu wonders which of his p/w reinhard has cracked ;-)
<reinhard> i was trying to figure out why you selected port 9673 for the new website :)
<reinhard> which doesn't work for me btw
<psu> blame one of the j*s - they did the set up
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> works in msie doesn't work in mozilla
<psu> um
<psu> that's bad
<psu> hopefully it's just the port # that's a problem
<psu> as a free s/w project with a site that doesn't work with mozilla would be 
<psu> well, not exactly self-contradictory
<psu> but on the verge ;-)
<reinhard> i am 100% positive it's the port#
<reinhard> my 2 cents (of course euro-cents) to the new site:
<reinhard> imho we need a site that is maintained _in_the_long_run_ and whoever will maintain it over the next months will have the right to choose php vs zope vs static
<reinhard> especially the documentation pages and the "current status" pages need maintainance
<psu> i agree
<reinhard> "Verbatim copying and distribution ... under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License" is a contradiction IMHO
<reinhard> as the GNU FDL says basically you may change the text how you see fit
<reinhard> and verbatim as i understands says you may not change
<psu> IANAL - my fault for cut & pasting the phpnuke bolierplate with GPL.
<psu> Also, I believe FSF house style is not to acknowldge trade marks
<psu> as there's no legal requirement to do so (provided you are careful)
<reinhard> hmmm.. FSF house style is not to _use_ trade marks :)
<psu> well, not trade marks for non-free s/w
<psu> I would guess "Linux is a trade mark of Linus Torvolds" is OK
<psu> This is one of my concerns about mirroring some of this stuff to the 
<psu> www.gnu.org site
<psu> as we may have to fillet some of the news items 
<reinhard> wrt design i like it
<reinhard> the "tabs" at the top of the page could be left away
<psu> i'm not that committed to them, but they do give you a feel for where you are in the site
<psu> plus I crashed zope debugging them ;-)
<reinhard> ahh the active one is always yellow - didn't get that... i guess it's ok then :)
<psu> The "What is GNUe?" is accesible from anywhere for people who come in via search engines
<reinhard> yeah that's a very good idea
<reinhard> i thought about (just as a small gag) the text in the top right corner
<reinhard> we could provide some 5 or 10 lines
<reinhard> and they get exchanged randomly
<psu> i'm sure that's do-able
<reinhard> nevermind just a spontaneous idea
<psu> i just need to think of 5-10 tag lines to rotate ;-)
<psu> that don't look too unprofessional ;-)
<psu> Raiding the "headquotes" from GNUe KC is tempting 
<psu> but probably not wise ;-)

<chillywilly> I don't think GEAS is totally defined...I see nowhere where a object-relational mapping is specified (yet) ;)
<siesel> cw: it would be great to have a definition soon.. I would like to test how  common/dbdrivers and appserver can be connected.

esands (~nic@mdr1-port1.jetstart.win.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<esands> Is there a quick 'howto' for building all the binaries within an alt-root. ie /home/foo/src/gnue/ rather than /usr/local/
<esands> from cvs
<siesel> n8t
siesel (jan@dial-213-168-95-209.netcologne.de) left irc: "KVIrc 2.1.2-pre2 'Monolith'"
<chillywilly> esands: check out cvs and run setup-cvs.py
<chillywilly> it will install things in /home/username/ for you
<chillywilly> This setup script can install GNUe as either a local (per user)
<chillywilly> copy or a system-wide copy.  If you are unsure, choose the
<chillywilly> recommended 'Local' setting.  Installing system-wide will require
<chillywilly> the root password and may force all users on this machine to use
<chillywilly> your copy.
<chillywilly> Perform a [L]ocal/per-user or a [S]ystem-wide install? [L] 
<chillywilly>  
<chillywilly> Where shall I put executable files? [/home/danielb/bin] 
<chillywilly> ...
<esands> That builds symlinks. I assume I then just have to make build in the appropiate cvs sub directories?
<esands> er, ignore that. It forget its python, so it doesn't really need to compile anything. 8)
<chillywilly> it doe sbuild then to .pyc files
<chillywilly> it sets it all up for you
<chillywilly> from cvs
<chillywilly> s/then/them
<esands> Ok.  Now just a matter of figuring out the db setup and trying some of the samples. Thanks.
<chillywilly> your welcome
<chillywilly> btw, I think there's going to be a new release soon ;)
<esands> In what sense?  Isn't every cvs commit a new release? ;)
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> in the sense that there should be better and more upt to date documentation ;)
<chillywilly> and it will be an officially supported version ;)
<chillywilly> not that you can't get support here though :)
<esands> documentation.  Now that is certainly worthy of a release. I was trying to figure if some of the stuff at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/ was really "Updated: 14 Jul 00"
<chillywilly> yea, supposedly the Forms API will be in the new technical reference ;)
<chillywilly> instead of having to grok it form examples, etc.
<esands> I think the best thing someone could do would be to produce a nice article/howto for one of the linux site going into the step-by-step mechanics of setting up a first stage gnue installation. (ie. for doing form development work.)
<chillywilly> er, update techref I should say
<chillywilly> 1. setup database
<chillywilly> 2. use designer
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> 3. make some forms
<chillywilly> 4. write some triggers
<esands> Yes, now add 1000 words. ;)
<chillywilly> :P
<chillywilly> 5. deploy
<esands> Is there a man describing the *.conf files?  
<chillywilly> uh, no
<chillywilly> I dunno I am not a forms guru....I am trying to be soem kinda GEAS architect ;)
<esands> Yeah, I've got a few things (eg. FX management system) in spreadsheets that I want to try make into a form
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> I have a project that I have been meaning to convert so as to learn the rest of the tools
<chillywilly> but geas and othe things keep me busy
<chillywilly> other
<esands> Another thing you guys should setup is a CPAN like place where outside developers can contrib applications so others can see what can be done
<chillywilly> yea
<esands> heh, "better keep writing the core code" the end-user developer says. ;)
<chillywilly> I am not too familiar with CPAN but we plan to have an arhcive of packages built with the tools
<chillywilly> and our core packages
<esands> CPAN stregth is i. its search/archive mechanism, ii. its easy of install using the Makefile.PL system
<esands> Query about connections.conf then (if there is no documentation)
<esands> It basically defines 'connection labels' which are then hard coded into the form.gfd files?
<drochaid> wheee ... #photo had a visitor ... for 6 seconds
<esands> Using the :datasource" tag
<esands> s/:/"/
siesel (jan@dial-213-168-64-111.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> yea, connections.conf defines the DSNs for you
<chillywilly> you can then just use the DSN in your form
<chillywilly> instead of having all these tags like database, etc.
<chillywilly> Data Source Name
<chillywilly> afaict anyway ;)
<esands> of course
<chillywilly> wb jan
<siesel> wb ?
<chillywilly> welcome back
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: siesel is a bit too slow tonight...
<chillywilly> it's ok
<chillywilly> so jan have you looked at the start of my geas architecture document?
<siesel> where is it?
<chillywilly> and also one thing I was wonder wrt to GNURPC is why no one looked at WSDL
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> gune/docbook/Proposals/geasarch/
<esands> How is the database access control stuff specified? ie. user:passwd?
<chillywilly> yea, that is deferred to the database
<chillywilly> however, there's a script somwhere that jcater wrote that sets up and SSH tunnel
<esands> Deferred to the db?  What happens if the db client (form in this case) needs a passwd to access the datasource?  Where is that specified? 
<chillywilly> the client uses a login box to allow you to authenticate to the db
<chillywilly> er, datasource even'
<chillywilly> iirc
<siesel> cw: especially the docbook file is very informative ;)
<chillywilly> outline.txt
<chillywilly> that's where all the goods are right now
<chillywilly> also, gnue/geas/doc/odmg.txt is helpful
Action: siesel is dreaming of a cool docbook editor
<chillywilly> emacs?
<chillywilly> ;)
<drochaid> vi?
<siesel> I've read odmg.txt, but its some time ago. outline.txt is informative, except of the overview at the beginning, it is mostly about odmg and how to describe objects, or how to map  ODL into python objects.
<siesel> I think two other things are also very important at the moment:
<siesel> a) object-relational mapping (you said it)
<siesel> b) more concret definition of the way to access objects
<chillywilly> well the client API is defined in ODMG, imho
<esands> You guys seen http://www.twistedmatrix.com/products/spread? python rpc mechanism
<chillywilly> it just needs to be worked out
<chillywilly> interesting
<siesel> thats the step i'am waiting for
<chillywilly> well I am trying my best ;)
<chillywilly> siesel: did you see ym diagram?
<chillywilly> for the schema compiler
<chillywilly> s/ym/my
<chillywilly> I know it needs more explanation
<chillywilly> s/more//
<chillywilly> I spoke with reinhard about it before
<siesel> which one?
<chillywilly> geas-schema-compiler.dia
<siesel> what are the metaobjects?
<chillywilly> aaaah
<chillywilly> introspection
<chillywilly> objects about obakects
<chillywilly> so you can change the schema on the fly
<chillywilly> object about objects I mean
<chillywilly> the meta object api could be used by designer to create new business objects
<siesel> ok, now i think i got it.
<chillywilly> then form those odl files can be generated and python code stubs can be generated
<siesel> thats cool
<chillywilly> you can go the various ways
<esands> What is the right provider in connections.conf for postgres? 
<siesel> pypgsql?
<chillywilly> we have a number of postgres db drivers
<siesel> popy?
<chillywilly> take your pick
<siesel> be careful popy doesn't support introspection 
<esands> The default one 'psycopg' doesn't seem to work with debians 'python2.1-pgsql
<chillywilly> siesel, and I like how they generate modules/packages in the IDL binding...so it is like geas is adding all the objects on the fly
<siesel> no 'python2.1-pgsql and pypgsql go together
<chillywilly> there's good stuff there man
<chillywilly> I really like ODMG's stuff
<chillywilly> anyway, I must eat dinner
<chillywilly> bye
<chillywilly> bbiab
<siesel> GEAS V2 will be great
<siesel> cu
Action: chillywilly is away: dinner
<esands> siesel: thanks.

<dsmith> HEy chillywilly
<chillywilly> how's it going?
<dsmith> Rough
<chillywilly> why?
<dsmith> All the work I'm doing in Michigan is a pain.  Being away from family and home is harsh.
<dsmith> My cluster is ready to install.  All the rules have been tested.  Once it's in.  I'm done!
<dsmith> THis a  firewall at Comerica Bank.
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> pays well? ;)
<chillywilly> you using *BSD to firewall with?
<dsmith> Better than nothing.
<dsmith> No, it's fw-1 on Solaris.
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> do you have acompany name?
<chillywilly> a company
<chillywilly> just out of curiousity
<dsmith> I work for Altus Technologies Corporation www.altustech.com
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> I thought you were a rogue warrior ;)
<dsmith> heh
<chillywilly> "open systems"
<dsmith> Well, it just two of us.
<chillywilly> really?
<dsmith> "open systems" is ibm speak for unix
<chillywilly> are you affiliated with IBM or just a vendor?
<dsmith> Buisness Partner.
<chillywilly> hmmm
<dsmith> We sell rs6000's
<dsmith> and do tsm (tivoli storage manager) (my main gig)
<chillywilly> I would like to request that you call Linux, GNU/Linux on your servuces page unless you are specifically talking about the kernel ;)
<chillywilly> ;P
<dsmith> I'll talk to the "web developer"
<dsmith> We use Debian pretty much exclusivle.
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> there's no better distro ;)
<dsmith> Yep.
<chillywilly> man how much does it cost to even get on of those rs6000?
<chillywilly> s/on/one
<dsmith> They ar not called rs six THOUSAND's for nothing.
<chillywilly> eeek, you got M$ on your bidness partner's list ;)
<chillywilly> lol
<dsmith> Ya. It's embarrasing.
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> how long are you going to be in Michigan?
<chillywilly> how long have you been there?
<chillywilly> Banks don't want to go the GNU/Linux route?
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> let me know if I am annoying you ;)
<dsmith> Hmm.  I've been there since around feb-march.  My cluster was supposed to go in yesterday.  It's been pushed back to the 18th.
<dsmith> They have standaized on Sun and Solaris.
<chillywilly> "cluster" means what exactly? a server farm of sorts?
<dsmith> At least it a unix.  It's better that any junk that comes from m$.
<chillywilly> yea
<dsmith> Well, my cluster is two sun boxes that have load balancing using something called Stonebeat.
<chillywilly> is tsm like the Linux Volume Manager or RAID?
<chillywilly> ok
<dsmith> TSM is a HUGE backup system.
<chillywilly> I see
<chillywilly> HUUUUUGGGEEEE
<chillywilly> ;)
<dsmith> It's got an enbedded db2 database in it.
<chillywilly> you ever hear of OLAP?
<chillywilly> they use that where da masta werks
<chillywilly> apparently
<chillywilly> to store a shit load of data
<dsmith> Ive seen the acronym, but I'm not familiar with it.
<dsmith> On Line Applications Processing?
Action: chillywilly tries to remember what ti stands for now...;P
<chillywilly> no, I don't think that is it
<chillywilly> it's like an n-dimensional matrix of storage
<dsmith> Overly Large Administivia Procedures
<chillywilly> you were close on the first one
<chillywilly> n-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a category of software technology that enables analysts, managers and executives to gain insight into data through fast, consistent, interactive access to a wide variety of possible views of information that has been transformed from raw data to reflect the real dimensionality of the enterprise as understood by the user. 
<chillywilly> On-Line
<chillywilly> OLAP functionality is characterized by dynamic multi-dimensional analysis of consolidated enterprise data supporting end user analytical and navigational activities including: 
<dsmith> For fun I wrote gkrellmoon and mod-guile.
<chillywilly> http://www.moulton.com/olap/olap.glossary.html
<dsmith> gkrellmoon is a moon clock for gkrellm
<chillywilly> ok
<dsmith> http://gkrellmoon.sourceforge.net/
<dsmith> mod-guile isn't released yet.  It's so you can write apache code in scheme.  Like mod-perl or mod-python.
<chillywilly> I see
<chillywilly> I am not a functional language guy (yet)
<dneighbo> btw: someone said soemthing about pyscopg not working with debian
<dneighbo> i use it religiously on debian with gnue
<dneighbo> so im curious as to the problem
<dsmith> Hmm.  It certainly was working for me.
<chillywilly> was that esands?

<chillywilly> bah, too much stuff
Action: chillywilly grep slogs
<chillywilly> May 05 18:25:50 <esands> The default one 'psycopg' doesn't seem to work with debians 'python2.1-pgsql

<No9> hello all
<chillywilly> hi dtm
<chillywilly> ello No9
<No9> one quick questions... cant seems to find it in docs or site.... what language is GNUE based on? and can I use MySQL?
<ajmitch> greetings
<ajmitch> mainly python, and you can use MySQL
<No9> heard of any ERP based on PHP?
<chillywilly> although I have no idea why you would use such a thing ;)
<No9> hee hee
<chillywilly> er, that goes for mysql and PHP ERP ;)
<No9> sorry folks... never touch python before... why that?
Action: rdean thinks it's because of the origin of the name :-)
<rdean> ni!
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> cause Python rocks our socks
<No9> and does anyone have anything to say about Compiere, www.compiere.org
<ajmitch> proprietary dependencies?
<rdean> seriously, though, although I've never delved into python before, it has a reputation for being a rich OO language
<No9> ok guys.. i will go red up on Python now... to me it might as well be cobol... excuse my ignorance. :) 
<rdean> syntax is a lot more elegant than others
<ajmitch> haven't heard many good things about Compiere :)
<chillywilly> I have heard some peope talking crap about it in here before ;)
<chillywilly> only because it has nasty dependencies or something
<ajmitch> Oracle
<No9> No9 at www.python.org now....
<chillywilly> ajmitch: ugh
<chillywilly> we support Oracle
<chillywilly> but we also support a LOT more ;)
<ajmitch> i know, but we don't depend on Oracle
<chillywilly> no we don't
<chillywilly> good point :)
<No9> I think they are working on other RDBMS support as well...
<chillywilly> well we already have tons of db drivers in our abstraction layer
<rdean> just went to compiere.org...they're working on pgsql support
<ajmitch> compiere also requires jdk 1.4 from sun :)
<ajmitch> not sure about licensing
Action: rdean would wait for jdk 1.4 from IBM....their JDKs run circles around Suns :-)
<No9> anyone here in singapore?
<ajmitch> close, i'm in NZ ;)
Action: rdean hrm...they're using JBuilder to write compiere.
<No9> NZ huh? i heard so much about the place... NICE !
<ajmitch> interesting
<No9> i came from Perth.
<No9> working in singapore...
<ajmitch> ok cool
<ajmitch> compiere is under MPL, i think
<chillywilly> Java....ugh
<No9> I have a customer looking at cheap ERP solution... instead of reinventing the wheel... I and looking at using one of the web.
<ajmitch> ok
<chillywilly> or you can hack GNUe ;)
<ajmitch> chillywilly: java, oracle dependencies, and MPL, what more could you want?
<rdean> compiere is under compiere public license (been looking at it for the last few minutes)
<chillywilly> oh God no
<chillywilly> hmmm, so where does this license actually fall then?
<chillywilly> is it BSD-like?
<ajmitch> compiere public license is MPL with only a couple of modifications
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> yea, I am loving it already
<chillywilly> NOT
<ajmitch> Compiere, Inc can roll your changes into a proprietary product
<chillywilly> yipppeee
<No9> GNUE worries me as the site says the application server is not in production stage yet....
Action: ajmitch looks at GNU's license list for details of MPL
<ajmitch> chillywilly: quick! hack the appserver into production status! :)
<chillywilly> yes sir
<No9> hee hee
<rdean> my guess is that the oracle dependencies are probably incurred in SQL....although I haven't looked into the code to see
<ajmitch> chillywilly: http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/netscape-npl.html
<chillywilly> that's not MPL thgouh
<chillywilly> though
<chillywilly> M is Mozilla right?
<ajmitch> read the page
<rdean> yep...
<rdean> oracle specificity is derived from using Oracle extensions to SQL
<chillywilly> blech
<chillywilly> dude, isn't mozilla trying to GPL the code now?
<chillywilly> I thought there was an article where they were trying to track down a couple developers
<chillywilly> so they could make the change
<chillywilly> brb
<No9> has anyone used GNUE commercially?  i mean installed at their own customer site
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> some have
<No9> I realised that most potentials i have been meeting up with wants a Multi national company doing their ERP... do you guys get the same response?
