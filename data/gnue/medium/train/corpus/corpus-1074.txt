<psu> yep
<psu> we are undergoing a "restructure"

<reinhard> psu: just to be curious - is 9/6/73 your birthday?
<psu> nope - why?
Action: psu wonders which of his p/w reinhard has cracked ;-)
<reinhard> i was trying to figure out why you selected port 9673 for the new website :)
<reinhard> which doesn't work for me btw
<psu> blame one of the j*s - they did the set up
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> works in msie doesn't work in mozilla
<psu> um
<psu> that's bad
<psu> hopefully it's just the port # that's a problem
<psu> as a free s/w project with a site that doesn't work with mozilla would be 
<psu> well, not exactly self-contradictory
<psu> but on the verge ;-)
<reinhard> i am 100% positive it's the port#
<reinhard> my 2 cents (of course euro-cents) to the new site:
<reinhard> imho we need a site that is maintained _in_the_long_run_ and whoever will maintain it over the next months will have the right to choose php vs zope vs static
<reinhard> especially the documentation pages and the "current status" pages need maintainance
<psu> i agree
<reinhard> "Verbatim copying and distribution ... under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License" is a contradiction IMHO
<reinhard> as the GNU FDL says basically you may change the text how you see fit
<reinhard> and verbatim as i understands says you may not change
<psu> IANAL - my fault for cut & pasting the phpnuke bolierplate with GPL.
<psu> Also, I believe FSF house style is not to acknowldge trade marks
<psu> as there's no legal requirement to do so (provided you are careful)
<reinhard> hmmm.. FSF house style is not to _use_ trade marks :)
<psu> well, not trade marks for non-free s/w
<psu> I would guess "Linux is a trade mark of Linus Torvolds" is OK
<psu> This is one of my concerns about mirroring some of this stuff to the 
<psu> www.gnu.org site
<psu> as we may have to fillet some of the news items 
<reinhard> wrt design i like it
<reinhard> the "tabs" at the top of the page could be left away
<psu> i'm not that committed to them, but they do give you a feel for where you are in the site
<psu> plus I crashed zope debugging them ;-)
<reinhard> ahh the active one is always yellow - didn't get that... i guess it's ok then :)
<psu> The "What is GNUe?" is accesible from anywhere for people who come in via search engines
<reinhard> yeah that's a very good idea
<reinhard> i thought about (just as a small gag) the text in the top right corner
<reinhard> we could provide some 5 or 10 lines
<reinhard> and they get exchanged randomly
<psu> i'm sure that's do-able
<reinhard> nevermind just a spontaneous idea
<psu> i just need to think of 5-10 tag lines to rotate ;-)
<psu> that don't look too unprofessional ;-)
<psu> Raiding the "headquotes" from GNUe KC is tempting 
<psu> but probably not wise ;-)
<reinhard> bbl
Nick change: reinhard -> rm-away
<psu> <reinhard> jamest: i think a final gnue install could have some 100 tables

esands (~nic@mdr1-port1.jetstart.win.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<esands> Is there a quick 'howto' for building all the binaries within an alt-root. ie /home/foo/src/gnue/ rather than /usr/local/
<esands> from cvs
<siesel> n8t
siesel (jan@dial-213-168-95-209.netcologne.de) left irc: "KVIrc 2.1.2-pre2 'Monolith'"
<chillywilly> esands: check out cvs and run setup-cvs.py
<chillywilly> it will install things in /home/username/ for you
<chillywilly> This setup script can install GNUe as either a local (per user)
<chillywilly> copy or a system-wide copy.  If you are unsure, choose the
<chillywilly> recommended 'Local' setting.  Installing system-wide will require
<chillywilly> the root password and may force all users on this machine to use
<chillywilly> your copy.
<chillywilly> Perform a [L]ocal/per-user or a [S]ystem-wide install? [L] 
<chillywilly>  
<chillywilly> Where shall I put executable files? [/home/danielb/bin] 
<chillywilly> ...
<esands> That builds symlinks. I assume I then just have to make build in the appropiate cvs sub directories?
<esands> er, ignore that. It forget its python, so it doesn't really need to compile anything. 8)
<chillywilly> it doe sbuild then to .pyc files
<chillywilly> it sets it all up for you
<chillywilly> from cvs
<chillywilly> s/then/them
<esands> Ok.  Now just a matter of figuring out the db setup and trying some of the samples. Thanks.
<chillywilly> your welcome
<chillywilly> btw, I think there's going to be a new release soon ;)
<esands> In what sense?  Isn't every cvs commit a new release? ;)
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> in the sense that there should be better and more upt to date documentation ;)
<chillywilly> and it will be an officially supported version ;)
<chillywilly> not that you can't get support here though :)
<esands> documentation.  Now that is certainly worthy of a release. I was trying to figure if some of the stuff at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/ was really "Updated: 14 Jul 00"
<chillywilly> yea, supposedly the Forms API will be in the new technical reference ;)
<chillywilly> instead of having to grok it form examples, etc.
<esands> I think the best thing someone could do would be to produce a nice article/howto for one of the linux site going into the step-by-step mechanics of setting up a first stage gnue installation. (ie. for doing form development work.)
<chillywilly> er, update techref I should say
<chillywilly> 1. setup database
<chillywilly> 2. use designer
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> 3. make some forms
<chillywilly> 4. write some triggers
<esands> Yes, now add 1000 words. ;)
<chillywilly> :P
<chillywilly> 5. deploy
<esands> Is there a man describing the *.conf files?  
<chillywilly> uh, no
<chillywilly> I dunno I am not a forms guru....I am trying to be soem kinda GEAS architect ;)
<esands> Yeah, I've got a few things (eg. FX management system) in spreadsheets that I want to try make into a form
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> I have a project that I have been meaning to convert so as to learn the rest of the tools
<chillywilly> but geas and othe things keep me busy
<chillywilly> other
<esands> Another thing you guys should setup is a CPAN like place where outside developers can contrib applications so others can see what can be done
<chillywilly> yea
<esands> heh, "better keep writing the core code" the end-user developer says. ;)
<chillywilly> I am not too familiar with CPAN but we plan to have an arhcive of packages built with the tools
<chillywilly> and our core packages
<esands> CPAN stregth is i. its search/archive mechanism, ii. its easy of install using the Makefile.PL system
<esands> Query about connections.conf then (if there is no documentation)
<esands> It basically defines 'connection labels' which are then hard coded into the form.gfd files?
<drochaid> wheee ... #photo had a visitor ... for 6 seconds
<esands> Using the :datasource" tag
<esands> s/:/"/
siesel (jan@dial-213-168-64-111.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> yea, connections.conf defines the DSNs for you
<chillywilly> you can then just use the DSN in your form
<chillywilly> instead of having all these tags like database, etc.
<chillywilly> Data Source Name
<chillywilly> afaict anyway ;)
<esands> of course
<chillywilly> wb jan
<siesel> wb ?
<chillywilly> welcome back
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: siesel is a bit too slow tonight...
<chillywilly> it's ok
<chillywilly> so jan have you looked at the start of my geas architecture document?
<siesel> where is it?
<chillywilly> and also one thing I was wonder wrt to GNURPC is why no one looked at WSDL
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> gune/docbook/Proposals/geasarch/
<esands> How is the database access control stuff specified? ie. user:passwd?
<chillywilly> yea, that is deferred to the database
<chillywilly> however, there's a script somwhere that jcater wrote that sets up and SSH tunnel
<esands> Deferred to the db?  What happens if the db client (form in this case) needs a passwd to access the datasource?  Where is that specified? 
<chillywilly> the client uses a login box to allow you to authenticate to the db
<chillywilly> er, datasource even'
<chillywilly> iirc
<siesel> cw: especially the docbook file is very informative ;)
<chillywilly> outline.txt
<chillywilly> that's where all the goods are right now
<chillywilly> also, gnue/geas/doc/odmg.txt is helpful
Action: siesel is dreaming of a cool docbook editor
<chillywilly> emacs?
<chillywilly> ;)
<drochaid> vi?
<siesel> I've read odmg.txt, but its some time ago. outline.txt is informative, except of the overview at the beginning, it is mostly about odmg and how to describe objects, or how to map  ODL into python objects.
<siesel> I think two other things are also very important at the moment:
<siesel> a) object-relational mapping (you said it)
<siesel> b) more concret definition of the way to access objects
<chillywilly> well the client API is defined in ODMG, imho
<esands> You guys seen http://www.twistedmatrix.com/products/spread? python rpc mechanism
<chillywilly> it just needs to be worked out
<chillywilly> interesting
<siesel> thats the step i'am waiting for
<chillywilly> well I am trying my best ;)
<chillywilly> siesel: did you see ym diagram?
<chillywilly> for the schema compiler
<chillywilly> s/ym/my
<chillywilly> I know it needs more explanation
<chillywilly> s/more//
<chillywilly> I spoke with reinhard about it before
<siesel> which one?
<chillywilly> geas-schema-compiler.dia
<siesel> what are the metaobjects?
<chillywilly> aaaah
<chillywilly> introspection
<chillywilly> objects about obakects
<chillywilly> so you can change the schema on the fly
<chillywilly> object about objects I mean
<chillywilly> the meta object api could be used by designer to create new business objects
<siesel> ok, now i think i got it.
<chillywilly> then form those odl files can be generated and python code stubs can be generated
<siesel> thats cool
<chillywilly> you can go the various ways
<esands> What is the right provider in connections.conf for postgres? 
<siesel> pypgsql?
<chillywilly> we have a number of postgres db drivers
<siesel> popy?
<chillywilly> take your pick
<siesel> be careful popy doesn't support introspection 
<esands> The default one 'psycopg' doesn't seem to work with debians 'python2.1-pgsql
<chillywilly> siesel, and I like how they generate modules/packages in the IDL binding...so it is like geas is adding all the objects on the fly
<siesel> no 'python2.1-pgsql and pypgsql go together
<chillywilly> there's good stuff there man
<chillywilly> I really like ODMG's stuff
<chillywilly> anyway, I must eat dinner

<dtm> hi all
No9 (trilluser@fi-hs3634.zapsurf.com.sg) joined #gnuenterprise.
<No9> hello all
<chillywilly> hi dtm
<chillywilly> ello No9
<No9> one quick questions... cant seems to find it in docs or site.... what language is GNUE based on? and can I use MySQL?
<ajmitch> greetings
<ajmitch> mainly python, and you can use MySQL
<No9> heard of any ERP based on PHP?
<chillywilly> although I have no idea why you would use such a thing ;)
<No9> hee hee
<chillywilly> er, that goes for mysql and PHP ERP ;)
<No9> sorry folks... never touch python before... why that?
Action: rdean thinks it's because of the origin of the name :-)
<rdean> ni!
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> cause Python rocks our socks
<No9> and does anyone have anything to say about Compiere, www.compiere.org
<ajmitch> proprietary dependencies?
<rdean> seriously, though, although I've never delved into python before, it has a reputation for being a rich OO language
<No9> ok guys.. i will go red up on Python now... to me it might as well be cobol... excuse my ignorance. :) 
<rdean> syntax is a lot more elegant than others
<ajmitch> haven't heard many good things about Compiere :)
<chillywilly> I have heard some peope talking crap about it in here before ;)
<chillywilly> only because it has nasty dependencies or something
<ajmitch> Oracle
<No9> No9 at www.python.org now....
<chillywilly> ajmitch: ugh
<chillywilly> we support Oracle
<chillywilly> but we also support a LOT more ;)
<ajmitch> i know, but we don't depend on Oracle
<chillywilly> no we don't
<chillywilly> good point :)
<No9> I think they are working on other RDBMS support as well...
<chillywilly> well we already have tons of db drivers in our abstraction layer
<rdean> just went to compiere.org...they're working on pgsql support
<ajmitch> compiere also requires jdk 1.4 from sun :)
<ajmitch> not sure about licensing
Action: rdean would wait for jdk 1.4 from IBM....their JDKs run circles around Suns :-)
<No9> anyone here in singapore?
<ajmitch> close, i'm in NZ ;)
Action: rdean hrm...they're using JBuilder to write compiere.
<No9> NZ huh? i heard so much about the place... NICE !
<ajmitch> interesting
<No9> i came from Perth.
<No9> working in singapore...
<ajmitch> ok cool
<ajmitch> compiere is under MPL, i think
<chillywilly> Java....ugh
<No9> I have a customer looking at cheap ERP solution... instead of reinventing the wheel... I and looking at using one of the web.
<ajmitch> ok
<chillywilly> or you can hack GNUe ;)
<ajmitch> chillywilly: java, oracle dependencies, and MPL, what more could you want?
<rdean> compiere is under compiere public license (been looking at it for the last few minutes)
<chillywilly> oh God no
<chillywilly> hmmm, so where does this license actually fall then?
<chillywilly> is it BSD-like?
<ajmitch> compiere public license is MPL with only a couple of modifications
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> yea, I am loving it already
<chillywilly> NOT
<ajmitch> Compiere, Inc can roll your changes into a proprietary product
<chillywilly> yipppeee
<No9> GNUE worries me as the site says the application server is not in production stage yet....
Action: ajmitch looks at GNU's license list for details of MPL
<ajmitch> chillywilly: quick! hack the appserver into production status! :)
<chillywilly> yes sir
<No9> hee hee
<rdean> my guess is that the oracle dependencies are probably incurred in SQL....although I haven't looked into the code to see
<ajmitch> chillywilly: http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/netscape-npl.html
<chillywilly> that's not MPL thgouh
<chillywilly> though
<chillywilly> M is Mozilla right?
<ajmitch> read the page
<rdean> yep...
<rdean> oracle specificity is derived from using Oracle extensions to SQL
<chillywilly> blech
<chillywilly> dude, isn't mozilla trying to GPL the code now?
<chillywilly> I thought there was an article where they were trying to track down a couple developers
<chillywilly> so they could make the change
<chillywilly> brb
<No9> has anyone used GNUE commercially?  i mean installed at their own customer site
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> some have
<No9> I realised that most potentials i have been meeting up with wants a Multi national company doing their ERP... do you guys get the same response?
