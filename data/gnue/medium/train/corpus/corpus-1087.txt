<Mr_You> ahh both are in libxml-dev
<Mr_You> thanks
<Mr_You> trying out plume.sf.net .. its like LTSP but suppose to be cleaner.. uses gtk, python, xml
<Mr_You> oh, and debian
<Mr_You> hmm doesn't compile for me :-(
<Mr_You> undefined references..
<Mr_You> oh well will try it another time
<jbailey> Mr_You: Are you on a debian system?
<Mr_You> I have one here
<jbailey> ``dpkg -S filename.ext'' will tell you what package a file is from.
<Mr_You> even if its not installed?  ;-)
<Mr_You> thanks tho
<jbailey> If it's not installed, /join #debian and the /msg apt find filename.ext
<Mr_You> ok thanks
<jbailey> apt won't answer if you're not in the channel, though.
<jcater> Mr_You: not sure why he said LTSP was crap
<jcater> but I use LTSP at my callcenter
<jcater> and you can't get much more lightweight than that
<jcater> as it's basically a kernel!
Action: jcater loves it
<jcater> plus, they had 3 or 4 deb's for me to download and install

<derek> its phunny 2 c pearl programers; arg you that thir kod is eazy 2 read; and that python wight space is cow terd; 
<derek> i.e. one fellow brags that some perl code is bad yes
<jcater> :)
<derek> for example i am so cool i FIXED the code of this jack ass top dog at the biggest company in the world
<derek> let me just paste it, his arrogance is funny
<derek> 'll give you another good example. Some time ago I tuned Perl code of one Senior Design Technologist (I won't tell you the name of his company, for obvious reasons). This was one of my records, so I have the exact stats. His program had 190 lines of code in 6530 characters and he asked me if the same can be done in more elegant way. I wrote my version from scratch, which had only 13 lines of code in 227 characters, i.e. it was 30 tim
<derek> aller - it's 3% of original size. It was also over 900% faster than the original (doing exactly the same of course), as a side effect of my elegance-tuning. And no, it wasn't obfuscated and I wasn't writing it just to use as small space as possible. Later I wrote a minimal version of that program and it had 2 lines in 112 characters (including a new-line), so the real 13-lines version was quite readable, with descriptive function and
<derek> able names, indentation, etc.
<jamest> :)
<derek> im thinking sounds like you used the evil shit in perl to make it unreadable ;) but no he swears otherwise
<derek> And no, it wasn't obfuscated
<jamest> what are you talking about?
<derek> the great part.... he gives an example of his 'unobfuscated' code:
<derek> So it's very common to see a code like this:
<derek> for($index = 0; $index <= $maxindex; $index++){
<derek> printf("ITEM: %s\n", $items[$index]);
<derek> } where you could just write:
<derek> print "ITEM: $_\n" for @items; 
<derek> now you tell me what person other than a perl guru thinks of
<derek> print "ITEM: $_\" for @items:
<derek> as a decent way to do a for loop?
<derek> wouldnt python be
<derek> for item in items:
<derek>   print("ITEM: %s\n" % item)
<derek> or something?
<derek> which seems pretty damn clean to me :)
<derek> whether im from a pascal or a C or C++ or java or even a vb background :)
<derek> jamest: just reading slashdot wars of perl people up set that python isnt 'real language'
<jbailey> You probably didn't want to escape the " in that third example.
Action: jamest looks at forms/designer/navigator
<derek> jbailey: guess thats why im not cool enough for perl ;)
<jamest> mmmmmm
<jamest> shit
<jamest> you have any idea how hard this is going to be to convert to java?
<derek> jamest: see people MIGHT use it if it was written in scheme or perl ;)

<jamest> hi
<Mr_You> hi all
<neilt> jamest:  how do i make forms work with geas?
<jamest> you setup a entry in connections.conf
<jamest> with a provider of geas
<neilt> where is the real connections.conf
<neilt> located
<jamest> /usr/local/gnue/etc by deafult
<neilt> which connection am i using
<neilt> devel, prod, gnue
<jamest> um
<jamest> i think it'd be gnue
<jamest> you can check
<jamest> by looking in the .gfd file
<neilt> which .gfd file
<jamest> which ever one you want to access geas with
<jamest> i'll assume the one sin samples/geas
<neilt> that seems too simple
<jamest> oooo
<jamest> those forms don't require a connections.conf entry
<jamest> as they define a <database> tag
<jamest> which is like a form specific entry in connections.conf
jcater (~jason@24.92.70.39) joined #gnuenterprise.
<neilt> so how do i connect usign geas and which .gfd do i test with
<neilt> ?
<neilt> what creates the tables
<neilt> in geas?
<jamest> geas does
<jamest> those forms expect a fully functoinal geas
<jamest> which has autocreated it tables
<neilt> ahh
<neilt> so i need to connect designer to geas
<neilt> hhow do i do that?
<jamest> you can't 
<neilt> :(
<jamest> i couldn't get that far 
<jamest> as a lot of the GEAS api requires corba.boolean support
<neilt> how can i see if i get the same error you did?
<jamest> um....IIRC you start geas
<jamest> and try to query a form
<neilt> that is running
<jamest> or
<jamest> just use your own test programs
<jamest> in the geas dir
<jamest> as I couldn't run them either
<neilt> those all run fine for me
<jamest> i can't run them
<jamest> you might have the older orbit-python?
<neilt> i have 3.1
<neilt> i think that is the very latest
<neilt> in fact i know it
<jamest> now
<neilt> now?
<jamest> it has to be a sample that does a query
<jamest> that tries to apply a filter
<jamest> the basic query works fine
<jamest> it's when you try and do something more complex than pull all data
<neilt> jamest: geas does not work for me any more, i get a bus error

<dtm> you silly guy
<dtm> hehhe
<derek> a mysql db :(
<derek> looks like i will hack psql support as it will take me longer to get mysql running and remember how to setup db and such than it will to just fix postgres :)
<derek> i really really just want an events calendar that reads from files instead of db's though :(
<dtm> btw i have a mysql cheat sheet i made for myself, and there's also the webmin GUI
<derek> guess im too old skool
<dtm> why files?  
<derek> just when i have the time to 'enter events' i dont have a net connection
<dtm> coz it's easier for you to admin on this silly non-root box you got?
<dtm> oh
<dtm> well then you could do a db dump and restore couldn't ya/

<chillywilly> er, kernel
<dtm> yeah so what do you use it for
<chillywilly> boots performance
<dtm> FOR WHAT
<dtm> :)
<chillywilly> makes my desktop and other stuff respond better

<chillywilly> faster
<dtm> your desktop?  whoa
<chillywilly> yes, Gnome is my desktop
<chillywilly> dog gone it
<dtm> whoa, so you give hardware-level priority to gnome/
<dtm> ?
<dtm> so that makes gnome fully cooperative with the kernel in execution time,eh
<dtm> ?
<dtm> gnome can halt or crash the whole system then? or what
<chillywilly> kernel code gets preempted in favor of user processes
<chillywilly> no
<dtm> preempted until the process returns?  or is it not cooperative?
ra3vat (ds@ics.elcom.ru) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> there's still multitaksing going on it is just that kernel code is less of a priority
<chillywilly> when it is "preempted" that just means itgives up it's time slice or chance to run in favor of a higher priority process
<chillywilly> actually any process cwn be preempted
<chillywilly> even kernel mode ones
<chillywilly> http://www.tech9.net/rml/linux/
<dtm> ok i see
<chillywilly> This patch enables a preemptible kernel, which reduces the latency of the kernel. It allows processes to be preempted even if in kernel mode.
<chillywilly> The design used is to allow a task to be preempted anywhere within the kernel, using spinlocks as markers for non-preemptibility regions. The resulting system response is greatly increased, with measured average latencies under 1ms.
<dtm> so basically it's like adding a new level to the 'nice' command.
<dtm> or 'renice'
<chillywilly> it makes the kernel get out of the way ;)
<dtm> ok so you can virtually renice the kernel down

<dtm> hey dan.  there's this concept of something called "HEAD" in a cvs tree, which is capitalized for no apparent reason.  what is "HEAD"?
<dtm> is that a default configuration of some kind?
<chillywilly> the main branch
<dtm> i hear about it in a lot of projets
<chillywilly> the 'trunk' if you will
<derek> HEAD is what most developers pine for but seldom get
<derek> ;)
<dtm> oh
<chillywilly> hehe
<dtm> stable huh?
<dtm> heh
<dtm> why is it capitalized?
<dtm> and what is an alternative?  what's non-HEAD?
<dtm> i mean, what else is there?
<derek> HEAD is the raw source
<chillywilly> HEAD is usually the most unstable as it is like the current cvs version
<derek> branches are segments marked off for retrieval
<derek> generally branches are stable of some sort
<chillywilly> the alternatives are specific branches in cvs
<derek> HEAD is just last file checkins
<dtm> derek: so in the case of DCL, which one is HEAD?
<derek> but say you get a working HEAD
<derek> HEAD is the development code (what you checked out) in most projects head is usually broken
<chillywilly> it's all about how you manage your cvs tree
<derek> instead use what i gave you in #dcl
<derek> to check out a stable branch
<chillywilly> usually you hack on a certain stable branch and fix bugs
<chillywilly> HEAD has all the 'development' stuff in it
<chillywilly> at some point HEAD becomes stable and you branch off again
<chillywilly> (that's one way to do it)
<chillywilly> you can merge bug fixes form the stable branch back into HEAD
<dtm> derek : why do you say most devs pine for it but seldom get it?
<chillywilly> the cvs book is a good source dtm
<chillywilly> I think he meant that other kinda HEAD
<chillywilly> ;)
<dtm> hmmm.
<dtm> HEAD is just a dumping ground then, eh?
<dtm> just to get files collected?
<dtm> but it's the default, right?  so if i just check out the module 'dclgw' then i get HEAD?
<chillywilly> it's the main trunk of the code, where the development version is
<chillywilly> it's the default branch you commit against
<dtm> ok which may be a dumping ground depending on the project's management policy
<chillywilly> the ever changing one

Action: dtm sticks a pipe cleaner into derek's head, ear to ear, and wiggles and pulls
<chillywilly> basically, dtm branches let you do parallel development
<dtm> yep

<chillywilly>       ====*===================================================================>
<chillywilly>                      (main line of development)
<chillywilly> weee
<dtm> HA!  who made that pic
<chillywilly> the main line there would be called HEAD
<chillywilly> that's fomr the cvs book
<chillywilly> er, from
<dtm> cvs book is ascii?
<chillywilly> well I was reading it with info
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> info cvsbook
<chillywilly> apt-get install cvsbook if on debian
<chillywilly> Introduction
<chillywilly> ************
<chillywilly> This is a set of free, online chapters about using CVS (Concurrent
<chillywilly> Versions System) for collaboration and version control.  It covers
<chillywilly> everything from CVS installation and basic concepts all the way to
<chillywilly> advanced usage and administration.  It is intended for anyone who uses
<chillywilly> or plans to use CVS.
<chillywilly> a branch is like a point in time where you diverged fomr the main line of development as it is separate, although you cn merge changes back and forth between branches at any time
<chillywilly> does this make sense at all?
<dtm> yeah i understand that
<dtm> so basically you have HEAD and you have branches.
<dtm> simple
<chillywilly> good :)
<chillywilly> with HEAD being a special branch that is always there
<dtm> yep
<chillywilly> the 'trunk'
<dtm> and being the default dev
<chillywilly> or main line of development
<dtm> which seems counterintuitive to me; i'd think the stable should be default ;)
<dtm> hehehe
<dtm> but that's me
<dtm> and i'm hungry.
<chillywilly> well you usually only checkout cvs code if you're going to hack (theoretically)
<dtm> haha
<chillywilly> some ppl do keep HEAD 'stable' and start an unstable 'branch'
<chillywilly> you can do it however you want
<chillywilly> jcater and jamest did this the last time with forms, et. al. when they went to add some major features
<chillywilly> iird
<chillywilly> er, iirc
<chillywilly> another example would be ORBit
<chillywilly> they had a development branch and HEAD was the stable 0.5.x series
<dtm> ok
<dtm> gotcha
<dtm> does cvs do incremental checkouts (downloads) not unlike rsync in concept?
<chillywilly> cvs only grabs the 'diffs'
<chillywilly> so once you do the initial checkout usually you're not downloading a lot after that
<chillywilly> it just pacthes the files and grabs new files
<chillywilly> iirc, it does the equivalent as diff -urN old new would do
<dtm> ok
<chillywilly> so, in essence it is incremental, but it is all ASCII of course for the most part as it's used to manage source code, or html files, etc.
<dtm> ok
<dtm> gotcha
<dtm> coz cvs is old skewl
<chillywilly> cvs is cool
<Remosi> er
<Remosi> I believe CVS uploads any files you have that have changed
<Remosi> and does all the processing on the server
<Remosi> which sends you back a diff
<chillywilly> only if you commit your changes
<Remosi> true
<Remosi> actually
<Remosi> I'm not sure
<Remosi> I think it does that for Merges too
<Remosi> (on Update)
<chillywilly> well, you can compress things with -z 
<Remosi> yeah
<chillywilly> I guess it has to transmit it to look do a diff...so it does more than rsync, my bad
<chillywilly> it's not really incremental
<Remosi> right.
<chillywilly> but it won;t do it for files that have not been modified
<chillywilly> will it?
<chillywilly> g'night everyone

<reinhard> i met (among others) rodrigo moya and georg greve
<derek> ah how did it go
Action: derek whats to hear all about it
<reinhard> who both asked for you :)
<reinhard> rms held a speech for about 850 people
<derek> i REALLY REALLY REALLY need to talk to greve
<derek> wonder what rodrigo was wanting?
<derek> been long time since i talked to him (i think he is at ximian now)
<reinhard> we talked about the days back when gnome-db and gnue were working together
<derek> rofl
<reinhard> and he asked me if you are still active in gnue
<reinhard> yes he is at ximian now
<reinhard> the weird thing is he hacks on evolution for ximian
<reinhard> and has to do gnome-db in his spare time
<derek> yeah thats what i heard
<derek> not that he was hacking evolution, but that gnome-db was not a 'ximian' thing
<derek> in many ways that is good
<derek> so what the overall feel of the event?
<derek> did you get to meet rms or bkuhn?

<derek> jbailey: how long would it take you to convert that rh5.2 on alpha to debian?
<jbailey> I can do an i386 system without disrupting any services in four hours./
<derek> as i have it up on the net now and recalled its root password
<derek> i have alpha cd's also
<jbailey> I would just apt everything into place.
<jbailey> It's easier because I don't need to preserve any config settings aside from network.  It's harder because I've never played on an alpha before, so I'm not familiar with the bootup process.
Action: derek is debating just doing it from cd and wiping redhat or having you have a hand at an 'upgrade'
<derek> the boot process is different for sure :)
<derek> its bootloader is like a mini operating sytem

<jbailey> Your call..  I am a little tight on time until I'm back from the wedding.

<jbailey> jamest: You have to be clever about it.
<jamest> ?
<jbailey> Basically, you need to unpack some dpkg file by hand, enough so that you can run dpkg.  Then you install the base environment.  Then install cruft, and work your way off of that report.
<jbailey> I've found that it's cheaper for my clients to pay me to convert to Debian and then do the work than it is to do complicated things on RH.

<derek> jcater: how does forms do its queries
<derek> let me make that more clear
<derek> if i put foo% in a box and hit query 
<derek> does it do 
<derek> where field like 'foo%'
<derek> or
<derek> where upper(field) like 'FOO%'  and foo was converted to FOO? 
<derek> ie.. is it case sensitive
<chillywilly> fooya
<derek> if it is, is there a way in the form to make it so it is not?
<derek> i.e. if i do UPPERCASE
<derek> will it then force my like queries to be uppercase as well?
<jcater> it is case sensitive
<jcater> but if the field is set to case="upper"
<jcater> then that applies to both input and queries
<derek> sweet
<jcater> iirc jamest added a flag to do case insensitive, but I may be wrong :(
<derek> i might have to do that for my form then
<derek> i.e. that is the answer i wanted to hear
<derek> it does it how it should (case sensitive) but you can override for those bozo's that dont consistently enter data :)
<chillywilly> btw, afaik per net is not 'irish'

<derek> much easier than aol ;)
<pirate1962> hi
<pirate1962> now what?
<jcater> welcome, papa-masta
<pirate1962> how do?
<chillywilly> hi pirate1962
<pirate1962> greetings to all
<derek> you were willing to work on the application server part right?
<derek> or you want some other hideous task?
<pirate1962> appserver sounds ok for now
<derek> ok we have something written in C that had some lofty goals and works to a degree
<derek> rather than give you the spec for that we have been debating about what we really want in an app server and whether its smarter to 'phase' in functionality
<derek> i was curious since you have worked with websphere a bit in the past
<derek> what did you like about it or not like about it and what did it 'do', i.e. what did the ibm marketing slicks sell it as solving?
Action: derek recalls they mostly label it for web applications, but we will need to support more than the web and was curious if websphere supported similar things
<pirate1962> the early versions were easy to install and operate.
<pirate1962> later versions became too complex and administration functions slowed to a crawl.
<derek> isnt that par for course in ibm?
<chillywilly> sorry to interrupt but did you guys see that award that Guido Van Rossum got from the FSF?
<derek> what functionality did websphere serve?
<pirate1962> it is pretty tighlty integrated with the web and that is all i ever used it for.
<jcater> derek: I think that's par for course in any proprietary software
<derek> chillywilly: yep discussed the other day the irony and that rms was less than having a good time when guido's speech consistently reiterated his gratitude towards 'open source'
<derek> pirate1962: but what did it 'do'
<derek> im thinking our current application server probably in many ways resembles some sort of EnterpriseJavaBeans server more than anything currently
<derek> you still have that redhat box up? and on the net?
<derek> if so probably easiest to have you crab a copy of CVS (the source code)
<derek> as it has the relevant documentation as well
<pirate1962> basically provides a platform for java applications to service the web
<derek> our original goals in an application server were..... (iirc)
<pirate1962> the redhat box is running an old version.
<derek> a. provide n-tier architecture, where db server could be independent of middleware and middleware independent of client and at either tier you could do fail over/load balancing or replication
<derek> b. that storage would be in SQL database but presented as 'objects' for client applications
<pirate1962> i have not finished the setup after reinstall because i plan to create new cds when i get my cdrw replaced.
<derek> c. that the objects methods could be written in any language
<derek> d. some other goals that i dont recall w/o looking at the docs
<derek> what is your opinion?
<derek> the idea roughly would be to get front end developers to not have to really think about backend code yet make it readily reusable over any number of RPC transports like SOAP/CORBA/DCOM/XML-RPC/MSMQ etc etc etc
<pirate1962> similar to websphere except for the object transparency
<derek> how did websphere handle that?
<derek> or did they not give you 'objects' work with
<derek> you have to fashion that yourself if you wanted to play that way?
<pirate1962> basically you are limited to java supported interfaces
<derek> ah
<derek> let me get you some links to some documentation
<chillywilly> there's this nice doc in cvs that someone has been working on in gnue/geas/doc/odmg.txt ;)
<derek> here is an old doc
<pirate1962> multiple languages and transports is a desirable objective, but it comes at a cost.
<derek> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/GNUeObjectServer/
<derek> pirate1962: yes we expect a speed penalty for the 'abstraction'
<derek> as really we end up abstracting... database, transport layer and method language
<pirate1962> performance and maintenance become stickier issues.
<derek> we are hoping in many ways maintenance will be better or at least suits will think so
<pirate1962> is the problem a language issue? a transport issue? an application issue?
<derek> as if i have a whole staff of 50 programmers that use vb regularly (yuck)
<pirate1962> the user doesnt care .. they just want it to work.
<derek> having to retrain them to use app server X w/ language X might not be feasible
<derek> BUT if i can use vb for the method code i might even to be able to leverage some of my existing code
<derek> the transport layer abstraction is because if anything transport is in a state of flux
<derek> 2 years ago it was DCOM
<derek> last year it was CORBA
<derek> six months ago it was XML-RPC
<chillywilly> now it's SOAP
<derek> with .net its now SOAP
<derek> abstracting that lets us kind of 'roll' with the flow
<derek> with minimum effort
<derek> and allows maximum types of clients to use the server
<derek> the language abstraction thing im only half sold on (im a python freak) so i woudl be fine with it only supporting python :)
<pirate1962> i am not saying it is a bad idea, only that it has hidden costs.
<jcater> we hope the benefits outway the disadvantages
<derek> i think we see them as real costs
<jcater> we do try to design our APIs with this abstraction in mind; not simply try to mold some existing product to fix our needs after the fact
<jcater> of course, that only takes you so far :)
<pirate1962> you need to be experts in all supported areas just to defend yourself and provide decent service.
<derek> another proposal that is kind of old http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/GEASCache/
<derek> pirate1962: i think this is where open source kicks butt
<chillywilly> man, you're pulling them out of the wood work ;)
<derek> generally what we do is implement our FAVORITE way of doing things but leave an open api for others
<derek> then as the 'expert' in that way comes along they just plug into the API
<derek> like database abstraction we did two or three providers we use regularly and one day code just 'showed up from ibm' for db2 out of the blue
<derek> none of us even had a db2 database to test it against :)
<derek> http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/gnue/geas/doc/overview.txt?rev=1.3&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup
<derek> is a more current 'overview' of our app server
<derek> actually here is the cvs tree online
<derek> http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/gnue/geas/doc/
<derek> faq.txt overview.txt odmg.txt are all relevant
<derek> as are probably the .txt's in the other directories
<derek> when were you gonna grab your burner?
<pirate1962> i will take a look at all of them and get back with questions
<chillywilly> there's lots of them gnue/geas/doc/
<derek> as i think it will help a lot to get the cvs tree on a unix box where you can look at the doxygen comments of the code and the code itself some
<pirate1962> i will probably run by frys tomorrow after my allergy shot
<derek> cool
<chillywilly> bah, I should go to bed
<chillywilly> l8r dudes
<pirate1962> gnite

<neilt> ok, thanks
<jamest> jcater, you agree?
<jcater> me thinks
<jamest> we look forward to the bug reports :)
Nick change: dnWork -> derek
<derek> gack what happened to netscape.com?
<derek> its like a portal
<derek> anyone know if there is a place to download 'old' netscapes
<derek> i have a user complaining about a bug no other user can replicate but they are using netscape 4.7
<jcater> ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator
<jamest> ftp.netsc
<jamest> nevermind 
<jamest> :)
<derek> im at rock and hard place
<derek> i dont really want to suggest an upgrade to netscape as ive heard HORRID things
<derek> i KNOW the stuff works on i.e. 4.x - current so that would be the easy copout
<derek> i just cant tell people to use ie :)
<derek> if it were not the ENTIRE corporation (several thousand hotels) i would say download mozilla and move along :)
<derek> guess i have to find out what idiosyncransy im invoking... ;)
Action: derek hates the web, have i ever said that (for applications that is)
<neilt> i use netscape 6.2
<neilt> it seems to work ok
<neilt> better IE
Action: neilt is looking for all web enterprise software
<neilt> ;)
<derek> jcater: i was seriously considering giving them gnue screens for this stuff
<derek> as it would rock for them
<neilt> s/is looking/is implementing/
<derek> the big issue is postgres isnt local to them
<jcater> well
<jcater> we've solved that :)
<derek> **if** we had middleware to handle it rock
<derek> w/o it wondering if we could spoof your hack
<derek> i.e. with a custom menuing system
<derek> make menu option 'connect to server'
<derek> that runs the ssh tunnel
<derek> and have at form startup call that method code
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> seems like overkill
<derek> basically lodgian a large hotel chain about (100+) has signed up whole organization
<derek> they did chapter 11 recently
<derek> and have no real IT budget so outsourcing recruitment was highly appealing to them
<derek> in past 3 days already like 50 of their general managers have signed up
<derek> so why i agree sounds like 'overkill'
<derek> w/o something 'idiot' proof the tech support would kill me
<jamest> um
<jamest> navigator now supports calling apps
<jamest> have it call a shell script that does what you require
<jcater> dude
<jcater> I said overkill
<jcater> because I think you'd be turning it into a tech support nightmare
<jcater> all you'd be doing w/port tunnelling is creating a single-port VPN
<jcater> I'll ship you a $200 intel box that will do it :)
<jcater> if you'd like
<derek> huh?
<jcater> if it don't work, tell them to hit the power button
<jcater> wait 2 seconds
<jcater> and hit again :)
<derek> if there are 100 hotels wouldnt it be 100 $200 boxes?
<jcater> I do that in my remote office
<jcater> ah, in each hotel
Action: jcater was thinking of one large office
<jcater> so maybe menu option would be better
Action: jcater shuts up now
<derek> the best option would be to have more control of the server and setup postgres probably w/ ssl and security to allow non localhost connections
<derek> by ip block/address
<derek> then no real special client stuff needed
<derek> btw the port tunnel just kicks butt
<derek> using gnue so much now i cant get cvs cause im scared if i break my working copy i will have to do things the 'hard way'
<derek> well techinically i could still get cvs just dont want the headache of multiple copies of gnue currently
<derek> jamest: you see new person interested in geas came in the other day
<derek> hopefully the documentation we gave him doesnt scare him away

<fdkf> hey raevat
<fdkf> privet
<ra3vat> privet :)
<fdkf> i just found out about gnue
<fdkf> amazing
<fdkf> and would like to help
<ra3vat> fdkf: you russian?
<fdkf> nop
<ra3vat> speaking?
<fdkf> nop
<fdkf> except for 'privet' ;)
<ra3vat> privet???
<ra3vat> :)
<fdkf> not russian?
<ra3vat> ok
<fdkf> i know a few russian ppl
<fdkf> always saying privet when i come in, guess it means 'hi' or smtn
<ra3vat> i was out for too long not sure i can help with specific questions
<fdkf> i dont have specific questions
<ra3vat> yes, it's like 'hi'
<fdkf> i was wondering how advanced the software was
<ra3vat> the software consists of few tools like
<ra3vat> forms
<ra3vat> designer (for forms)
<ra3vat> geas (app server)
<fdkf> geas currently support design of enterprise objects?
<ra3vat> forms are good enough for 2-tier application
<ra3vat> currently
<fdkf> forms cannot be used with geas?
<ra3vat> geas require more work for production
<fdkf> ok
<fdkf> cause i was working on something in java
<fdkf> rmi based
<fdkf> but not using java classes as base for objects
<ra3vat> forms should work with geas in 3-tier application
<fdkf> i wondered...
<ra3vat> not sure about current status of geas drivers
<fdkf> ever thought of making geas organize objects in hierarchy?
<ra3vat> business objects described in gcd formats
<ra3vat> there is lot of examples for business objects and base modules in /packages in cvs version 
<ra3vat> someone correct me later if i'm wrong in something
<ra3vat> gcd allows to describe objects, and methods definition, geas builds database tables from this
<fdkf> and gcd defines the business logic too?
<fdkf> operations to trigger on storage/retrieval of objects?

<dneighbo> jamest_ / jcater the fellow from lithuania has all installed now and i think is ready to begin working full time on gnue
<dneighbo> where do we want to let him loose at?
<dneighbo> do you guys have any basic cleanup in forms/designer/reports we could start have him look at?
<jamest_> ?????
<jamest_> who?
<dneighbo>  Arturas Kriukovas
<dneighbo> i believe his assignment is all in
<dneighbo> M (the guy i worked for at axis) is paying arturas to work on gnue full time
<jamest_> what?
<dneighbo> as they have recently started a company in lithuania that does free software consulting
<dneighbo> he thinks gnue would be good for business, so in between jobs he is letting one of his developers work on gnue
<jamest_> did I know about this?
<dneighbo> yeah
<dneighbo> just nothing happened with it for a long time
<jamest_> there is a huge todo
<jamest_> does he know python?
<jamest_> dneighbo: can we get more info
<jamest_> so we can find a spot
<dneighbo> well he doesnt speak english really well
<dneighbo> so maybe ra3vat can help some here
<dneighbo> as i think lithuania and russia have somewhat compatiable cyrillic dialects (but ii can guarantee that)
<dneighbo> he doesnt know python natively but he does have degree in computer science
<dneighbo> at one point M asked me what books he should buy for him
<dneighbo> and i suggested the ones that we all have
<dneighbo> so i think he has good 'reference' material
<dneighbo> since this is his job and not for 'fun'
<dneighbo> i dont think he really cares too much what the tasks are
<dneighbo> i would say its safest to find things that are quick wins
<dneighbo> i.e. you dont have to be a python master and doesnt affect tons of files
<jcater> what are his strengths
<jcater> historically
<jcater> C, C++, perl, XML
<dneighbo> jcater: i havent a clue
<dneighbo> i told him originally install the software and get it working and then come back and we will get you going 
<dneighbo> i got this today
<dneighbo> My name is Arturas and I am starting in GNUE project.
<dneighbo> I had to install all GNUE files and all dependencies and then write to
<dneighbo> you.
<dneighbo> I am sorry it took me so long.
<dneighbo> Now it looks like I have installed latest (02.18.) files with all
<dneighbo> dependencies and ready to work.
<dneighbo> on machine elsewhere i have the historical emails i could look at to see what he said re: what he wants to work on etc
<jamest_> hmmm
<jamest_> this is all rather sudden I hope you understand
<dneighbo> sudden :)
<dneighbo> ive been discussing for months :)
<jamest_> huh?
<jamest_> i haven't heard anything about this recently
<dneighbo> i said months :)
<dneighbo> i.e. like around time of lwe SF (august) m mentioned it
<dneighbo> and for like a month was getting paperwork for him etc and getting it primed
<dneighbo> then he disappeared until now :)
<dneighbo> btw: im teasing about sudden, as it suprised me quite a bit too, i had almost forgotten about it (rather given up that it would happen)
<dneighbo> btw: my gut reaction would be that he is a recent college graduate probably equivalent of Masters Degree here in the states
<dneighbo> with little 'on job' experience
<jamest_> ok
<dneighbo> jcater: btw when do our interns start?
<jcater> this week
<jcater> I have one this time
<jcater> didn't want to bite off more than I can chew
<dneighbo> soulstompp: were you wanting to still work on reports?
<jcater> I have him doing an Oracle Reports to GNUe Reports translater
<dneighbo> if so we need to get you assignment paperwork and get you started :)
<dneighbo> jcater: you have who doing that?
<jcater> intern
<dneighbo> intern or soulstompp
<dneighbo> ah how?
<jcater> as it's within his knowledge set
<dneighbo> we dont have reports defined yet
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> i.e. we dont have the tags defined (standard ones anyhow)
<jcater> sorry, users
<jcater> right
<jcater> however, first step is decoding/reading Oracle Reports file
<ra3vat> dneighbo: lithuania and russia have no compatiable cyrillic dialects but most of then spoke russian in ancient USSR age
<fdkf> thanks to stalin :)
<dneighbo> ra3vat : i think he speaks russian as well
<dneighbo> at least his university
<dneighbo> http://www.vtu.lt
<ra3vat> fdkf: oh, another dnue contributor :)
<dneighbo> seems to have two different languages one them russian

<chillywilly> Is Microsoft getting ahead of itself?
<chillywilly> By Mike Ricciuti
<chillywilly> Staff Writer, CNET News.com
<chillywilly> February 19, 2002, 4:00 AM PT
<chillywilly> REDMOND, Wash.--As far back as 1999, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer looked ahead enthusiastically to the rise of Web services as "more significant than the development of the browser."
<chillywilly> In typical Microsoft fashion, the world's largest software manufacturer dived headlong into the trend with a rush of marketing hyperbole. Also in character, at least according to critics, the company created much buzz about the new technology before fully developing its concept, let alone any actual products or services.
<chillywilly> As Microsoft prepares to launch the first trials of .Net My Services this fall, key details of the plan are still "not figured out," said Jim Allchin, Microsoft's group vice president in charge of Windows and server software development. "I think we just got ahead of ourselves and didn't get clear enough thinking," he said, echoing similar concerns voiced last August.
<chillywilly> <http://home.cnet.com/Ads/Media/Images/advertisement-10pt-66.gif>
<chillywilly> [Click Here!]
<chillywilly> That observation has become abundantly clear to those familiar with the initiative inside the company and beyond.
<chillywilly> As originally envisioned, .Net My Services was to become a "digital safe-deposit box" for hosting and delivering personal information while providing an array of services ranging from commerce to communication in partnership with Web retailers such as eBay. The company had hoped consumers would pay fees that would cover the bulk of the expense to run these one-stop services, which would, in turn, manage passwords, calendars and o
<chillywilly> onal information.
<chillywilly> Instead, the plan has been the source of continual confusion among potential customers, has encountered a series of problems with its underlying technologies, and has faced internal frustration that sources say even led to its lead executive being reassigned.
<chillywilly> In surprisingly candid interviews with CNET News.com at company headquarters here, Ballmer and other top executives recently acknowled
<chillywilly> woops
<chillywilly> too much
<chillywilly> "In surprisingly candid interviews with CNET News.com at company headquarters here, Ballmer and other top executives recently acknowledged that Microsoft is still in search of a business plan for the initiative and has not determined how to make money on .Net My Services, nearly a year after it was announced.
<chillywilly> "
<chillywilly> that's what I meant to paste
<chillywilly> sorry guys my mouse got greedy and highlighted it all
<dneighbo> yeah right
<dneighbo> i know you are a m$ mole here to illicit a response
<dneighbo> microsoft has one business model (goat raping)
<dneighbo> and they are seeing a faction (rather army) of COMPETENT developers using and propogating (free as in beer) tools not only rivaling but in some cases surpassing their own
<dneighbo> they took the next logical step in goat raping 'total control of the consumer' (passport and friends)
<dneighbo> and suprisingly the public said fsck you m$ we dont want you that close in our consuming habits, we have seen your game before
<dneighbo> so now m$ is left holding a marketing hyped machine (web services) that they really dont know how they are gonna leverage cash out of

<zDuff> Okay... I'm doing some work for a car dealership looking to rewrite and modernize its internal systems (initially the sales and finance & insurance modules) and add a CRM module. GNUe looks like it might be a suitable replacement for the aging, proprietary backend we currently use, UNIFY.
<jamest> ok
<zDuff> At first glance, it looks that what 'yall offer is rather similar -- a system for creating forms and tying them to the database, for instance... I'm just looking to get started in determining what GNUe currently does beyond that and whether it's mature enough to be useful.
<jamest> well
<jamest> we have a lot of package definitions in cvs
<jamest> however all are written with the idea of being run against geas
<jamest> which still needs some work to be up to speed for a biz
<jamest> however
<jamest> all of our tools stand alone
<jamest> you can use forms, designer, etc to create those new screens today

<zDuff> jamest, if the geas issues are strictly performance-related, then they're not a big deal -- our server is extreme overkill for our current needs (though that may be due to it being modern hardware running an app written in the '80s).

<reinhard> if you are waiting for the discussion...
<reinhard> it usually starts as soon as the american part of the world is awake
<reinhard> around 14:30 or 15:00 our time
<reinhard> so it should start soon
<reinhard> meanwhile if you have questions about gnue please ask
<reinhard> i _might_ be able to help
<jbeyer> since when you are working on gnue?
<jbeyer> and what's your role?
<reinhard> i joined somewhere around fall 1999 (IIRC)
<reinhard> and i hack on geas (the application server) as often as i have time
<reinhard> which is not as often as i would like to
<jbeyer> :-)
<TypeRite> reinhard: is CVS checkout access unrestricted? I can't seem to find references to CVS in the website.
<jbeyer> I have not tried, I downloaded some tarballs
<reinhard> TypeRite: http://www.gnuenterprise.org/sections.php?op=viewarticle&artid=2
<reinhard> the link is perfectly hidden on the front web page
<jbeyer> I down loaded forms, the designer , geas ans something that looks like a cvs snapshot
<TypeRite> reinhard: ahh!!! thank you, thank you. :)
jamest (~jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<TypeRite> would anyone know what software was used to set up the various diagrams available in the documentation online?
<Isomer> probably Dia
<reinhard> morning jamest
<reinhard> jbeyer came here to see some discussion
<reinhard> so
<reinhard> did you think about my proposal of rewriting gnuef in java?
<jamest> argh!
<reinhard> j/k
<jamest> :)
<jamest> just reading my mail
<jamest> and hit jbeyer's mail
<TypeRite> I am nobody here, but one of the reasons why I'm interested in GNUe is it's written in Python. :)
<jbeyer> that's me
<jamest> actually we're writing in python but will drop back to C where he hit performance problems
<jamest> or in the base of geas....it's all in C at this time
<jamest> base = case
<jbeyer> I just saw some broken links in the download area.
<jamest> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/
<jamest> we are using php-nuke for our web site
<jamest> but it's download manager was IMHO a major pain
<jamest> i thought i'd fixed the links though
Action: jamest goes to look at links
<jamest> oooo
<jamest> did you try the download link or a link from a story?
<jbeyer> that (http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/ ) is what I found later :-)
<jamest> ok
<jbeyer> on the page http://www.gnuenterprise.org/sections.php?op=viewarticle&artid=7
<TypeRite> jamest: that sounds like a very good way to do things. Python as the glue, with C handling the performance-intensive portions.
<jbeyer> there is a line "screenshots downloads docu"
<jbeyer> The download links works, but the actual downloads on e.g. page
<jbeyer> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/download.php?op=viewsdownload&sid=1
<jbeyer> down work for me.
<jbeyer> don't work for me.
<jamest> fixing
<jamest> jbeyer or TypeRite: anything you wish to know about us?
<TypeRite> jamest: I'm just lurking for awhile, if you don't mind. going through online documents seeing how things are and if I can do anything to help.
<TypeRite> jamest: GNUe is the only open source ERP solution I know of now, and the fact it's written in Python makes me jump up and down in joy. :)
<jamest> lol
<jbeyer> how much of the gnue code is actually working?
<jbeyer> or lets put it this way:
<jbeyer> is anybody using it in production?
<jbeyer> (no pun intended)
<jamest> working?  you want working code?!?!
<jamest> man, some people
<jbeyer> :-)
<jamest> um
<jamest> reinhard can talk about geas as he knows it better than I
<jamest> as for forms and designer they are usable today
<jamest> they are also used in production
<jbeyer> you feed them an xml description of the gui and it has backends...
<jamest> yes
<jbeyer> to produce the gui?
<jamest> yes
<jamest> what we have on the forms side of things
<jbeyer> what xml parser are you using?
<jamest> pyxml
<jamest> with our own custom wrapper parser
<TypeRite> jamest: if I want to get a feel of the code, which "module" should I start with?
<jbeyer> this one? http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyxml ?
<jamest> jbeyer: yes
<jamest> ok
<jamest> on the python side of the fence
<jamest> gnue-common is the core of forms, designer, navigator, and reports
<jamest>  it provides a lot of the core functionality of these tools
<jamest>     a dictionary based xml parser that maps to GObj (our base python object) trees
<jamest>   a data engine that has drivers for every python db api 2.0 available 
<jamest>    (we'll also support non-db api 2.0 drivers)
<jamest>   a app framework that embeds a debug system, config system, profiling system, 
alexey (alex@news.techkran.vladimir.ru) left irc: "[x]chat"
<jamest> forms is our user interface system
<jamest> designer currenly writes only form xml files
<jbeyer> that sound very interesting
<jamest>   however its capable of handling any xml format defined in our GParser format
<reinhard> on the status of geas
<jamest>   so if the forms gfd format changes designer adjusts automatically
<reinhard> geas is in a state where it basically works (more or less)
Action: jamest shuts up to let reinhard speak
<reinhard> but the code has become unmaintainable
<reinhard> and we are in the process of rewriting part by part
<reinhard> so if you are a "developer" we would greatly appreciate help in doing this as it's hard and time consuming work
<reinhard> if you are a "user" you'd better keep your hands off geas for the time being :)
<TypeRite> reinhard: do you discuss work primarily on IRC or also via the mailing lists?
Action: reinhard hands the microphone back to jamest
<jbeyer> I am not running .-)
<reinhard> ;)
<TypeRite> reinhard: I'm not a "developer" in the sense of being "production ready/tested" (so maybe I'm similar to GNUe? kidding), but I'd like to see if maybe I can find a slot to fit into and pitch in some manpower.
<jamest> navigator is currently a brain dead navigation system
<reinhard> TypeRite: we discuss most in IRC and we try to document the most important decisions via mailing list later
<jamest>   its a quick hack based upon common that lets you define processes
<jamest>   these processes define steps that run forms, or apps
<jamest>   some day this will support role based access control
<jamest>   but not today
<jamest> :)
<jamest> reports can generate reports
<jamest>   :)
<jamest>   but is not complete
<jamest>   it can be used however
<jamest>   it's author used it to generate something like a 10,000 letter mailing to their customer base IIRC
<jamest> so to play
<jamest>   i'd grab common, forms, designer if python was your thing
<jamest>   i'd grab geas if C and object servers are your thing
<jamest> if you're looking for an interesting project
<jamest>   the geas/forms interface is currently at a standstill due to problems on my machine
Action: jamest is not sure he is helping people here
<jamest> am I answering your questions ok?
<jbeyer> yes.
<TypeRite> jamest: yes.
<jamest> ok
<jamest> TypeRite: we can always use the help
<TypeRite> jamest: I have been quiet, reading in awe, raving about your friendliness and helpfullness in our local Python/Linux group's channel.
<jamest> huh?
<jamest> people know about #gnuenterprise outside of #gnuenterprise?
<jamest> wow
<TypeRite> jamest: hahaha.
<TypeRite> jamest: I told the local LUG and Python SIG about it. I'm from the Philippines.
<TypeRite> jamest: I know of at least two people who looked at things. I am still trying to get them to get interested enough to pitch in. they're more seasoned than I.
<jamest> ok
<TypeRite> jamest: thank you again for your help explaining things. I've got a CVS snapshot as of today and will see if I can find my way around things. :)
<jamest> TypeRite: ok, if you have cvs
<jamest> do this
<jamest> cd cvs/gnue
<jamest> python setup-cvs.py
<jamest> and answer the questions
<jamest> you'll end up with 
<jamest> gfcvs - forms from your local cvs tree
<jamest> grcvs - reports from cvs tree
<TypeRite> jamest: everything will run from wherever the CVS copy is?
<jamest> gncvs - navigator from cvs
<jamest> yes
<jamest> that setup-cvs.py script was created so that you could still work
<TypeRite> jamest: cool. oh, any news on GNUe and Python 2.2? I've got both 2.1 and 2.2 and wonder which you think I should use for the CVS-running copy.
<jamest> with a stable copy installed 
<jamest> while using these commands to use your private (and edited) cvs tree
<jamest> well, I have heard it works on 2.2
<jamest> but i have 2.0 and 2.1 installs here
<TypeRite> jamest: okay. since this is a dev copy I'll bite the bullet with 2.2. ;>
<jamest> :)
<jamest> bbiaf
<TypeRite> interesting, there are Debian packages for gnue-common, gnue-forms and gnue-designer.
<reinhard> yep
<reinhard> and for geas
<TypeRite> and geas.
<reinhard> even
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> yes what you said:)
<TypeRite> reinhard: haha. :)
<jamest> yes
<TypeRite> reinhard: it seems the cvs-running setup doesn't do anything about GEAS so I'll have to grab that package.
<jamest> yeah
<reinhard> yes
<jamest> the python tools use distutils and geas uses autoconf
<jbeyer> where do I find a uulib?
<reinhard> geas is somewhat separate from the front end tools
<reinhard> jbeyer: look for a package called e2fsprog-dev or like that
<TypeRite> jbeyer: or on Debian, uuid-dev, I think.
<jbeyer> I google for that :-)

<dneighbo> hello Arturas i apologize for not responding to your mail yesterday
<dneighbo> we had some other pressing tasks on the administration side to take care of :):
<Arturas> hello Derek. That's not a problem
<Arturas> I can allways wai
<Arturas> ... wait
<dneighbo> please tell M i say 'hello'
<Arturas> ok
<Arturas> Do you have time now?
<dneighbo> yes
<dneighbo> we discussed your mail a little bit yesterday and where we wanted to put you to work :)
<dneighbo> but we want to know more your programming background and more importantly what you would be interested to work on :)
<Arturas> I'm fluent in Delphi => visual programming
<Arturas> learned XML
<dneighbo> there is no shortage of things to do, its just a matter of getting you started :
<Arturas> learning C++
<dneighbo> Arturas : im ex delphi programmer :)
<Arturas> :)
<dneighbo> i will say python is a VERY easy transition from delphi
<Arturas> yes, it is for sure :)
<Arturas> but as i look into all this project
<Arturas> it all is so huge and i just would like to participate everywhere :)
<dneighbo> what language is your native language? (as we have several people that speak russian working on gnue)
<Arturas> native is Lithuanian
<dneighbo> Arturas thats the perfect answer :) we like people willing to work anywhere/everywhere :)
<Arturas> can read/write in Russian (and English ;)
<Arturas> can read in German
<Arturas> undestand and weakly read in Polish
<Arturas> maybe some Norwegian
<dneighbo> ra3vat : is outside of moscow and i think creating a russian mailing list for gnue, you will probably want to help him with it
<dneighbo> so that things get communicated back to the english lists and such
<dneighbo> i think there is a lot of stuff that needs work i will list probably some options
<dneighbo> - clean up/refactoring of gnue forms (probably best introductory stuff)
<ra3vat> dneighbo: it's him not me who can help for rest of us with languages :)
<Arturas> ( so I just can't chose any especial part of this project)
<dneighbo> - extending/finishing gnue-common rpc abstraction
<dneighbo> Arturas by all means yes
<dneighbo> if there is a particular piece you want to work on just let us know :)
<dneighbo> i thought you wanted to work on everything so i was gonna list some of the 'hot' todo's :)
<Arturas> problem is that i just don't know :\
<Arturas> what from to chose
<dneighbo> well that is why i was gonna suggest a few :)
<Arturas> and yes, i liked your idea of suggestions
<dneighbo> - clean up/refactoring of gnue forms (probably best introductory stuff)
<dneighbo> - extending/finishing gnue-common rpc abstraction
<Arturas> what is abstaction?
<Arturas> what is abstraction?
<dneighbo> - doing work on report engine
<dneighbo> - doing work on designer
<dneighbo> abstraction means to make it non detailed
<dneighbo> a good example would be perl DBI
<dneighbo> it abstracts perl calls to a SINGLE db interface
<dneighbo> so you dont have to write separate perl code for every database you wish to use 
<dneighbo> ex:
<dneighbo> oracle might be db.connect()
<dneighbo> sybase maybe db.connection()
<Arturas> but it can be too hard for me - i don't know yet all the details about your project
<Arturas> can make good abstraction
<dneighbo> postgres maybe db.conn()
<Arturas> but itmay not fit you
<dneighbo> so perl DBI creates db.Connect() and it knows what to call based by settings you gave it
<dneighbo> well the abstraction for rpc
<dneighbo> would be thigns like DCOM, SOAP, XML-RPC, CORBA etc
<Arturas> know only few details about them
<dneighbo> so you really dont have to know a lot about GNUe specifically to do it, but its a pretty large and complex undertaking
<dneighbo> i think we should talk to jcater and jamest and see if they have some stuff in forms or designer that we can start you with
<dneighbo> that will allow you get a better understanding of the internals of gnue, but while doing something useful :)
<Arturas> probabaly that would be best thing for start :)
<Arturas> :)
<dneighbo> jcater / jamest .....
<Arturas> i will have to quit after ~20 minutes
<dneighbo> ra3vat did you ever get that russian list setup?
<dneighbo> Arturas : are you on metered time?
Yurik (~yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> yes
<Arturas> now i am in university
<Yurik> re
<dneighbo> if so maybe we can try to schedule a time for you to meet us here
<Arturas> it's 20:33 and it closes strictly in 21:00 :\
<dneighbo> ah
<Arturas> what time is at you? ;)
<dneighbo> so its unlimited during open hours
<Arturas> yes
<dneighbo> im at 11:41
<ra3vat> dneighbo: there was not much activity, suggestion was to put it where other lists live 
<dneighbo> so we are at like a 9 hr diff, but jamest and jcater are only like a 7 hour diff from you
<Arturas> :) not a very big difference :)
<dneighbo> probably a good time to come back is between 18 - 21 your time
<dneighbo> er 18:00 - 21:00
<Arturas> I didn't expect to meet you today here
<Arturas> but tomorrow i will sit here from 17:00 :)
<dneighbo> im glad we got to meet at least 'virtually' :)
<Arturas> me too
<dneighbo> Arturas sounds good, tell M he is 'cheap' he should be paying for your internet connection full time ;)
<ra3vat> Arturas: one hour difference from me
<Arturas> :)
<dneighbo> is M still living there in lithuania?
<Arturas> yes, he is 
<dneighbo> he keeping busy?
<Arturas> ?
<dneighbo> is he staying out of trouble :)
<Arturas> don't know this :/
<Arturas> I guess you know www.codeworks.lt :)
<dneighbo> nope will have to check it out
<Arturas> M's firm (?) is called CodeWorks.lt and there is their site
<dneighbo> trying to find you something before the computer lab there closes and you have to leave
<dneighbo> interesting
<dneighbo> you are working for him right?
<Arturas> in some way
<Arturas> he accepted me
<Arturas> gave me computer
<Arturas> and told to communicate with you :)
<Arturas> do you know Bryan too?
<dneighbo> what is bryan's last name?
<Arturas> Bryan Rodgers 
<Arturas> (if ai'm not mistakening)
<Arturas> (if i'm not mistakening)
<dneighbo> hmm does not ring a bell
<Arturas> he works with M too
<dneighbo> is he in lithuania or here in the states?
<Arturas> so I thought you might know him
<Arturas> _now_ he is in Lithuania
<Arturas> but from States
<dneighbo> ah name sounds kind of familiar but i dont think i know him
<dneighbo> probably not too many lithuanians with last name rodgers :)
<Arturas> :)
<Arturas> I guess we could find one :)
<dneighbo> was looking for our current TODO but i can not find it so we can discuss tomorrow
<Arturas> ok
<Arturas> I will be here from 17:00 my time
<dneighbo> sounds good, have a good night
<Arturas> you too :)
<Arturas> have a good day :)
<dneighbo> i have tradition of trying to learn some of the language of those contributing to gnue
<dneighbo> how do you say? 'good night' in lithuanian?
<Arturas> 'Labanaktis'
<Arturas> very nice tradition
<dneighbo> well then
<Arturas> bye
<dneighbo> Labanaktis and will see you tomorrow :)
Arturas (artkri@gsk.vtu.lt) left irc: 
<dneighbo> ra3vat im curious about the diff between russian and lithuanian.. how do you say good night in russian (or yurik you probably know this too ) :)
<Yurik> dneighbo: the difference is very big
<Yurik> dneighbo: between russian and lithuanian
<ra3vat> dneighbo: 'spokoinoi nochi'
<Yurik> dneighbo: we say "spokoinoi nochi" in Russian
<ra3vat> dneighbo: now make a diff
<Yurik> dneighbo: russian (and ukranian, bielorussian, and so on) are slav language, when lithuanian is baltic (?)
<Yurik> s/language/languages/
<dneighbo> ah i was just going to ask that :)
<dneighbo> i.e. what are the deviations
<dneighbo> as we used to have arno from estonia
<dneighbo> and iirc estonian is a cross between finnish and russian
<dneighbo> as about every 100 years who 'owned' estonia would change :)
Action: dneighbo likes the geography plus world history lessons :)
<Yurik> :-)
<dneighbo> they dont teach us much about russia / eastern block countries in school at all here (or at least not when i was in school)
Action: Yurik is trying to imaginate something cross between finnish and russian.. brr!
<dneighbo> Yurik it might not be finnish, but some nordic country
<Yurik> of course, russian (and exUSSR) is an antipod country for us :)
<Yurik> yes, nordic
<Yurik> baltic (?)
<Yurik> s/russian/Russia/
<Yurik> us = U.S. :)
Action: Yurik is thinking to buye some mayonnaise
Action: Yurik is thinking to buy some mayonnaise
<dsmith> Estonia perhaps ?
Action: Yurik returned and bought some mayonnaise, sausage
<dneighbo> Yurik there is a rule in this channel
<dneighbo> you can't talk about food unless:
<dneighbo> a. you plan on sharing it with someone else in the channel
<dneighbo> b. you are trying to coerce jcater into doing something for you
<Yurik> heh
<dneighbo> we had to do this, because some of us gnue developers have eating problems....

<jan> hi reinhard. I`ve some questions about GEAS.
<reinhard> ok
<jan> How difficult is it to write an other "connection" to GEAS.
<jan> f.e. SOAP or RPC.
<reinhard> future: easy, because CORBA code is pulled out of the functional code of geas, and CORBA is only the outmost layer
<reinhard> present: very difficult because CORBA code is spread all over geas
Action: jan is dreaming of the future
Action: reinhard hopes the future is not _so_ distant
<jan> and your focus is on the parser at the moment, or not?
<reinhard> yes and no
<reinhard> my focus is actually rewriting geas part by part
<reinhard> and i choose to start with the parser as it is the "lowest" level
<reinhard> i am a believer in bottom up development
<reinhard> i decided to rewrite module by module and "plug in" the new ones instead of the respective old ones
<jan> and how many "level" are above the parser?
<reinhard> there are several other modules at the same level actually
<reinhard> biggest parts are the database abstraction part
<reinhard> which we are planning to merge with what forms has
<reinhard> and the method calling part
<jan> how many dbs does GEAS support at the moment? postgres, mysql any other?
<reinhard> these 3 make the low level
<reinhard> at the moment we support postgres and mysql
<reinhard> in geas
<reinhard> and a lot more in forms
neilt (~neilt@dhcp64-134-54-181.chan.dca.wayport.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
#gnuenterprise: mode change '+o neilt' by ChanServ!ChanServ@services.
<jan> whe you write the modules to plug into the old code, do you change the "main" code, or do you first have a layer in between to simulate the old code and keep the "main" code the same?
<jan> ./whe/when/s
<reinhard> jan: you are exactly pointing out the main problem i am facing
<reinhard> i change the main code
<reinhard> which is a major PITA
<reinhard> in fact much more of a PITA than i expected
<reinhard> AND
<reinhard> it breaks things :(
<reinhard> btw hi neilt
<neilt> he reinhard
<neilt> thanks for the fix
<neilt> s/he/hi/
<reinhard> jan: otoh it forces me to look at the "main" code and understand how it works
<reinhard> which will (hopefully) help me when replacing the next parts
<jan> porting an app from win to unix i`ve done the last way. leaving the "main" code the same and just difference of hidding the old and new module code behind a new function
<jan> an other approche is to separate GEAS into pieces and make an top-down rewrite.
<reinhard> yeah
<reinhard> actually we wanted something like that
<reinhard> separation into pieces
<neilt> how about horizontal rewrites
<reinhard> but it's like you want to separate a plate of spaghetti into the red and the yellow ones
<reinhard> neilt: sorry never heard of that
<reinhard> what is horizontal rewrite?
<reinhard> rewriting while lying in bed?
<neilt> just carve a bit off and rewrite it
<neilt> :)
<neilt> i like your description better
<reinhard> :)
<reinhard> still not sure if i understand what it would mean
<reinhard> can you give an example to explain?
<jan> reinhard: do you have allready seperated the way the parsed data is stored?
<reinhard> jan: yes
<reinhard> that's one of the "plugging" problems
<neilt> i say we just re-write it
<reinhard> the original author of geas seems to not have believed in the concept of private data structures :)
<neilt> I think a complete rewrite would allow to separate out parts better and get more help
<jan> there are many other ones not believing in "private" data ;)
<neilt> also I think we should be thinking about multiptle servers instead of one monolithic one
<jan> do you have a concept?
<neilt> we need to build it from the ground up mult-threaded
<neilt> with a workflow engine at the core
<neilt> :)
Action: reinhard is confused now about whether the :) relates only to the last post or to more
<reinhard> i would be serious about multithreading
Action: jan is trying to think it over again...
<jan> the parser builds up an object template tree. right?
<neilt> reinhard: it relates to me not wanting to ruffle any feathers
<reinhard> neilt: ah ok
Action: reinhard wonders why good discussions always start after midnight his time :)
psu (peter@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<jan> why don`t make the object templates a kind of active, so you just need a container to build them up and store them, and let there buisness logic kind of work. so different templates can be connected with differnt servers or diff. threads...
Action: dsmith is away: food
<neilt> yes thats where I think we need to go also
Action: jan didn`t know much about object servers..., but just tries to imagine
<dneighbo> im coming in half way to a conversation
<dneighbo> but please please please do not add rpc stuff to geas
<dneighbo> we plan on removing that from geas so you would be doing work only to be undone later
<neilt> geas does not work without rpc
<dneighbo> if you want to be productive in moving it forward look at common and there are some rpc abstraction classes there
<dneighbo> that will be tooled into geas
<dneighbo> neilt : im not saying that it wont
<dneighbo> im sayin gdont make it use SOAP by hardcoding it or writing abstraction in GEAS itself
<dneighbo> as of today GEAS is CORBA only
<dneighbo> if we want it other than CORBA lets not duplicate work
<dneighbo> fix it in common and make GEAS use common
<jan> should geas call the python code from common, or should the common code geas is using be rewritten in C?
<reinhard> jan: i think we are only thinking out loud here
<reinhard> but nobody has looked at how to actually do it
<reinhard> we just know we want it somehow :)
Action: jan understands. But
Action: jan hates not working orbit-language- bindings.
<jan> A very important step is to make the ERP packages working now.
<jan> Using forms and designer is very impressive, but
<jan> trying out an working fincancial package would be the hit!
<jan> _/fincancial/financial/
<dneighbo> we dont have our direction decided for geas at this point
<dneighbo> so it would be unfair for us to ask you to do work on it until we decide
<jan> You mean, you haven`t decided how to rewrite it?
<jan> Or even to do a complete rewrite? Or do you think of a complete replacement by something different?
<dneighbo> i think it best to rewrite it (in some cases using concepts/pieces) from original
<dneighbo> i STRONGLY think it needs to be in written in python
<dneighbo> for coherency
<dneighbo> and speed of development
<dneighbo> and if parts are slow its easy enough to move them to C
<jan> that seems to be the best solution, but are there any concrete plans?
<dneighbo> there are a few ideas of where we want to go, but there seems to be a rising division of ideals
<dneighbo> so at some point we either converge or diverge
<jan> so there is nothing more than the IRC logs?
<jan> sorry for being so direct and pressing, but i think geas is really important.
<dneighbo> yes its important
<dneighbo> but right now its better to get squared away with where we are going and what we want than to code
<dneighbo> unfortunately not all the right people are hear right now to have this dicussion (thus is the problem with time zones) :)
<dneighbo> so it will have to wait or be moved to a mailing list
<jan> ok, its just because I saw reinhard, and began to talk about GEAS.
<neilt> were with you jan
<neilt> geas is a great subject to talk about
<reinhard> indeed :)
<neilt> its just not the main focus of the project
<dneighbo> neilt thats only half true
<dneighbo> at one time there was equal focus and for reasons out side of control (not blaming here) one half wasnt able to keep up
<neilt> does geas work with forms
<dneighbo> until the disparity was too great
<neilt> nope
<dneighbo> neilt yes it did until everyone stopped developing on geas
<neilt> dneighbo:  not true
<dneighbo> when andrewm was working on geas full time it worked with forms
<dneighbo> yes it is true
<neilt> geas works fine
<dneighbo> i know i used geas and forms regularly in the beginning
<neilt> for all testing that has been done
<dneighbo> in fact even back when jade was here (over a year ago) it worked
<neilt> right now, for a couple of weeks it is in tranisition
<neilt> every error that has been posted has been corrected
<neilt> but I cant even test forms and geas because the forms part is not working
<dneighbo> forms doesnt work?
<neilt> i was told 4 months ago that a geas driver was in the works
<jan> yep!
<dneighbo> iirc its a bug in orbit-python
<neilt> orbit python work just fine for me
<neilt> i have tested geas a lot using python
<neilt> and all the tests work
<neilt> the only real outstanding issue is that the search IDL is nto so good
<neilt> we have said to the forms team "tell us what you want and we will change it"
Action: jan has looked into geas/dbdriver and tryed to understand it, but spend not much time on it.
<jan> dneighbo: why don`t create some RPC binding for common? By this, it would be a minimal server, and we could add the geas functionality step by step.
<dneighbo> we really need to talk more about it
<dneighbo> waiting say 5 days i dont think will kill us
<dneighbo> hopefully we can discuss over the weekend

<neilt> dneighbo: you here?
Action: chillywilly has a few ideas about next generation geas
<neilt> reinhard: someplace nice i hope
<neilt> like budapest
<fdkf> like what?
<reinhard> salzburg
<fdkf> chilly?
<neilt> is that good
<neilt> ?
<reinhard> basically ye
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> except when you have to visit 3 customers in 2 days
<chillywilly> I dunno it might have something to do with an implementation of a certain standard and another distributed transaction standard
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> but talk is cheap
<chillywilly> and time is short :(
Action: jan wants to hear chillywillys ideas.
<chillywilly> well there's some notes in gnue/geas/doc/odmg.txt
<chillywilly> then there's ISO XA which the ODMG standard points to and ops out of distributed transactions

<dneighbo> since reINHARD is gone for a few days
<dneighbo> probably will have to wait until next week
<neilt> cool, thanks
<neilt> why dont you propose a time via email and then we will all have time to plan
<jbailey> Woohoo pop3 over ssl almost running for gnu.org folks. =)
<dneighbo> well i was going to ask what day or times are NO way 
<dneighbo> i.e. i have xxx every thursday or i can do before x or after x any day
<neilt> ok
<neilt> works for me
<dneighbo> then i can find a window of times where people dont have a 'regular' schedule
<dneighbo> then i can set a day time with like 5 days notice
<chillywilly> a meeting?
<chillywilly> when?
<chillywilly> about what?
<neilt> dont know time
<dneighbo> bout scratching my butt
<neilt> its about re-writting geas
<chillywilly> ok
<dneighbo> where the hell are jamest and jcater tonight?
<chillywilly> may I attend?
<neilt> sure, i cant imagine it being provate
<neilt> private
<dneighbo> well we need to work on your creativity then :)
<dneighbo> er imagination
<neilt> whos?
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> I didn't know it needed work
<chillywilly> sorry
<chillywilly> I suck
<dneighbo> neilt 's

<dneighbo> he said he couldnt imagine it being private
<chillywilly> oh duh
<dneighbo> i say he needs to work on his imagination :)
<neilt> :)
<chillywilly> I need to work on my work ethic
<chillywilly> as of right now I don't have one

<chillywilly> (not at typing apparently ;P)
<derek> hmmm from version 0.0.1 to 0.0.2 eh ;)
<chillywilly> ouch
<chillywilly> that hurts
<jcater> 0.0.2pre1 :)
<chillywilly> I am at least beta quality
<chillywilly> you can give me that can't you?
Action: chillywilly probably shouldn't have asked
<jcater> um
<jcater> I'd say your at least GEAS beta quality
Action: jcater ducks
<chillywilly> :P
<chillywilly> hey that more credit than you gave me before
<chillywilly> geas is at 0.0.6
<derek> my mission this weekend is to get gnue debs that work
<chillywilly> cool
<derek> anyone have a 'guide' to making debian packages?
dres (~dres@4.18.171.42) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> his name is ajmitch ;)
<derek> or know of any other python based software in sid that has debians
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> either aj or jbailey
<chillywilly> oh ye
<jbailey> Hmm?
<chillywilly> jeff is a debian developer
<derek> jbailey wants to autoconf things :)
<derek> im not into that
<jcater> oooo
<jbailey> autoconf is good and right. =)
<jcater> well, aj then
<chillywilly> cause he rox
<derek> i dont want ot do it the C way
<derek> i want to do it the python way :)
<chillywilly> jbailey: you rox0rz!
<jbailey> derek: autoconf is not language dependant. =)
<jcater> nah
<jcater> but it's language implicit :)
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> it's justa  macro language
<chillywilly> m4
<chillywilly> nothing tlang specific about it dawg
<derek> jbailey: no its not language dependent only mindset :)
<jbailey> jcater: IIRC, auto* now has inherent support for python.
<derek> my mind doenst want to deal with autoconf
<derek> and autoconf can not be a requirement
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<derek> chillywilly: not sigh
<jbailey> derek: Yeah..  But alot of that mindset is the user being able to sit down, unpack ./configure; make; make install and have it DTRT.
<derek> i dont want people having to do autoconf to install gnue
<jcater> dude
<derek> i WOULD accept having to have autoconf to make debian packages
<chillywilly> you guys remind me of suits that wish they were hackers ;)
<jcater> that would suxor on non-*nix systems
<derek> i.e. autoconf is only used to make the debians
<jbailey> derek: This is a repeat conversation.  =)  I told you the solution to all of this before.  I just need to get a working copy of GnuE on my system so that I can make sure I don't break anything.
<derek> jbailey: you shouldnt have to do ANYTHING to gnue
<jbailey> (slow responses, cooking dinner)
<jbailey> derek: To run it?
<derek> i.e. if you have to change gnue source files there is a problem in your setup :)
<derek> i.e. to make a debian shouldnt require changing the source code of a program (or so i would think)
<chillywilly> ???
<chillywilly> why would you do that?
<jbailey> derek: It depends on if any locations are hardcoded.  Some of Debian's filesystem rules are a little twisted.
<derek> chillywilly: maybe im nuts but i have written commericial and in house software for years and never changed source to do an install
<derek> jbailey: ok if its file system things
<chillywilly> where do you have to change thje source to install?
<chillywilly> you are implying that auto* makes you do this?
<derek> and they are 'hardcoded' (outside conf files) then jcater and jamest have to sit the corner to be flogged
<derek> chillywilly: im not implying it jbailey was :)
<chillywilly> ./configure --preifx=/install/my/friggin/gnue/
<chillywilly> er, --prefix
<derek> I just need to get a working copy of GnuE on my system so that I can make sure I don't break anything.
<derek> <derek> jbailey: you shouldnt have to do ANYTHING to gnue
<derek> and yes its a repeat
<derek> basically because of some underlying things
<derek> i want working debs in the pool by sunday night
<jbailey> Ah nice.
<jbailey> Anyone willing to actually help me then? =)
<derek> so sunday morning i can quiet some very IMPORTANT critics
<derek> i will be on during the weekend
<chillywilly> who?
<jbailey> Everytime I've asked for assistance getting gnue running, the channel goes silent very quickly. =)
<chillywilly> hey now
<chillywilly> ask away
<jcater> really?
<chillywilly> jhlkjhlkjhsdlkfjhsdlkjfg
<chillywilly> qweb09tqw rg r;jk2bef;kjbh
<derek> i do have to leave tonight, i have a date with a really hot chick
<jcater> we get complemented all the time on our helpfulness
<chillywilly>  hjkSGodviqu tpr3g'v
<derek> but i should be around tomorrow and tomorrow night
<derek> BTW: we have debians in sid right now
<chillywilly> bah, call them debs
<derek> jbailey: do you know how to get the source that made those debs?
<chillywilly> you sound like a putz calling them debians
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> i.e. if apt-get source gnue-forms works and gets the files necessary to actually create the .deb file
<derek> we are 90% done
<chillywilly> where can I get some redhat package managements?
<derek> all we have to do is find out WHAT is breaking when you apt-get install gnue-forms for example and fix that
<chillywilly> ;D
<chillywilly> hrrrm
<derek> my big problem is i only have a headless debian box right now
<chillywilly> hold up
<derek> i hope to get my DEC Multia running debian this weekend (good articles on linuxjournal i think)
<derek> and then i can make debs for the alpha for gnue :)
Action: derek is holding up and darn is up heavy
<chillywilly> ?
<chillywilly> dude
<chillywilly> danielb@obfuscation:~$ sudo apt-get install gnue-forms
<chillywilly> Reading Package Lists... Done
<chillywilly> Building Dependency Tree... Done
<chillywilly> Sorry, gnue-forms is already the newest version.
<chillywilly> 0 packages upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 160  not upgraded.
<jbailey> (Scrolling back)
<chillywilly> looks like it installs for me home billy
<derek> it may INSTALL
<derek> does it WORK
Action: chillywilly should probablt upgrade
<jbailey> I'm trying the install right now.
<chillywilly> hrrrm
<chillywilly> lemme see
<derek> we have gotten NUMEROUS reports that it doesnt 'work'
<chillywilly> oh dude
<chillywilly> that was a libpng issue before
<chillywilly> iirc
<chillywilly> which is fixed
<derek> however we DID have people file bugs in debian
<derek> as of this AM a critical critic did an apt-get and the packages did not work
<derek> or so im told
<jcater> sigh
<jbailey> derek: There are no bugs to that effect.
<jcater> what ***really*** sucks
<jbailey> (In the BTS)
<jcater> if gnue-common is in woody
<jcater> s/if/is
<jcater> but nothing else
<jbailey> mmm
<jbailey> Veggie burger and potatoe chips. 
<jcater> ok
<chillywilly> it complains about me npot having a gnue.conf other than that it runs
<jcater> that sucks too
<derek> Today, in an effort to get a better
<derek> handle on this situation, I attempted to install GNUe Debian packages.  I
<derek> found:
<derek> gnue-common - The shared library for many items of the GNU Enterprise
<derek>               Framework
<derek> gnue-designer - A Rapid Application Development tool for GNU Enterprise.
<derek> gnue-forms - An XML-based forms painter
<jbailey> Your reason for not being in woody so far is that you're not building on all the arch's.
<derek> Which all looked promising, but the Debian packages appear to be
<derek> malfunctioning and I couldn't get it working in the 15 minutes I had to
<jbailey> That should be trivial to fix.
<derek> spend on it.
<chillywilly> it is fixed in sid
<chillywilly> with a fixed libpng
<chillywilly> IIRC
<derek> chillywilly: that complaint was from this morning
<chillywilly> hrrrm
<chillywilly> where?
<derek> i.e. Today in that paste equals today in Boston, MA
<jcater> dude
<chillywilly> lemme make a gnue.conf file then
<jcater> we need better descriptions in there
<chillywilly> agreed
<chillywilly> those descriptions blow goats
<derek> jcater maurizo looks like he ripped the first sentence from freshmeat
<derek> i must go now be back soon
<chillywilly> bye
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I wonder why we don't built on multi-platforms
<jcater> could it be a dependency that doesn't build that's keeping us back?
<jbailey> I've just confirmed that I'm permitted to NMY.
<jcater> well, that makes no sense
<jbailey> NMU rather.
<jcater> as all their dependencies are in woody
<jcater> :(
<chillywilly> we just need a debian guy to give us some lovin'
<chillywilly> then our packages will rock
<chillywilly> I volunteer jbailey
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> jbailey: I choose you!
<derek> what is NMU?
<chillywilly> new maintainer upload
<jbailey> Non-maintainer upload.
<chillywilly> woops
<chillywilly> yea that too ;)
<jbailey> It means that the maintainer isn't answering fast enough.
<derek> sweet
<derek> if we can fix whats wrong great
<derek> can you tell us waht is preventing us from compiling on other architectures?
<derek> as i know jamest uses on sun
<jbailey> Not yet, but soon.
<jbailey> That whole dinnner thing...
<derek> ok
<derek> well ive got date, be back in a few hours
<chillywilly> I thought you were  married?
<chillywilly> ;P
<jcater> surely he doesn't mean a date w/his wife
<jcater> as that ain't natural
<jbailey> Me?  not for another 16 days.
<chillywilly> jcater: perhaps you need a different woman then
<chillywilly> jbailey: nah, I meant da masta
Action: chillywilly should do something useful now
<chillywilly> bah
<jbailey> Ah.
<jbailey> Getting marries will be nice.  That will mean I don't have to plan the wedding anymore.
<chillywilly> hehe
Action: chillywilly is getting married june 7th 2003
<jcater> cool
<jbailey> Ah, hadn't realized you had picked a date.
<chillywilly> yup
<jcater> then we still have a year to work on you
<chillywilly> finally
<chillywilly> heheh
<jbailey> Did you tell *her* yet?
<chillywilly> well, yea she knows
<jcater>  /msg jbailey that's his mistress he's talking about
<chillywilly> yea, I wish...anyway
<chillywilly> the mistress of the sea
<jbailey> jcater: Hmm.. I"ve never had one of those.  I wonder if I get one as a present at my stag...
<jbailey> Thinking of which, I should probably find out when that is. =)
<jcater> rofl
<chillywilly> my buddy didn't even have one of those because his "fiance" wouldn't let him
<jbailey> gah, boot to the head to the finacee.
<chillywilly> so we went out and got plastered the night before the4 wedding
<chillywilly> (not a thing I recommend)
<jcater> sigh
<jbailey> If you can't trust the person you're marrying not to screw around on you on one particular day, you can't trust them anytime.
<jcater> I had an interesting wedding
<chillywilly> jbailey: true dat
<jcater> the best man and I (in full Tuxedos) had to break into my future mother-in-law's house
<jbailey> So I've got gnue-forms installed, now what?
<jbailey> (Incidentally, the only install problem I experiences was a conflict with pyxml - That's a broken python dependancy, not a gnue problem)
<jcater> well
<jcater> does that install the demos/samples?
<jbailey> no
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> where in the hell is crazymike at?
<chillywilly> I can't believe he'snot sitting behind his computer
<jbailey> (second burger on the frying pan, possibly more delays)
<jcater> do you have a gnue cvs somewhere?
<jcater> we need to get you to test the intro.gfd file
<jbailey> I think I nuked it, lemme check.
<jcater> if that works, you are good to go
<jbailey> it's still here.
<chillywilly> whatcha dot hat fer?
<jbailey> Running cvs update.
<jbailey> chillywilly: 'cause it didn't do anything. =)
<jbailey> I have something like 2 dozen projects that I'm tracking right now. =)

<chillywilly> cp sample.gnue.conf gnue.conf
<jbailey> Is that a bug in gnue-common then?  Should it install that? 
<chillywilly> it should istall the sample
<jbailey> Hmmm.
<chillywilly> er, install
<jbailey> It didn't mention that it was searching for it in /etc
<jbailey> What's the python equivalent to --sysconfdir?
<chillywilly> complain to jcater ;P
<chillywilly> beats me
Action: jbailey nudges jcater harder...
Action: chillywilly is not yet a python weenie
<chillywilly> er, developer
<chillywilly> ;D
<jbailey> Hrrmmm.
<jbailey> I've copied the sample gnue.conf to ~/.gnue/ and it still claims it can't find it.
<chillywilly> well I have never tried that
<jbailey> Where do you keep yours?
<chillywilly> I usually put it in /etc/gnue/
<jbailey> Oh hey, the sample.gnue.conf is there...
<chillywilly> tey do mysteriously disappear don;t they?
<chillywilly> bastards
<chillywilly> jcater: YOU SUCK!!!
<chillywilly> ;P
<jbailey> Now I got a traceback.

<jbailey> *sigh*
<jbailey> I want a deep fryer so I can make donuts.
<jbailey> Noone around here seems to make Vegan donuts.
<chillywilly> what do you fry them in?
<jbailey> IIRC, they have to be completely covered in oil...
<chillywilly> some kinda vegatable oil?
<jbailey> Yeah.
<jbailey> The *one* place in town that doesn't use eggs in their batter, uses lard to fry them in.
<chillywilly> mmmm
<chillywilly> lard
<jbailey> *sigh*
<chillywilly> sorry

<jbailey> Thinking of which.

<chillywilly> you know yuou have really long spindley eyes ;)

<chillywilly> o...
<chillywilly> k...

<chillywilly> forms dudes!!!!
<chillywilly> wake up!!!!
Action: chillywilly does the mexican hat dance on jcater
<chillywilly> jbailey: you know where we can find a reliable forms dude?
<chillywilly> ours seems to be broken
<jbailey> I think you pushed him off the cliff.
<chillywilly> woops
<jbailey> He was reliably not answering. =)
<chillywilly> hehe

<psu> hi steveb
<steveb> hi
<psu> it's a bit quiet in this channel at the moment
<psu> all the USA guys are asleep
<steveb> i've never been here before
<psu> and our main european developer just went off to Salzburg for the weekend
<steveb> ..only just discovered gnue yesterday
<psu> steveb: any questions about gnue?
<steveb> hmm, what proportion is python?
<psu> warning : anything technical and I'll just say "come back this evening when the Yanks are here"
<psu> steveb: as I understand it, most/all of the Forms part is 
<psu> and the GNUe Common module
<psu> The application server was written in C.
<psu> The plan is to use python for most stuff 
<psu> and just rewrite in C where necessary for speed
<steveb> sounds good.
<psu> Not sure if this applies to the app server as well  
<psu> (which is being rewritten)
<psu> or if that is to remain fully in C.
<steveb> thanks. i have to go to work now
<psu> best time to catch people here is the evening European time
<steveb> ok
<steveb> is cvs usable?
<psu> not sure
<psu> there is a lot of active development
<psu> so it tends to get broken with regularity
<psu> best bet is probably to download the 0.1.1 official release off the website
<psu> which OS are you using?
<steveb> linux
<psu> The .tar.gz files are there
<psu> we don't have working debs or rpms at the moment 
<psu> so you will need to resolve dependancies by hand
<psu> main one is that GNUe needs python 2.x
<psu> which is not AFAIK current version in stable debian or redhat
<steveb> i have python2.1
<psu> cool ;-)
<psu> have you ever had python 1.5.2 on the system?
<psu> as I know some people have had problems with getting the 
<psu> 2.x version to take priority
<steveb> yes, i have both. i should be able to figure it out
<psu> this was such a common problem that there is a script somewhere
<psu> that does a python test on your system and tells you how many pythons you have ;-)
<psu> and what to do about it
<psu> jcater is the man to speak to if you need it.
<steveb> ta. now i'm *really* going to work
<psu> ok.

<jasomja> hello
<dneighbo> hi jasomja 
<dneighbo> Arturas we are trying to collect what is most pressing for you to start digging into
<dneighbo> you have the tools installed correct?
<dneighbo> if so have you created any database applications (or tried the samples)?
<dneighbo> if not we should have you do that
<Arturas> I installed all the snapshot except geas and there were no errors
<dneighbo> then we have some action items that need work
<Arturas> yes
<dneighbo> specifically we think you could help a lot with internationalization
<Arturas> ok
<dneighbo> i think we have an uncommitted patch
<Arturas> what is uncomminted?
<dneighbo> but if you could do some testing 
<Arturas> what is uncommitted?
<dneighbo> jamest: will have to speak on that, i dont have the patch
<jamest> it's a patch that allows for unicode in forms IIRC
<jamest> reading/speaking only one language makes it impossible for me to properly test it
<jamest> :)
<jamest> however
<Arturas> ok
<jamest> i18n everywhere in GNUe would be a good thing
<Arturas> ?
<Arturas> what is that i18n??
<Yurik> Artas internationalization
<Yurik> Arturas internationalization
<Arturas> internationalization=locale ?
<jamest> yes
<jamest> i noticed from the logs yesterday that you know a few different languages
<Arturas> yes
<Arturas> it's interesting to learn them and search for differences :)

<jamest> however mainly python now
<Arturas> impressing
<jamest> not really
<jamest> just old :)
<Arturas> :)
<jamest> does i18n seem interesting?
<jamest> as we've got lots to do :)
<Arturas> yes, why not
<Arturas> what exactly will i have to do?
<jamest> well
<jamest> take the existing tools 
<jamest> and make with work w/ unicode and/or localization features
<jamest> so that you could write a form in russian
<jamest> have the menus and such appear in russian
<jamest> store russian in the backend
<jamest> it's as much a design job as a coding job
<jamest> as we can do some of this now
<jamest> it's just doing it correctly that needs attention :)
<Arturas> ok
<Arturas> i will be only one who takes care of it?
<jamest> well
<jamest> we're all working in the code
<jamest> and others could step up to help
<jamest> but I imagine you'd be the primary person
<Arturas> ok then :)
<jamest> however
<jamest> if this sounds sucky
<Arturas> :o|
<jamest> then we can find something else
<Arturas> i will do my best
<Arturas> i have a question (problem?)
<Arturas> i installed forms
<jamest> that is a problem :)
<Arturas> they had to be in /usr/local/gnue/forms
<Arturas> in /usr/local/gnue there are doc, etc
<Arturas> but there seem to be no catalog 'forms'
<Arturas> i repeated the installation
<Arturas> there were no errors again
<Arturas> but it told that files 'cannot be copied because they allready exist'
<jamest> that is fine
<Arturas> ???
<jamest> we don't install sample forms
<jamest> you're commands are gfclient
<jamest> gfdesigner
<jamest> your
<jamest> not you're :)
<jamest> they are in /usr/local/gnue/bin
<jamest> IIRC
<Arturas> ok
<Arturas> what is IIRC?
<jamest> if i recall correctly
<Arturas> :)
<Arturas> next problem is with GEAS - it doesn't want to install
<Arturas> i run ./autoconfigure
<Arturas> everything is ok

<cslewis> anyone familiar w/ designer on windows?

<Mr_You> whats the question?
<cslewis> does it work? i can't basic things working, but perhaps i'm doing something wrong
<Mr_You> are you using the latest build?
<cslewis> yes, the latest binary for windows
<Mr_You> update connections.conf
<cslewis> update it to what? i editted and added my own data source (?)
Nick change: tomte -> tomte_away
<Mr_You> cslewis: ok, thats about all I know right now ;-)  is the DB connection working?  i tink the wizard should work now, but not so sure
<psu> cslewis: what database are you working with?
<psu> the wizard doesn't work with all of them yet
<Mr_You> I see
<psu> as it doesn't know how to ask for lists of tables and fields 
<psu> from some obscure databases (like IBM DB2 ;-)
<cslewis> using pypgsql. docs say the wizard works with it. i am able to connect but nothing else
<cslewis> file -> new -> from wizard: brings up a blank window
<Mr_You> what DB?
<Mr_You> oh postgres
<cslewis> right, postgres
<Mr_You> I was wondering about that myself.. what driver is used to connect to postgres from windows?
Action: psu remembers an obscure bug, but thought it had been fixed
<dneighbo> hey
<Mr_You> I think I'll dive into this myself today
<psu> the postgres drivers try to connect using your windows username & pw
<dneighbo> first off wizard works with dbw now :)
<psu> *not* the one defined in connections.conf
<Mr_You> what is dbw?
<dneighbo> s/db2/dbw
<cslewis> the schema navigator shows my table but nothing else seems to work. for ex, should i be able to edit entries in the property inspector?
<dneighbo> i have ugly log
<dneighbo> can we start by restating some of the knowns?
<dneighbo> this machine is too slow to go read logs
<cslewis> dneighbo: knowns relating to my issue or something else?
<dneighbo> yes your issue
<cslewis> me: newbie, platform: windows, code: latest build, driver: pyPgSQL. i cant get designer to do anything useful. it connects to the database and shows it in the schema but everything else fails.
<dneighbo> i abuse designer regularly on windows sometimes even :)
<dneighbo> ok define latest build?
<cslewis> GNUe-Designer-03-feb-2002.exe          03-Feb-2002 11:48   3.9M 
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> let me grab and try here
<dneighbo> make sure its not instant bug :)
<dneighbo> there is lots of work going on so its tough to tell if the nightlies are toast or not
<cslewis> it may be operator error :) i'm trying to do a simple test of the system
<cslewis> i'm stumbling around blindly and most everything i do throws exceptions
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> you have forms and common installed?
<dneighbo> if so from where?
<dneighbo> i dont see builds for those
<cslewis> forms yes. i didn't see common so i assumed it was included in one of the above
<dneighbo> correct its included
<dneighbo> where did you get forms
<cslewis>  GNUe-Forms-snapshot-12-feb-2002.exe    12-Feb-2002 08:51   4.9M 
<dneighbo> hmm this could be the problem
<cslewis> should i try the jan 29 version of both?
<dneighbo> as designer and forms sometimes need to be in sync
<dneighbo> as i assume forms installs the common
<dneighbo> and designer uses common
<dneighbo> so if you have new designer with older common this could be some issue
<dneighbo> yes try same version of both
<dneighbo> let me know what happens then
<cslewis> ok, i'll uninstall and start over. thx for the help.
<cslewis> ok
<dneighbo> i.e. just uninstall designer (from the start/programs)
<dneighbo> er nevermind i guess you have to uninstall both
<dneighbo> to get proper versions
<dneighbo> it should leave your conf files and things though
<cslewis> d/l'ing now...
<jcater> actually, I don't know if our uninstall will leave the conf files
<jcater> jamest noticed this just recently
<dneighbo> jcater: i was just starting to think the same thing :)
<dneighbo> as i just uninstalled my version 
<dneighbo> adn it appears to have eaten them :)
<cslewis> same here
<dneighbo> cslewis: hopefully you didnt make a ton of connection.conf entries :(
Action: dneighbo is sorry, i could swear at one time it didnt eat them
<cslewis> no. its easy to recreate
<dneighbo> cslewis while you are waiting for that mind me asking how you heard about gnue? and what you plan to use it for?
Action: dneighbo is curious like that :)
<cslewis> originally on slashdot, i think. then yesterday searched for info on wxpython.
<cslewis> i want to rewrite a customer/order db. my plan was to use wxpython/python/postgres and do a 3-tier design
<dneighbo> slashdot? wow, not as a main story i suspect
<dneighbo> cslewis nah you want to use gnue :)
<dneighbo> much more simple
<cslewis> then i found gnue
<cslewis> :)
<cslewis> but i understand its 2-tier at the moment
<dneighbo> i promise designer works 
<dneighbo> yes currently it is
<dneighbo> but soon will be n-tier
<dneighbo> we have app server but its getting some over hauling to it
<dneighbo> i think you would find 2 tier would probably work ok for you (unless its already a huge installment)
<dneighbo> until we have n tier ready
<dneighbo> adn then all your forms should be able to stay the same (ie. dont have to rewrite them)
<jcater> well, depends on how you define 2-tier
<jcater> in the sense of remote methods
<jcater> we are only 2-tier
<jcater> at the moment
<jcater> but in the sense of connection proxying, etc
<cslewis> ok i got the older matching versions installed. can somebody hold my hand through a 'hello world' type of thing?
<jcater> we do support some middleware
<jcater> i.e., odbc, etc
<jcater> bbias
<cslewis> my main goal is to have the business logic in python objects
<cslewis> dneighbo: designer seems to be acting the same. i can't do much of anything with it.
<jamest> cslewis: what is wrong?
<cslewis> just trying to test out designer. i can connect to my database, but nothing else.
<cslewis> the wizard window is blank.
<jamest> :(
<cslewis> most other actions throw exceptions
<jamest> is this the release?
<jamest> or a snapshot?
<cslewis> using: windows, jan 29 build of designer and forms, pypgsql
<cslewis> could be operator error?
<cslewis> for instance: i add a button to page. double click the button. the property inspector opens. should i be able to edit properties here?
<cslewis> also: if i save a form and try to execute it, i see several windows open briefly then disappear.
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> this isn't right (obviously)
<jamest> we really need to do a new release
<jamest> from memory
<jamest> the last win32 release (0.1.1) had login issues with postgresql when windows username didn't match db username
<cslewis> would that prevent me from doing a non-db related form?
<jamest> the matching snapshots after that were quick bundles of the current cvs tree
<jamest> no it should not
<jamest> cslewis: where are you located
<cslewis> new mexico
<jamest> as I'll be home in < 4 hours
<jamest> and could whip up some new snapshots
<jamest> of forms and designer
<cslewis> i should be getting to work in about 4 hrs. i'll be there for 2-3 hours
<jamest> ah
<cslewis> will you put them on the website or somewhere else?
<jamest> i will put them on the website
<jamest> but
<jamest> if you give me your email
<jamest> i'll send you the URL to them the moment they are done
<cslewis> excellent. i'll check there. i'll also try to synch up the usernames and see if that changes them

<jamest> sigh
<jamest> this was a bug in cvs
<jamest> that we squashed this week IIRC
<cslewis> ok, i'll wait for the new build
<jamest> i didn't think it was in the last snapshot
<jamest> but w/ designer
<jamest> you get basic stuff out of the box
<cslewis> i'm excited to see it in action. i hope i can use it on my project
<jamest> i do too
<jamest> :)
<jamest> i think you'll find the cvs stuff a lot nicer anyway
Action: jamest would love to release
<jamest> but we're still testing
<cslewis> well i'll be using on both win & unix.
<cslewis> but i'm kind of a unix desktop weenie and i don't yet have a working x server
<cslewis> what compiler do you use to compile the windows version?
<jamest> it's all in python
<jamest> we use mcmillian installer to create an image of the python install on our machine
<jamest> then inno to create the setup.exe
<cslewis> oh, is it only geas that's in c?
<jamest> yes
<jamest> on the forms/designer side of things
<jamest> we're doing python 
<jamest> then if we find performance issue
<jamest> that can't be fixed via cleanup or design
<jamest> we'll recode that piece in C
<jamest> hasn't happened yet though :)

<chillywilly> I bet that first response was fitzix's ;)
<chillywilly> I can tell
<psu> the logical work-around is to relocate servers to outside US
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> this stuff makes me damn sick man
<chillywilly> anyone who uses the DMCA to beat ppl down with deserves to be boycotted
<psu> but of course, no-one has ever told Congress that they don't control the internet outsid the USA
<chillywilly> dude, I don't even see how it is a DMCA violation
<chillywilly> it does break the copy protection it just doesn't enforce it
<chillywilly> even if they had a pirated copy installed wtf does that have to do with the server?
<psu> bnetd could always call their bluff
<chillywilly> it would've been pirated long before they hooked up to the server
<psu> & ask for access to their CD key database
<chillywilly> hehe
<psu> & refuse connections from pirated/multiple CDs
<psu> s/pirat*/'pirat*'
<psu> since copying a non-free CD, whilst morally indefensible
<psu> isn;t in the same league as real piracy
<chillywilly> well, ppl should just take the high road and use Free software :)
<chillywilly> this is more admirable, imho
<psu> chillywilly: I've read a lot about SOAP
<chillywilly> this sheds some light on my stance on games though
<chillywilly> oh?
<psu> would you regard it as a standard or a proprietary tech
<psu> ?
<chillywilly> dunno
<chillywilly> it is a W3C standard
<psu> or a java-style proprietary standard
<psu> oh OK
<chillywilly> (which so far is free)
<chillywilly> in both senes of the word
<chillywilly> er, senses
<chillywilly> heh, someone says that Diablo is based on rogue and hack
<psu> UK govt is likely to make it mandatory for use in public sector systems
<chillywilly> maybe even nethack
<chillywilly> that is sorta lame
<psu> if it was, like, dotNet, I would whinge
<nickr> thats sort of like saying windows is based on macintosh
<psu> they are already hardcore on products that support XML
<chillywilly> nickr: well I haven't played ,uch of any of those games
<chillywilly> er, much
<nickr> I'w never played diablo, but I heard good things about it from fans.
<chillywilly> psu: well I suppose it is ok, but it could be abused
<nickr> I agree with the post that says ID software's model is good
<nickr> they have a huge good reputation
<chillywilly> ID is cool
<chillywilly> they have a nice balance
<chillywilly> psu: what if someone wanted to use CORBA?
<nickr> I want to use corba
<chillywilly> what if someone comes up with something better?
<psu> chillywilly: theoretically, these standards are mandatory
<psu> i.e. govt agencies can't buy anything non-compliant
<chillywilly> (or I should say what happens when someone comes up with the next best thing)
<chillywilly> (cause you know they will)
<psu> chillywilly: I guess the standard gets changed - eventually
<psu> they are also very keen on web based applications 
<psu> which will go down well in parts of AZ...
<psu> something like gnue, where you have max flexibility 
<psu> with multi platform and
<psu> db and rpc access all abstracted
<psu> might well end up being the only thing that meets all the requirements

<chillywilly> well this is a nice step
<psu> but at the moment, only one (property db) has been defined 
<chillywilly> however, do they make a case for the license of the software or do they think it will be enough to have a n open standard?
<chillywilly> hrrrm
<chillywilly> you seem to have answered my question already ;)
<psu> there is nothing to stop a proprietary ERP vendor complying with all these "open"/free standards
<psu> in fact, if they ever want to make a govt sale again, they have to.
<psu> but because s/w like gnue thrives on standards
<psu> even uses them natively

<chillywilly> ello
<psu> good evening
<ICJ> read my email concerning privacy laws?
Action: dneighbo is too dumb to read, he can only write
<chillywilly> privacy schmivacy
<psu> ICJ: I don't think it's a major issue, basically just good data protection
<chillywilly> j/k
<psu> the UK has already implemented the directive 
<psu> and the sky hasn't yet fallen
<psu> of course, US data protection laws are much weaker
<psu> hence the need for "safe harbour" provisions
<psu> for companies wanting to share data from EU to US arms
<ICJ> <psu> ICJ: I don't think it's a major issue, basically just good data protection
<dneighbo> i didnt read it yet
<ICJ> well, the technical thing is the "the user's consent has to be documented"
<dneighbo> but i will say this
<dneighbo> looks as though you are saying Europe is going gungho privacy
<dneighbo> while US is going gungho let corporate intellectuall 'property' override everything
<dneighbo> with addition of 'terrorist' legislation
Action: dneighbo fears soon we will see following:
<dneighbo> in Europe its against the law for software to easily get at customer data or transmit
<dneighbo> and
<dneighbo> in US its MANDATORY for software to easily get at customer data and transmist it :)

<psu> <clueless>what would be the implication if I deinstalled exim and had no mta at all</clueless>
<psu> or do I not even want to go there?
<jcater> I don't think that's a big deal
<jcater> if you have a remote machine to do smtp with
<jcater> e.g., an isp
<psu> I think my isp is the only one in uk that tries to deliver mail via both smtp and pop

<nickr> Its not completely stable but it works reasonably well
<psu> i'm not sure exim is even the culprit
<psu> it may be working exactly as I want 
<chillywilly> that's who usually bounces your mail

<perico> Any advice on how to begin will be very wellcome !
<jamest> what are you looking for perico?
<jamest> er, what are your needs?
<perico> well, I'm a freelance programmer and think that GNUe may be perfect for me if I find a way to make it work !
<jamest> ah
<jamest> ok
<jamest> well
<jamest> have you downloaded any code?
<jamest> or the CVS tree?
<perico> Yes, in fact I have just unzip the windows ZIP with everything (not easy to find) and having a look at it.
<perico> What i find quite confusing is the way the different modules interact, ie what do you need to run the thing
<chillywilly> hey jamest, could you do a text export of the forms tech ref for me?
<chillywilly> please  :)

<jamest> so not documented
<jamest> i planned to update the doc prior to release
<chillywilly> a 0.1.2 release?
<jamest> perico: common is the core of the other apps
<jamest> it gives you db access, app framework, etc
<jamest> forms is our end user UI client
<jamest> deisgner builds the xml based .gfd files that forms runs
<jamest> chillywilly: maybe a 0.3.0 release
<jamest> a lot has changed
<chillywilly> ooooh
<chillywilly> true
<perico> just a quick question, is the system development statutus? I mean, is it under strong development or usable?
<jamest> so
<jamest> the system is usable and is in use in a few places
<chillywilly> jamest: so using 0.1.1 would be the best bet for a stable system this time around?
<jamest> no
<chillywilly> how long off is the release?

<jamest> sigh
Action: jamest is now depressed
<chillywilly> don't be
<jamest> 0.1.1 is lacking alot compared to cvs
<jamest> however cvs took some serious abuse over the last few weeks
<chillywilly> well I am going to play with cvs then ;)
<jamest> so she's stable but not well tested
<chillywilly> hrrrm
<chillywilly> okey dokey
<chillywilly> I need to get postgres going once again
Nick change: dnSleep -> derek
<perico> well, thanks for helping, I'll better take a closer look. I'll be  back !
<jamest> perico: how heavy the devel is depends on the workloag
<jamest> workload
<jamest> but
<jamest> cvs should work most the time
<jamest> or get fixed quickly
<jamest> as I need to working at work :)
<jamest> to = it
<chillywilly> :)
<jamest> a few of us are in that boat
<jamest> so we don't break cvs intentionally 
<jamest> (very often :)
<chillywilly> well I was talking to my mom and they are a small firm that needs some nice software
<jamest> nice software....damn......think they'd settle for GNUe?
<chillywilly> sure
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> anything is better than nothing
Action: derek is back (gone 71:15:43)
<chillywilly> (which is what they have)
<derek> man all that sleep i was gone nearly 3 days :)
perico (perico@213-98-201-180.uc.nombres.ttd.es) left irc: 
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> you were in hybernation
<jcater> yeah
<chillywilly> jamest: is the lyx version current?
<jcater> too much pizza and dots will do that to ya
<derek> hey now, it was the donuts that did me in dood
<jamest> chillywilly: no
<chillywilly> ah well
<jamest> you've got the lyx version freshly converted
<chillywilly> is that text one you extracted form cvs though?
<chillywilly> ah
<chillywilly> ok
<jamest> yes
<chillywilly> groovy
<jamest> didn't check it though for accuracy
<jamest> figured you'd yell if something didn't work
<jamest> :)
<chillywilly> no problem
<derek> i need to get some foad ;9
<derek> brb
<chillywilly> anyone know where I can find something that explains better what the diff is between an inner and outer join?
<derek> right here
<chillywilly> the one postgres guide I was reading was damn confusing
<derek> an inner join only includes rows where BOTH tables are the same
<derek> and outer join includes all of either the left or right table and only the matching of the other
<chillywilly> jcater: and you say OO crap ius confusing...I think relational calculus is also damn confusing
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> you got an example?
<jcater> old skool people don't use inner/outer joins :)
<chillywilly> hehe
Action: jcater is old skool sql
<chillywilly> I thought that was the power of sql
<chillywilly> joins and shit
<chillywilly> btw, nice topic ;)
Action: chillywilly knows how to use select and all those goodies
<jcater> we'll have you thinking relationally soo 
<jcater> soon
<jcater> mwahahahaha
<chillywilly> nothing wrong with relational
<chillywilly> just it's not as extensible as inheritance ;P
<jcater> different tools for different needs
<chillywilly> sure
Action: jcater likes to program w/objects
<jcater> but would never want to store my large-scale database as objects
<chillywilly> no object to relational mapper?
<chillywilly> so you would never use geas if it became usable?
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> um
<jcater> at ncs
<jcater> probably not
<jcater> for a new venture
<jcater> possibly
<chillywilly> you don't want to spend the time redesigning as objects?
<chillywilly> is that why?
<chillywilly> or you think performance would suck
<jcater> um
<jcater> a mixture of both
<chillywilly> don't fix it if it ain't broke
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> largely, it has to do with maintenance and expandability
<jcater> and I know that's supposed to be the argument w/objects
<chillywilly> uhuh
<jcater> but long-term, I haven't seen an object schema that stands the test of time
<jcater> but then again, I'm used to thinking relationally :)

<derek> dinner time bbs
<jcater> ooooo.... it's fun with joins!
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<jcater> come back tomorrow for "Fun with Unions!"
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> can you do a union in sql?
<jcater> yes
<chillywilly> I guess any set operations right
<chillywilly> as that
<chillywilly> s the basis
<chillywilly> you have a set with relations, iirc
<jcater> purdy much
<derek> jcater: i dont do unions :)
<jcater> a select returns a "set"
<jcater> so the union of set 1 with set 2 is
<derek> btw: im assuming my samples were correct its been a while
<jcater> select column from table1 UNION select column from table2
Action: chillywilly sings "ir's been a while"
<chillywilly> er, it's
<chillywilly> sorry, you started it
<chillywilly> a uniojn gives you waht is common in the sets right?
Action: chillywilly tries to remember some math
<jcater> no
<chillywilly> doh
<jcater> union is a distint join 
<jcater> intersect is the common stuff
<jcater> minus is what's in #1 and not in #2
Action: jcater uses oracle's flavor of unions
<jcater> I'm not sure if their union keywords are SQL92
<chillywilly> ah
<chillywilly> maybe I should read that papaer again once
<chillywilly> but when they start doing set notation my brain just turns off ;)
<chillywilly> I hate when they get all theoretical with the notation
<chillywilly> it's worse than calculus
<chillywilly> well, if I were to write a GNUe solution today I would probably go with a 2-tier forms silution anyway as geas is lacking too much for my tastes
<jcater> one of the biggest lackings in geas is the ability to contruct complex conditions
<jcater> we hit that roadblock pretty hard w/the forms driver
<chillywilly> you mean mutiple ands?
<jcater> multiple/nested
<chillywilly> with nots and junk?
<chillywilly> desc
<chillywilly> what's a nested condition look like?
<chillywilly> er, nevermind
<chillywilly> you mena like a condition that uses another condition inside it right?
<jcater> (salary > 40000 and office = 2) or title = 'Manager'
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> I got it ;)
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> sorry
<nickr> sweet, netbsd boots
<chillywilly> infidel
Action: jcater has been meaning to do netbsd on my DreamCast
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> grooovy
<nickr> jcater: debian on DC
<chillywilly> but will you be able to play games on it if you do thayt jcater?
<jcater> debian runs on DC?
<nickr> yea
<jcater> dude
<jcater> really?
<nickr> I'm fairly sure
<nickr> I think i have a link
<chillywilly> doesn't that turn it into another computer then?
<chillywilly> instead of a game console
Action: jcater wants to do some embedded/consumer level stuff
<nickr> jcater: http://www.m17n.org/linux-sh/dreamcast/
<jcater> and wanted to play w/DC
<chillywilly> mmmm
<chillywilly> embedded
<chillywilly> you need to get GNUe running on DC
<chillywilly> hehe ;)
<chillywilly> we don't believe in playing
<chillywilly> just do some data entry dagnabit
<jcater> actually
<jcater> that is one of my goals
<chillywilly> rofl
<chillywilly> casn I do data entry with my game controller?
<jcater> yes
<chillywilly> lol
<jcater> to prove a point :)
<nickr> My friend wanted to replace all the workstations in the company with DCs cause they are cheaper than PCs
<jcater> all you need is X running
<chillywilly> that's funny
<jcater> and you could do diskless-style network
<jamest> $20 keyboard, $60 DC
<chillywilly> you are evil man
<jamest> and a TV
<nickr> live CD
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> that would be pretty cheap
<nickr> use NFS for the homedirs
<nickr> Mmm, Its gonna be seeet to have a unixlike on this hpc
<nickr> it has a full kb
<nickr> it'll be a nice wireless workstation
<chillywilly> in relational jargon what's a tuple?
<chillywilly> nevermind
<derek> thats not a relational term
<derek> persay but rather a programming one
<jamest> i need people to stress test cvs
<derek> jamest i can do that in a few
<jamest> please
Action: jcater jumps up and down on cvs
Action: jcater grabs his hammer, torch, and safety glasses
<jamest> no goats?
<chillywilly> derek: yes it is
<chillywilly> derek: it's part of the relational model dawg
<chillywilly> I read it in the postgresql tutorial
<jamest> ah
<derek> um postgres uses jacked up language to a degree :)
<jamest> in postgresql's terms
<jamest> it is a record
<jcater> chillywilly: this buds for you
<derek> most SQL folks call it a result or record set
<chillywilly> yea, I dun figured that out
<jcater> http://www.chimu.com/publications/objectRelational/
<chillywilly> jcater: thanks dude
<derek> and then the it's a 'row' or a 'record' ;)
<chillywilly> derek: yes and so does postgres, but this crap in the tutorial is the theoretical methematical stuff, uses set notation and subscripts
<chillywilly> they even say that a row == tuple at a different point, but i forgot what it said a tuple was and I got unlazy and went back and looked
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> and...
[20:45] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<chillywilly> too many friggin ands
<chillywilly> this and is and not and a and run and on and sentence
<dsmith> I liked the unlazy part
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> if !lazy:
<chillywilly>   rtfm()
Action: chillywilly is not sure '!' is valid python syntax
<chillywilly> any takers?
<chillywilly> did I get it right?
<chillywilly> ok, their outer join example makes sense I think
<jcater> if not lazy: 
<jcater>   rtfm()
<chillywilly> doh!
<dsmith> Anyone here know modems well?
<chillywilly> bah, this is loopy
<jamest> not well, i just have to use them 
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> this is fucking with my head
<chillywilly> a cross join
<chillywilly> inner join on true
<chillywilly> does anybody use this shit?
<jamest> i dont
<jamest> i use where clauses
<jamest> i'm oldskool
<chillywilly> hehe
<dsmith> I had a wierd query I couldn't figure out. (note I am *NO* sql wizard!)
<dsmith> Maybe you guys could help.
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<chillywilly> [20:52:47] * crazymike beats chillywilly with the smoke pole
<dsmith> There are about 3 or 4 (maybe 5) tables. One col in each table has the thing (it's a tape lable, as in backup tapes)
<dsmith> I needed a list of all lables, and which tables they were in.
Action: dsmith scrolls back to look at the join example
<chillywilly> hrrrm
<jcater> select 'mytablename', labelfield from table1 where type = 'label' UNION
<chillywilly> union?
<jcater> select 'mytablename', labelfield from table2 where type = 'label' UNION
<jcater> select 'mytablename3', labelfield from table3 where type = 'label' UNION
<chillywilly> I thought those were outlawed by da masta?
<jcater> ...
<jcater> no
<jcater> masta said he didn't use them
<dsmith> Hmmm.
<jcater> there's a difference
<jamest> jcater: that only covers the 1st 3 tables.....what about the other 2
Action: jamest runs
<jcater> jamest: I already looked
<jcater> the other 2 tables don't have anything
<dsmith> heh
<jamest> ah ok
<dsmith> Hmm.  I didn't explain very well.
<dsmith> The result should be something like:
Action: dsmith fires up an editor
<dsmith> label  library  offsite scratch stgpool
<dsmith> ---------------------------------------
<dsmith> TAPE01  y       n       n       tapepool
<dsmith> TAPE02  y       n       y       -
<dsmith> TAPE03  n       y       n       copypool
<dsmith> TAPE05  n       y       y       -
<dsmith> The tables are library, offsite, scratch and stgpool
<dsmith> Kinda wierd eh?
<dsmith> I want to get a list of all tapes, and what tables they are in.
<dsmith> Orderd by tape lable
<jcater> does your database support subselects as table names?
<dsmith> It's an embedded db2.  I'm not sure.
<jcater> ah
<jcater> does embedded db2 support views?
<dsmith> In this application, no.
<chillywilly> are those both SQL92 features?
<jcater> hmm
<dsmith> I only have a SELECT.
<jcater> chillywilly: not sure of that's SQL92 otr not to be honest
Action: chillywilly whispers something about GNUe Forms
<dsmith> It's actually part of a backup system. (Tivoli Storage Manager)
<dsmith> Just wondering.
<jcater> can you test an sql statement...
<dsmith> Well, it's not really sql, just a select.
<jcater> select label from (select label from library)
<jcater> I have no idea what embedded db2 supports
<dsmith> Ahh.  sub-select.
<dsmith> This was about 2 years ago I needed this, so I'm kinda cloudy.
<dsmith> Figured it was some kind of a join, but a union sounds interesting.
<jcater> if it supported subselects, then
<jcater> select label, max(library), max(offsite), max(scratch), max(stgpool) from
<jcater> (
<jcater> select label, 'y' as library, 'n' as offsite,'n' as scratch, '-' as stgpool from library
<jcater> UNION
<jcater> select label, 'n' as library, 'y' as offsite,'n' as scratch, '-' as stgpool from offsite
<jcater> UNION
<jcater> select label, 'n' as library, 'n' as offsite,'y' as scratch, '-' as stgpool from scratch
<jcater> UNION
<jcater> select label, 'n' as library, 'n' as offsite,'n' as scratch, stgpool as stgpool from stgpool
<jcater> )
<jcater> group by label
<jcater> is what you could do
<jcater> if it supported views
chillywilly_ (~danielb@d45.as10.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> then the subselect could be replaced with a view

<neilt> derek:  whats you dads email?
<derek> sneigh@carefree.com
<neilt> thanks,
<neilt> i have modified the drawing i did and put it on the web site.
<neilt> based on your comments
<derek> btw: i think we just had minor communication lapse not real disagreement about workflow :)
<derek> i.e. i think we both agree it shouldnt be in the geas server (i.e. one in the same)
<derek> and we both agree we need to be aware of it and talk about it during talks of geas
<neilt> correct, the drawing was wrong
<neilt> I dont want to design the workflow server
<neilt> right now
<neilt> I want to allow for it and have a general understanding of where it fits
<derek> i was just trying state that (like) security i dont want to get too far into a tangent that we lose sight of geas :)
<derek> cool
<derek> i agree 100% on that :)
<neilt> do you have time to take a look at the new drawing and see if it raises new questions
<neilt> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=NS-My_eGallery&file=index&do=showpic&pid=31
<neilt> actually the workflow server will drive some requirements for the object server we do need to understand how those requirements will be met so that object server does not have to be re-architected again.

<Yurik> chillywilly: btw, seems that you've slightly mistaked speaking about E/AS 7th February:
<Yurik> <chillywilly> problem with those is they just wrote the apps and not a framework that can be extended to write any sort of enterprise application
<Yurik> <chillywilly> different striokes for different folks
<Yurik> but E/AS IS a framework :-)
<psu> I suppose any free/"open source" ERP must be at least in part a framework
<psu> as you can never stop people going off and extending it 
<Yurik> yeah, but to allow them doing that better framework should be good, eh? :)
<psu> as I've gone on (and on...) before, ERP is probably the best single example of why free software is important
<jcater> I am soooo mad right now
<jcater> just went to DirecTV.com
Action: psu calms down jcater
<jcater> (which I subscribe too)
<jcater> and I can't view the damn page without Flash installed
<jcater> not a part of their site
<jcater> BUT THE ENTIRE SITE
Action: psu is getting mad on jcater's behalf
<psu> I mean, a naff Flash intro with a "skip" button is fair enough
<psu> gotta keep the suits in marketing happy
<jcater> damn
<jcater> it's horrible
<jcater> I ran to a windows machine to view their site
<jcater> and they use flash even for the text
<jcater> it flickers
<jcater> reminds me of an old CGA video card/monitor
<psu> ring 'em up, claim to be epileptic and cite the Americans with Disabilities Act at them ;-)
<jcater> ooooooo
<jcater> that's a fine idea
Action: jcater is gonna do that

<derek> rofl
<derek> jan:  you have assignment done?
Action: chillywilly just learned "unde the bridge" by the chili peppers on his guitar
<derek> if so send patch to common to info@gnue.org
<derek> and we will get it in cvs
<derek> so others can play/test and generally beat things up
<derek> chillywilly: rock
<derek> i learned the intro to POD Southtown other night
<derek> very very easy
<chillywilly> you want to tab?
Action: chillywilly sshes it to goats for the heck of it
<psu> CTRL-H
<chillywilly> er, scps
<chillywilly> http://goats.gnue.org/~chillywilly/underthebridge.html
<psu> Anyone recommend a good mail reader for Debian GNU/Linux?
<psu> main requirements are
<chillywilly> mutt
<jan> derek: assignment is on the snail mail way. I haven't got any email back
<Yurik> VM
<psu> X pref but not absolutely essential
<jcater> psu: sylpheed
<psu> outlook look and feel a minus ;-)
<jcater> http://sylpheed.good-day.net/
<Yurik> Emacs VM rules
<psu> main issue is being able to route multiple 
<jcater> it's apt-get'table too
<psu> names for same domain to different folders
<psu> but readable from the same login 
<chillywilly> derek: can you handle the intro?
<chillywilly> ;)
<psu> if you see what I mean
<chillywilly> there's a capo and non-capo versioj
<derek> yes sylpheed this is my main bain about not having a debian box :)
<chillywilly> er, version
<derek> i want sylphee
<derek> d
<derek> though in sid its called something different
<derek> like claws
<jcater> it'll run on practically any posix
<jcater> no
<chillywilly> balsa is nice too
<jcater> don't grab claws
<jcater> those are 2 diff versions
<derek> no balsa sucks
<Yurik> evolution?
<derek> imho
<derek> evolution sucks imho
<chillywilly> when's the last time you tried it derek?
<derek> chilly its been a while...
<jcater> sylpheed supports multiple IMAP servers, too... which non of the others do reliably!
<derek> re: staind (sic)
<chillywilly> derek: anyone you gonna snarf  that tablature or what?
<derek> maybe i already did
<chillywilly> I wanna hear a recording of you playing the intro by tonight ;)
<chillywilly> I should figure out how to record my freakin' guitar on my computer
<chillywilly> I suppose  could go off of my amp and into my sound card and use gstreamer or something
<derek> yeah right
<derek> to me knowing it any time soon
<derek> too many difficult parts
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> finger pick it dude
<derek> i only have been playing since christmas
<chillywilly> well
<chillywilly> part I is easy
<chillywilly> after the intro
<chillywilly> just some bar cords
<chillywilly> and it is pretty slow tempo
<derek> um
<derek> on is the intro finger picked or strummed?
<derek> i dont see where it states or if strummed what strings are open
<chillywilly> well you can use a pick and a finger
<chillywilly> there's a few parts where you pluck 2 strings at once
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise.
<derek> only thing about POD i dont like is they drop tune to a D
<chillywilly> I suppose I would need a 1/4" to 1/8" adapter to plug into the sound card...
<derek> since i cant tune by ear its a pain in the but for me :)
<chillywilly> ;)
<derek> e:---------------------|

<derek> A:-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-|
<derek> D:---------3---------0-|
<derek> is POD intro
<derek> note E droped to a D
<derek> and the 0 3 and 0 0 are played 12 times not once
<derek> i just condensed for the paste
<derek> thing i like about it is that it makes for a good intro to songs in general :)
<derek> i.e. filler before you let it rip :)
<derek> must go see accountant be back late

<fitzix> hey Dan, how are ya? :)
<chillywilly> I'm doing alright
<chillywilly> and yourself?
<fitzix> cool - just taking care of some loose ends before I jump into business work
<chillywilly> you developing a bidness plan?
<chillywilly> a found a good resource: http://allbusiness.com
<fitzix> Not at the moment... I've put it on hold while I clear my plate of loose work...
<chillywilly> ok...
<fitzix> neat site... I'll have to check it out more thoroughly when I get a shot
<fitzix> yeah - you can't be encumbered by random things when you jump into something like that

<dtm> hi all
<fitzix> hey dtm, how are ya?
<dtm> fitzix: o-tay 
<dtm> fitzix: what kind of business work are you doing
<chillywilly> sup dawg
<chillywilly> actually, I retract my statemwent as dtm was the one who pointed me to http://allbusiness.com
<fitzix> dtm: Well, over some time I'm starting a company providing specifically Free Software services.  Starting with, I think, providing custom distributions to people for a fee.
<chillywilly> just wanted to clarify that for the record
<chillywilly> ;)
<dtm> chillywilly: well yeah but you did therefore find it  :)  not by means independant of any one other individual, but still a find.  ;)
Action: dtm recredits chillywilly
<dtm> lol
Action: fitzix clarifies the record by removing the obfuscation that is chillywilly from it.
<chillywilly> hey now
<dtm> haha
<chillywilly> Linux obfuscation 2.4.17-xfs #1 Thu Feb 14 00:54:55 CST 2002 i686 unknown
<chillywilly> you can never remove 'obfuscation' form me!
<chillywilly> er, from
<chillywilly> I'll never part wiht her!
<fitzix> chillywilly: Quite true!  It's better just to remove you outright! :)
<dtm>  /exec -o sudo /sbin/hostname foobar
<dtm> so fitzix, custom distros of what?  to who
<chillywilly> no respect I tell ya
<chillywilly> I get no respect
<chillywilly> ;P
Action: dtm gives chillywilly some rizpeck
<chillywilly> hehe
<dtm> alksdjf
<chillywilly> xl;dkngalsknjg
<dtm> @(#%_)
<chillywilly> %^*&^RI
<dtm> :-P
<fitzix> dtm: Well, it's an idea that I've been hatching in my head for a little bit.  The business was originally an extension of DotGNU, but then we decided to differentiate it a bit so that we could make some unencumbered funds...
<fitzix> dtm: Custom GNU/Linux distributions
<dtm> fitzix: huh.
<chillywilly> 8-P
<dtm> fitzix: so what type of target would prefer customized distros
<fitzix> dtm: I'm thinking $100 -- arch optimized
<chillywilly> e-gov right ;)
<chillywilly> haha
<chillywilly> dude why does friggin setup.py devel work for common?
<fitzix> Enthusiasts, businesses who want performance from optimization for the arch, and from organizations that need specific packages in their install and tailored installation routines
<dtm> fitzix: ahh
<fitzix> Plus, it's something that I have some experience with... building GNU/Linux systems from scratch
<chillywilly> er, doesn't it work
<fitzix> I only see it as a method of achieving seed money
Action: chillywilly pokes jcater
<chillywilly> help me o python masta
<jcater> wa?
<chillywilly> dude how do I install common from cvs
<fitzix> innexpensive work... low yield, but also generally low attention and can be created and mass-produced in parallel
<dtm> fitzix: well i could interrogate you on the rest of your business planbut i was just curious :)
<dtm> fitzix: sounds interesting
<jcater> cd gnue/common; python setup.py install
<jcater> or was this for a devel version?
<chillywilly> well I wanted to do a devel install if that thing still exists
<jcater> ah
<jcater> in gnue/, run ./setup-cvs.sh
<jcater> or is it .py
<jcater> I forget
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> it'll set up all the client tools
<fitzix> dtm: thanks. :)  Once this gets some seed money (I'm still working through it a bit) I intend to do corporate consulting for GNU/Linux conversions...
<chillywilly> it's .py
<dtm> fitzix: cool   well i advocate having a complete business plan asap :) allbusiness.com has great starter info on that and templates
<fitzix> not just consulting myself out, but also starting a consulting company to fill the roles
<fitzix> dtm: I agree. :)  can't get anywhere if you don't know where you're going! :)
<chillywilly> oooh, I get to choose which python I use
<chillywilly> why are 2 of them listed twice?
<fitzix> dtm: those templates and the starter information could be very very useful.  Thank you. :) 
<dtm> yessah
<dtm> fitzix: the most useful one to start with is why you should have a business plan, and all the ways yo'ull  probably fail without one  ;)  heheheh
<dtm> and the reams of testimonials to that effect
<fitzix> I can think of some reasons offhand: lack of focus being the first
<fitzix> also, lack of coherent thinking through on your revenue potential in that market
<fitzix> The business plan gives you a unique chance to think through and reality check your ideas
<fitzix> to some extent, anyway
<dtm> yeah and present them to others
<chillywilly> cool, this script is nice
<dtm> like investors
<chillywilly> employees
<chillywilly> clients
<fitzix> dtm: I'm not looking for venture capital particularly, but you can't even get an angel investor to give any seed money without a bizplan
<fitzix> chillywilly: absolutely
<dtm> fitzix: yeah, for good reason :)
<chillywilly> jcater: ok, how do you install the others?
<dtm> fitzix: investment should be a last resort
<fitzix> dtm: Absolutely :)
<chillywilly> using this 'cvs' method here
<jcater> chillywilly: that installed all the client tools
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> duh
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> in ~/bin
Action: jcater is lazy and it's reflected in my install methods :)
<chillywilly> :)
<fitzix> Much better to start small and build from there... 
<chillywilly> wtf is grpcdoc?
<chillywilly> doh
<chillywilly> my python2.2 doesn't have wxwindows
<chillywilly> I should've told it to use 2.1
<jcater> just rerun setup-cvs.py with py2.1
<jcater> I wouldn't use 2.2 anyway
<jcater> it has a unicode issue 
<chillywilly> ah yes
<chillywilly>  think reports is b0rked
<chillywilly> danielb@obfuscation:~/bin$ ./grdcvs 
<chillywilly> /usr/bin/python2.1: can't open file '/home/danielb/src/cvs/gnue/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/reports/GRServe.py'
<chillywilly> does reports do anything?
<chillywilly> do grpcdoc takes an xml file and geberates the appropriate interface definition for that transport?
<chillywilly> er, generates
<jcater> chillywilly: not exactly
<jcater> well, in a way
<jcater> not an interface definition, but a text doc detailing the exposed services
<jcater> btw, it doesn't fully work yet :)
<chillywilly> I figured that
<chillywilly> you haven't hacked on it in a while

<chillywilly> you rock jcater

<chillywilly> cool
<fitzix> I have a satelite dish with them... it works well... I don't do DSL that way, though.. I get it through my local telco
<jcater> yeah.. I've had the satellite for 3 or so years
<jcater> and love that service
<jcater> my RoadRunner bill is close to $70 now
<fitzix> damn!
<jcater> and the connection sux
<fitzix> that's pretty nasty
<jcater> well, it's $45
<jcater> but add in the minimum cable tv service required
<jcater> plus LOTS of franchise fees, excise taxes, etc

<fitzix> you guys seen this: http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/02/21/1344204&mode=thread

<fitzix> ?
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> was talking about it yesterday
<fitzix> heh
<chillywilly> cause I saw you paste it and then leave
<fitzix> what do you think of the first talkback?
<chillywilly> I think it smells like Barry
<chillywilly> ;)
<fitzix> hehe
<fitzix> The situation is damned dangerous, though
<chillywilly> ok, I have to find something useful to do here
<chillywilly> ;)
<fitzix> the can of worms this opens up if a court judgement upholds the DMCA on this could be devastating to Free Software and even proprietary competition in the market
<chillywilly> yes, it sucks
<chillywilly> bah, my galeon is frozen
<fitzix> Hell, it could outright destroy any vestige of competition that DOES exist in the market because it would effectively invalidate all interoperability that wasn't expressly allowed
<fitzix> That's DAMNED dangerous
<jbailey> Well.
<jbailey> I don't think that will stick around long, because when american companies start moving out of the US, your government will panic.
<fitzix> XYZ corp doesn't want someone reading their proprietary file format --- just add a reg key to the file and demand that any client that can read it validate it's key... then not release the key db
<fitzix> jbailey: you may be right... I hope so anyway... I'd rather negate the DMCA before thousands are thrown in jail, though :)
<jbailey> fitzix: Yeah.  The US government seems like like its jails full.
<jbailey> I've never quite understood that policy.
<fitzix> jbailey: we've packed them with casualties in an idiotic war called the "war on drugs"...
<fitzix> ever seen the movie "traffic"?
<jbailey> Nope.
<fitzix> Good movie -- I'd suggest seeing it... one line I love in it "It's not a war on drugs, this is a war on people.  On families..."
<jbailey> This past week I made the mistake of watching two movies that weren't recommended to me by other people.  In both cases it was a mistake.
<fitzix> heheh
<fitzix> In america, we tend to believe that you can solve problems by covering them up...
<jbailey> The fact that Bushes actions have *increased* his popularity confirms my suspicions that the avg. US citizen doesn't want to live in a democracy.  They'd prefer to live in a monarchy.
<fitzix> I have little pride in being a citizen of the US
<fitzix> jbailey: Well, the terrorists did something REALLY stupid on Sept. 11th... the USA was about to implode economically and politically... the country was split down the middle on Bush and on other issues... although, I agree with your statement that the American people don't want to live in a democracy...
<fitzix> I graduated with a degree in sociology... 
<fitzix> and needless to say, what we call "democracy" sickens me
<jbailey> Ah, then you have stronger opinions than I do. =)
<jbailey> I'm just an outside observer to the whole process =)
<jbailey> But I lived in NY for 6 months a couple of years ago, and then again this summer for, er.. 2 months or so (was planning on moving there).
<jbailey> And with the other travels, the place just confuses me.
<fitzix> jbailey: Heh - it's very angering... I'm also a bit of a Marxist (sociologically speaking) and my focus in college was stratification.  I usually can't say that I have Marxist beliefs because people look at me like I'm green...
<jbailey> "Marxists.  Aren't those Commies like Russians?" =)  *sigh*
<fitzix> They say "Didn't Marx kill people?" ... Umm.. no... that  was Stalin
<fitzix> hehe - PRECISELY! :)
Action: jcater looks at fitzix like he's green
<jbailey> I don't know the term stratification outside of geology. =)
<chillywilly> splitting of ppl into economic/social classes
<jbailey> Hmm.  My compile seems to like segfaulting now.
<jbailey> Ah, okay.
<jbailey> We don't do that in Canada..  They've already been split! =)
<fitzix> In America, a person who advocates equality of opportunity, general fairness, participation by the people in the matters that affect them, and general equity in society (not necessarily complete equality) is labelled a foolish dreamer and anti-american... ugh
<fitzix> jbailey: lucky... you live in Canada :)
<jbailey> The funny part is, isn't it against the law to be anti-American in the us?
<fitzix> How can we have democracy without general equity?  Is it even possible?
<jcater> fitzix: we live in a democracy???
<jbailey> Sure, you just narrow that whole "demos" portion of democracy. =)
<chillywilly> we live in a republic
Action: jcater thought it was a republic :)
<jbailey> It worked for the greeks. =)
<fitzix> jbailey: Not explicitely, but there are enough laws to make it possible to arrest anyone for almost anything
<jbailey> fitzix: Ah, okay.  I thought I remember that your congress had a forum for un-american activites or something quite vague like that.
<fitzix> republic == the compromise between tyrrany and democracy... historically speaking
<jbailey> It seems almost as silly as the Jerry Springer show.  By the time you get there, something very very bad has happened. =)
Action: jcater loves a quote I saw... "democracy is three wolves and a sheep deciding what's for dinner."
<fitzix> jbailey: HUAC -- House UnAmerican Activities Committee
<chillywilly> gah
<fitzix> jbailey: heheheh
<chillywilly> what does it mean to be american these days?
<fitzix> Frankly, this axis of evil crap is dangerous
<fitzix> What the hell is he doing?
<jcater> chillywilly: you must be a xenophobic, free market, capitalistic, corporation-luvin soul
<fitzix> Does anyone recognize -- North Korea has damned nukes!
<jbailey> raising his popularity by leaps and bounds.
<chillywilly> you value the dollar above anything else and you crush those that get in your way in pursuit of $$$
<fitzix> jbailey: yeah -- but we're pissing off all of our allies and polarizing the world into a damned third world war... 
<jbailey> chillywilly: Capitalism still gives a whole lot of power to the consumers if they choose to use it.
<fitzix> chillywilly: your children will betray you in my name -- Rage Against the Machine
<fitzix> In the end, it's not really about capitalism -vs- socialism
<jbailey> fitzix: (Killing in the name of?)
<fitzix> those are just structures
<fitzix> jbailey: IIRC, Sleep Now in the Fire
<fitzix> to have a good society you need to mix capitalism and socialism
<fitzix> you can never have one or the other
<fitzix> it's not even possible explicitely speaking
<fitzix> not on the low level analysis anyway
<fitzix> This is about people rising up and taking back what is theirs ... taking part in what dictates their actions!
<fitzix> That is a purely communist thing... communism: The negation of the class system, the dissolving of the means of production into ownership and control by the many, not the few
Action: jcater has reached the uneasy conclusion this week that most don't see the need for reform
<jcater> and I don't think education matters
<jcater> it's a matter of their comfort zone
<fitzix> The perversion of capitalist systems left to do for themselves brought great hardship to many and brought GREAT innequality (or expanded it into an institution)...
<jbailey> jcater: I think there's two problems.  The first is that people don't see how their actions can make a different.
<fitzix> jcater: I agree 100%... people are comfortable so they won't do anything
<jbailey> The /fundamental/ principal behind any type of democracy is that it's the responsibility of the individual to act.
<jcater> I've talked with several outside of my typically libertarian group 
<jcater> (including my wife :(  )
<jbailey> And in fact, most people don't really understand how irresposibile it is to not act.
<jcater> this past week and most don't see a problem at all
<jbailey> (Incidentally, part of why I'm a vegan...)
<jcater> even if it's spelled out
<jbailey> The second is that people beleive that the current situation can exist forever.  So why change.
<jcater> jbailey: interesting second point
<jcater> one that I hadn't considered
<fitzix> Yeah... damned interesting.. and I think right on the money (no pun intended)
<jcater> but explains the attitudes I've encountered
<fitzix> I think I can explain why it happens... too
<fitzix> People percieve things linearly... almost in a serial fashion
<fitzix> one thing at a time
<fitzix> for people to be capable of understanding something, they have to take issues one at a time and make certain assumptions
<fitzix> hence, when you throw the monkey wrench of time being dynamic in the system... most people don't have the mental capacity to handle it
<fitzix> it's much easier (and efficient for them) to think of time and condition as static
<fitzix> In other words: they're hiding from reality to ensure that their world stays predictable
<fitzix> and it's futile because the world *IS* unpredictable
<fitzix> make sense?
<jcater> wait? that's more than one concept
<jcater> I can only handle one at a time :)
<jcater> j/k
<fitzix> hehehe
<jcater> ya
<chillywilly> in short, ppl suck
<fitzix> humanity is due for further evolution
<jcater> no, in short, people fear change
<jcater> to they make decisions ignoring the possibility for change
<jcater> why else would their be a republican party in the US?
Action: jcater is not defending the Democrats w/that statement, btw!
<fitzix> If there were a maker, he should just stamp "defective" on our backs and put us back into the damned bin
<chillywilly> ok, you went there so...
<fitzix> jcater: hehe - I jive with the statement regardles
<fitzix> s
<chillywilly> there's a simple solution to this whole problem
<fitzix> reign fire down on the sky?
<fitzix> :)
<chillywilly> put your faith in Jesus
<jcater> the solution: 
<jcater> Vote for JCater in 2004
<fitzix> hehe
<jcater> he'll be the only ballot entry with a smiley beside his name
<fitzix> Overthrow the government and replace it with the FSF
<fitzix> hehhehe
<jcater> um, no
<jbailey> fitzix: I'm not sure that would be the /best/ solution.
<fitzix> j/k
<fitzix> :)
<jbailey> (or even in my top 100...) *g*
<fitzix> Hell no, it wouldn't be... just being satyrical :)
<jbailey> rms for president.  Hmm. 
<jcater> sigh
<jbailey> Well, unlike your current one, he's been to other countries *before* getting elected...
<jcater> rofl
<jcater> but has he received sizable donations from megacorporations?
<fitzix> heheh
<chillywilly> rms for pres!!!!
<chillywilly> weee
<jcater> the day he'll accept $500,000 from M$ given to his political campaign is the day the public will like him
<jbailey> Almost all of the FSF hardware was donated.
<jbailey> Does that count?
<jbailey> And IIRC, he get paid a sizable amount in the 80's to port GCC to Intel's i960.
<fitzix> Hmm...
<fitzix> I have a solution
<jcater> but, the i960 is unamerican
<jbailey> "80% water, 20% salt"
<chillywilly> lemme rephrase form before
<jcater> anything but i386 is unamerican!!!
<jbailey> I hope you at least mean ix86.
<chillywilly> in  short, ppl suck without Jesus..they can't measure up
<jbailey> Oh wait, I'm not American.
<jbailey> =)
<jcater> lol
<jcater> well, x86 then
<jcater> :)
<fitzix> Find some land and form a new country...
<jbailey> Sealand!

<fitzix> Our disenfranchised people may once again have a home where they can participate!
<fitzix> We'll call it...
<fitzix> Israel!
<fitzix> er...
<jbailey> ROFL!
<fitzix> no
<fitzix> And we'll steal it from an already oppressed people!
<jbailey> Oh, that hurts...
<fitzix> So they can't fight back!  And when they do fight back, we'll take our superior technology - and kill them!
<fitzix> err... bad idea
<fitzix> heh
<jcater> fitzix: no, you side another country you don't like against them too :)
<jcater> and stand back and watch a war unfold
<jbailey> jcater: Isn't that what we're doing now?
<jcater> ya
<jcater> :)
<fitzix> jbailey: pretty much
<jbailey> woohoo glibc build finally finished.
<fitzix> and we're doing horribly at it now
<fitzix> this axis of evil stuff is just crazy
<fitzix> we've united Iran against us with Iraq.. oh yeah, that was smart
<fitzix> and we've included a country with nukes in with the bunch...
<fitzix> oh, that's great...
<jcater> fitzix: your words sound like terrorism... watch your back!
<fitzix> I fear that Bush is just pushing North Korea in order to force his (potentially highly faulty) missile defense shield on us
<jcater> bush?
<jcater> bush isn't doing crap
<fitzix> jcater: hehe - if McCarthyism was alive and well, I'd have been in jail LONG before :)
<fitzix> But, I'm a patriot.. that's the scary part...
<fitzix> I criticize us because it's my duty in this "democracy"
<jcater> bush couldn't form a coherent thought even if his Christian Coalition buddies required it
<jcater> oops
<jcater> did I say that?
<fitzix> jcater: Good point, he is just a puppet
<fitzix> heh
<jcater> you have to admit though
<jcater> he makes a great puppet
<jbailey> The man's never had a job before - Could he be anyything else?
<jbailey> Although, I had always assumed it was daddy pulling the strings..
<jcater> nah
<chillywilly> thay CC comment was uncalled for
<fitzix> jcater: yes he does.. and up until now I gave him credit for doing what he's done with the "war on terrorism"... 
<jcater> chillywilly: why?
<jcater> an attach on the CC is NOT an attack on christians
<jcater> s/attach/attack
<fitzix> the CC is wacked
<fitzix> I often wonder if they understand the tenets of their own religion
<jcater> as far as I'm concerned, the CC does NOT represent my interests as a Christian
Action: fitzix is on the outside of all religions... not against any, but capable of looking at all from an unbiased point of view...
<fitzix> or, as unbiased as possible
<jbailey> That's better. =)
<fitzix> no one can ever be completely unbiased
<fitzix> :)
<chillywilly> I don't think the CC does all bad things
<jcater> I consider myself to be quite open-minded when it comes to religions
<jcater> but, yeah, everyone is biased somewhat
<jbailey> fitzix: I find myself generally unable to comprehends religions other than my own, so I try to leave them alone.
<fitzix> jbailey: Also a good policy :)
<fitzix> chillywilly: nothing is entirely bad... the world is almost entirely a shade of gray
<jbailey> And I *know* that I'm biased. =)
<fitzix> heh - yeah, me saying that it was an "unbiased point of view" was wrong.. I apologize.. but you get the point
<jbailey> =)
<jbailey> Yeah.
<chillywilly> you have to be tolerant of others, but that doesn't mean they are right ;)
<chillywilly> or you condone what they do for that matter
<fitzix> It doesn't mean you're right either :)
Action: jcater automatically assumes no one is right
Action: fitzix does so likewise
<jcater> it uncomplicates a lot of stuff :)

<fitzix> What I said before about perception applies to me as well... I, too, think linearly and serially... it is a limitation of humanity...
<chillywilly> I don't think all people think linerally
<fitzix> insanity == human buffer overflow
<chillywilly> linearally either
<fitzix> you don't?
<fitzix> Can you think as yourself ten years in the future>
<fitzix> ??
<jcater> I can
<fitzix> right now that is... :)
<jcater> but I'm sure I'm wrong :)
<fitzix> jcater: hehe
<chillywilly> oh what;s that greta quote I read by Kierkegaard
<fitzix> I mean, can you transmute your perception forward in time actively and at will?
<chillywilly> er, great
Action: chillywilly digs for it
Action: fitzix thinks "hangovers suck"
<chillywilly> don't drink in excess then
<chillywilly> problem solved ;)
<jcater> fitzix: that's only the linear mind making assumptions
<jcater> think more dynamically
<fitzix> hehe -- true on both accounts :)
jbailey (~jbailey@HSE-Toronto-ppp3490011.sympatico.ca) joined #gnuenterprise.
Action: fitzix thinks it would be cool if one had the ability to shift inanimate objects into a static dimension
<chillywilly> man I wish I could find my existentialism book
<fitzix> dislike someone?  shift their head.  Next time they walk -- POP!
Action: jcater would fear suspended trouts, though
<jbailey> Hopefuly, you'd wait a little longer.  Say, maybe until you hated them.
<jbailey> Dislike seems a little mild.
<chillywilly> love your enemy as thyself
<fitzix> jcater: LOL!
<fitzix> jbailey: true true :)
<jbailey> chillywilly: That's flawed.  Most of us don't like ourselves as much as we probably should.
<jcater> chillywilly: unless they're terrorists, apparently :)
<fitzix> chillywilly: And kneel to recieve the blade?
<jbailey> funny, to see the three different repsonses. =)
<fitzix> heheh
<jbailey> It shows off interesting differences between us. =)
<fitzix> rofl -- one could probably spend DECADES interpreting the variance there :)
<chillywilly> point being that it doesn't matter who it is you show them love in place of hate
<fitzix> jbailey: analytical
<fitzix> jcater: humorous/satyr
<chillywilly> I don't like what the gov't is doing, never have...in fact I have littel faith in them anymore as our laws are bought and sold every day
<fitzix> fitzix: paranoid
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> sounds like a Plato novel
<jcater> s/novel/work
<fitzix> jcater: perhaps we should save the discussion and print out the log... 5000 years from now, they'll be showing this to college students
<jcater> :)
<fitzix> That's somewhat disturbing.. isn't it? :)
Action: fitzix wonders what they'll think when they get to this part of it...
<chillywilly> mn I am mad that I cannot find that quote
<chillywilly> gah!
<chillywilly> it really relates to the linear nature of our lives
<fitzix> The epic work by chillywillyo
<fitzix> FreeSoftwareic
<fitzix> The fresophtwaric
<chillywilly> hehe
<jcater> chillywilly, yielder of the mighty trout, defender of all things fresophtwary
<fitzix> hehe
<chillywilly> lol
<fitzix> There'll be translation difficults: we see "chillywilly: gah!" They see "ChillWillio: The universe is transcendental!"
<jbailey> The true seers are always like that, aren't they? =)
<fitzix> jbailey: misquoted, you mean? :)
<jbailey> misquoted and generally misunderstood.
<fitzix> RMS is a good example
<chillywilly> ok, this is really bugging me
<chillywilly> ah yes
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> I think I got it
<chillywilly> "It is perfectly true, as the philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards. And if one thinks over that proposition it becomes more and more and more evident that life can never really be understood in time simply because at no particular moment can I find the necessary resting place from which to understand it--backwards." 
<chillywilly> I love that quote
Action: fitzix is pondering
<chillywilly>  "The majority of men are subjective towards themselves and objective towards all others, terribly objective sometimes--but the real task is in fact to be objective towards oneself and subjective towards all others." 
<chillywilly> "People hardly ever make use of the freedom which they have, for example, freedom of thought; instead they demand freedom of speech as compensation." 
<jcater> "And how are you?" said Winnie-the-pooh.
<jcater> Eeyore shook his head from side to side.
<jcater> "Not very how," he said. "I don't seem to have felt at all how for a long time."
<jcater>  
<chillywilly> ok...
<chillywilly> a little too deep for you jcater ;)
<jcater> we were sharing life-altering quotes, right?
<chillywilly> are we regressing?
<jcater> sigh
<chillywilly> just teasing man
<jcater> eeyore is a great philosopher
<chillywilly> don;'t get bent out of shape
<jcater> if you listen to what he REALLY means :)

<chillywilly> actually I agree

dsmith (dsmith@oh-strongsville5a-64.clvhoh.adelphia.net) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<chillywilly> what happened here?
<chillywilly> everyone still awake?
<jbailey> Sortof.  My net connection has become incredibly painful to use.
<jcater> yeah, here
<jcater> it was one of those linear moments
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> another cool thing to thin about is this (assuming you believe in God) is that he actually doesn't think linearally at all but can see past, presentm and future all at once...now if that's doesn't mess with your head I don't know what does
<jcater> in that case, is free will a practical joke?
<jcater> sense he knows what will happen?
<chillywilly> I'm not sure we can actually phathom thay
<jcater> j/k
<chillywilly> sorta
<chillywilly> if you're a calvinist ;)
<chillywilly> j/k
<jbailey> WHat's a calvinist?
<jcater> rofl
<jcater> good point :)
<chillywilly> basic set of beliefs....the main one being that things are pre-destined
<jbailey> hmm..  Dit says "A follower of Calvin; a beleive in Calvinism"
<jbailey> dict rather.
<jbailey> *sigh*
<jbailey> I could write a dictionary like that.
<jbailey> Ah okay.  Is it a branch/sect of some main religion?
<jcater> Reformed Christianity
<jcater> who believe in predestination
<jcater> that's about all I know, so I won't give any more misinformation :)
<chillywilly> basically they say Calvin is right
<fitzix> presbyters
<jbailey> Hmm.  I couldn't beleive in that, because I would be so tempted to kill myself.  After all, that's what I was supposed to do, right?
<chillywilly> but, I love you jbailey
<fitzix> "God made me do it"
<chillywilly> that would make me very sad
<jbailey> chillywilly: See?  So I'm glad I don't beleive in predestination. =)
<fitzix> I didn't mean to steal the bread! -- REALLY!  It was predestined!
<chillywilly> :)
<fitzix> chillywilly: I've got a lot in common with kierkegaard... I came up with the whole "God wouldn't think linearally" by myself a few years ago... it makes sense.. anything that thinks linearally can't know everything...
<chillywilly> man, my mom's system is HOSED
Action: jcater foresees a new sect.... fitzixism
<chillywilly> how can you repair the fat of a winblows file system?
<jbailey> Put it on a diet?
<fitzix> hehe
<fitzix> burn it off!
<jcater> there's a tool called
<chillywilly> heh
<jcater> liposuction.com
<jcater> run it in safe mode
<jbailey> mke2fs works well for me.
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> dude I am so sick of fixing winblows for her
<jbailey> Just make sure to pass it the -j option.
<jcater> what do you mean by "repair"
<fitzix> chillywilly: you need a hex editor and a bible (for praying)
<chillywilly> well I got a bible
<chillywilly> just need to find a hex editor
Action: jcater places a hex on emacs
<chillywilly> jcater: scandisk never gets past the fat check
<fitzix> then you need to manually reset ALL of the hardlinks on the disk and record them into the fat, by hand
<jbailey> fitzix: It's for praying?  And all these years I've been smacking the computer on the side with it, hoping for healing!
<jbailey> I knew I had it wrong.
<fitzix> jbailey: hehhehe
<fitzix> ROFL
<jbailey> chillywilly: What is there that she doesn't that she can't do in Debian?
Action: chillywilly kicks vi
<jbailey> Careful, vi kicks back. =(
<fitzix> jbailey: I always thought it was to see over the wheel in the car :)
<jbailey> (Not as hard as Emacs does, luckily...)
<fitzix> use the joe editor... it's nice
<fitzix> and when it kicks I can take it's leg
<fitzix> and rip it off
<jbailey> fitzix: Funny thing.  In our Youth group, we always had a bible on the dashboard.  Whenever we were going to camps, they would also "Where are you going", and we'd say "Church camp".  Which was a truth.
<jbailey> And they'd let us through.  The problem is that "Unitarian Church" sounds otherwise too much like "Unification Church" (which is a nasty cultish place)
<chillywilly> jbailey: umm, nothing but I cannot convince her to use it
<fitzix> where the cow is a demigod and Roseann Barr still gets airplay
<jbailey> chillywilly: Maybe load fvwm95 on it, and just not tell her. =)
<chillywilly> so dudes, how can I fix the FAT
<jcater> chillywilly: mke2fs is a great "convincing" tool :)
<chillywilly> seriously this file system is horked
<jcater> I have a whole office of KDE/Debian using freaks
<jcater> they don't know they're off windows :)
<jcater> I never told them
<jbailey> chillywilly: I seriously recommend you just convert her and be done with it.  I gave Angie the choice of running Linux or fixing her own bugs.
<jbailey> She opted for Linux.
<fitzix> chillywilly: if scandisk can't get through it, I'm not sure that it can be fixed by a tool
<jbailey> fitzix: There used to be good sector recovery tools, but it was always data recovery, they never got everything.
<chillywilly> hmmm, well there's goes my little sister's mp3s
<chillywilly> buh-bye
<chillywilly> ;P
<fitzix> jbailey: if the fat is that damaged I'm not sure that the disk contents will be OK...
<chillywilly> jcater: what do they use to do word stuff?
<jcater> kword typically
<chillywilly> that's my mom's biggesst gripe
<jcater> when they need ms-compat stuff, I give them OpenOffice
<jcater> but the VAST majority of their stuff is so simple
<jcater> any GUI word processor will work
<chillywilly> well my mom does paralegal work for a law frim
<chillywilly> er, firm
<jcater> in that case, she should be using WordPerfect anyway
<jcater> as that's kind of a legal standard these days
<chillywilly> they use word there
<jcater> that's VERY unusual
<jbailey> jcater: Not around here anymore.
<chillywilly> I think she has wordperfect installed
<fitzix> Some judges actually denied certain legal briefs BECAUSE they used word to generate them
<jbailey> After wp51, most of the lawyers I know went to word.
<chillywilly> well I gotta split
<jcater> weird
<chillywilly> she's just going to have tp be screwed
<jcater> all the legal contracts we get are in wpd format
<chillywilly> I wonder if I could pull the hard drive out and moutn it un der gnu/linux
<jcater> chillywilly: if you have enough power, OpenOffice really rocks
<chillywilly> probably not if the FAT is toasted
<jcater> it's just a monster
<chillywilly> she has an 800MHz athlon
<fitzix> guys -- I've gotta get running as well...
<fitzix> later all
<fitzix> twas fun :)
<jbailey> Bye fitzix
<chillywilly> cya
<chillywilly> anyone know if I will be able to mount in under gnu/linux?

<motd> hehehe
<dtm> for derek is here.
<dtm> derek: the topic of #mklinux says "WWJD?  JWRTFM!"
<dtm> think about it
<motd> I know that already
<motd> I'm an op for #linuxhelp on efnet
<motd> I'm out to fix this linker problem
<derek> rofl
[18:39] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<derek> motd: we are gnu enterprise (a meta package for GNU)
<dtm> dont you think so?
<motd> jesus doesn't need the manual...he just knows it
<dtm> motd: hehehe!
<dtm> right on dewd
<derek> if you want help with gnu tools you might try #gnu
<motd> you hear that joke about the satan and jesus programming?
<derek> often people here can help ;)
<dtm> motd: yeah :)
<motd> jesus saves
<motd> HEH
<motd> doesn't look like I'll get help there derek
<derek> motd: bummer
<derek> i dont have time to look @ a complex problem right this second, trying to resurrect a boxen here
<motd> hehehe
<motd> dtm you up for helping?
<derek> so i have something other red hat :) (cough a real gnu\linux box you know, debian)
<dtm> motd: i'm not a binutils specialist
<derek> if nickr is around he would be good at this or reinhard
<derek> jbailey: also, but he is swamped
<jbailey> I can help at the end of March. =)
<dtm> i'm just in the binutils README.  that's the closest i get!  ;)
<dtm> as opposed to knowing how to fix binutils
<motd> slack ownz you
<dtm> yeah slackwre 0wned me when i was 18 yrs old and knee high to a grasshopper
<motd> how am I going to fix this
<derek> motd: trying to think where else you could get help, but honestly ive only ever gotten help here before :)
<dtm> motd: post to mailing lists
<motd> hehe
<motd> usually everyone comes to me for help
<derek> btw: for reference i had to 'mod' toilet internals today on a full internal change out so i have experience :)
<motd> now I'm in a rut
<dtm> motd: there are plenty of binutils usenet and mailing list resources
<derek> what is the problem again motd
<motd> looked at the binutils mailing list
<motd> okay I have ncurses installed when I try to use make menuconfig I get this error
<motd> make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux/scripts/lxdialog'
<motd> collect2: ld returned 190 exit status
<motd> now it happens with every program I try to compile
<motd> I've updated/downgraded binutils
<motd> compiled from source
<motd> and still no luck
<dtm> hmm  well i'd say double check your package management but you have none!  hehe
<dtm> rpm --verify binutils
<dtm> etc
jan (jan@dial-213-168-92-250.netcologne.de) left irc: "KVIrc 2.1.2-pre2 'Monolith'"
<motd> if I compile from source?
<dtm> well your whole distro has no meaningful package management at all, so that's out
<dtm> i'd just wonder if you overwrote something
<dtm> maybe you should reinstall the normal distro's base packages for binutils or maybe something else
<motd> well I recently installed binutils from slack 7.1 package
<dtm> maybe you have some dependancy errors
<dtm> did you upgrade glibc or whatever
<dtm> ?
<motd> yea
<motd> downgraded/upgraded installed from source
<dtm> and you're expecting your OS to work? :)
<dtm> i'd say your tech support is in the realm of binutils specialists alone
<motd> i've been on linux for 5 years
<dtm> yeah me too
<dtm> slackware 3.0
<motd> yeah that's what I thought
<dtm> the linux counter is down though :-/
<dtm> i entered it in 1996
<dtm> darn good idea to count us back then
<dtm> yeah coz you're running an experimental/nonexistant distro right now
<dtm> and there might be no telling how the parts interact
<dtm> i'd consider a forced reinstall of the base OS
<dtm> binutils and glibc at least
<motd> i never even registered
<motd> =P
<dtm> heheh
<motd> I tried reinstalling binutils and glibc
<dtm> and i hope that the re-standardized OS components (binutils, glibc, etc) are then compatible with what you compiled with your experimental stuff
<derek> for reference use debian it makes life easier i promise
<derek> you said you built from source correct?
<motd> already used debian
<derek> what package?
<derek> i.e. cvs, or a nightly build, or an official build ....
<motd> not cvs
<motd> just the latest glibc
<derek> what architecture you on
<motd> 2.2.5
<motd> i386
<dtm> "If you fall off a building, go real limp, because maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will be like hey, free dummy."
<dtm> motd: and you did a forced reinstallation of glibc and binutils already, from Slackware 7.1?
<motd> yes
<dtm> motd: what about the kernel?
<motd> 2.4.16
<dtm> motd: from where?
<dtm> motd: from slackware?
<dtm> motd: i'd consider a potential bias with any binary you'd built with your experimental combo
<dtm> motd: and what about gcc?
<motd> yeah I downloaded the glibc/binutils off slackware ftp site
<motd> 2.95.3
<motd> downloaded off slack ftp as well
<dtm> huh.
<dtm> and the kernel?
<motd> gcc
<motd> kernel is 2.4.16
<dtm> yeah but is the kernel from slackware 7.1?
<dtm> the binary image is from 7.1?
<dtm> i.e. was it built by you or by slackware
<motd> no
<motd> kernel.org
<dtm> ok so do you get where i'm going then?
<dtm> replace your binaries
<dtm> that's my hunch
<dtm> just fyi, imho
<motd> with source?
<dtm> take it fwiw
<motd> fwiw?
<dtm> "for what it's worth"
<motd> and your opionion is not humble
<motd> heh
<dtm> it is humble at this point!  :)
<dtm> it's not subtle but it's humble!  ;)
<dtm> coz i dont know
<motd> replace my binaries with the source built right?
<dtm> but i would definately replace the binaries you've built, with those from slackware
<dtm> basically reinstall any relevant part of the OS
<dtm> from the OS distro
<motd> what the hell are you talking about
<dtm> you replaced all critical parts of your base OS with a random-sounding experimental combination
<dtm> i'm advising putting them back!
<motd> howso?
<motd> put what back?
<dtm> basically reinstall any relevant part of the OS
<dtm> from the OS distro
<motd> like?
<dtm> get the glibc/kernel/gcc/binutils/etc packages from slackware 7.1 and reinstall themn
<dtm> undo your random-sounding work 
<dtm> revert to known good state
<dtm> if that works then that gets you back to work and sorta narrows down the problem
<motd> what the hell glibc/gcc/binutils/etc are all slack 7.1
<motd> and kernel is from source
<motd> I don't want to reinstall my OS from scratch
<dtm> motd: ok well you said that you'd upgraded glibc and such
<motd> i want to debug it
<dtm> i'm not saying reinstall the whole thing from scratch.  i'm saying debug it by trying to revert to a known good state
<dtm> if you dont understand that then you shouldn't have been messing withit like that ;)
<dtm> you have to do that because you probably dont have a backup!
<dtm> and because you aren't a hard core binutils hacker
<dtm> which most people can't be
<dtm> dig?
<dtm> oh yeah and one other reason to do that is because i dont know anything else.
<dtm> :)
<motd> heh
<jbailey> Just to chime in:  I generally advise people *not* to ever compile their own build toolchair.  A subtle failure there can very quickly lead to a non-bootstrappable system.
<dtm> jbailey: same here
<dtm> jbailey: well there are failsafe procedures though
<dtm> you use stuff like chroot or alternate root filesystems 
<dtm> and bakcups
<jbailey> dtm: All of which takes the knowledge to use those.  And in those cases, you've probably got a greater chance of not corrupting it. =)
<dtm> yep
<dtm> linuxfromscratch.org is da bomb
<dtm> it gots everything
<dtm> for multiple archs btw
<dtm> which is glorious
<jbailey> I learned how to recover my toolchain the hard way: Years of beating my head against it.
<dtm> jbailey: uh huh
<dtm> i learned it because i worked at VA Linux with H.J. Lu
<jbailey> You had the master of the broken build chains! =)
<dtm> he's one of the most intense hackers i've ever met
<dtm> intensely dysfunctional, too
<dtm> as well as talented
<jbailey> Yeah.  He's amazingly talented.  He just needs to be more... verbose.
<dtm> jbailey: are you familiar with his work?  hehhe
<dtm> hehehe
<dtm> i then got a contract at Cygnus, where i learned that there are certain places where one does not speak the name "H.J. Lu"
<dtm> such as at Cygnus
<jbailey> *lol*
<dtm> it's just not done
<dtm> especially when one is a contractor, which is viewed as the enemy
<dtm> viewed as parasitic
<dtm> i worked with HJ professionally and on a hobby level there, coz he fixed the bugs in ppc binutils so that linuxppc R5 could be released.  he did that on my powerbook.  so imagine HJ having superuser access on my personal baby  :)
<dtm> he only had it for a couple weeks and didn't do anything insane
<dtm> but a lot of peopel would croak at that though
<dtm> t
<dtm> so he put me in the credits
<dtm> yay
<dtm> he's pretty old school
<dtm> in linux terms
<dtm> which is an odd cultural mentality
<dtm> and which seems to be normalizing in the global village
<dtm> they were pretty weird types, coz they were reinventing in concept, the core OS components which have been done to death.  often they were reinventing them solo.  he did libc5 pretty much solo.
<dtm> so there's a lot of megalomaniacal behavior there which doens't survive well in the global village
<dtm> subgenius micromanaging
<dtm> or something
<derek> sigh i hate hardware

<chillywilly> yes
<derek> it disappears the day you get married

<jcater> nah
<jcater> it slows the day you get married
<jcater> it disappears the day you have children
<jcater> chillywilly: you figure out the master/detail stuff?
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> was reading the hurd mailing lists
<jcater> oh
<jcater> well, I'll let you read then :)
<chillywilly> I;m done now
<derek> jcater: actual i think you are correct
<jcater> are you familiar with primary keys / foreign keys in relational databases?
<jcater> derek: ?
<chillywilly> sorta
<derek> me
<derek> yes
<chillywilly> primary key is a 'unique' key right?
<jcater> well, say I have a states table and a zipcodes table
<chillywilly> the value there makes a record unique
<derek> jcater: correct about the kids vs married
<jcater> :)
<jcater> in forms, I might create a 'states' block corresponding to the 'states' table
<jcater> I also create a 'zipcodes' block corresponding to the 'zipcodes' table
<jcater> but I set zipcodes to be a detail block of states
<jcater> linked by the 'state' field
<jcater> this means each time a new record is brought into focus in the states table, 
<jcater> then the zipcodes block is requeried (behind the scenes) to only bring up all zipcodes in the current state
<jcater> also, if you elect to add a new entry to the zipcodes block
<jcater> the "state" field is automatically filled in with the value of "state" in the states block
<jcater> that make any sense?
<chillywilly> ummm, lemme thin about that for a sec
Action: jcater is tired, so may be outputting gibberish :)
Action: chillywilly is a bit tired too
<chillywilly> I get it I think
<jcater> it closely resembles the relational foreign key concept
<jcater> but doesn't have to have an underlying foreign key/primary key to work
<chillywilly> it does it in the form?
<chillywilly> right?
<jcater> yes
<chillywilly> you make your own key
<chillywilly> gotcha
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<chillywilly> apt-proxy looks useful ;)

<jamest> did anyone have a chance to stress test cvs ?
<Suit> I am building the dependencied for GNUe, which is preferred wxGTK 2.2.9 or 2.3.2 ?
<jamest> which platform?
<Suit> linux (SuSE 7.3)
<jamest> hmmmm
<jamest> we work w/ either
<jamest> on debian most people use the packaged 2.2 
<jamest> i use 2.3 on solaris
<jamest> 2.3 is a bit nicer
<Suit> It comse with 
<Suit> wxgtk-config --version
<Suit> 2.2.6
<jamest> that should work IIRC
<Suit> So maybe I am better of getting that wxPython version?
<jamest> oooo
<jamest> i see the problem
<jamest> there is no wxpython package
<jamest> yes, they must match the wxgtk that is installed
<jamest> i tried running different releases and had issues
<Suit> So do I :-)
<Suit> Hmm, what is nicer in 2.3 ?
<jamest> internals 
<jamest> we'd be 2.3 only if the distro's shipped with it :)
<jamest> I believe that the toolbar works better on win32 platforms
<jamest> there are less memory leaks
<jamest> but our stuff runs the exact same
<Suit> Ok, well I am trying to get the hang of it all on linux first, will see about Win32 much later. This is just me thinking I can learn stuf about python and SQL and such by looking at what other people are doing with it.
<jamest> looking at our code?
Action: jamest feels sorry for Suit
<jamest> that way lie madness
<jamest> :)
<Suit> Hmm, maybe not looking at all the code, just bit's and pieces
<Suit> shoul wxPython match the subversion number too, or just the minor?
<jamest> i had the best luck matching both
<jamest> it's a pain i know
<jamest> as it's hard to find older copies
<jamest> IIRC you have to go to sourceforge
<jamest> and search for wxpython
<jamest> if you go to www.wxpython.org they only give links to the latest and greatest devel copy 
<Suit> well, I just stripped the filename of the url anc got the whole archive in view
<jamest> :)
<Suit> seems they went from 2.2.5 straight to 2.2.7, even google can't find a 2.2.6
<jamest> cool
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> looks like suse went same route as debian
<Suit> Oh well, I'll get them both and start with the .7
<jamest> there was an unreleased version in distros
<jamest> i am suprised that wxpython isn't availble as a package
<Suit> The ppl at SuSE are german, usually "Grundlich" as in dependable is all that get's on the CD
<Suit> me also surprised IIRC seen it in earlier versions of SuSE
<Suit> I am mearly checking out a lot of projects to get some programming experience in OOP and SQL
<jamest> ah

<neilt> hello all
<jamest> a little a long time ago
<jamest> hey neilt
<neilt> did not expect to find folks here on Sunday
<neilt> hey jamest
<reinhard> hey neil
<neilt> hello reinhard
<neilt> I am looking at geas
<reinhard> i saw your mail
<neilt> you mentioned that root:: needed to be removed from something
<neilt> which mail
<reinhard> to geas-dev
<neilt> ahh yes
<reinhard> about removing sql reserved words
<reinhard> point is
<neilt> we need to quote the SQL when it envolves sql keywords
<reinhard> we agreed about putting module name into column name
<reinhard> so the column will not be named "user"
<reinhard> but rather "lang__user"
<neilt> i forgot about that
<neilt> but that should happen automatically
<reinhard> all geas generated column names would have double underscores in them
<neilt> after you code it right
<reinhard> yes exactly
<reinhard> the code is already there but commented out
<reinhard> for the phase of transition
<neilt> its hard to make it work that way :)
<reinhard> old parser and new parser must use the same column names
<reinhard> however
<reinhard> the more i think about it the more i am for a rewrite from scratch
<reinhard> especially if i look at the pain i went through with this double parser phase
<neilt> cool,
<jamest> cool
<neilt> did you change the IDL
<neilt> i am getting an IDL error
<neilt> Traceback (most recent call last):
<neilt>   File "./neil_methods_test.py", line 204, in ?
<neilt>     print "query found %i results between city starts with %s and zip starts with %s," % (result.length, city_test[x], zip2_test[x]),
<neilt> AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'length'
<reinhard> i got the same error
<reinhard> this is still bugs i introduced with the parser exchange
<reinhard> it has to do with more root:: stuff that is throughout the code
<reinhard> btw if anybody is interested:
<reinhard> the fsf has a sister in europe, the fsf europe
<reinhard> they have "associate organisations" in many european countries
<neilt> reinhard: is there anything i can do to help fix current geas?
<reinhard> and for the austrian organisation, i am an elected board member since yesterday evening :)
<reinhard> neilt: if you have time
<reinhard> the bug should be findable
<reinhard> it's the table name
<reinhard> when the sql statement is generated, oql receives "root::module::class" as the class name
<reinhard> and it should only be "module::class"
<reinhard> i just didn't have the time to look at it
<reinhard> however if you don't have time or want to user your resource for the design of GEAS2 (which i think would make more sense)
<reinhard> then i am positive i can fix within the next week
<neilt> ok, I'll wait

<neilt> reinhard: what dont you understand?
<reinhard> Batch Schema Compiler
<reinhard> Transaction Processor
<neilt> converts an object definition into initial SQL table schema
<reinhard> Synchronisation Engine
<neilt> the transaction processor and synchronization engine are for remote users not connected to the database but still doing processing
<reinhard> oh what is SQL Schema Generator then?
<neilt> this is required for anytype of real CRM solution
<neilt> it does the interface in real time, but does not create tables
<reinhard> sorry brb in 15 min
<neilt> it creates SQL for querries and selects etc
<neilt> ok
<jan> hi neilt, hi jcater.

<neilt> hi
<jan> looking on jcaters RPC abstraction code, i realized, there is no RPC abstraction without an object storage.
<jan> i.e. working RPC abstraction = 20 % of GEAS

<jan> some patches to make three system functions in XMLRPC work.
<jamest> patches for the gnurpc stuff?

<jan> first i wanna send you a small drawing. Do you have dia?
<neilt> yes
<jan> ok, the problem is: there three kinds of things need to bind: "static" object, "static" methods, and object which need to be created (like in GEAS)
<chillywilly> what are we talking about here?
<neilt> i cant get dia to load it
<neilt> hold on

<rpc-expert> ok, i have them
Nick change: rpc-expert -> neilt
Nick change: starved_rpc_beginner -> jan
<neilt> jan: what is your question
<jan> ok, first question: should there be one single object, as an kind of base object, which can return links to "static" methods and new objects, or should there be many of them?
<neilt> not sure what you mean by "should be"
<neilt> also not sure if you are talking about geas or common
<neilt> which have different architectures
<jan> common.
<neilt> i don't understand common
<neilt> there are not architecture drawings
<neilt> so you have to read a bunch of code to understand how it all fits together
<jan> should be = what is the best?
<jan> the bunch is a small one.
<neilt> the problem with common from what i have seen is that the SQL layer goes all the way back to the GUI
<neilt> there is not real object abstraction
<jan> the problem is the code which isn't written now, and because i dont know exactly how geas handle the thing, and if GNURPC should follow the GEAS way
<neilt> i can explain geas
<neilt> but it is also far from perfect in implementation, but it does a reasonable object abstraction
<jan> the SQL thing is the next thing I have to care for to get phpgfc use common db abstraction
<neilt> if you want a common db abstraction why not just use ODBC
<jan> ODBC doen't have master/detail.
<jan> I just want to reuse some common code.
<neilt> thats the reason to have a business object layer
<jan> yep.
<neilt> you should have a list view and form view for each business object and then it just depends on the which view is selected by the user
<jan> but phporbit isn't working. And its too complicated to fix it.
<jan> you say it.
<neilt> the business object then takes care of linking two views of the same or related business objects
<jan> then you don't need a gfd for every buisiness object when you just want to test the framework
<neilt> will you do need a form definition
<neilt> of some sort
<jamest> which would be provided by the object autho
<jamest> are
<jamest> author
<neilt> yes
<neilt> the basic ones
Action: jamest was thinking about this in shower this morning 
<jamest> wierd that it came up in here today
<neilt> feel free to join in
<neilt> jamest
<jan> for the author it would be very easy if there is an buisness object to tabular gfd file compiler
<jamest> i'd love to in a sec
<neilt> the gfd should contain a link to the business object
<neilt> and default field into should be given by the business object
<neilt> then forms should be vary basic unless the defaults need to be over-ridden
<neilt> s/into/info/
<jamest> new win32 snapshots of forms/designer at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/snapshots/win32/

<Yurik> is it planned?
<neilt> yes, of course
<Yurik> ah, ok
<neilt> the current model
<neilt> is for internal use for a small company
<Yurik> so adding crypto will require model changes?
<neilt> where security is controlled by pyhsical access
<neilt> yes
<Yurik> clear
<neilt> it does depend on what you are trying to crypto
<neilt> have remote secure access is doable without model changes
<neilt> just use an ssl or vpn tunnel
<neilt> secure authentication is a different story
<Yurik> yeah, I'm about secure auth
<Yurik> say, kerberos-like
<neilt> no one has wanted to take on the security discussion
<neilt> because once you do that you also have to limit row access to authorized persons
<neilt> this is rather invasive

<neilt> welcome back
jbailey (~jbailey@HSE-Toronto-ppp319268.sympatico.ca) joined #gnuenterprise.
<reinhard> neilt: thanks
<reinhard> and thanks for the definitions mail
<neilt> your welcome
<reinhard> if may i place some comments here
<neilt> sure
<reinhard> i think the "sql schema generator" (why not "sql generator"? "schema" did mislead me to the db schema)
<reinhard> should be integrated in the database adapter
<neilt> sounds reasonable
<reinhard> because the sql is database dependent
<neilt> hence its shown connected to database adapter
<reinhard> however it could be a module where more than one adapter can share the same code
<reinhard> ok
<neilt> yes
<reinhard> i see we actually mean the same :)
<reinhard> now for a dangerous part
<reinhard> when to create the tables and columns in the db
<reinhard> and what to do with dynamic changes to the object definitions
chillywilly_ (~danielb@d95.as0.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<neilt> yes, thats a rough one
<reinhard> what i would like to have but am not sure whether it is doable is:
<reinhard> i have a table where e.g. the fields of an object are defined
<reinhard> i want to add a new field so i open a form where i can enter that field
<reinhard> this field is stored in the table that defines the objects
<reinhard> and without restarting the server the field becomes available
<Yurik> chillywilly_: hi
<reinhard> if this is doable it is only doable IMHO when
<reinhard> the database adapter holds a list of the schema in memory
<neilt> its doable with some restrictions
<reinhard> and when access to a column is requested, and the column doesn't exist in the in-memory table
chillywilly (danielb@d102.as28.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) left irc: Killed (NickServ (Ghost: chillywilly_!~danielb@d95.as0.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net))
<reinhard> it first rescans the schema of the table (in case someone else has created the column meanwhile)
Nick change: chillywilly_ -> chillywilly
<reinhard> and if it still doesn't exist the column is created "on the fly"
<neilt> i have some reservations about that
<reinhard> neilt: i would have bet on that :)
<neilt> the data base could be filled with a lot of garbage
<neilt> if some naming error came to be
<reinhard> sure
<reinhard> don't think this is a big problem
<reinhard> as you could write some "clean-up" procedure
<neilt> I think you would want to force some manual on the fly adding of columns
<reinhard> maybe yes
<reinhard> not completely "invisible" for the user
<reinhard> but triggered by a call to some procedure in geas
<neilt> but either way could be counigurable
<neilt> configurable
<reinhard> sure
<reinhard> and of course the "batch" method must exist in parallel
<reinhard> to bootstrap a system
<neilt> i see that batch system and the SQL generator sharing some code, maybe a lot
<reinhard> yes in that case
<reinhard> i see batch system being an automatisation of sql generator
<reinhard> so to say
<reinhard> could one say that the "object server" translates outside access on objects into calls of methods and access to the database
<reinhard> while enforcing things like security and integrity?
<neilt> yes, but we need to break the business object = table restriction
<reinhard> yeah we talked about that already
<neilt> ah, ok
<reinhard> while travelling yesterday i made some notes on my thoughts on geas
<reinhard> on paper
fil_c (username@public1-cosh3-3-cust12.cosh.broadband.ntl.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<reinhard> i will write down and combine with your last mail
<reinhard> somehow to get a "whitepaper"
<reinhard> however the train ride was long and i even thought about acronyms (yes i was bored)
<reinhard> GNU Enterprise Data Interface = GEDI (we already had that)
<neilt> :)
<reinhard> GNU Enterprise Methods Adapter = GEMA
<reinhard> GNU Enterprise Object Repository = GEOR
<jan> rofl
<reinhard> and what i like most
<reinhard> what you called "object-server"
<reinhard> Gnue Object Access Translator
<neilt> :) :)
<chillywilly> hehe
<reinhard> well this is even partly serious because i think we need something like function prefixes
Action: chillywilly is lost
<jan> listen to your talks, i've some questions about GEAS
<chillywilly> what are you guys talking about?
<reinhard> about neilts drawing and his definitions
<jan> whats about the old buissness objects, after a change of an table?
<reinhard> i would say
<neilt> that would have to be one of the restrictions
<reinhard> only additions of fields would be valid
<neilt> only adding allowed in auto fashion
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> and existing business objects have NULL in the new field
<reinhard> fields
<reinhard> actually we would have to restrict that a new column may not be NOT NULL
<jan> whats about the batch schema processor?
<reinhard> you could use that to do a batch of schema changes
<chillywilly> anyone look at the odmg notes?
<reinhard> for example when bootstrapping a new project
<jan> is it an batch processor who does batch jobs, like computing the sum of some objects every night?
<reinhard> chillywilly: i forgot to print them out i wanted to read on train ride :(
<reinhard> jan: not sure i think neilt should answer
<reinhard> sorry i am getting too tired

<chillywilly> man
<neilt> jan: what batch processor are  you referring too
<neilt> oh i understant
<neilt> it is a batch job to parse the object repository and
<neilt> create the necessary tables and seed data
<neilt> should only be done when changes have been made to the repostiory
<jan> sorry i misread you drawing: its an batch schema compiler not processor
<jan> ok, the thing I mean should be done by a process outside of GEAS.

<chillywilly> btw, ODMG does have some nice metadata interfaces for adding objects and such....I think it leaves open what is underneath however, like it doesn't handle whether you do a object-relational mapping, an OODBMS, or an object app server..hence they changed the name to Object Data Management Group instead of 'Database'
<neilt> yes thats why it is yellow
#gnuenterprise: mode change '+o derek' by ChanServ!ChanServ@services.
<chillywilly> some controversy we have on the list here
<neilt> ehat controversy?
<neilt> i am not aware of any?

<chillywilly> remember that Tidd guy talking about the 'other' standards groups, etc.
<chillywilly> er, Todd
<chillywilly> now there's a guy form the one standard group refuting hsi claim and saying he really does a great disservice to them
<derek> i have stayed otu of that for the most part
<derek> but gnue is many things
<derek> one thing is a framework
<derek> the framework itself doesnt care about 'data' standards per say
<derek> i.e. one coudl use the framework to implement EACH standard :)
<neilt> yes, its is interesting that kpmg is watching us
<neilt> however
<derek> thats why i dont get 'too worked up' about what standard X is doing

<derek> i dont think that person has any 'claim' to my software's functionality of doing that :)
<derek> if they sent me the patch to change my software then yes but simply telling me my software needed no
<neilt> if he does not send assignment then I can easily remove it
<derek> i dont know if he sent you patch or not i guess is what im saying :)
<neilt> no patch sent
<neilt> dream on

<jcater> well
<derek> i have cd and not on there :(
<derek> appears not in powertools cd either
<derek> suckage
<dtm> derek: have you looked up Mozilla instead?
<dtm> derek: of course you might hafta recompile it if you're wanting to keep that old of an OS
<derek> honestly with fvwm and 64mb of ram this little alpha is quite usable even in gui mode it seems
<derek> dtm: im getting ready to put woody on that box, just nephew was over and wanted to 'surf'
<derek> i think im going to try windowmaker on it
<derek> when woody is on it
<derek> that or blackice or something 'light weight'
<dtm> derek: how about a remote display then
<derek> if its usable it will go in kitchen probably as the 'netpliance'
<dtm> derek: start up netscape on another host
<derek> dtm: its only machine i have other than this laptop
<derek> so if i were to do that i would have him just use laptop :)
<derek> less pain
<dtm> derek: oh you dont have enough memory or something?
<derek> thanks guys be back in a bit
<dtm> alphas take incredible amounts of electricity :)
<derek> no i have enough memory, just its more work than worth for one time deal
<dtm> oh ;it'd take one command via ssh
<dtm> or two via telnet and xhost
<derek> um no it would take finding ssh for alpha 5.2 :)
<dtm> which would take two commands as well :)
<derek> ls |grep ssh from the cd (rpms)
<derek> brings back a null
<derek> so i assume finding ssh for it will be a pain in the butt
<dtm> which is why God invented rpmfind
<dtm> yeah it's too bad there's no such thing as a network transparent package manager...
<derek> no ssh for alpha at rpmfind
<Yurik> derek: use telnet, rcp... :)
<derek> um nah
<dtm> derek: then get the srpm and type yet another command, if you have a development env
<derek> just let him use playstation its easier :)
<dtm> rpm --rebuild openssh*
<derek> i cant find src rpm for 5.2
<dtm> derek: do you have a dev env?
<derek> explain

<jcater> I know just passwd files used to work
<jcater> ignore that
<dtm> jcater: Done.

<jamest> neilt: you still here?
<neilt> yes
<jamest> I'm looking at the geas drawing 
<jamest> finally
<neilt> cool
<neilt> hopefully it mmirrors common
<neilt> :)
<jamest> :)
<jamest> well
<jamest> yes
<jamest> your RPA is commons GNURPC
<jamest> the db/sql stuff is our DataSource system
<neilt> probably not
[19:17] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<neilt> but open to discussion
<jamest> the methods adapter is similar the trigger system 
<jamest> starting w/ the db stuff
<neilt> the problem that I see with current common is that there is no object abstraction and the SQL paradigm goes to the UI ( not I may not understand it all)
<jamest> ?
<neilt> ??
<jamest> i think that's my naming of menu picks in forms
<jamest> as looking at the old geas API it really wasn't OO 
<jamest> and seems similar to what common does
<neilt> so where do you want to start
<jamest> hmmmm
<jamest> first, i'm curious to know
<jamest> is old geas no longer considered worth maintaining?
rdean (rdean@chcgil2-ar2-053-033.chcgil2.dsl.gtei.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<neilt> it depends
<jamest> IOW...is this a new geas?
<neilt> no one will support it with forms
<neilt> so we are stuck
<neilt> in limbo
<jamest> i can't support it
<jamest> anyone is welcome to write a driver
<jamest> but I've tried on linux and solaris
<jamest> w/ same resutls
<jamest> a segfault every time I use a boolean
<jamest> anyway
<neilt> I dont recall us having a boolean in the IDL
<jamest> lots of them
<neilt> does it work with INTs
<jamest> i think so
<jamest> bash-2.05a$ grep boolean *.idl
<jamest> admin.idl:    attribute boolean verbose;
<jamest> connection.idl:    boolean supportsFeature( in Feature featureID );
<jamest> dataobject.idl:    boolean identity( in string classname , in string oid );
<jamest> dataobject.idl:    boolean ofclass( in string classname ) raises(ServerError);
<jamest> dataobject.idl:    readonly attribute boolean inDatabase;
<jamest> methodprovider.idl:    boolean verify ( in string name , in long argcount        );
<jamest> objectlist.idl:    void resort( in string fieldname , in boolean ascending )
<jamest> objectlist.idl:    attribute boolean delayFilter;
<jamest> query.idl:        boolean invert;
<jamest> query.idl:        boolean casesensitive;
<jamest> query.idl:        attribute boolean reverse; // reverse sort order
<jamest> schema.idl:    boolean   notnull;          // are null values forbidden?
<jamest> schema.idl:    boolean   isreadonly;       // readonly field?
<jamest> schema.idl:    boolean    allfields;       // TRUE if inherited fields are included
<jamest> transaction.idl:    boolean isOpen();
<jamest> bash-2.05a$
<jamest> that's why forms currently can pull all data at startup
<neilt> cool, i should not rely on memory
<neilt> it seems
<jamest> as that all the farther I could go w/o segfaulting
<jamest> i honestly did take it as far as i could
<neilt> what versions of python, orbit-python are you using
<jamest> python 2.1
<neilt> and what version of orbit
<jamest> pyobit 0.3.1
<jamest> orbit 0.5.12
<jamest> now
<jamest> these could be newer than my last attempts
<jamest> as it seems woody recently updated some of there
<jamest> these 
<jamest> the pyorbit i believe
<neilt>  i  orbit           0.5.12-1    The CORBA ORB used in GNOME
<neilt>  i  python          2.2-6       Interpreted, interactive, object-oriented l...
<jamest> what pyorbit?
<neilt> I am using orbit-python 3.1 not pyorbit
<jamest> sorry
<jamest> that's what I mean
<neilt> cool
<neilt> right now geas is broke as reinhard is in the middle of changing the parser
<neilt> but my test routines mostly work
<jamest> i'm building
<jamest> what I'd like to see 
<jamest> is a merge in the code bases
<jamest> and a fleshing out of the object model in forms
<jamest> it's there as a stub
<neilt> the object model should not be in forms
<neilt> it should be in the middleware
<neilt> the business object model that is
<jamest> forms needs to understand how to interface w/ objects
<jamest> that is what I'm calling an object model
<neilt> ok not the business object model
<jamest> nope
<jamest> the interactions between forms and an object server
<neilt> the only thing the UI needs to understand is the business object it attaches too and
<jamest> that will require a rewrite of the geas API as it doesn't export objects
<neilt> if the UI is a form (single entity) or list (multiple entitiy)
<jamest> it gives me only IMHO a table view of an object
<jamest> that i can query
<neilt> then it should query to business object (using introspection to get the fields and other stuff.)
<jamest> yes
<jamest> the start of that is also in the geas driver
<neilt> geas should not export objects
<neilt> it should provide an interface to the UI
Yurik (yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<jamest> i don't mean export to run remote
<neilt> their is a lot of cost associated with marshalling the real objects and running them down the rail
<jamest> i mean that right now geas doesn't give me anything postgresql doesn't
<jamest> it's a relational view of object data 
<neilt> correct, the big problem we have with geas is that business object should not equal database table
<jamest> yes
<jamest> what I wanted (while in shower)
<neilt> we should be able to normalized data on the backend without effecting the UI
<jamest> was a way to drill down thru objects in geas
<neilt> and that should be hidden behind the business object
<neilt> also the business object should provide security
<jamest> so that a defined action on the form (say dbl clicking) would be defined by an object
<neilt> in that only authorized people should see certain data
<jamest> so that forms is told if user does foo than do bar
<neilt> in this case all business objects should respond to certain UI events
<neilt> in a consistent way
<jamest> yes
<jamest> that the object author defines
<neilt> or the UI author defines
<jamest> what I mean is that if the customer object is displayed
<jamest> then a dbl click on the customer takes me to ??????
<neilt> for example you should be able to say in the UI "GIve me the object pointed to by this field" 
<neilt> the object servers should serve it up
<jamest> where that is defined by the object itself in it's context
<jamest> but this is way ahead of where we are today :)
<neilt> that is why we need some new architecture
<jamest> my biggest issues with geas as it stands
<jamest>   performance - common trounces it currently
<jamest>   security - none exists
<jamest>   !@#!@# booleans in python-orbit :)
<neilt> my biggest issues with common is that there is now central object definition
<neilt> for business objects
<neilt> and I agree with your assessment of geas 100%
<jcater> I don
<jamest> you jcater not don
<jcater> I don't follow the central object definition thing
Action: jcater just joined mid-conversation
<jcater> (sorry, different keyboard and has one of those awkward L shaped enter keys)
<neilt> what dont you follow
<jamest> in my mind a "central object definition" can be mapped to a table def with database side triggers in a relational world
<derek> can i please ask we only talk about new geas
<jamest> they are basically things that have methods
<derek> either via email or at the set meeting
<jamest> set meeting?
<neilt> a central
<derek> as half conversations between one or two people just make it more laborious to unify us
<neilt> object definition is
<neilt> a single place to define a business object
<derek> jamest: you got an email requesting times/days that do not work
<derek> neilt and you are only ones not to respond :)
<neilt> derek: I dont know any days that I cant do it
<jcater> I follow that, but am not sure how that relates to common
<neilt> until the day or so before then i will know
<jcater> as common is only a library at this point
<jamest> where did you send that mail?
Action: jamest hasn't seen it
<jcater> I can wait until the meeting I suppose
<derek> if reinhard was here right now i would say lets have the conversation now
<neilt> why wait 
<neilt> we dont have to decide anything
<derek> jamest i sent it to jamest@gnue.org
<derek> neilt: because then we end up rediscussing
<neilt> just getting people on the same subject is very positive
<derek> and its better for feed back if everyone is there initially
<derek> if its something that cant wait do email
<derek> then its documented for others to participate
<neilt> we are just answering each other questions
<derek> i think we owe it to reinhard to make sure he is included
<neilt> that will make the formal discussion shorter
<neilt> i agree we need a formal discussion for deciding the future
<neilt> but please dont stop a productive discussion
<derek> discuss as you like
<derek> i am very pro phases
<derek> honestly i would like next geas to start out with no objects
<derek> just an abstracted rpc
<derek> that talks to a daemon that gives data access and remote method innovaction
<derek> as that should be very simple with a large gain
<derek> learn from it
<derek> come back and do a real geas
<neilt> then we drop back 2 years and dont get any benefit from what we ahve learned
<neilt> we also extend the time to get a working enterprise system
<neilt> if you want a db system, just use current forms
<neilt> you should be able to use odbc for the rpc now
<neilt> its not a real one
<neilt> but would work in that way
<neilt> -
<neilt> the issues that need learning are not the RPC
<derek> well i would use sqlrelay i think before odbc
<neilt> that is just adapting one of the common protocols
<neilt> agreed
<neilt> the real issues to making a middleware werver work is the object handling and its relation to SQL
<neilt> that is not off the shelf
<derek> hmmm websphere seems to sell well and it doesnt have object transparency
<derek> guess its shit though
<neilt> i dont know websphere
<neilt> so i dont kow
<neilt> know
<neilt> the value is not in objects anyway
<derek> the big difference here is whether we make our middleware object transparent or whether we push that back to the developer
<neilt> its in implementing a model, view, controller architecture
<neilt> that abstracts the bloody details from the business developer
<derek> remote methods + remote database is what 98% of the players are doing
<derek> then they make people make their method stuff do object/sql mapping (i.e. they shove that responsibility to the developer)
<derek> i think it makes sense to make an object transparent system
<derek> just its VERY VERY difficult compared to the former
<derek> and why i was suggesting a more evolutionary approach
<neilt> we are almost there
<neilt> now
<neilt> sure we have some problems but so does forms
<derek> neilt: when i look at geas we are far from there
<derek> we have a much better idea of what is involved but i wouldnt say almost there :)
<derek> much closer than most though :)
<neilt> so its ok to evolve forms but not geas
<neilt> this i dont understand
<derek> i guess more specifically the people doing most of the coding right now are not showing extreme interest in object transparency (though they are not saying they wont support doing it in gnue)
<neilt> on that we agree on
<derek> which tells me we will sit with an unused half done thing for a long time, which only makes gnue look bad
<neilt> but as a business developer I can not use forms
<neilt> its not productive enough
<derek> if we can get a ton of people willing to do the other i would be a lot more inclined to not do evolutionary
<neilt> there are too many peices that have to be manually spliced togeher
<derek> i think in doing the evolutionary way we are more inclined to get contributors and when they do, they will be encouraged at the potential and more willing to code object transparency
<derek> but maybe i have the wrong outlook
<neilt> there is no way to define the business concept and tie it together 
<neilt> so it can be discussed
<neilt> I have to have someone that understand SQL, XML etc
<neilt> then they have to understand how they relate to each other
<jamest> here's a thought from left field
<neilt> and how the system works
<jamest> inside common I've got a GTriggerNSObject
<derek> i have to run ttfn
Nick change: derek -> dnAway
<jamest> among other things it lets me define internal functions that map to public things in a trigger namespace within forms
<jamest> along w/ a set of object properties
<jamest> this allows me to map things like
<jamest> block1.field.doThis()
<jamest> or
<jamest> so if a customer block exists
<jamest> customer.foobulate()
<jamest> this generic object doesn't really care what it represents as it has to deal with anything you add to a gfd file
<jamest> it might be the start of a object interface to forms
<jamest> as forms already knows how to deal with it inside triggers
<jcater> not might be, but is
<jcater> forms is an object-based UI
<jcater> that is currently using a relational backend
<jamest> right now at run time a filter thru the form def and build a tree of these objects
<jcater> look at all the trigger code, and the databse abstraction
<jamest> nothing would stop me from doing the same to a geas server
<jamest> exposing objects via their names
<jamest> along with methods and attributes
<jcater> forms knows NOTHING about SQL... it simply talks to n object provided by gnue-common
<jamest> this would be instantly visible to the trigger system 
<jamest> and with a little more effort the forms UI could be driven in a similar manner
<jamest> by having these ojbect expose a getGFD() 
<jamest> in geas
<jamest> then using that to build the UI on the fly
<jamest> hmmmm
<jamest> doing this would keep the objects on geas
Nick change: dnAway -> derek
<jamest> give a 100% consistant interface to them in forms
<derek> i have a reprieve for a few minutes
<jamest> and i don't think would be hard 
<jamest> if
<neilt> i really dont care how its done, but i know the requirements
<jamest> we can get the schema info from geas
<derek> thats what i had mentioned as neilt wanted this i.e. build the xml on the fly
<derek> for people not wanting xml flat file forms
<derek> but rather forms created from GEAS
<neilt> and those requiremts are that I can specify business objects that have data and procedures
<neilt> in a simple manner
<jamest> hmmmmm
<jamest> you know
Action: jamest is thinking
<jcater> jamest: that can be dangerous
<neilt> and the UI is separate from the business object
<jamest> ow ow ow ow
<jamest> almost there
<derek> jamest: he meant for use not to you
<neilt> and the SQL is separate from the business object
<jamest> ok
<derek> well neilt what you seem to want (not saying its wrong) is the UI to be the business object :)
<jamest> you'll all hang me for this
<derek> i.e. the form is created from the object
<neilt> derek: nope
<jamest> but GTriggerNSObject could easily become GEASObject
<jcater> yip
<derek> jcater: get the rope
<derek> j/k
<neilt> derek: the problem with that is that there are many views of the basic business object
<derek> neilt: then you will have to store some form defintion information somewhere
<neilt> sure I dont mind a form definition
<jamest> as it's already letting me tie hardcoded functoins to dynamic objects
<neilt> no hardcoded functions
<neilt> please
<jamest> so those methods could be stored in object and dynamic
<jamest> neilt: absolutely
<jamest> man
<jamest> this could work
<derek> for clarification, you would still work in 2 tier mode with local triggers as well this way correct
Action: jamest is a relational man to the core
<jcater> derek: you can guarantee I'll make sure of that :)
<jamest> i'm the one that refuses to let 2-tier die
<jamest> er, and jcater now
<derek> i.e. this GEASObject struct or GTriggerNSObject
<derek> would let you either grab GEAS objects and methods
<derek> or let you tie hardcoded methods to GEAS objects
<derek> or tie hardcoded functions to gnue objects
<derek> or such
<derek> i.e. its doing the last one currently from what i understand
<jamest> forms already has an object system stubs in it seperate from the sql db stuff
<derek> just functionality would be added for the others
<jamest> my first thoughts are how to flesh that out using existing code
<derek> so we would end up with a GEAS server and adaptor
<jamest> my second thoughts were taking this to the next level
<derek> or more a 'local' geas (non daemon) for 2 tier
<jamest> and using it as a core object in geas
<jamest> i really need to run
<jamest> just as this was gettin fun 
<jamest> derek: can you resend me that mail
<jamest> about a meeting
<derek> jamest: just send me days/times that WILL NOT work
<jamest> ah ok
<derek> like tae kwan do nights
<derek> and such
<jamest> ok
<derek> and i will take everyones 'sacred' time
<jamest> l8r
<derek> and choose a day/time with a few days notice

<neilt> if we are intalling a new linux system, should we use woody or potato?
<jamest> well
<jamest> how linuxy are you guys there?
Action: jamest would have claimed woody 1 month ago
<jamest> as it was frozen and very stable
<jamest> then they doinked it up
<jamest> however it is back on track and _seems_ stable again
<jamest> I'm running woody on most my production servers now
<jamest> as is jcater
<jamest> IIRC
<neilt> cool
<neilt> should i should not even install potato
<neilt> just go for woody
<neilt> we are not very linuxy
<neilt> if fact we are strickly a winblows shop
<neilt> until today
<neilt> :)
<jamest> lol
<jamest> if you have a fat pipe to the net then I imagine you could just install woody
<jamest> i think i burned a woody cd here a while back myself
<jamest> but typically I've just installed potato as it was the cd i had
<jamest> then dist-upgraded to woody
<neilt> :(
<neilt> gigbit network drivers for 3com cards only work on 2.2 or 2.3
<jamest> 2.2 or 2.3 of what?
<neilt> potato = 2.2.x
<neilt> woody = 3.x
<jamest> ?
<jamest> that's the debian version #
<neilt> linux
<jamest> you need a 2.4 kernel?
<neilt> potato is currently 2.2r5
<jamest> yes
<jamest> there will not be a 2.3 debian
<jamest> however if you are talking kernel
<jamest> then woody does have a 2.4 kernel option
<neilt> let me check
<jamest> it installs 2.2 be default
<jamest> then you have to apt-get install a kernel-image-* package
<neilt> sorry
<neilt> my screwup i
<neilt> the drivers were talking about kernal version
<neilt> so I am searching for more up to date drivers
<jamest> the drivers would be included in the kernel more than likely

<dneighbo> here
<jbeyer> ok, I use the cvs snapsnapshot of GNUe
<dneighbo> ok
<jbeyer> an in geas/src I do a make check
<dneighbo> just to start the conversation, GEAS is currently for developers only
<jbeyer> should it work? I get errors:
<dneighbo> i.e. unless you are looking to 'contribute' code to GEAS or are 'curious' about it, I wouldnt bother trying to compile it
<jbeyer> the check?
<jbeyer> or geas?
<dneighbo> if you are wanting to be a developer, we are in process of restructuring it seriously
<dneighbo> and will be having discussions on the next iteration later this week
<jbeyer> I am looking at the geas code, 'cause I am curious.
<dneighbo> jbeyer: at this stage geas is more a prototype or a learning tool
<jbeyer> I want the check, if my build is ok, ...
<dneighbo> reinhard would have to answer that
<dneighbo> i think he said things should be 'making' ok
<jbeyer> where "ok", means "not more broken than what you have" :-)
<dneighbo> but i havent followed too closely over past few weeks
<dneighbo> jbeyer : exactly :)
<dneighbo> ok means compiles on my machine, lets ship it :)
<jbeyer> I compiled geas and the compile was ok, now I am at the point where I need to
<jbeyer> try things. and a working testcase is always a nice start :-)

<dneighbo> in python

<jbeyer> fine.
<dneighbo> shoudl be in the cvs tree

<neilt> if its quick
<neilt> ./geas-server -v -d9
<reinhard> jbeyer: yes i am here too
<jbeyer> ok, is that in the source dir? geas/src ?
<reinhard> yes
<jbeyer> my conf is in the geas dir, is what you use?
Serafin (~charlie@200.59.77.31) joined #gnuenterprise.
<reinhard> no you should modify the geas.conf in the src directory
<reinhard> that's the one that is used if you run from source dir
<reinhard> the geas.conf in geas directory is what would get installed on make install
<reinhard> however we strongly advise to not install
<jbeyer> what do you use for the method-dir? I use this:
<jbeyer> methoddir            ../examples/businessobjects/methods
<jbeyer> ok?
<reinhard> yes
<jbeyer> I use postgresql, and I get this error:
<jbeyer> error: Connection to database 'gnue' failed: FATAL 1:  user "gnue" does not exist
<jbeyer> could I change the user in the geas.conf?
<jbeyer> If I change it there, then the server starts....
<jbeyer> and I get this error:
<jbeyer> addrbook.gcd:7: no format allowed for this type
<jbeyer>     text name<20>;
<jbeyer> addrbook.gcd:16: no format allowed for this type
<jbeyer>     text description<16>;
<jbeyer> and 3 more. What can I do about this?
<reinhard> that is ok
<jbeyer> so I could ignore it?
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> sorry doing 3 things at a time currently
<reinhard> you should get "the GNU Enterprise Application Server is ready"
<reinhard> at the very end of the output
<reinhard> then everything is (more or less) ok
<jbeyer> Yes, I get that.
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> then you could open another session and start examples/python/addrbook.py
<reinhard> which is a demo "front end"
<jbeyer> I get an error with that:
<jbeyer> CORBA._load_idl("../../idl/geas.idl")
<jbeyer> I could fix it by changing the path to the idl...
<jbeyer> is that ok?
<dneighbo> make sure path to idl is correct
<dneighbo> if you still get issues
<reinhard> it _should_ be correct though
<dneighbo> make sure you ahve a current version of orbit-python
<reinhard> do you have orbit-python installed?
<reinhard> um yes what derek said
<dneighbo> if you are on something other than debian (or even debian)
<dneighbo> and you have orbit-python but more than one version of python (like 1.5.2 and 2.x )
<jbeyer> yes I have orbit-python installed
<dneighbo> make sure orbit-python is installed for right python version
<jbeyer> from which directory do you start the example?
<jbeyer> I use python 2.1 and now GNUe is using it :-)
<reinhard> from the directory where addrbook.py is
<jbeyer> There was a path to the CORBAmodule.so hard coded for the python1.5 version
<reinhard> sure?
<reinhard> where?
<reinhard> i thought others got it to run with 2.x
<jbeyer> in file geas/src/methods/methods_python.c
<jbeyer> < #define ORBIT_PYTHON_SO    "/usr/lib/python1.5/site-packages/CORBAmodule.so"
<jbeyer> > #define ORBIT_PYTHON_SO    "/usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages/CORBAmodule.so"
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> ok
<jbeyer> no problem :-)
<reinhard> thanks anyway
<jbeyer> now I get this:
<jbeyer> error: Password failed 'guest'
<jbeyer> what passwd could that be?
<reinhard> db password?
<reinhard> you can set the password in geas.conf
<jbeyer> ok, I am not a postgresql wizard. Do you know how to set it?
<reinhard> you know what the password is?
<jbeyer> for postgresql?
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> for the user you use to connect to postgresql
<jbeyer> I could connet without a passwd. I installed the db a few weeks ago...
<reinhard> hm
<jbeyer> and it works fine for the cmdline "psql"
<reinhard> did you provide a shadowpw file?
<jbeyer> for the machine or for the db?
<jbeyer> should I drop the db named gnue and create it new?
<reinhard> please try that
<reinhard> i did
<reinhard> createuser <some new username>
<reinhard> with that user createdb gnue
<reinhard> and connect with the new user
<reinhard> and that did work
<reinhard> i am no postgresql wizard either :(
<reinhard> jbeyer: 2 things before i have to leave
<reinhard> 1. i am happy you play with geas and we are looking forward to your help
<jbeyer> ok
<reinhard> 2. i'm not sure if it makes sense to put much effort into this incarnation of geas
<reinhard> let me explain
<jbeyer> ?
<reinhard> we got this contributed from a company that wrote geas for their own needs
<reinhard> we decided to take it and adapt it to our needs
<reinhard> however we found out it is a PITA
<reinhard> and last week we finally decided to do a rewrite from scratch
<jbeyer> PITA == ?
<reinhard> pain in the a**
<jbeyer> ok.
<jbeyer> and you started with the rewrite?
<reinhard> so to speak yes
<jbeyer> is any code available?
<reinhard> in the form that we are discussing to agree on the concepts :)
<reinhard> one of the experiences from existing geas is
<reinhard> 1. code 2. think is the wrong way around :)
<jbeyer> come on :-)
<reinhard> we are working on a whitepaper
<reinhard> and there is a drawing on the website
<reinhard> you could see discussions on the gnue-dev@gnu.org mailing list
<reinhard> and we would very much appreciate your input on that topic
<reinhard> not saying you must stop playing with GEASv1
<reinhard> but explaining there might be better use of your effort :)
<reinhard> if you have further questions i will be here probably tomorrow same time
<reinhard> or neilt or chilliwilly might be able to help if they are here
<jbeyer> ok. I will take a look @ the mailing list.
<reinhard> sorry i have to go now

<chillywilly> ;)
<jbailey> When are you thinking?
<chillywilly> umm
<chillywilly> I dunno
<chillywilly> he said I was welcome to go with him
<chillywilly> however
<jbailey> Well, check with me first if you have options on when.  I'm travelling in August.
<jbailey> (And several weekends before that)
<chillywilly> I'm not a single guy that can just go off and atke vacations without my familiy
<chillywilly> er, take
<chillywilly> where?
<chillywilly> I think it would be earlier than august
<chillywilly> much earlier
<chillywilly> I think they would only stay a couple of days
<chillywilly> last time they wen tey took the train
<jbailey> Nice.
<chillywilly> went they
<chillywilly> my buddy did not like it
<jbailey> The train station is a 15 minute walk from here.
<chillywilly> it was too long
phil_c (username@public1-cosh3-3-cust12.cosh.broadband.ntl.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jbailey> Impatience is a vice.
<chillywilly> I told him that was nothing
<chillywilly> as we drive to NC for about 18 hours every summer to visit family
<chillywilly> NC == North Carolina
<jbailey> It was less than 18 hours?
<chillywilly> just in case you didn't know our state abbreviations
<jbailey> I don't, thanks for the heads up.
<chillywilly> it takes about 18 hours at the least
<chillywilly> soemtimes it takes 20
<jbailey> But his train ride was less than 18 hours?
<chillywilly> it was 12
<chillywilly> accroding to him
<chillywilly> er, according
<chillywilly> that's nothing IMHO
<chillywilly> all you need to do is find something to do
<chillywilly> right ;)
<chillywilly> heh, all you have to do is bring a laptop and you can code for 12 hours ;)
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<jbailey> Or a deck of cards.  Or a pile of books.
<chillywilly> that sounds like a good idea
<chillywilly> well I guess he was saying that they are going to fly this time
<chillywilly> (btw, this guy that I am talking about is the guy that  I work with)
<chillywilly> crazymike
<jbailey> Cool.
<chillywilly> he's been on IRC a couple of times
<chillywilly> right now I think he
<jbailey> I don't know if I can put you up, though... We live in a one room place.
<jbailey> But it would be cool to hang out.
<chillywilly> bah, you don't have to do all that
<chillywilly> I can just say 'hi'
<jbailey> Fine, I won't hang out with you. =)
<chillywilly> no I mean "put me up"
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<jbailey> Well, I tried to do that in Vancouver when I was able to.
<chillywilly> I'll have to bring a trout especially for you
<jbailey> But with 2 people and 2 cats in a one-room 550sq ft appt., it's a little cramped.
<jbailey> chillywilly: You can't bring meat over the border.
<jbailey> chillywilly: Nor citrus fruit.
<chillywilly> are the customs people going to have dogs to sniff it out?
<chillywilly> otherwise they can't stop me
<chillywilly> muuwhahahha
<chillywilly> OR
<chillywilly> I'll just get a canadian trout
<chillywilly> to slap you with
<jbailey> IIRC, Canadian trout are endanged.  Perhaps a Salmon.
<chillywilly> oh really
<chillywilly> hmmm
<jbailey> You could try Tuna, but please make sure it's dolphin safe.
<chillywilly> prehaps then you will be beaten with a salmon
<jbailey> I'd say "whatever your fetish", but I wouldn't really mean it.
<chillywilly> hmmm

Nick change: dnSleep -> derek
<derek> the meeting isnt 4 hours
<derek> i gave two options
<derek> both being 4 hour blocks
<chillywilly> oh
<derek> i assuming we would do it in 1.5 hour session somewhere in the 4 hour block
<derek> i.e. it was process of SLOWLY whittling down what would work :)
<neilt> i would also assume the meeting will be a bit moderated, so we keep on track
Action: dtm gets out the hose
<chillywilly> hey neilt, you got cvs locked man ;)
<chillywilly> wassa matta fa you eh?
<chillywilly> cvs server: [20:07:37] waiting for anoncvs's lock in /cvsroot/gnue/gnue/geas/src/mac/geas-mac.pbproj
<chillywilly> cvs server: [20:08:07] obtained lock in /cvsroot/gnue/gnue/geas/src/mac/geas-mac.pbproj
<chillywilly> danielb@obfuscation:~/src/cvs/gnue$ 
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> that was a first for me
<neilt> wtf
<neilt> how can annoncvs lock cvs
<chillywilly> I dunno
<chillywilly> seems pretty goofy to me too
Action: derek has to attend to sick chitlins be back in an hour or so
<derek> i will do an announce on geas-dev for option 1 as i think everyone said 'yeah' to it
<derek> bbs
<neilt> chillywilly: whats even wierder is that is a directory
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> now I am curious
<chillywilly> If several developers try to run CVS at the same time, one may get
<chillywilly> the following message:
<chillywilly>      [11:43:23] waiting for bach's lock in /usr/local/cvsroot/foo
<neilt> so it may have gone away
<neilt> now
<chillywilly>  CVS will try again every 30 seconds, and either continue with the
<chillywilly> operation or print the message again, if it still needs to wait.  If a
<chillywilly> lock seems to stick around for an undue amount of time, find the person
<chillywilly> holding the lock and ask them about the cvs command they are running.
<chillywilly> If they aren't running a cvs command, look in the repository directory
<chillywilly> mentioned in the message and remove files which they own whose names
<chillywilly> start with `#cvs.rfl', `#cvs.wfl', or `#cvs.lock'.
<chillywilly>    Note that these locks are to protect CVS's internal data structures
<chillywilly> and have no relationship to the word "lock" in the sense used by
<chillywilly> RCS--which refers to reserved checkouts (*note Multiple developers::).
<chillywilly>    Any number of people can be reading from a given repository at a
<chillywilly> time; only when someone is writing do the locks prevent other people
<chillywilly> from reading or writing.
<chillywilly> it did go away

<chillywilly> as soon as you got done doing what you were doing

<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> sorry
<chillywilly> I dunno why I said it was you
<chillywilly> maybe because it lock the 'mac' project file dir
<chillywilly> I just naturally thought of you

<chillywilly> my subconcious mind told me to type that

<neilt> cool, i like people thinking about me

<chillywilly> hrrrm, that could be construed as 'eogtistical' thing to say
<chillywilly> but, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt
<neilt> :)
<jamest> ....boy it'd sure be great if neilt would do this, this, this, this, this, this, oh and this.  Take the blame for this and that and..........
<chillywilly> it's neilt's fault!
<chillywilly> that's it!

<chillywilly> hey
<chillywilly> how do you keep your desktops in sync jcater?
<jcater> it involves a whip and chocolate syrup
<jcater> oops
<jcater> wrong question
<chillywilly> I talked my mom into letting me install Debian
<chillywilly> on her machine ;)
<jcater> waddya mean, in sync?
<chillywilly> oh yea
<chillywilly> you have diskless clients
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> that's the easy way ;)
Action: jcater is confused
<chillywilly> that was a joke
<derek> you know n'sync... like.... "i want it that way...."
<jcater> ah
<jcater> well
<jcater> I use KDE
<chillywilly> what i really want is a common apt cache
<chillywilly> fpor my network
<derek> there is way to do that :)
<jcater> so when I say "I want it that way..." KDE responds, "ok"
<SachaS_> chillywilly: i think you can export the archive of apt-get via nfs
<chillywilly> apt-proxy looks promising, but I dunno
<chillywilly> yesm I thought of that too
<jcater> chillywilly: what are you trying to do?
<derek> apt-proxy
<chillywilly> well I;ll worry about that later first I have to do a network install on that box
<derek> i think is what you want dude
<jcater> ah
<chillywilly> yep, but I heard it has issues
<jcater> I just use squid + apt-get
<chillywilly> that's another possibility
<jcater> but that's because I already used squid to connect my remote office
<jcater> just set http_proxy to point to the squid machine and apt-get could care less :)
<chillywilly> ok, but I also want to pool the existing packages I got on this box and the packages on my server
<chillywilly> into one cache
<chillywilly> so I don't have to download a bunch of crap
Action: chillywilly is aon dialup remember ;)
<derek>  apt-proxy is a cahing proxy for use with apt on Debian systems.  It is useful anywhere where you have more than one Debian machine together on a network which is faster than your internet connection (most networks are).  It builds up a partial Debian mirror, containing those files which have been requested by clients.
<chillywilly> I should just export the apt cahce off the server via NFS
<jcater> squid is a caching proxy
<jcater> that's it's point :)
<derek> no
<derek> just get apt-proxy
<derek> squid is usable too
<derek> but unless you are using it for other things
<derek> i would just use apt-proxy
<jcater> chillywilly: real men just do a raw download each time
<derek> although....
<chillywilly> I looked at apt-proxy I also saw a post on debian planet that said it had issues
<derek> you install squid, you could turn on that 'evil sister' filter :)
<derek> and not have to use netfilter :)
<chillywilly> jcater: sure, if they have cable
<chillywilly> or DSL
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> not going to matter anymore dude
<derek> jcater also:
<derek> ecause apt-proxy understands the Debian mirror structure, it is able to manage the mirror directory more efficiently than a general cache such as Squid.  As of version 1.2.0, it can use the Packages files to determine which package versions are current and purge older versions.
<chillywilly> I'l be able to ssh in that box as root and kill her login process ;)
<chillywilly> muuwahahhaa
<chillywilly> or just nuke X
<chillywilly> killall X
<chillywilly> buh-bye
Action: derek wants to sucker chillywilly into using apt-proxy
<derek> so i can decide if i want it here :)
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> someone was saying it leaves zombie rsync processes
<chillywilly> if I could somehow get apt-move to merge my packages and then setup apt-proxy to us eit
<chillywilly> then I'd be happy
<chillywilly> I'd give it a whirl
<chillywilly> ah well I'm going to go finish the install
<chillywilly> brb
<chillywilly> you know what I need to get the woody install disks so I cna go XFS right away ;)
<derek> um they switched to http or ftp options in newest apt-proxy
<derek> as rsync is too much overhead for little gain in zipped files
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> but the docs still say it uses rsync
<derek> they were getting good performance on big files with rsync but overhead on small files was negating it
<chillywilly> maybe they are just old
<derek> so they added the option
<chillywilly> ooooh
<chillywilly> I see
<derek> * New for 1.2.9: http/ftp backend support
<chillywilly> it's an 'option'?
<chillywilly> s/?//
<chillywilly> I need to find my XFS install disk images
<chillywilly> bah
<jcater> chillywilly: did you see we now mirror your favorite library?
<chillywilly> wassat?
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/bayonne/commonc++
<chillywilly> aaah
<chillywilly> kewl
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> time to go looking on the net for those xfs disks
<derek> rofl
Action: derek runs off to watch movie
<chillywilly> I haven't hacked on commonc++ or my simulation library in some time
<chillywilly> too excited about my ODMG book and the goodies it contains ;)
<chillywilly> must hack GNUe
<jcater> GNue?
<jcater> wassat?

<chillywilly> er, mastas
<chillywilly> and this AI jcater
<chillywilly> he codes like there;s noe tommorow
<jcater> who thrives on donuts?
<jcater> I heard about him
<chillywilly> yes, this is what he craves
<jcater> but haven't seen much output lately
<jcater> I think y'all should fire him
<chillywilly> NEVER
<chillywilly> you can't get fired for voluntary work unless you are REALLY bad

<dneighbo> well folks
<dneighbo> it appears the GPL will be tested in court tomorrow
<chillywilly> where?
<chillywilly> when?
<chillywilly> what?
<chillywilly> er, who? even
<chillywilly> ;)
<dneighbo> http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/02/26/1825200
<dneighbo> mysql AB vs nusphere
<dneighbo> they are stating because nusphere violated the GPL
<dneighbo> they want to enforce clause 4
<dneighbo> and NOT forgive nusphere
<dneighbo> and thusly preventing them from using any of the gpl code
<dneighbo> which is truly wonderful
<dneighbo> i did NOT realize the GPL was structured
<dneighbo> so that is if you are caught with your hand in the cookie jar
<dneighbo> it is up to the copyright holder to determine if you can ever eat his cookies for free again :)
<dneighbo> this again points out the rms in some ways
<dneighbo> i recall him saying he FORGAVE qt
<dneighbo> and people were like ASSHOLE
<dneighbo> and he was like no its important that i forgive them
<dneighbo> i think this is what he meant
<dneighbo> that he was forgiving them in the event that had done any transgressions of a GPL nature

<chillywilly> you do know that I went to an expensive private engineering college?
<chillywilly> http://www.msoe.edu
Action: dneighbo wonders what kind of an engineering school sells trout?
<chillywilly> tuition is up to 50k per year now
<dneighbo> chillywilly we told you just get mcse and mcsd certified
<chillywilly> er, I mean 15k
<dneighbo> only costs 10bucks and a box of donuts
<chillywilly> not 50
<dneighbo> and you get to make 145k per year
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> I'd rather starve
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> why do you think I am working at a fire alarm company?
<dneighbo> i think you should turn hacker
<chillywilly> I'm not about to sell out
<dneighbo> er cuse me 'cracker'
<jcater> chillywilly: because you are concerned with the fire safety of greater WI?
<dneighbo> and start a cute little 'extortion' ring
<chillywilly> yea, that's it ;)
<ICJ> MCSE is sometimes payed by the government (social security) in Germany

<chillywilly> dneighbo: good idea
<chillywilly> ;P
<dneighbo> jcater : he only works at fire alarm co, cause the promised him his 'beat' was the wharf (lots o free slapping trout) you know take what you can get :)
<chillywilly> lol
<dneighbo> ICJ: thats wrong
<dneighbo> but then again this is a country that wanted to start SAP institutes

<chillywilly> you guys are having too much fun with this :)
<chillywilly> hey, dneighbo so what's wrong with that GPL court case?
<chillywilly> they are linking to Free Software and not releasing their code
<chillywilly> that's wrong
<dneighbo_> just dont start using musky : the official fish
<dneighbo_> http://seagrant.wisc.edu/greatlakesfish/musky.html
<chillywilly> musky are pretty big fish
<dneighbo_> chillywilly i didnt say ANYTHING was wrong with it
<chillywilly> we have lots of nothern pike too
<dneighbo_> i was merely commenting it was getting tested
<chillywilly> oh, ok
<chillywilly> not what I read though ;)
<chillywilly> [14:24:58] <dneighbo> i did NOT realize the GPL was structured

<chillywilly> this is going to set a nice precedent if they have to release their code
<dneighbo> --------------------^^^^^^^^^
<chillywilly> dude!
<dneighbo_> um it will set major precendence even if they dont and just are PREVENTED from using the code
<chillywilly> I HAVE to get one of those pillows
<chillywilly> jcater: thanks man!
<dneighbo_> as what it says is 'DONT GET CAUGHT' with your hand in the cookie jar
<chillywilly> now, when I finally get to see you guys in person I'll get to beat you with a trout
<chillywilly> awesome!
<chillywilly> dneighbo: yep, sucks to be nusphere as I think the GPL is pretty solid, imho
<reinhard> dneighbo_: is it still true that we accept documents in any format?
<reinhard> (as long as it's free)
<chillywilly> man this case sounds like a fued
<chillywilly> between nusphere and the mysql team
<dneighbo_> um probably
<dneighbo_> free format and we get assignment paperwork
<dneighbo_> we will do the work to convert if we feel the original format is too difficult
<dneighbo_> we prefer docbook first, then lyx
<dneighbo_> but rtf, txt etc etc are all ok too :0
<reinhard> ok
<chillywilly> afaics, clause 4 says if you voilate the GPL you are screwed and cannot distribute the software at all
<reinhard> just to make sure that i don't get beaten with a trout :)
<dneighbo> well hopefully its not texinfo 
<jcater> reinhard: you should be asking chillywilly instead of dneighbo :)
<dneighbo> as its a bitch to convert :)
<jcater> he's the doc police

<chillywilly> lol
<Mr_You> chilly must be getting older, but wiser?  ;-))
<chillywilly> nah, I'm just getting old
<chillywilly> bu they
<chillywilly> all my 'docs' as of late are in txt ;)
<Mr_You> my favorite
<chillywilly> so at least I am not a hypocrite
<chillywilly> sup Mr_You
<Mr_You> re btw
<dneighbo_> after doing a document in xml and transforming with xslt
<chillywilly> haven't seen you around in a while
<Mr_You> not much chilly
<dneighbo_> im just too in love with it :)
<Mr_You> yeah you've been out when I've been poppin in
Action: jcater troutslaps dneighbo
<jcater> no!!!!
<dneighbo_> or text works :)
<chillywilly> dude, I vote that we rename GEAS to trout
Action: jcater thinks someone should just write an adapter for designer and have it read and write the xml docs :)
<chillywilly> geas next generation should be called 'trout'
<dneighbo_> jcater: i have been thinking of doing a REAL simple dtd / style sheet for our specs
<chillywilly> who's with me!?!?!
<dneighbo_> just like
<dneighbo_> title
<jcater> sigh
<dneighbo_> section
<dneighbo_> paragraph
<dneighbo_> and thats it
Action: jcater gets nervous when dneighbo_ starts thinking
<chillywilly> come on
<dneighbo_> basically a VERY VERY simple docbook so to speak
<Mr_You> chilly: marketing might like that they hate acronyms
<dneighbo_> but no rush
Action: Mr_You goes to cvs update.
Action: dneighbo_ thinks Mr_You is either brave or very foolish
<chillywilly> and I still think our 'wizards' should be called 'mastas'
<chillywilly> GNUe, we bring the fun back to business!
<dneighbo_> just kidding, cvs should be 'fun' :) er i mean stable

<chillywilly> that's a good tune
<Mr_You> you could place bets on a stable cvs update
<chillywilly> 'eye of the beholder'
<Mr_You> why is my cvs update skipping gnuef, gnue-common, gnue-config
<chillywilly> they were renamed
<jcater> you probably want to do a 
<chillywilly> to forms, common, and packages, IIRC
<jcater> cvs update -Pd
<Mr_You> says its looking in /home/cvs/gnue
<Mr_You> ok
<Mr_You> I'm gonna keep in touch with that plume (Debian based LTSP app) and hopefully use it

<Mr_You> they're
<Mr_You> should I delete gnuef gnue-common gnue-config
<Mr_You> ?
<jcater> wouldn't hurt

<jcater> I need to borrow everyone's SQL experience
<jcater> how does your flavor of DB escape single quotes in strings

<jcater> Oracle is 'Jason''s Cookies'
<jcater> iirc Postgres is 'Jason\'s Cookies', but I'm not 100% sure
<chillywilly> I vote for \
<jcater> lol
<jcater> no, this isn't a democratic vote
<chillywilly> that's what I remember doing in postgres ;)
<jcater> oh, you're commenting ok PG specifically
<chillywilly> btw
<jcater> sorry
<jcater> :)
<jcater> anyone familiar w/ DB2 or MySQL
<chillywilly> wouldn't it be Jason's Donuts?
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I thought of that after typing cookies
<chillywilly> hehe

<chillywilly> damn apt-move is slow
<chillywilly> hey, I am trying out ext3 on the family PC
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: jcater exclusively uses ext3 in production now
<jcater> quite nice
<chillywilly> I like XFS though....I won't be able to make an acceptable comparison as that computer has much more horse power than this one
<reinhard> dneighbo: you were serious about texinfo?
<chillywilly> I don't know why more ppl don't do info files instead of man pages
<chillywilly> I like info pages better
<chillywilly> ok, my goal is to get chapter 2 notes done before thrusday so we can talk about some of the ODMG interfaces
<chillywilly> the ODMG Object Model classes/interfaces are all in chapter 2
<chillywilly> whihc includes a metadata interface for adding types, which probably would be relevant to neilt's "schema compiler"
<chillywilly> FYI
<Mr_You> plume.sf.net
<chillywilly> reinhard: also there's a Transaction and Database imterface in there
<chillywilly> the Transaction one is VERY similar to transaction.idl in geas/idl/
<chillywilly> ;)
<Mr_You> bbl
<chillywilly> I am also thinking that I will pull out all the ODL definitions into a copy that just contains only them and the comments about the methods/attributes as that would be more useful for developers looking to implement them....then it would not be cluttered with 'notes'

<dneighbo> reinhard yes serious
<dneighbo> texinfo is a pain, would rather just have flat text
<dneighbo> if you already have something in texinfo surely we would take it
<dneighbo> but i wouldnt go out of my way to make it texinfo
<reinhard> well i can make plain text from texinfo
<dneighbo> better yet though
<dneighbo> if you dont hvae the doc already
<chillywilly> dneighbo: when are we going to get info files on all those docbook docs ;)
<dneighbo> why write in texinfo?
Action: chillywilly wats to do 'info gnue-module-guide'
<reinhard> because it's the only format i can write
<dneighbo> ok thats reasonable then :)
<dneighbo> texinfo is fine
<dneighbo> as then we can at least immedately make txt and html
<reinhard> i can't write docbook (i tried)
Action: chillywilly learned docbook in an afternoon
<dneighbo> until someone gets around to converting them
<reinhard> i can't get lyx to run
<dneighbo> which luckily for you will probably be never :)
<dneighbo> yeah lyx can be a pain to get running 
<dneighbo> same with docbook
<reinhard> btw i can make dvi, ps, pdf, html and plain text out of texinfo
<chillywilly> just go with text then
<dneighbo> only reason i like docbook better is because one can write it with ANY editor
<dneighbo> then put on ash and let the conversion happen there
jamest_ (jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) got netsplit.
<dneighbo> texinfo same principle
<dneighbo> so its all good :)
<chillywilly> hmmm, why couldn't you fo that with texinfo though
<chillywilly> hehe
jamest_ (~jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) returned to #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> technically you could with lyx too
<chillywilly> it's all good nik-a
<dneighbo> as its just TeX
<dneighbo> but TeX is very pain in butt
<chillywilly> lyx is NOT laTeX
Action: neilt does docbook, and its sweet
<jamest_> um
<chillywilly> you actaully have to export it
<jamest_> users are finding commit and rollback terms on forms confusing
<chillywilly> but anyway
<jamest_> so how about 
<jamest_> Commit = Save
<jamest_> Rollback = Abort Changes
<reinhard> at least i got TeX to run without thinking
<dneighbo> um....
<dneighbo> commit = save (no problem)
<jamest_> neilt: yes docbook is powerfull but the !@#!@# tools drive me insane
<dneighbo> rollback = abort changes
<dneighbo> not so sure
<reinhard> what abut
<reinhard> rollback = undo
<chillywilly> jamest_: you know I looked at that too and I also thought the same exact thing
<dneighbo> undo might be more fitting
<chillywilly> nice reinhard :)
<jamest_> reinhard: I want an undo facility in there under Edit some day
<jamest_> in fact
<jamest_> one of my users has requesty Undo w/ history
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> that seems like a bit of overhead
<jamest_> so they can pull up a list of changes and pick the one they want undone
<reinhard> jamest_ maybe chilly can lend you a trout ;)
<jamest_> seems like a major pain in the ass to me
<dneighbo> they want gnue to wipe their butt too?
<chillywilly> hey now
<jamest_> File -> Xtra's -> Slap -> with trout
<chillywilly> most text editors do it
<chillywilly> so should we ;)
<chillywilly> j/k
<jamest_> undo isn't a major problem 
<jamest_> undo from  a history list is a problem
<chillywilly> vim does undo with history
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> just keep hitting 'u'
<chillywilly> well, if you had a more dovument view architecture instead of sucha  relationsl one it would be easier ;)
<chillywilly> but having a relational deal makes it harder
<chillywilly> you can't rollback after changes have been commited can you?
<jamest_> they want selective undo - "undo the 3rd change but not the 4th, 5th, or 6th ones"
<chillywilly> what apps do that?
<chillywilly> I can't even think of anything that does that
