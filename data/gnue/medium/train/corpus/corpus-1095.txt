<chillywilly> FYI
<nickr> its yellow with a touch of green or yellow with a tougch of brown
<nickr> I prefer green because it has a sligtly tart taste which is very pleasent
<nickr> the other end is too bland.. all the sugar is changing to starch
<chillywilly> I actually like them a little on the non-ripe side too ;)
<chillywilly> but that doesn't change the fact that you are sicko

<neilt> if we are intalling a new linux system, should we use woody or potato?
<jamest> well
<jamest> how linuxy are you guys there?
Action: jamest would have claimed woody 1 month ago
<jamest> as it was frozen and very stable
<jamest> then they doinked it up
<jamest> however it is back on track and _seems_ stable again
<jamest> I'm running woody on most my production servers now
<jamest> as is jcater
<jamest> IIRC
<neilt> cool
<neilt> should i should not even install potato
<neilt> just go for woody
<neilt> we are not very linuxy
<neilt> if fact we are strickly a winblows shop
<neilt> until today
<neilt> :)
<jamest> lol
<jamest> if you have a fat pipe to the net then I imagine you could just install woody
<jamest> i think i burned a woody cd here a while back myself
<jamest> but typically I've just installed potato as it was the cd i had
<jamest> then dist-upgraded to woody
<neilt> :(
<neilt> gigbit network drivers for 3com cards only work on 2.2 or 2.3
<jamest> 2.2 or 2.3 of what?
<neilt> potato = 2.2.x
<neilt> woody = 3.x
<jamest> ?
<jamest> that's the debian version #
<neilt> linux
<jamest> you need a 2.4 kernel?
<neilt> potato is currently 2.2r5
<jamest> yes
<jamest> there will not be a 2.3 debian
<jamest> however if you are talking kernel
<jamest> then woody does have a 2.4 kernel option
<neilt> let me check
<jamest> it installs 2.2 be default
<jamest> then you have to apt-get install a kernel-image-* package
<neilt> sorry
<neilt> my screwup i
<neilt> the drivers were talking about kernal version
<neilt> so I am searching for more up to date drivers
<jamest> the drivers would be included in the kernel more than likely

<jcater> no

<jbeyer> I have a question about geas. anybody here?
<dneighbo> here
<jbeyer> ok, I use the cvs snapsnapshot of GNUe
<dneighbo> ok
<jbeyer> an in geas/src I do a make check
<dneighbo> just to start the conversation, GEAS is currently for developers only
<jbeyer> should it work? I get errors:
<dneighbo> i.e. unless you are looking to 'contribute' code to GEAS or are 'curious' about it, I wouldnt bother trying to compile it
<jbeyer> the check?
<jbeyer> or geas?
<dneighbo> if you are wanting to be a developer, we are in process of restructuring it seriously
<dneighbo> and will be having discussions on the next iteration later this week
<jbeyer> I am looking at the geas code, 'cause I am curious.
<dneighbo> jbeyer: at this stage geas is more a prototype or a learning tool
<jbeyer> I want the check, if my build is ok, ...
<dneighbo> reinhard would have to answer that
<dneighbo> i think he said things should be 'making' ok
<jbeyer> where "ok", means "not more broken than what you have" :-)
<dneighbo> but i havent followed too closely over past few weeks
<dneighbo> jbeyer : exactly :)
<dneighbo> ok means compiles on my machine, lets ship it :)
<jbeyer> I compiled geas and the compile was ok, now I am at the point where I need to
<jbeyer> try things. and a working testcase is always a nice start :-)
chillywilly (danielb@d40.as29.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) left irc: "My damn controlling terminal disappeared!"
<dneighbo> um there are some samples i think
<jbeyer> can anybody point me to code that uses geas? python or C will be fine.
<dneighbo> in python
<dneighbo> that they use
<jbeyer> fine.
<dneighbo> shoudl be in the cvs tree
<jbeyer> so what have I to do? I start the geas server and then?

<jbeyer> I have some trouble starting geas - is anybody here who could help me?
<neilt> if its quick
<neilt> ./geas-server -v -d9
<reinhard> jbeyer: yes i am here too
<jbeyer> ok, is that in the source dir? geas/src ?
<reinhard> yes
<jbeyer> my conf is in the geas dir, is what you use?
Serafin (~charlie@200.59.77.31) joined #gnuenterprise.
<reinhard> no you should modify the geas.conf in the src directory
<reinhard> that's the one that is used if you run from source dir
<reinhard> the geas.conf in geas directory is what would get installed on make install
<reinhard> however we strongly advise to not install
<jbeyer> what do you use for the method-dir? I use this:
<jbeyer> methoddir            ../examples/businessobjects/methods
<jbeyer> ok?
<reinhard> yes
<jbeyer> I use postgresql, and I get this error:
<jbeyer> error: Connection to database 'gnue' failed: FATAL 1:  user "gnue" does not exist
<jbeyer> could I change the user in the geas.conf?
<jbeyer> If I change it there, then the server starts....
<jbeyer> and I get this error:
<jbeyer> addrbook.gcd:7: no format allowed for this type
<jbeyer>     text name<20>;
<jbeyer> addrbook.gcd:16: no format allowed for this type
<jbeyer>     text description<16>;
<jbeyer> and 3 more. What can I do about this?
<reinhard> that is ok
<jbeyer> so I could ignore it?
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> sorry doing 3 things at a time currently
<reinhard> you should get "the GNU Enterprise Application Server is ready"
<reinhard> at the very end of the output
<reinhard> then everything is (more or less) ok
<jbeyer> Yes, I get that.
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> then you could open another session and start examples/python/addrbook.py
<reinhard> which is a demo "front end"
<jbeyer> I get an error with that:
<jbeyer> CORBA._load_idl("../../idl/geas.idl")
<jbeyer> I could fix it by changing the path to the idl...
<jbeyer> is that ok?
<dneighbo> make sure path to idl is correct
<dneighbo> if you still get issues
<reinhard> it _should_ be correct though
<dneighbo> make sure you ahve a current version of orbit-python
<reinhard> do you have orbit-python installed?
<reinhard> um yes what derek said
<dneighbo> if you are on something other than debian (or even debian)
<dneighbo> and you have orbit-python but more than one version of python (like 1.5.2 and 2.x )
<jbeyer> yes I have orbit-python installed
<dneighbo> make sure orbit-python is installed for right python version
<jbeyer> from which directory do you start the example?
<jbeyer> I use python 2.1 and now GNUe is using it :-)
<reinhard> from the directory where addrbook.py is
<jbeyer> There was a path to the CORBAmodule.so hard coded for the python1.5 version
<reinhard> sure?
<reinhard> where?
<reinhard> i thought others got it to run with 2.x
<jbeyer> in file geas/src/methods/methods_python.c
<jbeyer> < #define ORBIT_PYTHON_SO    "/usr/lib/python1.5/site-packages/CORBAmodule.so"
<jbeyer> > #define ORBIT_PYTHON_SO    "/usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages/CORBAmodule.so"
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> ok
<jbeyer> no problem :-)
<reinhard> thanks anyway
<jbeyer> now I get this:
<jbeyer> error: Password failed 'guest'
<jbeyer> what passwd could that be?
<reinhard> db password?
<reinhard> you can set the password in geas.conf
<jbeyer> ok, I am not a postgresql wizard. Do you know how to set it?
<reinhard> you know what the password is?
<jbeyer> for postgresql?
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> for the user you use to connect to postgresql
<jbeyer> I could connet without a passwd. I installed the db a few weeks ago...
<reinhard> hm
<jbeyer> and it works fine for the cmdline "psql"
<reinhard> did you provide a shadowpw file?
<jbeyer> for the machine or for the db?
<jbeyer> should I drop the db named gnue and create it new?
<reinhard> please try that
<reinhard> i did
<reinhard> createuser <some new username>
<reinhard> with that user createdb gnue
<reinhard> and connect with the new user
<reinhard> and that did work
<reinhard> i am no postgresql wizard either :(
<reinhard> jbeyer: 2 things before i have to leave
<reinhard> 1. i am happy you play with geas and we are looking forward to your help
<jbeyer> ok
<reinhard> 2. i'm not sure if it makes sense to put much effort into this incarnation of geas
<reinhard> let me explain
<jbeyer> ?
<reinhard> we got this contributed from a company that wrote geas for their own needs
<reinhard> we decided to take it and adapt it to our needs
<reinhard> however we found out it is a PITA
<reinhard> and last week we finally decided to do a rewrite from scratch
<jbeyer> PITA == ?
<reinhard> pain in the a**
<jbeyer> ok.
<jbeyer> and you started with the rewrite?
<reinhard> so to speak yes
<jbeyer> is any code available?
<reinhard> in the form that we are discussing to agree on the concepts :)
<reinhard> one of the experiences from existing geas is
<reinhard> 1. code 2. think is the wrong way around :)
<jbeyer> come on :-)
<reinhard> we are working on a whitepaper
<reinhard> and there is a drawing on the website
<reinhard> you could see discussions on the gnue-dev@gnu.org mailing list
<reinhard> and we would very much appreciate your input on that topic
<reinhard> not saying you must stop playing with GEASv1
<reinhard> but explaining there might be better use of your effort :)
<reinhard> if you have further questions i will be here probably tomorrow same time
<reinhard> or neilt or chilliwilly might be able to help if they are here
<jbeyer> ok. I will take a look @ the mailing list.
<reinhard> sorry i have to go now

<chillywilly> consuming ODMG spec
<chillywilly> trying to get the notes on the second chapter done so I can read the rest and get  to some hacking
<chillywilly> as this shit is boooring
<chillywilly> I would rather od notes and writing some code in parallel
<chillywilly> s/od/do
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> as notes doesn't amount to much without some code

<jbailey> It's a spec.  Specs are *supposed* to be boring.
<jbailey> When they get creative, you have Microsoft.
<chillywilly> why thank you jbailey
<chillywilly> only reason I am writing some notes is that some ppl are too cheap to buy the book ;)
<chillywilly> woops, did I say that out loud?

<chillywilly> actually I figured it would save us all some time and money ;)
<jbailey> Write a book on the spec and get it published by Gnu press...
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> that's not a half bad idea
<jbailey> I'm doing one on tcp/ip
<chillywilly> so I hear
<jbailey> Gah!  Rumours again! =)
<chillywilly> well I could write a book on my implementation of the standard
<jbailey> (Or you're stalking me...)
<chillywilly> nah, you told me about it dude
<chillywilly> remember?
<chillywilly> oh dude
<chillywilly> my buddy wants tro go to toronto
<jbailey> No, but I'm sure that grepping through my xchat logs would find it.
<chillywilly> for a vacation
<jbailey> chillywilly: Tell him not to do it!
<jbailey> this is an evil place!
<chillywilly> but I willl go with him
<chillywilly> and visit you
<chillywilly> ;)
<jbailey> When are you thinking?
<chillywilly> umm
<chillywilly> I dunno
<chillywilly> he said I was welcome to go with him
<chillywilly> however
<jbailey> Well, check with me first if you have options on when.  I'm travelling in August.
<jbailey> (And several weekends before that)
<chillywilly> I'm not a single guy that can just go off and atke vacations without my familiy
<chillywilly> er, take
<chillywilly> where?
<chillywilly> I think it would be earlier than august
<chillywilly> much earlier
<chillywilly> I think they would only stay a couple of days
<chillywilly> last time they wen tey took the train
<jbailey> Nice.
<chillywilly> went they
<chillywilly> my buddy did not like it
<jbailey> The train station is a 15 minute walk from here.
<chillywilly> it was too long
phil_c (username@public1-cosh3-3-cust12.cosh.broadband.ntl.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jbailey> Impatience is a vice.
<chillywilly> I told him that was nothing
<chillywilly> as we drive to NC for about 18 hours every summer to visit family
<chillywilly> NC == North Carolina
<jbailey> It was less than 18 hours?
<chillywilly> just in case you didn't know our state abbreviations
<jbailey> I don't, thanks for the heads up.
<chillywilly> it takes about 18 hours at the least
<chillywilly> soemtimes it takes 20
<jbailey> But his train ride was less than 18 hours?
<chillywilly> it was 12
<chillywilly> accroding to him
<chillywilly> er, according
<chillywilly> that's nothing IMHO
<chillywilly> all you need to do is find something to do
<chillywilly> right ;)
<chillywilly> heh, all you have to do is bring a laptop and you can code for 12 hours ;)
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<jbailey> Or a deck of cards.  Or a pile of books.
<chillywilly> that sounds like a good idea
<chillywilly> well I guess he was saying that they are going to fly this time
<chillywilly> (btw, this guy that I am talking about is the guy that  I work with)
<chillywilly> crazymike
<jbailey> Cool.
<chillywilly> he's been on IRC a couple of times
<chillywilly> right now I think he
<jbailey> I don't know if I can put you up, though... We live in a one room place.
<jbailey> But it would be cool to hang out.
<chillywilly> bah, you don't have to do all that
<chillywilly> I can just say 'hi'
<jbailey> Fine, I won't hang out with you. =)
<chillywilly> no I mean "put me up"
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<jbailey> Well, I tried to do that in Vancouver when I was able to.
<chillywilly> I'll have to bring a trout especially for you
<jbailey> But with 2 people and 2 cats in a one-room 550sq ft appt., it's a little cramped.
<jbailey> chillywilly: You can't bring meat over the border.
<jbailey> chillywilly: Nor citrus fruit.
<chillywilly> are the customs people going to have dogs to sniff it out?
<chillywilly> otherwise they can't stop me
<chillywilly> muuwhahahha
<chillywilly> OR
<chillywilly> I'll just get a canadian trout
<chillywilly> to slap you with
<jbailey> IIRC, Canadian trout are endanged.  Perhaps a Salmon.
<chillywilly> oh really
<chillywilly> hmmm
<jbailey> You could try Tuna, but please make sure it's dolphin safe.
<chillywilly> prehaps then you will be beaten with a salmon
<jbailey> I'd say "whatever your fetish", but I wouldn't really mean it.
<chillywilly> hmmm

Nick change: dnSleep -> derek
<derek> the meeting isnt 4 hours
<derek> i gave two options
<derek> both being 4 hour blocks
<chillywilly> oh
<derek> i assuming we would do it in 1.5 hour session somewhere in the 4 hour block
<derek> i.e. it was process of SLOWLY whittling down what would work :)
<neilt> i would also assume the meeting will be a bit moderated, so we keep on track
Action: dtm gets out the hose
<chillywilly> hey neilt, you got cvs locked man ;)
<chillywilly> wassa matta fa you eh?
<chillywilly> cvs server: [20:07:37] waiting for anoncvs's lock in /cvsroot/gnue/gnue/geas/src/mac/geas-mac.pbproj
<chillywilly> cvs server: [20:08:07] obtained lock in /cvsroot/gnue/gnue/geas/src/mac/geas-mac.pbproj
<chillywilly> danielb@obfuscation:~/src/cvs/gnue$ 
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> that was a first for me
<neilt> wtf
<neilt> how can annoncvs lock cvs
<chillywilly> I dunno
<chillywilly> seems pretty goofy to me too
Action: derek has to attend to sick chitlins be back in an hour or so
<derek> i will do an announce on geas-dev for option 1 as i think everyone said 'yeah' to it
<derek> bbs
<neilt> chillywilly: whats even wierder is that is a directory
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> now I am curious
<chillywilly> If several developers try to run CVS at the same time, one may get
<chillywilly> the following message:
<chillywilly>      [11:43:23] waiting for bach's lock in /usr/local/cvsroot/foo
<neilt> so it may have gone away
<neilt> now
<chillywilly>  CVS will try again every 30 seconds, and either continue with the
<chillywilly> operation or print the message again, if it still needs to wait.  If a
<chillywilly> lock seems to stick around for an undue amount of time, find the person
<chillywilly> holding the lock and ask them about the cvs command they are running.
<chillywilly> If they aren't running a cvs command, look in the repository directory
<chillywilly> mentioned in the message and remove files which they own whose names
<chillywilly> start with `#cvs.rfl', `#cvs.wfl', or `#cvs.lock'.
<chillywilly>    Note that these locks are to protect CVS's internal data structures
<chillywilly> and have no relationship to the word "lock" in the sense used by
<chillywilly> RCS--which refers to reserved checkouts (*note Multiple developers::).
<chillywilly>    Any number of people can be reading from a given repository at a
<chillywilly> time; only when someone is writing do the locks prevent other people
<chillywilly> from reading or writing.
<chillywilly> it did go away

<chillywilly> as soon as you got done doing what you were doing

<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> sorry
<chillywilly> I dunno why I said it was you
<chillywilly> maybe because it lock the 'mac' project file dir
<chillywilly> I just naturally thought of you

<chillywilly> my subconcious mind told me to type that

<neilt> cool, i like people thinking about me

<chillywilly> hrrrm, that could be construed as 'eogtistical' thing to say
<chillywilly> but, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt
<neilt> :)
<jamest> ....boy it'd sure be great if neilt would do this, this, this, this, this, this, oh and this.  Take the blame for this and that and..........
<chillywilly> it's neilt's fault!
<chillywilly> that's it!

<chillywilly> hey
<chillywilly> how do you keep your desktops in sync jcater?
<jcater> it involves a whip and chocolate syrup
<jcater> oops
<jcater> wrong question
<chillywilly> I talked my mom into letting me install Debian
<chillywilly> on her machine ;)
<jcater> waddya mean, in sync?
<chillywilly> oh yea
<chillywilly> you have diskless clients
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> that's the easy way ;)
Action: jcater is confused
<chillywilly> that was a joke
<derek> you know n'sync... like.... "i want it that way...."
<jcater> ah
<jcater> well
<jcater> I use KDE
<chillywilly> what i really want is a common apt cache
<chillywilly> fpor my network
<derek> there is way to do that :)
<jcater> so when I say "I want it that way..." KDE responds, "ok"
<SachaS_> chillywilly: i think you can export the archive of apt-get via nfs
<chillywilly> apt-proxy looks promising, but I dunno
<chillywilly> yesm I thought of that too
<jcater> chillywilly: what are you trying to do?
<derek> apt-proxy
<chillywilly> well I;ll worry about that later first I have to do a network install on that box
<derek> i think is what you want dude
<jcater> ah
<chillywilly> yep, but I heard it has issues
<jcater> I just use squid + apt-get
<chillywilly> that's another possibility
<jcater> but that's because I already used squid to connect my remote office
<jcater> just set http_proxy to point to the squid machine and apt-get could care less :)
<chillywilly> ok, but I also want to pool the existing packages I got on this box and the packages on my server
<chillywilly> into one cache
<chillywilly> so I don't have to download a bunch of crap
Action: chillywilly is aon dialup remember ;)
<derek>  apt-proxy is a cahing proxy for use with apt on Debian systems.  It is useful anywhere where you have more than one Debian machine together on a network which is faster than your internet connection (most networks are).  It builds up a partial Debian mirror, containing those files which have been requested by clients.
<chillywilly> I should just export the apt cahce off the server via NFS
<jcater> squid is a caching proxy
<jcater> that's it's point :)
<derek> no
<derek> just get apt-proxy
<derek> squid is usable too
<derek> but unless you are using it for other things
<derek> i would just use apt-proxy
<jcater> chillywilly: real men just do a raw download each time
<derek> although....
<chillywilly> I looked at apt-proxy I also saw a post on debian planet that said it had issues
<derek> you install squid, you could turn on that 'evil sister' filter :)
<derek> and not have to use netfilter :)
<chillywilly> jcater: sure, if they have cable
<chillywilly> or DSL
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> not going to matter anymore dude
<derek> jcater also:
<derek> ecause apt-proxy understands the Debian mirror structure, it is able to manage the mirror directory more efficiently than a general cache such as Squid.  As of version 1.2.0, it can use the Packages files to determine which package versions are current and purge older versions.
<chillywilly> I'l be able to ssh in that box as root and kill her login process ;)
<chillywilly> muuwahahhaa
<chillywilly> or just nuke X
<chillywilly> killall X
<chillywilly> buh-bye
Action: derek wants to sucker chillywilly into using apt-proxy
<derek> so i can decide if i want it here :)
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> someone was saying it leaves zombie rsync processes
<chillywilly> if I could somehow get apt-move to merge my packages and then setup apt-proxy to us eit
<chillywilly> then I'd be happy
<chillywilly> I'd give it a whirl
<chillywilly> ah well I'm going to go finish the install
<chillywilly> brb
<chillywilly> you know what I need to get the woody install disks so I cna go XFS right away ;)
<derek> um they switched to http or ftp options in newest apt-proxy
<derek> as rsync is too much overhead for little gain in zipped files
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> but the docs still say it uses rsync
<derek> they were getting good performance on big files with rsync but overhead on small files was negating it
<chillywilly> maybe they are just old
<derek> so they added the option
<chillywilly> ooooh
<chillywilly> I see
<derek> * New for 1.2.9: http/ftp backend support
<chillywilly> it's an 'option'?
<chillywilly> s/?//
<chillywilly> I need to find my XFS install disk images
<chillywilly> bah
<jcater> chillywilly: did you see we now mirror your favorite library?
<chillywilly> wassat?
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/bayonne/commonc++
<chillywilly> aaah
<chillywilly> kewl
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> time to go looking on the net for those xfs disks
<derek> rofl
Action: derek runs off to watch movie
<chillywilly> I haven't hacked on commonc++ or my simulation library in some time
<chillywilly> too excited about my ODMG book and the goodies it contains ;)
<chillywilly> must hack GNUe
<jcater> GNue?
<jcater> wassat?
<chillywilly> I dunno something about goat sex, trout slappings, and over zealous matas
<chillywilly> er, mastas
<chillywilly> and this AI jcater
<chillywilly> he codes like there;s noe tommorow
<jcater> who thrives on donuts?
<jcater> I heard about him
<chillywilly> yes, this is what he craves
<jcater> but haven't seen much output lately
<jcater> I think y'all should fire him
<chillywilly> NEVER
<chillywilly> you can't get fired for voluntary work unless you are REALLY bad

<dneighbo> well folks
<dneighbo> it appears the GPL will be tested in court tomorrow
<chillywilly> where?
<chillywilly> when?
<chillywilly> what?
<chillywilly> er, who? even
<chillywilly> ;)
<dneighbo> http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/02/26/1825200
<dneighbo> mysql AB vs nusphere
<dneighbo> they are stating because nusphere violated the GPL
<dneighbo> they want to enforce clause 4
<dneighbo> and NOT forgive nusphere
<dneighbo> and thusly preventing them from using any of the gpl code
<dneighbo> which is truly wonderful
<dneighbo> i did NOT realize the GPL was structured
<dneighbo> so that is if you are caught with your hand in the cookie jar
<dneighbo> it is up to the copyright holder to determine if you can ever eat his cookies for free again :)
<dneighbo> this again points out the rms in some ways
<dneighbo> i recall him saying he FORGAVE qt
<dneighbo> and people were like ASSHOLE
<dneighbo> and he was like no its important that i forgive them
<dneighbo> i think this is what he meant
<dneighbo> that he was forgiving them in the event that had done any transgressions of a GPL nature

<dneighbo> i think east coast
<chillywilly> gah, that phone call was lame
<chillywilly> they freaking reading the packet back to me and shit
<chillywilly> how stupid is that

<dneighbo> i guess trout are expensive now a days?
<chillywilly> you do know that I went to an expensive private engineering college?
<chillywilly> http://www.msoe.edu
Action: dneighbo wonders what kind of an engineering school sells trout?
<chillywilly> tuition is up to 50k per year now
<dneighbo> chillywilly we told you just get mcse and mcsd certified
<chillywilly> er, I mean 15k
<dneighbo> only costs 10bucks and a box of donuts
<chillywilly> not 50
<dneighbo> and you get to make 145k per year
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> I'd rather starve
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> why do you think I am working at a fire alarm company?
<dneighbo> i think you should turn hacker
<chillywilly> I'm not about to sell out
<dneighbo> er cuse me 'cracker'
<jcater> chillywilly: because you are concerned with the fire safety of greater WI?
<dneighbo> and start a cute little 'extortion' ring
<chillywilly> yea, that's it ;)
<ICJ> MCSE is sometimes payed by the government (social security) in Germany
<ICJ> afai heard
<chillywilly> dneighbo: good idea
<chillywilly> ;P
<dneighbo> jcater : he only works at fire alarm co, cause the promised him his 'beat' was the wharf (lots o free slapping trout) you know take what you can get :)
<chillywilly> lol
<dneighbo> ICJ: thats wrong
<dneighbo> but then again this is a country that wanted to start SAP institutes

<chillywilly> look out

<chillywilly> you guys are having too much fun with this :)
<chillywilly> hey, dneighbo so what's wrong with that GPL court case?
<chillywilly> they are linking to Free Software and not releasing their code
<chillywilly> that's wrong
<dneighbo_> just dont start using musky : the official fish
<dneighbo_> http://seagrant.wisc.edu/greatlakesfish/musky.html
<chillywilly> musky are pretty big fish
<dneighbo_> chillywilly i didnt say ANYTHING was wrong with it
<chillywilly> we have lots of nothern pike too
<dneighbo_> i was merely commenting it was getting tested
<chillywilly> oh, ok
<chillywilly> not what I read though ;)
<chillywilly> [14:24:58] <dneighbo> i did NOT realize the GPL was structured

<dneighbo_> i smiled at end of that plus above that

<chillywilly> just giving you crap man
<dneighbo> <dneighbo> they want to enforce clause 4

<dneighbo> <dneighbo> and thusly preventing them from using any of the gpl code
<dneighbo> <dneighbo> which is truly wonderful
<chillywilly> this is going to set a nice precedent if they have to release their code
<dneighbo> --------------------^^^^^^^^^
<chillywilly> dude!
<dneighbo_> um it will set major precendence even if they dont and just are PREVENTED from using the code
<chillywilly> I HAVE to get one of those pillows
<chillywilly> jcater: thanks man!
<dneighbo_> as what it says is 'DONT GET CAUGHT' with your hand in the cookie jar
<chillywilly> now, when I finally get to see you guys in person I'll get to beat you with a trout
<chillywilly> awesome!
<chillywilly> dneighbo: yep, sucks to be nusphere as I think the GPL is pretty solid, imho
<reinhard> dneighbo_: is it still true that we accept documents in any format?
<reinhard> (as long as it's free)
<chillywilly> man this case sounds like a fued
<chillywilly> between nusphere and the mysql team
<dneighbo_> um probably
<dneighbo_> free format and we get assignment paperwork
<dneighbo_> we will do the work to convert if we feel the original format is too difficult
<dneighbo_> we prefer docbook first, then lyx
<dneighbo_> but rtf, txt etc etc are all ok too :0
<reinhard> ok
<chillywilly> afaics, clause 4 says if you voilate the GPL you are screwed and cannot distribute the software at all
<reinhard> just to make sure that i don't get beaten with a trout :)
<dneighbo> well hopefully its not texinfo 
<jcater> reinhard: you should be asking chillywilly instead of dneighbo :)
<dneighbo> as its a bitch to convert :)
<jcater> he's the doc police

<chillywilly> nah, I'm just getting old
<chillywilly> bu they
<chillywilly> all my 'docs' as of late are in txt ;)
<Mr_You> my favorite
<chillywilly> so at least I am not a hypocrite
<chillywilly> sup Mr_You
<Mr_You> re btw
<dneighbo_> after doing a document in xml and transforming with xslt
<chillywilly> haven't seen you around in a while
<Mr_You> not much chilly
<dneighbo_> im just too in love with it :)
<Mr_You> yeah you've been out when I've been poppin in
Action: jcater troutslaps dneighbo
<jcater> no!!!!
<dneighbo_> or text works :)
<chillywilly> dude, I vote that we rename GEAS to trout
Action: jcater thinks someone should just write an adapter for designer and have it read and write the xml docs :)
<chillywilly> geas next generation should be called 'trout'
<dneighbo_> jcater: i have been thinking of doing a REAL simple dtd / style sheet for our specs
<chillywilly> who's with me!?!?!
<dneighbo_> just like
<dneighbo_> title
<jcater> sigh
<dneighbo_> section
<dneighbo_> paragraph
<dneighbo_> and thats it
Action: jcater gets nervous when dneighbo_ starts thinking
<chillywilly> come on
<dneighbo_> basically a VERY VERY simple docbook so to speak
<Mr_You> chilly: marketing might like that they hate acronyms
<dneighbo_> but no rush
Action: Mr_You goes to cvs update.
Action: dneighbo_ thinks Mr_You is either brave or very foolish
<chillywilly> and I still think our 'wizards' should be called 'mastas'
<chillywilly> GNUe, we bring the fun back to business!
<dneighbo_> just kidding, cvs should be 'fun' :) er i mean stable

<chillywilly> that's a good tune
<Mr_You> you could place bets on a stable cvs update
<chillywilly> 'eye of the beholder'
<Mr_You> why is my cvs update skipping gnuef, gnue-common, gnue-config
<chillywilly> they were renamed
<jcater> you probably want to do a 
<chillywilly> to forms, common, and packages, IIRC
<jcater> cvs update -Pd
<Mr_You> says its looking in /home/cvs/gnue
<Mr_You> ok
<Mr_You> I'm gonna keep in touch with that plume (Debian based LTSP app) and hopefully use it
<Mr_You> their beginning development again
<Mr_You> they're
<Mr_You> should I delete gnuef gnue-common gnue-config
<Mr_You> ?
<jcater> wouldn't hurt
<Mr_You> plume is built around python, XML, GTK

<chillywilly> XML shcexml
<chillywilly> er, schmexml
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I need to borrow everyone's SQL experience
<jcater> how does your flavor of DB escape single quotes in strings
<jcater> i.e., if you have Jason's Cookies, how would you do that in an insert
<jcater> Oracle is 'Jason''s Cookies'
<jcater> iirc Postgres is 'Jason\'s Cookies', but I'm not 100% sure
<chillywilly> I vote for \
<jcater> lol
<jcater> no, this isn't a democratic vote
<chillywilly> that's what I remember doing in postgres ;)
<jcater> oh, you're commenting ok PG specifically
<chillywilly> btw
<jcater> sorry
<jcater> :)
<jcater> anyone familiar w/ DB2 or MySQL
<chillywilly> wouldn't it be Jason's Donuts?
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I thought of that after typing cookies
<chillywilly> hehe
Action: jcater is slow
<chillywilly> well, we know you are form the south so...
<chillywilly> j/k
<chillywilly> damn apt-move is slow
<chillywilly> hey, I am trying out ext3 on the family PC
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: jcater exclusively uses ext3 in production now
<jcater> quite nice
<chillywilly> I like XFS though....I won't be able to make an acceptable comparison as that computer has much more horse power than this one
<reinhard> dneighbo: you were serious about texinfo?
<chillywilly> I don't know why more ppl don't do info files instead of man pages
<chillywilly> I like info pages better
<chillywilly> ok, my goal is to get chapter 2 notes done before thrusday so we can talk about some of the ODMG interfaces
<chillywilly> the ODMG Object Model classes/interfaces are all in chapter 2
<chillywilly> whihc includes a metadata interface for adding types, which probably would be relevant to neilt's "schema compiler"
<chillywilly> FYI
<Mr_You> plume.sf.net
<chillywilly> reinhard: also there's a Transaction and Database imterface in there
<chillywilly> the Transaction one is VERY similar to transaction.idl in geas/idl/
<chillywilly> ;)
<Mr_You> bbl
<chillywilly> I am also thinking that I will pull out all the ODL definitions into a copy that just contains only them and the comments about the methods/attributes as that would be more useful for developers looking to implement them....then it would not be cluttered with 'notes'

<dneighbo> reinhard yes serious
<dneighbo> texinfo is a pain, would rather just have flat text
<dneighbo> if you already have something in texinfo surely we would take it
<dneighbo> but i wouldnt go out of my way to make it texinfo
<reinhard> well i can make plain text from texinfo
<dneighbo> better yet though
<dneighbo> if you dont hvae the doc already
<chillywilly> dneighbo: when are we going to get info files on all those docbook docs ;)
<dneighbo> why write in texinfo?
Action: chillywilly wats to do 'info gnue-module-guide'
<reinhard> because it's the only format i can write
<dneighbo> ok thats reasonable then :)
<dneighbo> texinfo is fine
<dneighbo> as then we can at least immedately make txt and html
<reinhard> i can't write docbook (i tried)
Action: chillywilly learned docbook in an afternoon
<dneighbo> until someone gets around to converting them
<reinhard> i can't get lyx to run
<dneighbo> which luckily for you will probably be never :)
<dneighbo> yeah lyx can be a pain to get running 
<dneighbo> same with docbook
<reinhard> btw i can make dvi, ps, pdf, html and plain text out of texinfo
<chillywilly> just go with text then
<dneighbo> only reason i like docbook better is because one can write it with ANY editor
<dneighbo> then put on ash and let the conversion happen there
jamest_ (jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) got netsplit.
<dneighbo> texinfo same principle
<dneighbo> so its all good :)
<chillywilly> hmmm, why couldn't you fo that with texinfo though
<chillywilly> hehe
jamest_ (~jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) returned to #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> technically you could with lyx too
<chillywilly> it's all good nik-a
<dneighbo> as its just TeX
<dneighbo> but TeX is very pain in butt
<chillywilly> lyx is NOT laTeX
Action: neilt does docbook, and its sweet
<jamest_> um
<chillywilly> you actaully have to export it
<jamest_> users are finding commit and rollback terms on forms confusing
<chillywilly> but anyway
<jamest_> so how about 
<jamest_> Commit = Save
<jamest_> Rollback = Abort Changes
<reinhard> at least i got TeX to run without thinking
<dneighbo> um....
<dneighbo> commit = save (no problem)
<jamest_> neilt: yes docbook is powerfull but the !@#!@# tools drive me insane
<dneighbo> rollback = abort changes
<dneighbo> not so sure
<reinhard> what abut
<reinhard> rollback = undo
<chillywilly> jamest_: you know I looked at that too and I also thought the same exact thing
<dneighbo> undo might be more fitting
<chillywilly> nice reinhard :)
<jamest_> reinhard: I want an undo facility in there under Edit some day
<jamest_> in fact
<jamest_> one of my users has requesty Undo w/ history
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> that seems like a bit of overhead
<jamest_> so they can pull up a list of changes and pick the one they want undone
<reinhard> jamest_ maybe chilly can lend you a trout ;)
<jamest_> seems like a major pain in the ass to me
<dneighbo> they want gnue to wipe their butt too?
<chillywilly> hey now
<jamest_> File -> Xtra's -> Slap -> with trout
<chillywilly> most text editors do it
<chillywilly> so should we ;)
<chillywilly> j/k
<jamest_> undo isn't a major problem 
<jamest_> undo from  a history list is a problem
<chillywilly> vim does undo with history
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> just keep hitting 'u'
<chillywilly> well, if you had a more dovument view architecture instead of sucha  relationsl one it would be easier ;)
<chillywilly> but having a relational deal makes it harder
<chillywilly> you can't rollback after changes have been commited can you?
<jamest_> they want selective undo - "undo the 3rd change but not the 4th, 5th, or 6th ones"
<chillywilly> what apps do that?
<chillywilly> I can't even think of anything that does that
