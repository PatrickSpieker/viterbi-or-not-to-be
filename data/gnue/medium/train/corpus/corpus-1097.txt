<dneighbo> well folks
<dneighbo> it appears the GPL will be tested in court tomorrow
<chillywilly> where?
<chillywilly> when?
<chillywilly> what?
<chillywilly> er, who? even
<chillywilly> ;)
<dneighbo> http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/02/26/1825200
<dneighbo> mysql AB vs nusphere
<dneighbo> they are stating because nusphere violated the GPL
<dneighbo> they want to enforce clause 4
<dneighbo> and NOT forgive nusphere
<dneighbo> and thusly preventing them from using any of the gpl code
<dneighbo> which is truly wonderful
<dneighbo> i did NOT realize the GPL was structured
<dneighbo> so that is if you are caught with your hand in the cookie jar
<dneighbo> it is up to the copyright holder to determine if you can ever eat his cookies for free again :)
<dneighbo> this again points out the rms in some ways
<dneighbo> i recall him saying he FORGAVE qt
<dneighbo> and people were like ASSHOLE
<dneighbo> and he was like no its important that i forgive them
<dneighbo> i think this is what he meant
<dneighbo> that he was forgiving them in the event that had done any transgressions of a GPL nature

<chillywilly> gah, that phone call was lame
<chillywilly> they freaking reading the packet back to me and shit

<chillywilly> you do know that I went to an expensive private engineering college?
<chillywilly> http://www.msoe.edu
Action: dneighbo wonders what kind of an engineering school sells trout?
<chillywilly> tuition is up to 50k per year now
<dneighbo> chillywilly we told you just get mcse and mcsd certified
<chillywilly> er, I mean 15k
<dneighbo> only costs 10bucks and a box of donuts
<chillywilly> not 50
<dneighbo> and you get to make 145k per year
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> I'd rather starve
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> why do you think I am working at a fire alarm company?
<dneighbo> i think you should turn hacker
<chillywilly> I'm not about to sell out
<dneighbo> er cuse me 'cracker'
<jcater> chillywilly: because you are concerned with the fire safety of greater WI?
<dneighbo> and start a cute little 'extortion' ring
<chillywilly> yea, that's it ;)
<ICJ> MCSE is sometimes payed by the government (social security) in Germany
<ICJ> afai heard
<chillywilly> dneighbo: good idea
<chillywilly> ;P
<dneighbo> jcater : he only works at fire alarm co, cause the promised him his 'beat' was the wharf (lots o free slapping trout) you know take what you can get :)

<dneighbo> ICJ: thats wrong
<dneighbo> but then again this is a country that wanted to start SAP institutes

<chillywilly> they are linking to Free Software and not releasing their code
<chillywilly> that's wrong
<dneighbo_> just dont start using musky : the official fish
<dneighbo_> http://seagrant.wisc.edu/greatlakesfish/musky.html
<chillywilly> musky are pretty big fish
<dneighbo_> chillywilly i didnt say ANYTHING was wrong with it

<chillywilly> not what I read though ;)

<dneighbo_> um it will set major precendence even if they dont and just are PREVENTED from using the code
<chillywilly> I HAVE to get one of those pillows
<chillywilly> jcater: thanks man!
<dneighbo_> as what it says is 'DONT GET CAUGHT' with your hand in the cookie jar
<chillywilly> now, when I finally get to see you guys in person I'll get to beat you with a trout
<chillywilly> awesome!
<chillywilly> dneighbo: yep, sucks to be nusphere as I think the GPL is pretty solid, imho
<reinhard> dneighbo_: is it still true that we accept documents in any format?
<reinhard> (as long as it's free)
<chillywilly> man this case sounds like a fued
<chillywilly> between nusphere and the mysql team
<dneighbo_> um probably
<dneighbo_> free format and we get assignment paperwork
<dneighbo_> we will do the work to convert if we feel the original format is too difficult
<dneighbo_> we prefer docbook first, then lyx
<dneighbo_> but rtf, txt etc etc are all ok too :0
<reinhard> ok
<chillywilly> afaics, clause 4 says if you voilate the GPL you are screwed and cannot distribute the software at all
<reinhard> just to make sure that i don't get beaten with a trout :)
<dneighbo> well hopefully its not texinfo 
<jcater> reinhard: you should be asking chillywilly instead of dneighbo :)

<chillywilly> haven't seen you around in a while

Action: jcater troutslaps dneighbo
<jcater> no!!!!
<dneighbo_> or text works :)
<chillywilly> dude, I vote that we rename GEAS to trout
Action: jcater thinks someone should just write an adapter for designer and have it read and write the xml docs :)
<chillywilly> geas next generation should be called 'trout'
<dneighbo_> jcater: i have been thinking of doing a REAL simple dtd / style sheet for our specs
<chillywilly> who's with me!?!?!
<dneighbo_> just like
<dneighbo_> title
<jcater> sigh
<dneighbo_> section
<dneighbo_> paragraph
<dneighbo_> and thats it
Action: jcater gets nervous when dneighbo_ starts thinking
<chillywilly> come on
<dneighbo_> basically a VERY VERY simple docbook so to speak
<Mr_You> chilly: marketing might like that they hate acronyms
<dneighbo_> but no rush
Action: Mr_You goes to cvs update.
Action: dneighbo_ thinks Mr_You is either brave or very foolish
<chillywilly> and I still think our 'wizards' should be called 'mastas'
<chillywilly> GNUe, we bring the fun back to business!
<dneighbo_> just kidding, cvs should be 'fun' :) er i mean stable

<chillywilly> that's a good tune

<Mr_You> why is my cvs update skipping gnuef, gnue-common, gnue-config
<chillywilly> they were renamed
<jcater> you probably want to do a 
<chillywilly> to forms, common, and packages, IIRC
<jcater> cvs update -Pd
<Mr_You> says its looking in /home/cvs/gnue
<Mr_You> ok

<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I need to borrow everyone's SQL experience
<jcater> how does your flavor of DB escape single quotes in strings

<jcater> Oracle is 'Jason''s Cookies'
<jcater> iirc Postgres is 'Jason\'s Cookies', but I'm not 100% sure
<chillywilly> I vote for \
<jcater> lol
<jcater> no, this isn't a democratic vote
<chillywilly> that's what I remember doing in postgres ;)
<jcater> oh, you're commenting ok PG specifically
<chillywilly> btw
<jcater> sorry
<jcater> :)
<jcater> anyone familiar w/ DB2 or MySQL
<chillywilly> wouldn't it be Jason's Donuts?
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I thought of that after typing cookies
<chillywilly> hehe

<chillywilly> well, we know you are form the south so...
<chillywilly> j/k
<chillywilly> damn apt-move is slow
<chillywilly> hey, I am trying out ext3 on the family PC
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: jcater exclusively uses ext3 in production now
<jcater> quite nice
<chillywilly> I like XFS though....I won't be able to make an acceptable comparison as that computer has much more horse power than this one
<reinhard> dneighbo: you were serious about texinfo?
<chillywilly> I don't know why more ppl don't do info files instead of man pages
<chillywilly> I like info pages better
<chillywilly> ok, my goal is to get chapter 2 notes done before thrusday so we can talk about some of the ODMG interfaces
<chillywilly> the ODMG Object Model classes/interfaces are all in chapter 2
<chillywilly> whihc includes a metadata interface for adding types, which probably would be relevant to neilt's "schema compiler"
<chillywilly> FYI
<Mr_You> plume.sf.net
<chillywilly> reinhard: also there's a Transaction and Database imterface in there
<chillywilly> the Transaction one is VERY similar to transaction.idl in geas/idl/
<chillywilly> ;)
<Mr_You> bbl
<chillywilly> I am also thinking that I will pull out all the ODL definitions into a copy that just contains only them and the comments about the methods/attributes as that would be more useful for developers looking to implement them....then it would not be cluttered with 'notes'

<dneighbo> reinhard yes serious
<dneighbo> texinfo is a pain, would rather just have flat text
<dneighbo> if you already have something in texinfo surely we would take it
<dneighbo> but i wouldnt go out of my way to make it texinfo
<reinhard> well i can make plain text from texinfo
<dneighbo> better yet though
<dneighbo> if you dont hvae the doc already
<chillywilly> dneighbo: when are we going to get info files on all those docbook docs ;)
<dneighbo> why write in texinfo?
Action: chillywilly wats to do 'info gnue-module-guide'
<reinhard> because it's the only format i can write
<dneighbo> ok thats reasonable then :)
<dneighbo> texinfo is fine
<dneighbo> as then we can at least immedately make txt and html
<reinhard> i can't write docbook (i tried)
Action: chillywilly learned docbook in an afternoon
<dneighbo> until someone gets around to converting them
<reinhard> i can't get lyx to run
<dneighbo> which luckily for you will probably be never :)
<dneighbo> yeah lyx can be a pain to get running 
<dneighbo> same with docbook
<reinhard> btw i can make dvi, ps, pdf, html and plain text out of texinfo
<chillywilly> just go with text then
<dneighbo> only reason i like docbook better is because one can write it with ANY editor
<dneighbo> then put on ash and let the conversion happen there
jamest_ (jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) got netsplit.
<dneighbo> texinfo same principle
<dneighbo> so its all good :)
<chillywilly> hmmm, why couldn't you fo that with texinfo though
<chillywilly> hehe
jamest_ (~jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) returned to #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> technically you could with lyx too
<chillywilly> it's all good nik-a
<dneighbo> as its just TeX
<dneighbo> but TeX is very pain in butt
<chillywilly> lyx is NOT laTeX
Action: neilt does docbook, and its sweet
<jamest_> um
<chillywilly> you actaully have to export it
<jamest_> users are finding commit and rollback terms on forms confusing
<chillywilly> but anyway
<jamest_> so how about 
<jamest_> Commit = Save
<jamest_> Rollback = Abort Changes
<reinhard> at least i got TeX to run without thinking
<dneighbo> um....
<dneighbo> commit = save (no problem)
<jamest_> neilt: yes docbook is powerfull but the !@#!@# tools drive me insane
<dneighbo> rollback = abort changes
<dneighbo> not so sure
<reinhard> what abut
<reinhard> rollback = undo
<chillywilly> jamest_: you know I looked at that too and I also thought the same exact thing
<dneighbo> undo might be more fitting
<chillywilly> nice reinhard :)
<jamest_> reinhard: I want an undo facility in there under Edit some day
<jamest_> in fact
<jamest_> one of my users has requesty Undo w/ history
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> that seems like a bit of overhead
<jamest_> so they can pull up a list of changes and pick the one they want undone

<chillywilly> what apps do that?

<jcater> morning
<jan_> good afternoon
<jan_> (MET) ;)
<jcater> :)
<jan_> jamest: UI rewrite: whats about renaming GLoginDialog.GLoginDialog.destroyLoginDialog into .... something else
<jan_> jcater: do you have time for a RPC policy question?
<jcater> I'll try
<jcater> just got to work, though, and am dealing with ppl :(
<jcater> but if you're patient, I'll try :)
<jan_> :)
<jan_> ok. If I use a RPC procedure to get an object.  I will just receive an handle.
<jan_> Now, when i call an method of this object. I send a message like _23957834680248062_.get_flavor
<jan_> But by this method, the object has no fixed place into an hirarchie of the grpc file.
<jan_> At the moment, i don't care for the gprc file in this case.
<jan_> Now my question: Should there be a "description" of all objects to check against? 
<jcater> um
<jcater> I need to think about this for a sec
<jcater> we do pass handles for object when using transports that don't support objects natively
<jcater> (i.e., the CORBA driver won't pass around references, but actual objects)
<jcater> the handle is used to reference a proxy object on the server-side
<jcater> so this was meant to be transparent to the client and server
<jcater> at least when using GRPC on both ends
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> what do you mean by "description" of the objects?
<jan_> a definition like in the gprc file.
<jan_> the thing is, that the protokoll is describing itself, so the information is there two times. one time in the gprc file and one time in the protocoll (i.e. in the real objects based on class definitions on the server side)
<jan_> looking at soap for example. you don't need any desciption(i.e. gprc) of the server side or on the client side. You just register an object on the server side. and
<jan_> then you can use it with server.object on the client side.
<jan_> To say it short:  a gprc is not needed to comunicate with SOAP or XMLRPC. The only function it can have is to be a kind of control.
<jan_> That means to check which parts of an object should be available by RPC and which not.
Nick change: jan_ -> jan
<jcater> I'm confused
<jcater> are you arguing for a description to be passwd
<jcater> or for a description to not be passed?
<jcater> sorry, I haven't had my caffeine yet, so I'm really slow this morning
<jan> If i understand it right, corba needs an IDL file for client and server.
<jan> So for corba there is the need of an definition of the tranfered classes on both sides ( in case of GNURPC: grpc )
<dneighbo> jan: i will speak out of turn
<dneighbo> i think the idl file and such
<jan> SOAP and XMLRPC don't need this definition file for transfering classes, because variablesand type information are passed together 
<dneighbo> is to describe objects
<dneighbo> we are not wanting to define every object
<dneighbo> merely a wrapper
<dneighbo> to pass objects back and forth over the transport
<jan> i.e. we don't need the gprc file=
<jan>  i.e. we don't need the gprc file?
<jcater> we very much need the grpc file
<jcater> to know what to expose
<jcater> the client may not need the grpc file
<jcater> but one has to exist
<jan> You mean, the grpc file is something like a communication standarization document. Something like a grammar. i.e. people can SPEAK, without everytime looking on it ;) 
<jcater> yes
<jcater> the problem is, grpc is very much in the early planning stage
<jcater> as in, you saw the first round of my thought process
<jcater> (you poor soul :)
<jcater> and we really don't have any docs yet
<jan> Ok, my question is: Should the incoming request be checked  against the GRPC file by the server?
<jcater> I hadn't planned on it
<jcater> but hadn't gotten to that point
<jan> But the basic structure you've coded are quite  good. I just had to insert some lines to make it working.
<jan> Ok, I put all questions from this talk into a file and name it GNURPC pre alpha draft docu
<jan> Would you like to get a new patch (working o=getBackingUnit and  then o.getFlavor) per mail?
<jcater> yip
<jcater> hey, have you sent in a copyright assignment?

Action: jamest thinks it says alot about jan's state of mind in comparison to jcater's state of mind
Action: jamest goes and cowers in terror in the closet fearing a world where more that one person thinks like that
<jan> jamest: understanding the grpc code was not very difficult. First you have to imagine a donut, ....
<jan> ;)
<jamest> ahhhhhh
<dneighbo> you see just need to have 'donuts' on the mind
<jamest> i never thought of it that way
<dneighbo> and rpc is a SNAP :)
<jamest> no wonder he's into recursive routines
<dneighbo> but yes python highly addictive
<jcater> jan is right... all the grpc samples are donut related
<jcater> so you really DO have to think "donuts"

<jan> Hi.
<jan> I've an python beginner question: i want to change one value in a tuple. But python don't let me do it. So what to do?
<dneighbo> why not?
<jan> my python book tells me:  tuple are immutable
<dneighbo> hmmmmm
<dneighbo> maybe im thinking of dictionary
<jan> but i found a solution: c=(1,2,3)    / c[1]=5 /  c = c[0:1]+(5)+ c[2:] /s
<dneighbo> cool i was going to suggest
<dneighbo> tuple[index]=newvalue
<jan> Still not working: can only concatenate tuple (not "instance") to tuple
<dneighbo> btw lots of time its easier to find python examples in existing gnue code

<dneighbo> i called and talked to tom at FSF
<dneighbo> and jan's paperwork is there and is in order
<dneighbo> brian is out with flu so it hasnt been 'recorded' yet
<dneighbo> but we have green light that its good to go
<dneighbo> so commit away :)
<jcater> cool
<dneighbo> they have a bayonne setup for phone
<dneighbo> in someways its cheesy (and some funny stuff like fsf song)
<dneighbo> but over all its pretty cool
<dneighbo> i plan to set bayonne up at the house soon :)
<dneighbo> well not too soon im broke
<jamest> we knew that
<jamest> we started a list of all the things that are wrong with you
<jamest> however ash didn't have the HD space to spare

<dneighbo> jamest: i get it and like it :)
<dneighbo> um
<dneighbo> i assume articles in docbook format?
<psu> error 504 - makes a change from 404 I suppose ;-)
<dneighbo> ICJ : ok looked at cvs
<dneighbo> at one time our docs were all going to be docbook
<dneighbo> thus docbook 'directory'
<dneighbo> it ended up not working out that way (yes its silly but its an old story with history, which you dont want to hear)
<dneighbo> so think of docbook == docs
<dneighbo> and i think it might make more sense
<dneighbo> docs/articles/
<dneighbo> then would be articles about gnue
<dneighbo> believe it or not i think we have had at least one published and at one time were working on others

<jcater> howdy
<derek> sup
<derek> man this activcard sucks
<jcater> ?
<derek> 4 bad connects and it freezes your account
<derek> jcater: new security at work
<derek> they give you a card (looks like a calculator)
<derek> before logging on to network you have to punch in a pincode to your card
<derek> it then issues a password
<derek> that is valid for like 12 hours
<derek> if you try to auth with same passkey more than 5 times in 24hr period it locks you
<derek> which sucks when you are 'testing' :)
<jcater> weird
<derek> actually im happy
<derek> as they are moving away from prop windows point to point protocols
<derek> to letting cisco and activcard manage it
<derek> which opens door for NON m$ machines to play :)
<derek> i just dont understand ppp on linux
<derek> it appeared to let me connect
<derek> and i could ping both addresses on the ppp0 device
<derek> but i couldnt ping anything i can normal ping when connected

<jcater> dunno
<jcater> :(
<derek> though it kills my eth0 connection when i try to dial up, even though it doesnt PHYSICALLY kill eth0
<jcater> sorry
<derek> thats ok, jamest has dialup im hoping he can shed some light :)

<jamest> question
<jamest> if forms highlighted the current field being edited....would this be a bad thing?
<jamest> at least in the wx driver
<jcater> define "highlight"?
<jamest> ala designer
<jamest> the field the cursor is in 
<jcater> ah
<jcater> hmm
Action: jcater has mixed feelings
<jamest> my users are complaining about finding the cursor
<jamest> so do i
<jamest> i thing it'd look tacky
<jamest> but I'm open to suggestoins to impove visibility
<jamest> things I've thought about
<jamest>   block cursor
<jamest>   highlighting
<jamest>   bolding current fields text
<jamest>   enlarging current field a small amount
<jamest> i really don't like any of them 
<jcater>   changing background color of current field to a pale yellow???
<jcater> ala my label editor in designer
<jamest> color blind people might not notice it
Action: jcater doesn't think that's a fair assumption
<jamest> ?
nickr (panphage@e-172-IP28.empnet.net) left irc: Remote closed the connection
Action: jamest is one of those people that are color confused
<jamest> so I'm a bit sensitive to color being used to convey information
<jcater> ok
<jamest> anyway
<jamest> we can make the highlighting an option
<jamest> in gnue.conf
<jamest> highlighting=none, colored, bold, foo
<jamest> if people aren't against the idea
<jamest> or
<jamest> and I like this one
<jamest> we ignore the problem and let them get used to it :)
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> I'm certainly not against any of these
<jcater> but none tickle my fancy too much
<jamest> same here :)

<chillywilly> nothing
<chillywilly> dead tired
<chillywilly> still settting up the family box ;)
<chillywilly> takes a while to get yo GNU/Linux system configured just right
<derek> im all for the option in gnue.conf
<derek> in fact before getting to that point that was going to be my suggestion
<derek> i think the 'proper' way to denote field of focus
<derek> is to bold highlight the border of the field with focus
<derek> this way text or background isnt 'altered' which can be hard on eyes
<derek> but the field appears 'elevated' to distinguish it
<derek> but i still vot for options :)
<derek> er vote
<jcater> well, I agree that would be best
<jcater> but I think we can't do that in wx
<jcater> or that would've been our primary approach
<jcater> :(
<derek> probably not 
<derek> but that is why optoin in gnue.conf is great
<derek> so when you have pyGTK and pyQT working someday
<derek> you can make it right easy :)
