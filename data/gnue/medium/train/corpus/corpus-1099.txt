<jan_> hi jcater
<jcater> morning
<jan_> good afternoon
<jan_> (MET) ;)
<jcater> :)
<jan_> jamest: UI rewrite: whats about renaming GLoginDialog.GLoginDialog.destroyLoginDialog into .... something else
<jan_> jcater: do you have time for a RPC policy question?
<jcater> I'll try
<jcater> just got to work, though, and am dealing with ppl :(
<jcater> but if you're patient, I'll try :)
<jan_> :)
<jan_> ok. If I use a RPC procedure to get an object.  I will just receive an handle.
<jan_> Now, when i call an method of this object. I send a message like _23957834680248062_.get_flavor
<jan_> But by this method, the object has no fixed place into an hirarchie of the grpc file.
<jan_> At the moment, i don't care for the gprc file in this case.
<jan_> Now my question: Should there be a "description" of all objects to check against? 
<jcater> um
<jcater> I need to think about this for a sec
<jcater> we do pass handles for object when using transports that don't support objects natively
<jcater> (i.e., the CORBA driver won't pass around references, but actual objects)
<jcater> the handle is used to reference a proxy object on the server-side
<jcater> so this was meant to be transparent to the client and server
<jcater> at least when using GRPC on both ends
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> what do you mean by "description" of the objects?
<jan_> a definition like in the gprc file.
<jan_> the thing is, that the protokoll is describing itself, so the information is there two times. one time in the gprc file and one time in the protocoll (i.e. in the real objects based on class definitions on the server side)
<jan_> looking at soap for example. you don't need any desciption(i.e. gprc) of the server side or on the client side. You just register an object on the server side. and
<jan_> then you can use it with server.object on the client side.
<jan_> To say it short:  a gprc is not needed to comunicate with SOAP or XMLRPC. The only function it can have is to be a kind of control.
<jan_> That means to check which parts of an object should be available by RPC and which not.
Nick change: jan_ -> jan
<jcater> I'm confused
<jcater> are you arguing for a description to be passwd
<jcater> or for a description to not be passed?
<jcater> sorry, I haven't had my caffeine yet, so I'm really slow this morning
<jan> If i understand it right, corba needs an IDL file for client and server.
<jan> So for corba there is the need of an definition of the tranfered classes on both sides ( in case of GNURPC: grpc )
<dneighbo> jan: i will speak out of turn
<dneighbo> i think the idl file and such
<jan> SOAP and XMLRPC don't need this definition file for transfering classes, because variablesand type information are passed together 
<dneighbo> is to describe objects
<dneighbo> we are not wanting to define every object
<dneighbo> merely a wrapper
<dneighbo> to pass objects back and forth over the transport
<jan> i.e. we don't need the gprc file=
<jan>  i.e. we don't need the gprc file?
<jcater> we very much need the grpc file
<jcater> to know what to expose
<jcater> the client may not need the grpc file
<jcater> but one has to exist
<jan> You mean, the grpc file is something like a communication standarization document. Something like a grammar. i.e. people can SPEAK, without everytime looking on it ;) 
<jcater> yes
<jcater> the problem is, grpc is very much in the early planning stage
<jcater> as in, you saw the first round of my thought process
<jcater> (you poor soul :)
<jcater> and we really don't have any docs yet
<jan> Ok, my question is: Should the incoming request be checked  against the GRPC file by the server?
<jcater> I hadn't planned on it
<jcater> but hadn't gotten to that point
<jan> But the basic structure you've coded are quite  good. I just had to insert some lines to make it working.
<jan> Ok, I put all questions from this talk into a file and name it GNURPC pre alpha draft docu
<jan> Would you like to get a new patch (working o=getBackingUnit and  then o.getFlavor) per mail?
<jcater> yip
<jcater> hey, have you sent in a copyright assignment?

<jamest> jan: what do you think of python? (now that you're using it)

<jamest> :)
<jan> the coolest thing is: no {{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}} and things like [:2] instead of substr(sdf,2,3) ... 
Action: jcater thinks it says a lot about python'
<jcater> s reablility when jan can figure out grpc :)
Action: jamest thinks it says alot about jan's state of mind in comparison to jcater's state of mind
Action: jamest goes and cowers in terror in the closet fearing a world where more that one person thinks like that
<jan> jamest: understanding the grpc code was not very difficult. First you have to imagine a donut, ....
<jan> ;)
<jamest> ahhhhhh
<dneighbo> you see just need to have 'donuts' on the mind
<jamest> i never thought of it that way
<dneighbo> and rpc is a SNAP :)
<jamest> no wonder he's into recursive routines
<dneighbo> but yes python highly addictive
<jcater> jan is right... all the grpc samples are donut related
<jcater> so you really DO have to think "donuts"
Action: dneighbo hopes that jan isnt under impression that a grpc donut factory will produce EDIBLE donuts :)

<ICJ> Hi!
<dtm> hi all
<jan> Hi.
<jan> I've an python beginner question: i want to change one value in a tuple. But python don't let me do it. So what to do?
<dneighbo> why not?
<jan> my python book tells me:  tuple are immutable
<dneighbo> hmmmmm
<dneighbo> maybe im thinking of dictionary
<jan> but i found a solution: c=(1,2,3)    / c[1]=5 /  c = c[0:1]+(5)+ c[2:] /s
<dneighbo> cool i was going to suggest
<dneighbo> tuple[index]=newvalue
<jan> Still not working: can only concatenate tuple (not "instance") to tuple
<dneighbo> btw lots of time its easier to find python examples in existing gnue code
<dneighbo> than on the net :)
<jan> i know but i allways thought the authors  of the code are better than the code. -> asking in IRC #gnue
<jan> but it works now: / (5) / (5,) /s

<dneighbo> thus docbook 'directory'
<dneighbo> it ended up not working out that way (yes its silly but its an old story with history, which you dont want to hear)
<dneighbo> so think of docbook == docs
<dneighbo> and i think it might make more sense
<dneighbo> docs/articles/
<dneighbo> then would be articles about gnue

<jamest> so do i
<jamest> i thing it'd look tacky
<jamest> but I'm open to suggestoins to impove visibility
<jamest> things I've thought about
<jamest>   block cursor
<jamest>   highlighting
<jamest>   bolding current fields text
<jamest>   enlarging current field a small amount
<jamest> i really don't like any of them 
<jcater>   changing background color of current field to a pale yellow???
<jcater> ala my label editor in designer
<jamest> color blind people might not notice it
Action: jcater doesn't think that's a fair assumption
<jamest> ?

Action: jamest is one of those people that are color confused
<jamest> so I'm a bit sensitive to color being used to convey information
<jcater> ok
<jamest> anyway
<jamest> we can make the highlighting an option
<jamest> in gnue.conf
<jamest> highlighting=none, colored, bold, foo
<jamest> if people aren't against the idea
<jamest> or
<jamest> and I like this one
<jamest> we ignore the problem and let them get used to it :)
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> I'm certainly not against any of these
<jcater> but none tickle my fancy too much
<jamest> same here :)

<chillywilly> nothing
<chillywilly> dead tired
<chillywilly> still settting up the family box ;)
<chillywilly> takes a while to get yo GNU/Linux system configured just right
<derek> im all for the option in gnue.conf
<derek> in fact before getting to that point that was going to be my suggestion
<derek> i think the 'proper' way to denote field of focus
<derek> is to bold highlight the border of the field with focus
<derek> this way text or background isnt 'altered' which can be hard on eyes
<derek> but the field appears 'elevated' to distinguish it
<derek> but i still vot for options :)
<derek> er vote
<jcater> well, I agree that would be best
<jcater> but I think we can't do that in wx
<jcater> or that would've been our primary approach
<jcater> :(
<derek> probably not 
<derek> but that is why optoin in gnue.conf is great
<derek> so when you have pyGTK and pyQT working someday
<derek> you can make it right easy :)
