<dcmwai> h...
<Vee2d2> 'sup dcmwai
<Vee2d2> well.. 'sup everyone. =)
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, Nothing, Just thinking about the inventory problem...
<Vee2d2> the same one as before?
<dcmwai> And I think that I might find the answer here...
<dcmwai> Hum... what was the before )
<dcmwai> ;)
<Vee2d2> assemblies
<dcmwai> yes but this time is more complex....
<dcmwai> Because assemblies will change with time ...
<dcmwai> so It is really hard to control them .
<dcmwai> Any Good News Vee2d2 ?
<dcmwai> Gor Gnue..  of course :)
<dcmwai> s/Gor/For
<Vee2d2> Ahh.. well, things are moving a little bit
<dcmwai> The CVS Changes? or...
Action: dcmwai hate the ISP to kept the DSL Line disconnecting all the time...
<Vee2d2> I've started putting up pages describing the expecpected features of gnue-sb, at http://www.gnu.org/software/gnue-sb/features/ ..I havent had a chance yet to discuss it with anyone so it's nothing official (and not linked from anywhere), incomplete, and likely to change a lot...
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, tell me something... Did you find creating webpage like that easy ? ( I found that is sometime hardly to archive and time consuming)
ariel (~ariel@ppp-217-133-163-93.cust-adsl.tiscali.it) left irc: "Client exiting"
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, ... reading the page will take a long long time and creating a discussion on it will be difficult... Unless you discuss group by group... But more and most of the time they are cross related...
<Vee2d2> I dont think I follow you.
<Vee2d2> difficult how?

<dcmwai__> Vee2d2, I'm back...
<Vee2d2> to answer your question, writing those pages wasnt too much of an effort. I drew the content from discussions here and on the list, and from my own wants/needs which will drive revisions and additions.. I'm always here and on the list 
<dcmwai__> damn ISP kep me from disc...
<dcmwai__> I see
Nick change: dcmwai__ -> dcmwai

<dcmwai> Vee2d2, Any luck with ldap ? for contact managenemt?
<Vee2d2> *shrug* I dont use ldap for anything
<Vee2d2> someone else here might though
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, I've already have my contact on LDAP ... it is just for them to bind with it...
<dcmwai> But it will be very tuff...
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, may I ask what is client management?
<Vee2d2> customers.. 
<Vee2d2> s/client/customer/
<dcmwai> shouldn't that be on contact management?
<Vee2d2> No, I dont think so.. we need to keep some information besides contact information
<Vee2d2> Payment terms, Discounts.. etc.. 
<dcmwai> hum... 
<dcmwai> shouldn't that be CRM ? Customer Relation Management?
<dcmwai> s/Relation/Relationship
<Vee2d2> I'm thinking that contact management will be tied pretty closely with vendor management and client management, but I may not understand how it will relate to the project as Derek does.  
<Vee2d2> Right that's why I said s/client/customer/.. Like lik said the pages hadnt been discussed with anyone yet and are subject to change a lot.. =)
<Vee2d2> the names used, etc.. 
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, Not at all that is pretty close to what is needed.
<Vee2d2> my understanding of how everything will work together is all subject.. Whenever Derek gets some time I'm sure we'll knock it around a bit
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, Something simple or stupid... Does any company send out a PO to purchase a software/hardware that is use for Company and not for the Sale?
<dcmwai> Where have derek went?
<Vee2d2> Not sure exactly, just know he's juggling a lot of stuff at the moment. 
<dcmwai> nvm... the time is still not there yet...
<dcmwai> a few more people will get the time right ... :)
<Vee2d2> ?
<dcmwai> I meant a few more hands ;)
<dcmwai> helping hands..
<Vee2d2> ahh, those usually help. =)

<btami> hi all
<lupo__> hi btami
<btami> hi lupo__
<btami> can someone tel me is venster's license (MIT license) gpl compatible ?
<btami> http://sourceforge.net/projects/venster/
<btami> s/tel/tell
<btami> my english is too limited :(
<btami> especially when i'm reading licenses
<siesel> btami, if you just "use" it, as a library it should be ok, but cannot directly link to it, or something like that
<siesel> (I forgot the exact relation)
<btami> can i use it in GNUe forms code?
<siesel> if its a library like wxwindows etc. it should be no problem IMHO
<btami> ok, thanks
<siesel> but you better ask derek or jamest on that
<lupo__> btami: yes, the MIT license it compatible with the GNU GPL.
<btami> siese: btw have you got my mails about Install GNUe-CVS-Snapshot on Win32 mini-HOWTO.htm
<btami> lupo__: thx
