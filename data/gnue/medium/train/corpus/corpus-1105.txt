<jcater> today is "Fun with UUCP day"
<jamest> lol
<chillywilly> who uses UUCP?
<jamest> i do
[13:30] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<jcater> have for many years
<nickr> really?+
<jamest> yip
<chillywilly> it is like for old style unix mail right?
<jcater> old style?
<jack-e> jamest: yep :))
<chillywilly> unix to unix communication protocol
<jamest> old style?
<dneighbo> nickr he means a different UUCP (jamest does)
<dneighbo> Uber University Coed Prober
<dneighbo> is what he is thinking
<jamest> lol
<jack-e> jamest: im still very interested in gnue and need to play around much more ..
<jamest> actually I mean uucp in the traditional sense
<dneighbo> i dont think its email chilly but rather
<dneighbo> old tcp/ip :)
<jamest> um
<chillywilly> yea
<dneighbo> i.e. it was way for unix machines to 'talk'
<jack-e> jamest: still need to figure out how to build complex forms/apps
<chillywilly> that's what I mean a "different" comm protocol
<dneighbo> jack-e what do you mean?
<jamest> actually uucp over tcp/ip is what I do now
<dneighbo> jamest so is it mroe liek nfs or something?
<chillywilly> sure you can layer protocols anyway you want
<dneighbo> jack-e what are you lacking?
<chillywilly> uucp is still old schoo is it not? ;)
<chillywilly> school
<dneighbo> you have forms working right
<jack-e> dneighbo: i have not yet built any app that i could use .. i just tried the examples
<dneighbo> and the db stuff
<dneighbo> and designer
<ajmitch> hmm, i shoudl head to bed soon
<jack-e> yep .. all is fine .. 
<dneighbo> well the wya i normally do it
<dneighbo> is i open designer
<dneighbo> and run a wizard against the 'biggest/base' table for my form
<dneighbo> and let it auto create that
<jamest> uucp = unix to unix copy (via modem, tcp/ip, etc, etc)
<dneighbo> then i use designer to add additional datasources (detail)
<jack-e> but i have not yet build master/detail - forms with designer for example ...
<jamest> kinda like an old rsync in a way (i guess)
<dneighbo> and the widgets needd to support htem
<dneighbo> jack-e its pretty easy
<dneighbo> just add a new datasource 
<jamest> very handy for email to dynamic ip based servers
<dneighbo> then in it fill out the information to bind to a master
<dneighbo> i think its like mastersource
<dneighbo> and then you have to pick the fields to 'link' on
<jack-e> yes .. thats why i like the concept .. but often "easy" things are limited .. and i need to find these to decide if we will build our apps with gnue :)
<dneighbo> of course gnue is limited 
Action: chillywilly needs to fix the screen bindings
<jack-e> :)
<chillywilly> er, key bindings for 'screen' program
<dneighbo> in the sense you are a LOT less confined say writing an app in C and GTK+
<dneighbo> however it will take you a lot longer
<dneighbo> you will be tied to single UI
<dneighbo> etc etc etc
<dneighbo> so its all a matter of this for that i suppose
<jack-e> for example: how would i build an app that has many modules that use forms for data-entry/report ..
<dneighbo> i can say from my expierence thus far 'most' data aware business applications are a good choice for gnue
<dneighbo> as fancy widgets etc arent all that necessary and the maintainability, speed to develop and UI choices are worth it
<dneighbo> when you say app w/ many modules
<dneighbo> i am going to assume you mean an app that has many forms?
<chillywilly> I don't see GNUe as being app ready...you can hack up a nice 2-tier app for now with it, but that's not what you want in the long run
<dneighbo> currently what i have done is create a 'launcher' form
<jack-e> yep
<dneighbo> so like a 'floating toolbar' that can be used to call the different forms
<dneighbo> we are working on a 'dynamic menuing' system
<jack-e> my first thought was to import the interesting parts of gnue-forms and use them directly .. has anyone done such a thing ??
<dneighbo> so that you could bundle forms together to make an 'application'
<dneighbo> well that is what common was DESIGNED for :)
<jcater> chillywilly: there's nothing wrong with 2-tier
<jamest> chillywilly: i think you'd be amazed how many "non app ready" 2-tier solutions driver todays businesses
<jcater> it's a different approach
<dneighbo> so db abstraction, rpc abstraction, and everything else in common
<jack-e> hmm common is only the db-layer afaik .. forms does the xml->ui work 
<dneighbo> was designed to be available to any python developer wishing to use them
<dneighbo> i think the parser is there too
<dneighbo> if you were to start importing things into forms
<dneighbo> i would question why not add to forms what you need done
<dneighbo> instead of importing it
<jamest> jack-e: the forms trigger language and the UI system on forms are currently both being rewritten
<dneighbo> i.e. 'why branch forms'
<jamest> jack-e: so any input on where it's lacking would be greatly appreciated
<dneighbo> right
<jamest> rewritten = about to be rewritten :)
<dneighbo> i see this question as provoking one of two responses
<jamest> argh, i need to study
<dneighbo> if there is a good reason why one would want to 'import' something that is in forms
<jamest> why did I go back to school again?
<dneighbo> that is probably a good reason as to why it possibly should be moved to common
<jack-e> ok .. let me first try all the things we are talking about before i rumble around with less knowledge about what i'm really talking :)
<dneighbo> if the motivation to import forms is to get 'more features' then that is good reason to add the features to forms :)
<jack-e> i'm willing to bring in my ideas :)
<jack-e> and probably some code as well ..
<jack-e> but i really need to get into it .. as i've often said to others: read the sources, luke :))
<jamest> i wouldn't recommend reading forms code :)
<jack-e> :) .. but if i won't .. i won't be able to contribute :)
<jamest> dang! 
<jamest> you're write
<jamest> well, please keep one thing in mind
<jack-e> ...
<dneighbo> its all jamest fault
<jamest> common was born from forms (and greatly improved upon)
<jack-e> :))
<dneighbo> when a method is horribly constructed and in the wrong place
<dneighbo> its jamest fault
<dneighbo> when you change something that is improperly encapsulated and it jacks up the whole cvs tree
<dneighbo> its jamest fault
<jamest> and forms has lots of quick hacks that was just stuck
<jamest> was = has
<jamest> has = have
<jamest> :(
<dneighbo> when the code is so tangled you want to vomit
<dneighbo> its jamest fault
<dneighbo> and last but not least
<jamest> so forms is a bit messy, odd, etc, etc
<jamest> and it's all my fault
<jamest> happy dneighbo?
<jack-e> jamest: :)
<dneighbo> if you had two donuts, but now have none and you didnt eat them
<dneighbo> its probably not jamest fault, blame jcater
<jack-e> i will look and ask and complain if necessary :)
<jamest> lots of stuff (read bugs, design issues, etc) were left for after the 0.1.0 release 
<dneighbo> jamest i figure we cant blame you for everything :)
<jamest> as that release was the focus on getting the new db drivers in place
<dneighbo> jack-e read masta threatened abnormal beatings if something didnt escape soon :)
<jamest> yeah, if the forms good looks good jcater did it

<psu> Any XML experts in the house?
<psu> I am putting topics in the Kernel Cousins XML source
<psu> as Zack is writing a topic indexer as well
<psu> format is <section topic="Forms">
<psu> however, if there are multiple topics, 
<psu> should I do <section topic="Forms" topic="Designer">
<jack-e> psu: then it is not valid xml afaik
<psu> or <section topic="Forms,Designer">
<jack-e> then your app needs to know about :)
<psu> I assume Zack's scripts will cope with 1) as that's what he told me to use
<psu> but my XML validator barfs on it
<psu> I can write it either way as KCs are always lovingly hand-crafted ;-)
<dneighbo> it depends on how the app deals with it
<dneighbo> i dont think
<dneighbo> <section topic="foo" topic="monsterfoo">
<dneighbo> is valid
<dneighbo> i think it would be
<dneighbo> <section topic="foo,monsterfoo">
<dneighbo> or something like
<dneighbo> <section>
<jack-e> better use topic as child-elements
<dneighbo>   <topic>foo</topic>
<jack-e> yep
<dneighbo> <topic>monsterfoo</topic>
<dneighbo> something
<dneighbo> </section>
<psu> thanks
<psu> definantly looks as if repeated attributes in a tag are a bad thing
<dneighbo> BUT i cant stress enough its all how the reader application is written :)
<psu> dn - agreed. In this case, if Zack's perl scripts can hack it, that's how I'll do it
<psu> It's just I've been relying on my XML validator so far
<jack-e> but if you want to use dom or expat you'll probably have some trouble with duplicate args ...
<psu> and will have to fudge this
<psu> AFAIK, the point of using XML for Kernel Cousins "source" files 
<psu> is just to have something vaguley standards-supporting
<psu> that Zack's perl scripts can work with
<psu> Also allows me to include "raw" HTML without breaking anything

<ajmitch> yo mdean
<mdean> how d
<ajmitch> wassup?
<mdean> nuttin' - looking through dcl emails
<ajmitch> righto
<ajmitch> got the boss interested in GNUe, and he's planning to install phpGroupware for a client's email/calendar, etc
<mdean> cool
<ajmitch> all in all, it's been a good day (even if i didn't go to bed last night)
<mdean> you go to bed?
<ajmitch> sometimes
<ajmitch> the client has a crappy piece of *** foxpro-driven database that they want replaced, so i suggested using GNUe :)
<ajmitch> mdean: you know phpgw fairly well?
<mdean> depends on which piece - I'm totally ignorant in some areas
<ajmitch> installation requirements
<ajmitch> how well would it run on debian potato?
<mdean> which ver of PHP?
<ajmitch> just a min, i'll check on the debian web page
<mdean> 4.0.6-7 is known to have issues - as in phpgw not working
<ajmitch> it'll be using php3
<mdean> should be fine then - but .12 has php3 compatibility issues
<mdean> I recommend running CVS
<ajmitch> hmm, this is for a production site
<mdean> much easier to set up
<ajmitch> ok
<mdean> the .13 code has the new/improved setup tool
<ajmitch> ah cool
<ajmitch> isn't .13 near release anyway?
<mdean> I think that's up in the air - .12.1 has been in limbo for a while
<mdean> don't know if they may just skip it and go for .14
<ajmitch> right
<ajmitch> i'll have to try it out, i have an old version on here
<madlocke> jamest: you are here?
<ajmitch> oh no, i have .12
<mdean> I don't know the extent of the php3 incompatibilities in .12, but know that several people experienced problems in various areas

<madlocke> jcater: you here?
<jcater> not for long
<jcater> but am at the moment
<ajmitch> cool
<ajmitch> jcater: managed to impress someone with forms :)
<madlocke> you did write some code for the xml parser, didn't you?
<jcater> cool
<jcater> madlocke: yeah
<madlocke> i was looking at the way forms is importing other files, with special tags etc..
<madlocke> i think these things are supported be xml parsers
<madlocke> that are able to work with dtds
<madlocke> it's possible to to validate these xml docs
<ajmitch> bother, skeeter not reply
<madlocke> so i am thinking of maybe moving to dtds...
<madlocke> what are you thinking about it?
<jcater> um
<jcater> not sure I follow
<mdean> madlocke: why would you want to validate the xml?
<ajmitch> sounds useful
<madlocke> mdean: validation for users that write there stuff with vi
<madlocke> mdean: the other thing is that things like import can be done by the parser
<madlocke> mdean: it's like doing work twice
<mdean> but not at runtime, right?  just for development?
<jcater> I have no problem having DTD's to validate against, but I don't see those replacing anything we;ve done
<mdean> derek doesn't want to use DTD's for anything
<mdean> just XML schema
<madlocke> mdean: is there a good schema parser available for python?
<mdean> haven't looked
<madlocke> ok maybe i've to wait for derek
<jcater> either way, that won't replace what we've done
<jcater> that has many shortcomings
<madlocke> jcater: the xmlElements map is then obsolete i think
<mdean> jcater: ja
<jcater> madlocke: no
<jcater> it's the defacto standard
<jcater> btw, it's also what designer uses
<madlocke> hm
<jcater> and dtd or xml-schema won't do all that we do w/xmlElements
<jcater> we have started utilities to generate DTD from our xmlElements
<jcater> but they aren't high on our list currently
<jcater> I'm not sure I follow where you are coming from, though.
<madlocke> what's impossible with schema that is done w/ xmlElements at the moment?
<jcater> I think xmlElements does a lot more than you realize
<jcater> for one, it's the basis of Designer
<jcater> it also typecasts attributes into the proper python datatype
<madlocke> at the moment i am working on a layout manager and for this i was looking at other details
<jcater> and it defines how the xml tags are mapped into python objects
<madlocke> the typecasting is a normal thing of a xml parser...
<Maniac> madlocke: schema processor?
<Maniac> python has good xml tools
<jcater> xmlElements is not an XML tool.. it's a python tool
<madlocke> Maniac: you know a good one?
<Maniac> pyxml
<Maniac> pyxml.sf.net iirc
<madlocke> pyxml is able to work with schema??? ok then i have to read more...
<Maniac> 4suite.org also has some decent stuff
<Maniac> madlocke: not sure what you mean by schema?
Action: Maniac isn't too bright 
<madlocke> Maniac: xml schema is another way of defining the structure and data types used in an xml document
<madlocke> something like dtds
<madlocke> but in xml language and more advanced
<Maniac> hm
<mdean> Maniac: schemas are defined in xml and replace DTD's, they also contain things like data types
<Maniac> ok i know pyxml can handle dtd's :)
<madlocke> if derek was doing already some discussion at this topic it's maybe better i wait for his coming
<Maniac> :)
<mdean> madlocke: yes - we touched on this a few weeks ago
Action: Maniac is reading up on xml "schemas" right now
<mdean> madlocke: he said "schema good, dtd bad" ;-)
<madlocke> ermmm... hmm. have to be online more time...
<madlocke> ok...
<jcater> even if we do create schemas or dtds, they can't replace xmlElements
<madlocke> i agree with this but did not find a good parser
<jcater> they can only serve as another tool
<mdean> jcater: your record is broken ;-)
<jcater> sigh
<madlocke> jacter: problem is with xmlElements you break compatibility with standard xml tools...
<madlocke> this is bad when developing add ons ...

<SachaS> can you confirm this ajmitch?
<reinhard> SachaS: that is correct
<ajmitch> yes
<SachaS> and gnue-common as abstract database (whatever db is behind). is this correct?

<SachaS> hi. just got disconnected.
<SachaS> i post my text again:
<SachaS> <SachaS> ebxml lists "buying-selling a product or service" as the most common business collaboration
<SachaS> <SachaS> "buying-selling a product or service" is what most businesses do with other business.
<SachaS> <SachaS> company A supplies: wood , company B produces: furniture. So company B buys wood and company A sells wood.
<SachaS> <SachaS> now with have the most common business collaboration: "buying and selling of a product or service"
<SachaS> <SachaS> the most common business process is: ``order-fulfillment-payment''
<SachaS> <SachaS> company B orders wood. company A ships the wood. company B pays the wood
<SachaS> <SachaS> .... Business Process and Business Information Analysis Overview 1.0 at www.ebXML.org ... is the document I cite here.
<SachaS> <SachaS> ok.
<SachaS> <SachaS> i never new how someone can define such a process, because i thought they are very complex. 
<SachaS> <SachaS> then i read the "ebXML Businss Process Specification Schema Version 1.01" also at www.ebxml.org
<SachaS> ...... only the second part got pasted ....
<SachaS> sorry guys. i just start again.
<SachaS> i am studying ebXML (electronic business XML
<SachaS> so today companies already use erp systems.
<SachaS> the ebXML specifications provide a framework to get a global electronic marketplace.
<SachaS> ebXML emphasis on collaboration (inter-enterprise business -> b2b).
<SachaS> the most common collaboration is (after ebxml doc): "buying-selling of a product of service".
<SachaS> and the most common business process is: "oder-fullfillment-payment"
<SachaS> s/oder/order
<SachaS> company A is wood seller
<SachaS> company B is a furniture producer
<SachaS> company B orders some wood from it supplier company A
<SachaS> company A fullfills the oder and ships the wood
<SachaS> company B then pays the wood.
<SachaS> pretty easy and straight forward.
<SachaS> the ebXML Business Process Specification Schema Version 1.01 shows how such a business process can be modelled in UML and then converted to XML.
<SachaS> in ebXML each of these two companies will define their business processes in XML document and send this XML docuemnt to a registry.
<SachaS> the XML document is called Collaboration Protocol Profile (CPP).
<SachaS> so there are two CPP in the registry.
<SachaS> When company B does not know company A yet, company B looksup the registry.
<SachaS> In this example company B finds company A.
<SachaS> company B then downloads the CPP of company A
<SachaS> company B then creates a new XML docuemnt which is derived from the two CPP documents (CPP of company A and CPP of company B).
<SachaS> in this new XML document, called Collaboration Protocol Agreement.
<SachaS> in this new XML document the business process (which is the same for company A and company B, except that company A is the seller and company B is the buyer).
<SachaS> is defined.
<SachaS> now it comes:
<SachaS> at both sides (company A and company B) the ebXML software gets configured with this CPA XML docuemnt!
<SachaS> the ebXML software (called Business Service Interface in the ebXML docu) parses the CPA
<SachaS> and configures itself.
<SachaS> so the ebXML software knows the business process involved.
<SachaS> to recall: the business process defines the roles (buyer, seller), the documents which have to be sent (order, shipment notice, bill etc) and in which order.
<SachaS> where is gnue???
<SachaS> lets assume at company A and company B
<SachaS> what i need now is a gnue-ebxml convertor.
<SachaS> i assume, that i have gnue running as my erp system.
<SachaS> .... at company A and B
<SachaS> the ebXML software knows which documents to send BUT not what data to put into the documents.
<SachaS> the ebXML software knows that there is a field called: address, quantity, value etc. but the ebXML software does not know the content of these fields.
<SachaS> ....................
<SachaS> i think if there is a Business Process Engine within gnue (geas) where I can model business processes
<SachaS> the gnue (erp) to ebXML convertor is straight forward.
<SachaS> i hope i did not lose anybody, here , i appologies.
<ajmitch> don't worry, it'll all be in the logs :)
<SachaS> reinhard: i know there can be business objects in geas. so i guess we could get something like a business process engine.
<SachaS> reinhard: I want to investigate here and do my masters next year in this area. I cant wait to see you in february to get insight information on how to do it.
<reinhard> SachaS: I am reading although not too closely
<reinhard> i am at work actually and rather busy
<SachaS> no problem reinhard. i will see you in february and we can discuss it.
<reinhard> however i'm not sure if individual business process modeling is practical
<reinhard> my experience is that every company tries to have a single business process that is valid for all customers
<reinhard> or all vendors
<reinhard> etc.
<reinhard> not to have their own business process for every customer
<reinhard> which is what i understand ebXML would result in
<SachaS> ok. ebXML allows you do have different business process. but it wants users to re-use business proceses.
<SachaS> the idea is, that the ebXML registry is filled with COMMON business processes and that companies re-use those business processes.
<SachaS> and there are a lot of common business processes.
<SachaS> even ebXML targets Small to Medium Enterprises (SME) it looks like bigger companies will profit of ebXML first.
<SachaS> ajmitch: could you understand what i wrote?
<ajmitch> SachaS: no, because i'm not into that sort of thing
<SachaS> but you could compile geas compared to me ..... we might be a good team. lol
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> i'm looking at using GNUe in much smaller installations i think :)
<SachaS> ajmitch: after compiling it, i wanna have (or program) first is a small gnue application with some sample customers and some sample products
<SachaS> ajmitch: i will be happy when i have that first.
<ajmitch> right
<ajmitch> not sure how well the geas db driver works at the moment, you'll have to ask jamest when he's around
<ajmitch> if you're wanting to use forms, that is
<SachaS> ajmitch: did you try the forms?

<dneighbo> i love linux....
<dneighbo> for first time my operating system outlasted the compenents :)
<dneighbo> i installed linux on this box 16X days ago
<dneighbo> this morning i come in and power is off, i figure cleaning ladies bumped it
<dneighbo> instead found dead power supply...
<dneighbo> have hot swapable drives so in about 30 seconds have machine back up and running (moved drive from one case to another)
<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> i have had components die on me before but NEVER before the operating system had at least crashed once :)
<dsmith> dneighbo: bah!  I've had more crashes from hardware than an os. But I've been running linux/freebsd for about 6 years.
<jcater> anyone know of a good backup mx provider?
<jcater> good=cheap

<|darks|> hi, got a small question: how do i define integer fields with the designer ?!?
<jcater> there should be a "typecast" attribute
<jcater> that you can set to numeric
Action: jcater is away: food

<|darks|> hmm and how do i change that field .. except in the gfd file ?!?
Action: jcater is back (gone 00:11:43)
<jcater> you can right-click an entry widget and select "Properties"
<jcater> which should bring up a property inspector
<|darks|> yip .. sure .. but i can't change the typecast field :P
<jcater> what OS are you running on?

<psu> GNU/Linux

<|darks|> well not an embedded version :)
<psu> couldn't resist - but i ought to know better than to jump in before reading the log
<|darks|> designer 0.1.0 if that helps ...
<jcater> does the property inspector not let you change values ?
<|darks|> right ..
<jcater> the typecast property should have a combo box
<jcater> does it look like it's entering an "edit" mode when you double click, or does it do nothing at all
<|darks|> it looks like a editing mode ..
<|darks|> but i can't edit anything .. and it's not a combo box .. at least here

<|darks|> jcarter: well you said it's a combo box .. never thought of that possibility :)
<dneighbo> |darks| i think wx has screwed up painting
<dneighbo> so on the combo boxes it 'behaves' like a combobox, but it doesnt 'look' like one :)
<dneighbo> screwed me up too ;)
<|darks|> yip .. could be .. maybe the sizing is wrong ...
<dneighbo> i think its cause its a combo box in a grid
<|darks|> hmm, i don't know that much about wx ..
<dneighbo> jcater if you can confirm this is a wx thing
<dneighbo> i can send (or you can) something to the wx lists
<dneighbo> see if we can get it fixed

<pattieja> hello dneighbo
<dneighbo> pattieja where are you located?
<dneighbo> and what are your base requirements
<pattieja> St. Louis, MO
<pattieja> well, we currently have written a web-based CGI application for time keeping
<dneighbo> pattieja do you have an RFP or RFQ for what you need payroll to do
<pattieja> nope
<pattieja> :)
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> damn users shopping w/o specs again ;)
<pattieja> hey.
<pattieja> I resemble that remark.
<pattieja> if you haven't seen it, you might take a gander at SandSurfer
<chillywilly> resent?
<pattieja> sandsurfer.sourceforge.net
<pattieja> it's an open source time keeping tool we wrote
<pattieja> we were either wanting to replace it with something better or integrate a payroll system into it (or export to a payroll system)
<pattieja> how mature is GNUe?
<pattieja> the website looks pretty good
<dneighbo> pattieja : we dont have payroll done
<dneighbo> BUT
Remosi (~isomer@210-86-56-222.jetstart.xtra.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> i have customers needing it
<dneighbo> so i would be willing to make it priority
<pattieja> cool
<dneighbo> you could definitely integrate or interface to your current system
<dneighbo> we have a GPL time app too (though i dont think i have told anyone here)
<pattieja> is timekeeping a part of GNUe currently? if not, would it fit?
<dneighbo> yes it would fit
<pattieja> cool
<dneighbo> I would definitely love to look at what you have
<dneighbo> and if it makes sense maybe make it part of gnue
<pattieja> go for it
<dneighbo> and start writing some gnue management utilities against it
<dneighbo> (as i dont care for web apps)
<pattieja> it's strictly backend CGI scripts written in Perl
<pattieja> right
<dneighbo> but i see value in web based 'time entry'
<dneighbo> i.e. clock in clock out
<dneighbo> we have somethign all done in php
<pattieja> exactly what it does
<dneighbo> called timekeeper
<pattieja> so you're the ones that stole our original name, ahah!
<dneighbo> it allows clock in clock out for a warehouse company
<pattieja> hehe
<dneighbo> i wrote this evil little php reporting tool
<dneighbo> that allows you to use excel as a reporting engine
<pattieja> ewww!
<dneighbo> for this reason mostly is why we never released to public :)
<dneighbo> but it was a 'requirement' at the time
reinhard (rm@N816P015.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: "All things being equal, fat people use more soap"
<dneighbo> and it made dealing with  ADP for payroll easy
<pattieja> hmm.  maybe you're not, then.  Cause there's already a TimeKeeper project out there.
<pattieja> SandSurfer has client billing included and some other company related features
<dneighbo> cool
<dneighbo> definitely worth looking at
<dneighbo> if of course you are open to incorporating it into GNUe
<pattieja> I don't see why that would be a problem
<dneighbo> or being flexible to someone adding stubs where necessary to interface to GNUe
<dneighbo> only problem i see
<dneighbo> is its written in perl :)
<pattieja> we wanted to rewrite the whole thing anyway
<pattieja> yep
<dneighbo> python! python! python!
<pattieja> is GNUe primarily C++?
<pattieja> oh
<dneighbo> sorry...
<pattieja> ORB?  python?  wow.
<dneighbo> python is just so friendly
<dneighbo> we are working on a UI html driver too for gnue
<dneighbo> so maybe rewrite it in gnue :)
<pattieja> I saw that in the picture graph
<pattieja> the ncurses and html frontends
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise.
Action: jcater is back (gone 00:24:49)
Action: dneighbo needs to see how complex this perl thing is
<dneighbo> and see if its best to move with it or dig timekeeper out of cvs
<dneighbo> hmmm looks pretty similar only you guys have some more 'payroll' stuff
<dneighbo> does your stuff do any notifications?
<dneighbo> as i recall what we had was it email notifying the payroll leader
<dneighbo> when people had uncoupled time
<chillywilly> hey there was a new wxWindows release
<dneighbo> so that they could beat the person or fix it
<dneighbo> also there was time edit request system via email
<dneighbo> so if you needed to 'amend' your time you filled it out, and it went to a queue
<dneighbo> where the administrator could then approve or modify it
<dneighbo> jcater : btw: you have any need for this kind of thing?
<chillywilly> "The biggest changes in the development version is that the Mac version is now 90% ready for production use and supports MacOS 8.6 or higher as well as MacOS X or higher.
<chillywilly> "
<chillywilly> http://wesley.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~wxxt/
<dneighbo> chillywilly 2.3.x i think is a 'development' release
<jcater> dneighbo: not immediately at least
<chillywilly> still OS X is almost there
<chillywilly> ;P
<dneighbo> jcater how do you do time cards current?
<chillywilly> will make neilt appy at least
<chillywilly> happy
<dneighbo> dcl is good for tracking time, but not for 'hourly employees'
<dneighbo> i.e. its good performance metrics tool, but not a hard core when are you at work when aren't you tool
<jcater> we use ETC time card
<jcater> it has credit card like things
<jcater> w/a magnetic strip
<dneighbo> ah
<jcater> w/PC software
<dneighbo> so you bought something (evil you)
<dneighbo> well the idea was time keep instead of 'swipe' any terminal with a webbroswer could clock you in
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> we have a hard time getting ppl to understand
<dneighbo> at the warehouse this worked well, BUT i was going to get a card reader and try it out at one point
<jcater> "swiping"
<jcater> much less web-based stuff
<chillywilly> hwy I almost worked for the city of milwaukee here on their time keeping app for the city...it was a java app...they had 1GB ethnet netwokr
<dneighbo> what we did for timekeeper was put a pc at front desk (running linux) that was OLD like 486
<dneighbo> and have it with browser open to page
<jcater> btw, the time card machine uses a text-based serial protocol
<dneighbo> it was 'login' click the button logout
<jcater> so it'd be easy to integrate w/another solution
<dneighbo> which did take some time
<jcater> dneighbo: and it you were smart, you used LTSP to run the 486 :)
<dneighbo> but it was saviour in sense that memphis location needed something too
<dneighbo> and needed reported to corporate
<dneighbo> so this solved that
<dneighbo> and even the memphis boys figured er out :)
<dneighbo> but i still think value in making a time swiper too
<dneighbo> to do metrics you have to have a terminal though
<dneighbo> and everyone is starting to do metric
<dneighbo> so i imagine slowly it will be the way
<dneighbo> pattieja did we lose ya?
<dneighbo> if you are serious about using gnue we can probably focus some attention to a solution
<dneighbo> if you needed something yesterday and only want something that is ready now today out of box, then gnue wont work :)
<pattieja> dneighbo: no.  this will be a process of growth
<pattieja> my boss wanted to incorporate payroll into SandSurfer, but wanted to check to make sure that there weren't systems out there already so we wouldn't reinvent the wheel yet another time.
<pattieja> We also have a web-based accounting system which is open source as well
<pattieja> called XIWA
<pattieja> (XIWA Is Web Accounting)
<dneighbo> hmm havent heard of that
<pattieja> xiwa.sourceforge.net if you want to check it out
<dneighbo> any reason you didnt use sql-ledger/
Action: dneighbo is just curious as it seems popular and is perl (iirc)
<pattieja> or you can just go to pcxperience.org to see all the open source projects we're working on
<pattieja> how long has it been around?
<pattieja> never heard of it
<dneighbo> dont know but its all the rage right now
<dneighbo> people coming here generally say do we
<dneighbo> a. use sql-ledger now
<dneighbo> b. use gnucash and hope we get business features added later
<dneighbo> c. contribute to gnue and grow with it
<pattieja> hehe.  I found this project because of gnucash
<dneighbo> http://www.sql-ledger.com/
<pattieja> wow
<dneighbo> i still cant imagine doing books via a web interface, but i suppose if you are low volume you could do so w/o tearing your hair out
<pattieja> yeah.  we had to craft some pretty intricate SQL stored procedures to increase the speed that Perl wasn't giving us
<dneighbo> its not that so much as data entry in a stateless environment has to hurt
<pattieja> how so?
<pattieja> it's single user at the moment  :)
<dneighbo> well often times data is dependent on other data
<dneighbo> with out state you have to 'refresh and submit' to get this or load a ton of stuff into javascript
<dneighbo> example if i choose department X
<pattieja> yep
<dneighbo> maybe only accounts a and b are available
<dneighbo> if i choose account a (expense codes 1 2 3 are ok) but if i choose b (only c and d are ok)
<pattieja> then when you create account X, you have to propagate it into the dropdown or whatever
<dneighbo> etc etc etc
<pattieja> yep yep
<dneighbo> when you get 'nested' validations doing in javascript is a bitch
<dneighbo> as you have to load a ton of arrays
<dneighbo> etc
<pattieja> :)
<dneighbo> so most people put on the 'next page' etc
<dneighbo> which becomes CUMBERSOME to do data entyr
<dneighbo> i.e. fill out the whole form and we will tell you if you had an error
<dneighbo> opposed to telling me up front i had an error :)
<pattieja> yep
<pattieja> you might want to checkout XIWA
<dneighbo> not to mention the concept of redrawing the screen after every 'action'
<dneighbo> while no big deal at a second or two per redraw
<dneighbo> if you enter say 10 invoices a day
<pattieja> we're attempting to get a server going to host a demo
<dneighbo> but at one shop here they enter approx 300-500 invoices a day between like 2 people
<dneighbo> they would LYNCH us if they had to use a web interface :)
<pattieja> so how do you do the html frontend in python for GNUe?
<dneighbo> it woudl have the same issues and such and handled similar way
<dneighbo> the difference is it become optional w/o recode
<pattieja> hmm
<dneighbo> so if i make a gnue form for something
<dneighbo> it can be used web, curses, gtk, win32
<pattieja> yep
<dneighbo> so the folks doing 500 invoices can use gtk or such and not suffer penalty
<pattieja> win32 ... ewww
<pattieja> :)
<dneighbo> but for a same disparate organization they can use the webforms 
<dneighbo> i.e. you are tied
<dneighbo> thats why i said are you against us making admin forms for sandsurfer in gnue :)
<pattieja> you did
<pattieja> I did?
<dneighbo> like the edit/add/deletion of users
<dneighbo> etc etc
<dneighbo> as i could make that form in problably 10 minutes
<dneighbo> and it would take seconds to add 20 to 30 users
<dneighbo> compared to half a day using a web form
<dneighbo> i have a huge list of todo's tonight
<pattieja> unless GNUe were to use Java or Tcl on the web forms
<dneighbo> but if i get unburied some, i might install sandsurfer
<dneighbo> pattieja im not suggesting 'replacing' just adding a choice
<pattieja> you can checkout the online demo, if that's easier
<dneighbo> i looked at online demo
<pattieja> hmm.  that too.
<pattieja> cool  :)
<pattieja> what'd you think?
<dneighbo> im thinking of grabbing it writing the gnue screens for management
<dneighbo> and having you look at them
<pattieja> go for it
<dneighbo> i.e. forcing you to install gnue :)
<dneighbo> as the logic thought for me is if you are normalized enough
<dneighbo> in your structs
<dneighbo> i might be able to take our hr spec and whip up employee screens
<dneighbo> which would be the basis of your user tables
<pattieja> coolness
<dneighbo> i.e. you create and employee and it 'autocreates' them a login
<dneighbo> er rather their login references their hr record
<dneighbo> for like thier name, job title etc
<pattieja> sounds neat
<pattieja> I'm takin' off, but I'll definitely try to install GNUe tomorrow
Action: pattieja is away: Bible study + dinner (mmmm :)

<dneighbo> or do i get work done and do that another day
<dneighbo> i think it probably needs to wait till another day, but red hats time is definitely limited
Nick change: dsmith -> dsmith-away
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 00:24:35)
<chillywilly> dneighbo: hehe
Action: chillywilly hasn't used redhat in FOREVER
<dneighbo> well me either in one sense
<dneighbo> put it this way i installed the current version on red hat when it was brand spanking new
<dneighbo> that is version 6.2
<chillywilly> ok
<dneighbo> nearly 2 years ago?
Action: dneighbo is trying to remember
<chillywilly> woah ;)
<dneighbo> so while i use red hat 'regularly' like a LOT
<dneighbo> i do so only because upgrading is a painful thought
<dneighbo> upgrading to anything :) even a newer red hat
<dneighbo> im firm believer you shouldnt really have to upgrade all the time
<dneighbo> unless there is a tool like debian apt
<dneighbo> that lets you update VERY regularly
<dneighbo> so you arent upgrading your whole damn system at a single time
<dneighbo> of course apt will let you do that too :)
<dneighbo> hey chillywilly you are mr. kernel
<dneighbo> how come sid has kernel
<chillywilly> yes?
<chillywilly> er?
<dneighbo> Linux version 2.2.19pre17 (herbert@arnor) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #1 Tue Mar 13 22:37:59 EST 2001
<chillywilly> because debian is like compile your own kernel
<dneighbo> i.e. installed potato on this machine
<chillywilly> biased
<dneighbo> then i did dist upgrade to sid
<dneighbo> figured it would be 2.4.x something at least
<chillywilly> you can install one of the binaries
<dneighbo> and was suprised it was still in 2.2.x series
<chillywilly> one of the kernel-images
<chillywilly> dneighbo: if you use the xfs disks
<chillywilly> you can get a 2.4.x kernel
<dneighbo> hmmmm
<dneighbo> if i was more of a stud
<chillywilly> or you should be able to install a binary
<dneighbo> i would try xfs (or some journaling filesystem) and 2.4 kernel
<dneighbo> probably not something i want to tackle w/ laptop upgrade, will have enough issues to fight htere :)
<dneighbo> dont need stuff never seen on top of it
<dneighbo> BUT 
<dneighbo> if i get a pc at home soon, i will probably do that type of install
<chillywilly> well doing xfs was not fun
<chillywilly> it took too much time
<chillywilly> :P
<chillywilly> well not really
<chillywilly> I made myself go down to school and use the T3
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> when I last reinstalled
<chillywilly> my buddy just b0rked his kernel
<chillywilly> the one that came over and we installed debian
<chillywilly> on his machine
<chillywilly> but I told him to be careful
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> I'll have to go help him fix it
<chillywilly> :)
<dneighbo> hey its SNOWING in phoenix
<chillywilly> WOW
<dneighbo> that only happens like every 10 to 50 years
<chillywilly> cool
<dneighbo> of course it melts when it hits the ground :)
<chillywilly> heheh
<dneighbo> cept 1 year when i was bout 12 it got like half inch and STUCK
<dneighbo> it was kick butt

<derek> no rolling on laughing floor
<derek> if thats confusing, you havent had enough crack :)
Action: chillywilly takes a hit off his crack pipe
<chillywilly> can never have enough crack
Action: mdean gets his crack from php
<chillywilly> derek: who's rolf?
<chillywilly> ;)
<Remosi> Mmm
<Remosi> phpCrack
<mdean> piano playing dog on the Muppet Show
<chillywilly> lol
Action: chillywilly forgot about him
<jcater> Remosi: I prefer pyCrack
Action: chillywilly prefers crack++
<jcater> rofl
<Remosi> pyCrack's much better, instead of this watered down MSCrack.
<derek> hmmm MSCrack is extreme powerful
<derek> but nearly as addictive as pyCrack
<jcater> gnuCrack doesn't cause you to crash as harrd as MSCrack
<Remosi> gnuCrack's got the recipe printed on the side
<chillywilly> objCrack is for apples
<jcater> yes, but any improvements to gnuCrack has to be given back to the community
<chillywilly> lol
<Remosi> Reused gnuCrack, Mmmmm
<chillywilly> gnuCrack can also be freely distributed
<chillywilly> (re)distributed even
<jcater> problem with MSCrack is you have to take it anally
<jcater> at least by MS's standards
<Remosi> you're allowed to charge for gnuCrack (it comes in tape boxes), but the dealers can give it away for free
<mdean> jcater: with a scoop of Skippy Extra Chunky
<jcater> then there's sharedSourceCrack... you know at least part of it is real :)
<chillywilly> with gnuCrack you are allowed 4 central freedoms: 1)     *  The freedom to use the crack, for any purpose (freedom 0).
Action: mdean has too many copies of DCL installed...
<derek> how hard is an upgrade
<chillywilly> 2) * The freedom to study crack is made, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the crack recipe is a precondition for this.
<chillywilly> study how
<derek> from like 3 months ago cvs to 1209 release?
<chillywilly> * The freedom to redistribute the crack so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
<jcater> derek: such an upgrade requires massive doses of SqlCrack
<chillywilly>     * The freedom to improve the crack, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits. (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
<mdean> derek: as easy as running a few sql scripts, moving the new web source in place and using it as normal
<chillywilly> er, crack recipe
<jcater> mdean: really?
<jcater> cool
<mdean> derek: it's all explained poorly in the UPGRADE file ;-)
<mdean> 1210 is the latest btw
<mdean> and I'm readying another release for the nagging IE cookie problem
<derek> ok
<chillywilly> Free The crack!!!!!
<derek> i think i need to upgrade at work
<chillywilly> noe more crack hoarders
<mdean> the gateway is in there too :)
<derek> i have some date stuff with the tickets (fixed work orders)
<derek> that im pretty sure i saw as fixed in newer release
<derek> and i think i saw the ability to flag things as closed (i.e. instead of hardcoded to a position)
<mdean> yup
<mdean> statuses now have a type (open, closed, deferred)
<derek> basic i had sent like 2 or 3 bugs and a few feature requests :)
<derek> i think you hit those and now i need to upgrade :)
<mdean> I should have acted like a proprietary vendor and sat on them for a couple years first ;-)
<derek> no kidding
<derek> fits our 'upgrade' schedule :)
<derek> i.e. i have wanted to upgrade at every release but keep getting pulled to do other things
Action: mdean knows the feeling...
Action: derek is hearing an msn commericial in the background and laughing....
<derek> have problems, msn will solve them....

<derek> nickr: you ehre?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> always
<nickr> eternally
<Mr_You> hi
<derek> nickr: briefly looked at docustore proposal
<derek> good start, will probably need more fleshing out as we go
<derek> Maniac and mdean are looking for dm
<derek> so you might have some victims here soon if we get this rolling :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<nickr> Heheh
<nickr> Ah, fresh meat
<nickr> no to speak
<nickr> Yea, there are several areas that need things written in them
<derek> i asked neilt to get up on  official site
<derek> and we will blast to mailing list and web site news
<derek> to get some feedback
<derek> and get the ball rolling further
<nickr> that'd be amazing
<derek> jcater is making headway on gnurpc which should be good for the 'server' communications aspect
<ajmitch> phpGW is looking pretty cool
<nickr> yea, gnuprc is rather fundimental to this design
<derek> ajmitch you been drinkiing again? ;)
<ajmitch> would be useful
<ajmitch> derek: :P
<chillywilly> derek: ?
<chillywilly> why would using phpGW require getting drunk?
<chillywilly> eh?
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> chillywilly: im teasing
Action: chillywilly trout slaps derek hard
<derek> thats nothing, after being attacked by the thwapmaster earlier toady :)
<derek> today even
Action: chillywilly ducks slaps derek
Action: chillywilly strangles derek with the quackmaster
<derek> chillywilly: we need to put your energy of the trout slap to work
<derek> time to make you a dcl account and start assigning you tasks
<nickr> Heh.
Action: chillywilly drop kicks da masta 
<ajmitch> derek: you got dcl setup for GNUe?
<derek> yip
<nickr> neat
<nickr> Hows dcl comming?
<ajmitch> cool
<derek> nicely
<nickr> It was a little rough last time I used it
Action: derek needs to create a 'guest' account so people can see whats there then create a little page so can create an account to 'add' items
<chillywilly> gooo heeerbieee!
<derek> i.e. add tickets
<ajmitch> sounds cool
<nickr> There should be a non-login account for tickets and things or something
Action: mdean whispers e-mail gateway...
<ajmitch> i've got an old DCL setup here, haven't used it really
<derek> mdean: yes to email gateway
<derek> BUT
<derek> tehre are issues
<derek> i created a guest account so people can view w/o registering
<derek> i want to allow people to register so they can have security to only create tickets
<derek> if they dont want to register they just email bugs@gnue.org and it autocreates a ticket :)
<derek> via gateway
<derek> the 'advantage' to registering will be then you can get the 'status' of your ticket and status will be mailed to you etc etc etc
<mdean> that's cool
<derek> ultimately with the gateway it will be mailed to you from account you sent the bug from
<mdean> may need to tighten a few things down
<derek> for now you can see whats there by using
<derek> user: guest
<derek> pass: guest
<derek> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/dclgw/
<derek> obviously most of the people in this channel are gnue team members or core team members
<derek> so your user/pass will be forth coming
<derek> best way to get one is email me lots of crap that should be in dcl and i will get sick of entering it and give you an id instead and tell you to enter it :)
<derek> that or volunteer to do things :)
<ajmitch> hehe
