<derek> nickr: what doesnt work?
<chillywilly> I am not in there
<derek> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/dclgw/ tries to auto refresh to an https: 
<nickr> ah,.
<derek> so if you are using a broswer that doesnt support ssl that could be the issue
<ajmitch> chillywilly: why don't you want one? ;)
<nickr> it is an issue, yes
<derek> ajmitch he knows it means i will start chaining him to the furniture again
<ajmitch> hehe
<nickr> maybe it should say something like 'redirecting to SSL blah blah blah' :)
<derek> nickr: thats too intuitive
<ajmitch> you've got to keep the users guessing
<derek> suppose the more correct thing is to give out the url as https://www.gnuenterprise.org/dclgw/

<derek> hello psu
<ajmitch> yo psu
<psu> hi
<psu> masta is up late
<ajmitch> yeah
<derek> psu: believe it or not i used to ALWAYS be up this late
<derek> bout time reinhard comes in is when i woudl go to bed
<derek> just got out of the habit 
<ajmitch> lately i've been up till about 3 or 4am most nights, sometimes 7 or 8am
Action: psu is keeping fairly sensible hours at the moment
<psu> big project at work is still at the Statement of User Requirements stage
<ajmitch> ah
<ajmitch> i'm trying to finish a project at work this week :)
<psu> shame I can't "bank" some sleep for the pre-go live rush ;-)
<derek> psu: whatever it is send those requirements over this way :)
<psu> Actually, GNUe Integrator might be nifty for my interfaces
<psu> but I've got to stop mentioning Integrator
<psu> or I'll end up writing the spec for it ;-)
<derek> ?
<derek> rolf
<psu> I have a 4-page list of actual and possible interfaces into the finance system
<psu> hopefully many will go away 
<psu> with a more integrated system
<psu> but still lots to do
<psu> most bizarre one is probably
<psu> the interface from the crematorium MIS to Accounts Receivable
<psu> to send sales invoices to Funeral Directors
<ajmitch> heh
<nickr> freaky
Action: ajmitch knows a few funeral directors :)
<psu> Not sure how much credit control you can do with those invoices
<ajmitch> parent's main business is making coffins
<psu> It's not like, "If you don't pay, we dig him up..."
<psu> aj - I'm sure you've heard *all* the jokes...
<ajmitch> it's more "If you don't pay, you join him..."
<ajmitch> psu: quite a few
<derek> thats ok... at the county
<derek> this bio firm approached out 'county health system' and our 'medical examiner' (read coroner)
<derek> they were willing to pay 50k for 'heads'
<derek> for 'research'
<derek> since we get lots of jane/john doe's this would have been a VERY lucrative revenue stream for us
<derek> board damn near passed it
<ajmitch> heh
Action: psu feels a Dilbert "headcount" joke coming on
<psu> so early in the morning, too *whimper*
<ajmitch> early?

<nickr> yes
<nickr> it really is
<derek> SachaS: i dont know of anyone going
<derek> reinhard would be the logical choice
<SachaS> www.fosdem.org for further infos. Even not developer I just registered to go there :) cool.
<SachaS> derek: next year i will do a masters by thesis in computer science.
<SachaS> derek: my area will be ebXML
<SachaS> derek: and there is no fun without a ERP system. Thats why I hang around here.
<SachaS> derek: I will hopefully meet Reinhard in February in Austria to get an in depth view of gnue and geas :)
<SachaS> would be cool to get into gnue.
<reinhard> i am seriously considering to go
<reinhard> especially because it's a weekend
<reinhard> and because i love brussel :)
<SachaS> reinhard: i would like to join you.
<reinhard> SachaS: if we meet before we can talk about that
<SachaS> reinhard: yesterday i saw documentation in the geas cvs directory and will read them.
<SachaS> reinhard: ok. i will be in Liechtenstein 3rd of February and can come to your place around then.

<jack-e> puh .. just came back from service-dates out of office .. so i had not much time to play around with gnue ..
<jack-e> no i got a warm cup of coffee in cooold germany .. so things're getting better :))
<reinhard> jack-e: you are from germany?
<jack-e> yep .. you're from austria .. eh ??
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> servus
<jack-e> saw you in the contributors list of gnue ..
<reinhard> :)
<jack-e> grüazi .)
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> that would be swizerland :)
<jack-e> jaja
<reinhard> what part of germany
<jack-e> munich ..
<reinhard> oh cool
<jack-e> jamest: i will investigate the common dbdriver concept and try to bring in some ideas for field-conversion (date/long/...) that i find are missing .. 
<jack-e> jamest: first i'll need to test sapdb-driver and then i'll have a closer look on dbdriver's concept
<jack-e> reinhard: so where are you from in östereich ??
<reinhard> Vorarlberg - Lustenau
<jack-e> ok ..
<jack-e> reinhard: so what part of gnue are you working on mostly ??

<reinhard> geas
<reinhard> application server
<jack-e> :))))) so you work on integration of gnue-common into geas ????
<reinhard> well currently that isn't yet being worked on
<reinhard> and when we start i guess i will do that together with jamest/jcater
<reinhard> but i guess you know the problem we europeans are facing now wrt 1.1.2002 :)
<reinhard> especially we european it consultants :)
<jack-e> :)
<jack-e> i'm very interested in using 3-tier mode of gnue .. but i only do python-programming these days (have done c years ago) .. so i won't be able to help very much in this case ..

<dneighbo> du hast der meister?
<dneighbo> instead of sie hassen
<dneighbo> damn english-german dictionary isnt very good 
<reinhard> du haßt
<dneighbo> your language is 'difficult' to translate
<dneighbo> same word means 45 different things :)
<dneighbo> what is sie hassen then?
<|darks|> they hate ..
<jcater> ah
<dneighbo> so sie hassen der meister would be they had the master right?
<jcater> so "GNUe" is a german term?
<jcater> 'cause it means 45 different things
<dneighbo> no swedish actually
<reinhard> or swiss dialect
<|darks|> noe sie hatten den meister would be they hate their master :)
<reinhard> for "enough"
<dneighbo> ah
<|darks|> aeh s/hatten/hassen :P
<dneighbo> |darks| ok, the dictionary doesnt talk about 'tense' really and grammer :)
<|darks|> i shoild stop looking a dneighbo'r german lessions .. confuses me :)
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> i would love to learn german, but trying in here is difficult
<dneighbo> i dont know how some of the folks that barely speak english keep up using a dictionary
<dneighbo> german just looks 'cooler' and it comes in 'blue' :)
<jack-e> ??
<dneighbo> you have all the cool symbol on your character set ;)
<jack-e> :)
<jack-e> you mean äöüß ??
<jamest> it comes in blue! rock!
<dneighbo> i knew that would sell jamest :)

<jack-e> misspelling isn't that hard :)

<dneighbo> psu you still here?
<dneighbo> let me create you an account so you can do that :)
<dneighbo> jcater : im nuts dcl isnt dorked, just dumb lusers here :)
<dneighbo> but get this, all the hype about them loving it
<dneighbo> well boss took it to his boss
<dneighbo> and now they want to find a commerical product that does same thing
<dneighbo> as having 'free software' isnt safe 
<dneighbo> just had about an hour argument....
<dneighbo> we will see how it ends up
<dneighbo> one thing that might save it is if i can provide a few companies that will 'commercially support' dcl
<dneighbo> to point they might even PAY for a support contract
<psu> Anyone got an off-the-shelf company we can let mdean have, cheap?
<dneighbo> they are so funny, literally they are 'squirming' because we have something VERY useful that we didnt pay a dime for, we get bug fixes on demand and we customized it to meet everything they asked for in under 24 hours...
<dneighbo> it is such a FOREIGN concept they dont knwo what to do
<dneighbo> its 'too good to be true'
<jcater> "spend money"
<jcater> isn't that the solution to everything?
<dneighbo> jcater: thats pretty much what they are saying
<jamest> dneighbo: tell them ThompsonCorp will support it for $45 hour....mdean you willing to work for say um, $5 an hour :)
<dneighbo> if we could just drop $1500 for licenses
<dneighbo> and know there is a phone number to call
<jcater> hell, I'll support it :)
<dneighbo> granted from experience no one need answer that fone that knows shit about hte product
<dneighbo> and they can just say hmmm that sucks, it will be in the next release
<dneighbo> we dont know when next release is
<dneighbo> (as thats what our other vendors do)
<jcater> 'Pookie Support, Inc.'
<dneighbo> but just having the phone number and writing the checks make them 'feel good'
<psu> The accountancy answer 
<psu> is to guess how much it would cost to license equivalent product
<psu> stick that in a Reserve
<jcater> dneighbo: all you have to do is set up a Bayonne server with an "automated" attendent :)

<dneighbo> Dare Obasanjo: Similarly what happens if Dan Kusnetzky's prediction comes true and Microsoft changes the .NET APIs in the future? Will the Mono project play catch up or will it become an incompatible implementation of .NET on UNIX platforms?
<dneighbo> Miguel de Icaza: Microsoft is remarkably good at keeping their APIs backwards compatible (and this is one of the reasons I think they have had so much success as a platform vendor). So I think that this would not be a problem.
<dneighbo> had me rolling on the floor so hard i nearly peed my self
<dneighbo> m$ good at keeping API backwards compatiablity and that is why they are dominant on the desktop (hahahahhaha)
<dneighbo> now that is some GOOD CRACK!
<dneighbo> the most notable part of the article though
<dneighbo> was when he asked them about the free software community saying mono was a bunch of bastards
<dneighbo> they pointed to portable.net and gave a link
<dneighbo> but when referring to dotGNU they didnt give a url

<pattieja> at least it got past the PyXML error
<pattieja> but now it gives me an error not being able to find the wxPython-gl package
<pattieja> since I only downloaded and installed the wxPython packages for 2.1
<pattieja> Python 2.1 (I guess)
<jamest> when dealing w/ rpms and debs they are version specific
<dneighbo> yes
<pattieja> right
<dneighbo> we created an 'ugly' but good dependency in moving to pyhton > 2.0
<pattieja> so by typing ./setup.py, it's apparently running Python 1.5.2
<dneighbo> as it generally means one has TWO versions of python
<pattieja> which knows about PyXML

<pattieja> hmmm
<dneighbo> i solved this on red hat by just instalilng everything from source 
<pattieja> I've never used Python before
Action: dneighbo is a source junkie on my laptop now :)
<pattieja> ouch
<dneighbo> as redhat is so screwed packaging wise
<dneighbo> finding ANYTHING new that works with 6.2 is near impossible
<pattieja> dneighbo: as in redhat source RPMs or the actual tarballs of stuff
<pattieja> ?
<dneighbo> on debian it was as easy as apt-get
<dneighbo> pattieja actual tarballs
<dneighbo> though you SHOULDNT have to do that
<pattieja> whew
<pattieja> hmm
<dneighbo> i just did it, because rpm db is messed up on my machine and i gave up fighting it anylonger :)
<chillywilly> rpm sucks
<dneighbo> apt sucks too
<dneighbo> it just sucks less
<jamest> yes!
<chillywilly> sucking less is good though

<chillywilly> jcater: pythin is friggin slow though
<chillywilly> er, python
<jcater> um
<jcater> no
<chillywilly> yes it is
<chillywilly> not as bad as java
<jcater> mom! he said python was slow
<chillywilly> but it is slower
<jamest> slow?
<jcater> you'd be surprised
<chillywilly> I have to wait for designer to start up
<chillywilly> I am damn impatient
<jamest> that's actually wxPython starting up
<jamest> which is based upon wxWindows 
<jamest> which is C++
<jamest> :)
<dneighbo> first in tests i think in many areas java has been proven faster than python
<dneighbo> and vice versa
<dneighbo> BUT
<chillywilly> interpreted languages are always goign to be slow
<chillywilly> anyway
<dneighbo> sloppy code can make a fast language seem slow
<jamest> I _think_ i'd blame swig for the performance hit on wxPython
<dneighbo> and good code make a slow language seem fast
<reinhard> Does the fact that .NET seems to imply that the end of COM is near mean that Mono will spell the end of Bonobo?
<chillywilly> I just love GNU Common C++
<chillywilly> damnit
<reinhard> Miguel de Icaza: Definitely.
<chillywilly> heh
<dneighbo> python natively incourages structure that doesnt let you code poorly as easily as say C/C++/Java
<dneighbo> ;)
<dneighbo> thats not to say you cant
<chillywilly> feh
<dneighbo> just w/o trying generally it leads you to structures etc that are more efficient
<dneighbo> at least that is my humble opinion
<chillywilly> dneighbo: dude, that's just shitty software design
<psu> dn - my new @gnuenterprise.org address works
<chillywilly> use the right structure for the right job then
<chillywilly> dag nabit
<jamest> i think it's unfair to state that <language> is too slow w/o profiling it
<dneighbo> jamest: i sent you a dcl workorder for the psu thing
<dneighbo> so you can log on and close it now :)
<chillywilly> jamest: fine then I'll make python bindings to my lib and we'll see how much slower it is
<dneighbo> i didnt hear response from you immediately so figured you were away :) so put in dcl so i wouldnt forget
<chillywilly> :P
<chillywilly> anyway, who cares
<jamest> chillywilly: that'd be cool with me
<chillywilly> I want to use GNU Common C++
<chillywilly> it rocks!
<chillywilly> we can play with omniORB
<chillywilly> I think ORBit2 still has threading issues
<chillywilly> :(
Action: chillywilly wants multi-threaded app server
<jcater> nah
<jcater> threading is bad
<chillywilly> um
<chillywilly> no
<jcater> threading is a lazy way to code servers
<jcater> (second only to forking)
<chillywilly> how do you figure?
<chillywilly> so Dave is lazy because Bayonne is multi-threaded?
<jcater> well, with simple math, I use my fingers
<jcater> as it gets more complex, I use my toes too
<chillywilly> oh plz
<chillywilly> that's a lame reason not to do threading where it makes sense
<chillywilly> sure the complexity is higher
<chillywilly> but it's more fun :)
<jcater> sure, "where it makes sense"
<chillywilly> and why shouldn't each orb request run in its own thread?
<chillywilly> you want ppl to have to wait on each other?
<jcater> there's a different between blocking vs nonblocking and threaded vs nonthreaded
<chillywilly> geeze maybe my OS should just have one process
<chillywilly> it is so much easier
<dneighbo> maybe it should, might make you more productive ;')

<jack-e> we use omniorb + omninames + omninotify + omniorbpy for our account-management-project ..
<jack-e> i find omniorb quite ok .. but i haven't yet really worked with orbit.
<jack-e> we used omniorb because of it's standard python binding and notification service .
<chillywilly> orbit has 'issues'

<chillywilly> but you might get infected with the horrendous GPL ;)
<chillywilly> the IP destroyer
<jack-e> yep .. but companies make money with linux as well (at least they did :) ...
<chillywilly> I am joking of course
<jack-e> the gnue-site explicitly tells about consultants that install gnue and make money .. 
<jack-e> ok ..
<chillywilly> yep
<psu> "we don't sell software, we sell solutions"
<chillywilly> probably not as expensive as those SAP and Oracle consultants
<jack-e> that's what we wanna do :)

<chillywilly> heheh

<chillywilly>  yep
<psu> "So tell me, Mr. SAP, if I'm buying a solution, not software
<jcater> prop vendor: "we don't sell software, we go on vacations"
<jack-e> so has anyone build apps on top of gnue and "sold" it ??
<psu> why do you care how many licenses I have?"
<psu> jack-e - AFAIK, you could never "sell" the app
<jack-e> or at least got some donations ...
<psu> GPL and all that 
<psu> but you can sell the service of writing the app
<|darks|> well cou can sell the cd :)
<jack-e> so i never can reuse what i have done .. twice ??
<psu> jack-e - yes you can, but so can anyone else
<psu> "free as in speech", AFAIK
<psu> of course, I know only what I've read on www.gnu.org
<psu> re the GPL 
<psu> so I'm hardly authorative
<psu> ask chillywilly
<jack-e> so you say .. that if i "do not modifiy gnue" but build something on top .. i need to gpl it as well ??
<jack-e> e.g. i my database scheme or my forms .. 
<psu> Needs clarification
<jack-e> jep .. definitly .. 
<psu> You might claim this falls under "freedom 0" - to use GNUe for any purpose
<psu> but equally not sure how I feel about using GNUe tools (Forms, Reports)
<psu> to build a non-free app
<psu> bear in mind the GPL only talks about distribution
<psu> if you don't distribute, you can keep your code private
<Mr_You> "are we there yet?"
<Mr_You> ;-)
<jamest> jack-e: yes
<psu> and not share it with anyone
<jack-e> if it is not possible to sell my work without opening everything to public and promote on my site: "i wrote a very good app, please copy and get in competition with my company with my own work ???"
<jamest> jack-e: I've got a client using forms in house
<psu> However, don;t trust *anything* I say about GPL
<psu> as this is all still shiny new to me
<jack-e> jamest: and you charge them for your work ??
<jack-e> i like the idea to share work on the basics (gnue for example) but i cannot see any way to keep on my business if i cannot sell an app that is build on these basics ..
<Mr_You> psu: I believe any/every company has a right to charge for their work for compensation (people gots ta eat), but greatly appreciate those companies that "free" their software after reasonable compensation
<jack-e> or work on the basic and contribute their enhancements ...
<Mr_You> jack: I believe you will find higher profits focusing on services versus a packaged product
<Mr_You> software is and should be a commodity

<jack-e> mr: i calculate about a year of work for 2-5 people for our project to be able to sell it ..
<jack-e> this will cost us about 150000$ if i would pay everyone who's involved with a regular income
<Mr_You> I believe many many customers will prefer customizing GNUe to their business versus some sort of future upgrades of the proprietary application
<jack-e> i want to use gnue for one big solution .. (with our first project)
<Mr_You> jack, I hate to say it, but a lot of people want free software in the future.. it is and should be a commodity..
<Mr_You> how long this will take, I dunno..
<jamest> jack-e: they get a cut rate as long as anything I do for them goes back to gnue
<jamest> jack-e: however it's not my "real" job
<Mr_You> software as a service will become reality.. maybe not via "web apps" but a combination of many technologies.. 
<jamest> so lots of work I do in forms that's generic doesn't cost them a dime
<jamest> however screens created in forms that they use they are charged for
<jamest> very, very little actually costs them money 
<jack-e> let's take our project as example:
<Mr_You> jack: most of the software we want to replace cost around in the hundred thousands and even millions of dollars 
<jack-e> we are consultants for educational instituts in germany
<Mr_You> after all the development and maint is incluuded
<jack-e> we are developing an account-management (and want to use gnue for example)
<jack-e> we design our solution in a way that it would fit into corporate environments from the beginning.
<jack-e> after we have some experience and the solution is really well done (otherwise i wouldn't sell it :)
<jack-e> i want to advertise: I have an account-managment for heterogenous networks that you can buy.
<jack-e> i contributed all the things that we extended gnue back to gnue.
<jack-e> can i sell this app (giving sources to my customers .. python won't let me another choice) to a number of companies ????
<Mr_You> how do you plan to extend gnue?
<Mr_You> if you modify gnue source code you must use GPL
<jack-e> i don't now yet .. i started using gnue 3 days ago .. but for example i will work on the sapdb-driver and contribute it back
<jcater> jack-e: AFAIK, all that is within the bounds of GPL wrt GNUe; but, you realize that sort of package is in competition with GNUe right? As that's the type of software we are trying to open up
<jack-e> i will try to enhance the gnue-common and we think that gnue-forms is not yet perfect.
<jack-e> so all modification we will do on gnue we will contribute back ...
<jamest> jack-e: i see no problem with you making "closed" .gfd and .gcd files
<Mr_You> yes your $___.__ package will be competing with GNUe.. so you really need to be ahead of GNUe
<jamest> jack-e: and enhancing the tools as you require but giving the enhancements back
<jamest> one way to look at it (IANAL)
<jack-e> jcarter: why is my package competing with gnue
<jamest> you could modify our parsers to only accept digitally encrypted/signed gfd files and donate that code back
<Mr_You> jack: any modification of source code must follow GPL, applications written using GNUe Designer (.gfd, .gcd) can have their own license and be commercial/proprietary if you want
<jamest> then you could distribute encrypted/closed gfd's that your customer couldn't read via normal means
<jack-e> it is a solution built with gnue .. so can everyone else who has the knowledge to build an account-management ..
<jcater> sure
<jcater> we are also doing account management packages, tho
<jcater> I'm not saying "Don't do it"... I'm just making sure you are aware that we will do similar stuff
<Mr_You> the idea is actually for any users of GNUe to create a proprietary (it is proprietary if an app is modified for their org), but can be access via open backend-framework technology if anyone wants to plugin to this proprietary system
<jack-e> account-management in my sense means: you manage users and groups for heterogenous networks (unix/win/mac)
<Mr_You> jack: if you can't compete with GNUe, you are much better off helping us ;-)
<jack-e> jcarter: does this compete ??
<Mr_You> well jack.. you and every other bub are attempting that
<Mr_You> ;-)
<Mr_You> lets see... 
<Mr_You> have you thought about how you will do this with GNUe?
<Mr_You> via python, etc?
<jack-e> as i said .. i would like to help improving gnue .. if i can get something to eat with some money i earned ..
<jack-e> mr_you .. we have a working version with Zope but we are not happy with it :)
<Mr_You> I've always said a requirement for GEAS/GNUe authentication needs to be via OS,DB, and internal GNUe/GEAS table... I don't see it being really dificult to extend this to password modification, etc..
<Mr_You> account management..
<jack-e> what i need gnue for is a RDBMS->Corba adapter and a Data-Management App that runs on multiple platforms ...
<jack-e> mr_you ... it's much more than just authenticating users ;-)
reinhard (rm@N816P015.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: "Even if you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there"
<Mr_You> jack: most orgs have already customized account management between multiple apps.. the PITA is integrating these systems with mainframes
<Mr_You> jack: yeah my point being it shouldn't be too dificult to add password modification, add accounts, etc..
<jack-e> if it is so easy .. fine .. then we will use gnue and sell specialiced versions of it :)
<Mr_You> but most orgs will want 3 different types of systems to authenticate and maintain users and passwords against: OS, DB, and GNUe table
<jack-e> but first i need a working geas-server that coops with forms and designer .. and what i got till yet .. there is a stony way to reach this 
<Mr_You> well, your code will need to be GPLed unless its external of and uses no GNUe code
<jamest> jack-e: ?
<jamest> i didn't understand last parts of last sentence
<jack-e> jamest: am i wrong ????
<Mr_You> jamest: I think he means with what he has now he is far away from reaching his goal 
<Mr_You> ;-)
<jamest> ah, well, the geas driver will be getting more love maybe tonight but it has a ways to go
<jack-e> jamest: what is your timeline for geas-0.10.0 ??
<Mr_You> hehe
<jamest> that timeline is a reinhard/neilt/friends timeline
<jack-e> i want to use sapdb for example .. so i need to wait for geas<->common integration ...
<jamest> so I don't know for sure
<jamest> ooooooo
<jack-e> i want to have a much nicer user-interface .. so i need to help extending the (you said) messy-code of forms :))
<jack-e> that's what i said .. a stony way .. 
<jamest> ok
<jack-e> I can coop with this .. i don't need to pay for gnue :)
<jamest> wrt to geas/common - i don't have answer there yet
<jamest> the UI rewrite is underway 
<jamest> however I'm a bit of a, well, a bit of an ass about the UI in forms
<jack-e> and i'm ready to contribute if i see a way to build our solution with gnue ...
<jamest> I do cave in to some pressure but I really don't want to see a widgetfest in forms
<Mr_You> widgetfest isn't bad ;-)
<jack-e> what does widgetfest mean ??
<jamest> one of my major complaints about widget sets is that 20% of what they give you can do 80% of your needs, the other 80% is "flash" that ...
<jamest>   a ) increases complexity in learning the widget set
<Mr_You> yeah good thoughts james
<jamest>  b ) incourages designers to play
Maniac-atwork (user1@anolas01-p184.mts.net) left irc: 
<jamest> so I want to keep the forms UI lean and very focused on making data aware apps very very easy to write
<Mr_You> kewl
<jamest> (widgetfest = something I made up to show that there are way too many widgets in a typical wigdet set)
<jcater> fwiw, jcater backs jamest up on this viewpoint
<jack-e> ok
<jamest> i know derek did a demo of forms in NY
<jamest> for a dude that was used to working with GTK apps
<psu> Dmitry free? So says slashdot, quoting NY Times
<jamest> and the dude was amazed at how fast and easy you could get to working app
<jack-e> but perhaps one could write forms it in a way that the it is easy to include into more "advanced" applications than just data-in/output ...
Action: Mr_You hands jason 5 cents.
<jack-e> as a module/library that i can include in apps 
<jamest> jack-e: oh yes, forms does non-dataware apps now
<jamest> I'm just saying that we'll (hopefully) keep the focus on making the basic business tasks (writing interfaces to get data into the system) very very easy
<jamest> and the other stuff may make you work a bit harder
<jamest> as it sits right now
<jamest> you can make a forms trigger do anything python can do
<jamest> and you can even manipulate forms itself
<jamest> you just have to really know the internals
<jamest> and if you do that then you have my pity
<jack-e> :)
<jamest> the trigger language is on the table for rewrite too to make the basic business tasks i spoke of above easier
<jamest> the other thing that rocks about the forms ui
<jack-e> ..
<jamest> was when the curses backend was up to date (read "working") 
<jamest> by keeping the UI simple the same file worked seemlessly on text and gui platforms
<jack-e> that'
<jack-e> s definitly interesting
<jamest> with madlockes work with html clients we'll soon (hopefully) have a web interface as well
<jamest> so the same .gfd file could be accessed via telnet, gui, or http
<jamest> that's the push for the forms 0.3.0 release
<jack-e> this raises the value of work for sure .. and there need to be limitations to achieve this .. i agree
<jamest> available sometime in (if our 0.1.0 release is any indication) Oct 2002 :)
<jcater> jamest: that early?
<jack-e> :)
<jamest> jcater: i was going to con you into looking at it sometime in Sep 2002
<jack-e> so i just should take my long awaited holiday and come back next year ??
<jamest> jcater: that way I know it'd get done :)
<jamest> lol
<jack-e> :)
<jack-e> just joking .. i'm very interested in gnue .. and I'll try to "get your pity" .. with my partner |darks| .. if he agrees on using gnue for our project :))

<dneighbo> if so check out
<dneighbo> http://judiciary.senate.gov/te121201f-lessig.htm
<dneighbo> its lessig's testimony in M$ trial from other day
<dneighbo> very very very disappointing :(
<dneighbo> basically he thinks nothing should happen to microsoft
<dneighbo> because hurting them would let cable companies take over the net
<dneighbo> and that .net is vital to preventing this
<jbailey> Errr.. Is cable companies taking over a bad thing?
<dneighbo> so we should let them go untouched and just put somone in place
<dneighbo> as the 'master overseer'
<dneighbo> and if it looks like they are being bad this person could decide and slap hand if they get out of line
<dneighbo> boy thats reassuring
<dneighbo> i suppose we would let m$ pick WHOM this overseer is too :)

<dneighbo> i really like most of lessig's stuff, but this was really bad assessment IMHO

<chillywilly> lessig is diasappointing
<jcater> what's scary is lessig is probably right
<chillywilly> his code is law stuff dneighbo?
<chillywilly> which is code more like law? or art?
<jcater> chillywilly: have you read the book?
<chillywilly> lessig's?
<dneighbo> jcater: i think he is right in some respects
<dneighbo> and normally i would AGREE, but i dont trust the system
<dneighbo> his major point is
<dneighbo> microsoft is losing, linux is starting to gain marketshare and windows is losing it
<dneighbo> so to 'fix a battle that ended' is pointless
<dneighbo> instead head off the next battle
<dneighbo> which is for the internet
<chillywilly> why does that url not resolve for me?
<dneighbo> i think he over plays the significance of .net
<dneighbo> IMHO
<chillywilly> bigbrother is trying to keep me down
<chillywilly> ;P
<dneighbo> and i think he is too idealistic to think that an 'overseer' could keep m$ in check
<dneighbo> maybe i am just paranoid
<chillywilly> well we all now how you feel about web services ;)
<dneighbo> what is your view jcater?
<dneighbo> web services (bah) thats a buzz word
<dneighbo> what is a web service?
<dneighbo> the definitions i hear exist today w/o .net
<chillywilly> got to dotgnu.org
<chillywilly> they should have  defintiion now

<dneighbo> we have it in the works
<dneighbo> the guy that started carving me an LPAR on it transferred to the state :(
<chillywilly> seriously?
<dneighbo> seriously
<chillywilly> when you gonna get county its GNUe solution?

<dneighbo> they were upgrading so the 'extra' partition was being used for a migration path
<chillywilly> LPAR?
<chillywilly> wtf is that?
<dneighbo> he was slowly moving stuff into production and saving me that LPAR for it
<dneighbo> its a mainframe partition
<dneighbo> there are two ways you can install linux on a mainframe
<dneighbo> vm = virtual machine
<chillywilly> ok
<dneighbo> partition
<chillywilly> logical partition?
<dneighbo> i.e. you can emulate linux on os/390

<chillywilly> dneighbo: you can't play with it yourself?

<neilt> dneighbo: thats when you just fake passing out
<dneighbo> i should get a picture of our mainframe
<neilt> then they open the door and you are in
<dneighbo> its pretty sweet
<dneighbo> they just replaced it like 2 years ago
<chillywilly> dneighbo: so you can get GNUe tested on big iron at county yet? ;)
<dneighbo> and now its size of like an entertainment center
<chillywilly> haw
<dneighbo> instead of like the 1000sqft it used to be :)
<dneighbo> chillywilly : um yes kind of
<chillywilly> man
<dneighbo> i have gnue forms 2 tier working against db2 on mainframe ;)
<chillywilly> but no app server testing?
<dneighbo> so technically i am using GNUe against 'big iron' but not ON it
<neilt> dneighbo: can we put that on website
<chillywilly> ah well
<dneighbo> you can put on website that its test on that sure
<chillywilly> dneighbo: I see
<dneighbo> but cant name my county
<chillywilly> heh
<dneighbo> as i dont want to go through a 6 month legal hoop jumping to get the approval :)
<chillywilly> they won't offically sponsor us?

<dneighbo> jcater: you coudl say a county in az
<dneighbo> and it would say its us
<neilt> :)
<chillywilly> what sorta battles?
<dneighbo> as we are probably only one running os/390 :)
<dneighbo> neilt difference between casually saying in irc
<dneighbo> and publicly putting as an item on a website for purposes of promotion
<dneighbo> put it this way we employ about 400 lawyers at the county
<chillywilly> see dneighbo you just need to get them to pay you to hack on GNUe and it would be all good man
<chillywilly> :)
<dneighbo> so its not like most orgs where you just do things and get A lawyers sign off
<dneighbo> if it goes to a lawyer here, its lost for 6 months
<chillywilly> ugh
<chillywilly> too much red tape
<chillywilly> ?
<dneighbo> yip
<dneighbo> contracts here are a pain in the ass especially for software
<dneighbo> as most software contracts suck
<dneighbo> they are written to effect of
<dneighbo> 'you cant ever file suit against us the software company, but if we feel you ever wrong us we have right to screw you'
<dneighbo> and of course our lawyers refuse to sign (which is good)
<dneighbo> but then its a pissing contest for 8 months
<dneighbo> and ulitimately they just sign the damn thing only have it changed to ('we cant do shit to you, you cant do shit to us')
<chillywilly> haha
<dneighbo> actually there is ONE really good contract negotiator here, Chris

<Mr_You> does anyone have any problems with storing GNUe definition files inside a database?
<chillywilly> ::P
dres (~dres@4.18.171.42) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> Mr_You: actually I think we discussed putting thing all in a database at one point
<Mr_You> for security it would be good.. if you combined db storage of all data (including definitions).. AND encrypted (via crypt local system functions) the password inside the GEAS config file (and any other files requiring passwords) this would be pretty secure..
<Mr_You> easiest solution is to create/find an app that will print the resulting encryption of the password and you can just copy and paste that
<Mr_You> hell you could just copy and paste /etc/passwd password entries
<Mr_You> someone gaining root access would have to find access to the db via a username and password or a hole in the DB security system itself
<Mr_You> someone who gained root access that is
<Mr_You> post this to the list I guess in a little while
<Mr_You> the hacker could also attempt to hack the raw data of the DB possibly
<chillywilly> hackity hack hack
<Mr_You> at that point, only some weird encryption method would work
<chillywilly> Mr_You: a hacker is one who enjoys programing an being clever at it
<chillywilly> ;)
<dneighbo> Mr_You personally i hate it
<Mr_You> yeah yeah I know
<dneighbo> but i wouldnt push my personality on you
<chillywilly> heh
<Mr_You> hate what?
<chillywilly> that's what mastas are for?
<dneighbo> we have discussed having forms and gcd's both be available via db
<chillywilly> s/?//
<dneighbo> i.e. i think we all agreed that would be an 'option'
<dneighbo> perhaps even the default
<chillywilly> we would need scripts for all dbs
<chillywilly> it would sorta make mor ework for us
<dneighbo> but we would never remove the ability to have .gfd, .gcd, etc be files
<Mr_You> well.. jason and I were talking, and if your machine gets rooted, he's one step better by just knowing what your data looks like.. much less being able to modify files
<dneighbo> as i stated, i wont argue it, but it will be an option
<Mr_You> well thats something that I can do, so make it possible and I'll make some scripts ;-)
<dneighbo> my big issue is im an ssh baby now
<Mr_You> what about GEAS config file database username password encryption?
<dneighbo> and you put all this crap in dbs and such and it gets evil real quick
<dneighbo> to manipulate it w/o a gui
<dneighbo> and when im on the beach in hawaii
<dneighbo> and a company calls up and needs me to look at something real qiuck
<dneighbo> i dont want to have to extract it form db and get to flat file
<dneighbo> review fix repackage and insert in db etc etc etc :)
<dneighbo> not saying i dont see value in it being in a db
<Mr_You> it shouldn't be a problem to have both at once
<dneighbo> just as stated its about OPTIONS :)
<Mr_You> create scripts that could, possibly, be executed by GEAS to import stuff
<Mr_You> well, I really do think that password encryption of the GEAS user's password inside the geas config file should be encryptable.. its very easy to implement

<neilt> * database fault tolerance
<neilt> * transaction support
<neilt> * load balancing
<neilt> * database access monitoring (logging of all db operations)
<neilt> * administration tool (provide number of users etc. and some administrative
<neilt>   operations as pseudo-businessobjects)
<neilt> * be able to point object field defaults to a company parameter list or
<neilt>   defaults located in the GEAS.conf file.
<neilt> * add MySQL support to parse_load_sql.py
<neilt> * add Oracle support to GEAS
<neilt> * abstract CORBA/client support to enable using different ORBs or other network
<neilt>   connection technologies
Action: chillywilly wanst to work on the first one

<jbailey> IIRC the AC_MINIX is because Minix request special hacks in TRY_COMPILE.
<chillywilly> k
<jbailey> Is CPP the C preprocessor?  It might be trying to prefer "gcc -E"

<chillywilly> this is in GNU Common C++

Action: chillywilly nominates nickr to be "spock"
<nickr> that is illogical
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> jcater just does not make a good spock
<jcater> I just can't hold er, captain
<chillywilly> his donut addiction is highly illogical ;)
Action: chillywilly fires up zsnes
Action: chillywilly should get the lord of the rings game
<chillywilly> dude Ia m goignt o have to rewrite these templates
<chillywilly> they suck
<chillywilly> :P
<chillywilly> maybe Dave will take them
<chillywilly> Is Gnome ready For the Desktop?
<chillywilly> http://news.gnome.org/gnome-news/gnome-news/1008237426/
Action: chillywilly waits to be bombarded with Gnime hatred
<chillywilly> Gnome even
<nickr> No
<chillywilly> yes nickr you and I are the only ppl who like Gnome in this channel
<chillywilly> Or were you ansswering the question?
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: dsmith tries to think of bloated jokes
<chillywilly> oooh
<nickr> I was answering the question
<chillywilly> can I have your thinkpad?
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> nickr: I know, I was being a smart ass when ignoring it and taking it as a reply to my gnome hatred comment
<jcater> ooooooh
<jcater> "I know its more fun to work on "the next great feature" than to maintain the last release, and that volunteer coders get to spend their time the way they want, but unless the code gets more stable and better documented, it will never be ready for prime time."
<nickr> so true
<chillywilly> yea
<derek> jcater: you mean we should fix what we have instead of trying to 'keep up with the jones'
<chillywilly> I agree there
<jcater> derek: novel idea, eh?
<chillywilly> derek: we want no comments out of you
<jcater> now you understand why it'll be awhile before you get grids, right?
<derek> but the jones drive a shiny new .net and moved into a large c#
Action: jcater ducks
<derek> i want that too
<derek> jcater: yip  understand and agree
<chillywilly> haha
<chillywilly> you notice how jc only pick the bas parts about the review?
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<chillywilly> coincidence?
<chillywilly> I think not
<jcater> um
<nickr> bass parts of the interview
<jcater> that's not a bad part
Action: chillywilly just read about how intuitive the panel is
<derek> jcater what was your view of lessig (i dont recall seeing it)
<nickr> the panel annoys me
<nickr> I want a transparent one
<nickr> or a dock/warf pretending one
<chillywilly> nickr: you cna fake transparency
<derek> nickr: couldnt you remove the panel and use that thing enlightnement gives you?
<chillywilly> :P
<derek> crap forget the name of it
<nickr> No.
<jcater> derek: well, I think it coincides with his book
<nickr> I don't use entl
<nickr> enl
<jcater> and I don't think that's the kind of future he's endorsing
<nickr> I want a panel that mimcs the dock though
<jcater> but is saying that with the commercialization of the internet
<jcater> it is inevitable
<jcater> which is why I agree with him IF the internet continues to be commercialized
<chillywilly> they want to build 2 internets
<chillywilly> one commercial and one not
<jcater> chillywilly: that's what he said in his book
<chillywilly> right?
<chillywilly> yep
<jcater> that was his prediction of what would happen
<jcater> and it is happening
<chillywilly> I saw something about it on a news site
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> Bush has this initiative
<chillywilly> called govnet
<chillywilly> or something
<jcater> bush can kiss my rosy red a**
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> this is being logged
<jcater> and will be a permanent part of history
<jcater> bush can kiss my rosy red a** many, many times
<jcater> (sorry, couldn't resist)
<chillywilly> don't tell me you voted for Gore?
<jbailey> jcater: The great part will be when it appears in the kernel cousin
<derek> why would he kiss your arm?
<chillywilly> heheh
<jbailey> chillywilly: Nader!! Nader!!
<derek> vote whats that?
<derek> i voted for nader, not because i wanted him
<jcater> btw, that's just in case my great-grandchildren weren't sure of my stance
<chillywilly> hehe
<derek> but because i wanted to be sure that when bush or gore was elected
<chillywilly> always looking to the future aren't we?
<derek> i could bitch and moan and bitch and moan
<derek> and say i have the right to complain i didnt vote for either one
<derek> i woudl have just NOT voted but then one could say i couldnt complain cause i didnt exercise my right to vote :)
<chillywilly> both of those parties are bought
<chillywilly> however, I do not like the alternatives either
<chillywilly> Nader is too liberal
<jcater> my point of view....
<jcater> both parties have a sucky agenda
<jcater> which is why
<jcater> I want one controlling the house and one controlling the executive branch
<jcater> :)
<derek> i liked clinton, i didnt stand for hardly any of his policies
<derek> but he barely rocked the boat
<derek> and at least the son of a bitch could weasel his way out of anything
<chillywilly> that's sort of a lame reason
<derek> including wars, trade embargos and other nasties
<derek> chillywilly: it may sound sick but i felt somewhat comfy with clinton as president
<derek> the guy was 'slick'
<derek> and honestly in politics
<derek> being able to lie and bluff
<derek> is what makes you successful
<nickr> he was a good lawyer
<chillywilly> dude how could any president right now avoid war?
<derek> if i had to send someone into negotiations with another country
<chillywilly> not even slick willy could get out of this one
<jcater> chillywilly: maybe he couldn't avoid war... 
<jcater> but I bet american's rights wouldn't be suspended
<jbailey> chillywilly: Outright invading other countries is a little extreme.
<chillywilly> jcater: give me a break
<derek> chillywilly: hmmm funny you say that
<derek> why did the terrorists not attack here until he was GONE?
<derek> i mean the 'reasons' they are attacking was from what Bush's father did
<jbailey> chillywilly: Especially since the US is guilty of almost all of the things that they accuse others of.
<derek> not what clinton did
<derek> they had 8 years to retaliate
<jcater> jbailey: absolutely
<derek> they waited until weenie boy bush was in office before they did
<chillywilly> derek: clinton could've and should've done a lot of thngs
<chillywilly> but he chooose to geta  blow job in his office
<jbailey> chillywilly: I think clinton was bogged down by people who were too obsessed with his sex life.
<derek> while i dont condone it
<nickr> since we're on the subject:
<nickr> http://www.funnystrange.com/quiz/
<derek> i dont care what he does in his office as long as he does his job
<jcater> I think clinton did a fair share with foreign policy
<jcater> btw, I'm sure EVERY president had a girl in the oval office at one point
<jcater> :P
<derek> believe me im not a fan of clinton in sense of all his policies his life etc
<jcater> I know I would
<jcater> doh!
<derek> but he kept things running
<chillywilly> well i wouldn't
<derek> i was bout to say i get **** jobs in my office and if my employer dont like it tough crap, but this is logged :)
<jbailey> jcater: *shudder* Bush senior and a girl.  What a though. =)
<derek> granted its my home office ;)
<jcater> derek: too much info
<jcater> besides, how do you pull that off?
<jcater> our wives need to meet up
<jcater> :)
<derek> rofl
<nickr> jcater: you'll never get elected now
<derek> i didnt say recently :)
<derek> once upon a time we didnt have kids you know
<jcater> nickr: I'd never get elected anyway :)
<derek> but my wife is a lady no way she woudl do that ;)

<chillywilly> gnu rules man
<derek> we are the enterprise arm of gnue :)
<derek> er gnu
<RoDude> is it linux based?
<RoDude> or any platform
<chillywilly> we try to write portable code
<RoDude> goodc
<chillywilly> it is pretty portable
<derek> GNU Enterprise (GNUe) is a suite of tools and applications for solving the needs of the enterprise. From human resources, accounting, customer relationship management and project management to supply chain or e-commerce, GNUe can handle the needs of any business, large or small. If you are looking for a full-function ERP, GNUe is the package for you.
<RoDude> any one here of purebasic?
<derek> Beyond applications, GNUe is a development framework that enables enterprise information technology professionals to customize applications for their businesses. The GNUe platform boasts an open architecture and easy maintenance. It gives users a modular system and freedom from being stuck with a single-source vendor. Plus, users get consistency and the ability to tap into a network of best practices from other enterprises, saving 
<derek> e development time.
<derek> GNUe is a Free Software project with a corps of volunteer developers around the world working on GNUe projects. This provides the added benefits of easy internationalization of applications. The project is working to provide a worldwide GNUe community, allowing everyone who is involved in the project access to other talented business information technology professionals.
<derek> yes works on linux and windows and other places too :)
<derek> nope
<derek> what is it
<RoDude> its a basic compiler
<RoDude> have you heard of Rapaid-Q?

<lvogel> how come when I try to use cvs
<lvogel> I get an error "failed to create lock directory" blah blah blah?
<lvogel> anybody?
<lvogel> class?
<lvogel> anybody?
<lvogel> Ferris?
<lvogel> Bueller?
<ajmitch> problem on the cvs server i think
<ajmitch> hmm
<ajmitch> what CVSROOT did you use?
<lvogel> anoncvs?
<ajmitch> the full thing
<lvogel> I followed the instructions from the website
<lvogel> cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot co gnue
<lvogel>     
<ajmitch> seems to be a cvs server problem
<lvogel> well poop
<jbailey> ajmitch: ?
<jbailey> ajmitch: Want something checked?
<lvogel> I want to d/l it
<ajmitch> jbailey: yeah
<ajmitch> [ajmitch @ ajmitch cvs] cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot co gnue
<ajmitch> cvs server: Updating gnue
<ajmitch> cvs server: failed to create lock directory for `/cvsroot/gnue' (/cvsroot/gnue/#cvs.lock): Permission denied
<ajmitch> cvs server: failed to obtain dir lock in repository `/cvsroot/gnue'
<ajmitch> cvs [server aborted]: read lock failed - giving up
<lvogel> that's what I got
<ajmitch> jbailey: ah yesh, you have access to that server, don't you
<jbailey> Yeah.  I'm not as familiar with the current setup, but I can at least see what the permissions say and make a more complete bug report.
<ajmitch> righto
Nick change: chillywilly_ -> chillywilly
<ajmitch> i guess i could have filed a savannah bug report too :)
<jbailey> ajmitch: You don't appear to be in the gnue group.
<ajmitch> jbailey: i'm not
<ajmitch> jbailey: why would i be?
<jbailey> oh, duh.  anoncvs. =)
<jbailey> sorry
<lvogel> is anoncvs in the gnue group?
<chillywilly> yes, you can checkout via anoncvs
<ajmitch> chillywilly: not at the moment
<chillywilly> well you;re supposed to anyway
<chillywilly> somtiemes subversions sucks
<ajmitch> yes, we know that, but jbailey's trying to sort stuff out so it might work
<chillywilly> umm, really?
<chillywilly> is that why it says that on my screen?
<chillywilly> :P
<ajmitch> no, he's just checking it
<chillywilly> if all else fails I can put a cvs snapshot on my web site
Action: ajmitch wonders why he bothers sometimes
<chillywilly> ;)
<ajmitch> it's working here with a different cvsroot
<chillywilly> yes why do you bother?
<chillywilly> you ove me too much
<chillywilly> love even
<ajmitch> :pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/home/cvs
<chillywilly> that's why
<ajmitch> mustn't have changed that one properly
<ajmitch> i do?
<jbailey> That would do it. =)
<jbailey> 'cause it really does look setup right.
<chillywilly> well I sure can't update via ssh with a real account either
<chillywilly> it is just hanging there
<chillywilly> no symlink?
<chillywilly> does /cvs point to /home/cvs?
<jbailey> They're recently removed all the deprecated symlinks.
<jbailey> My anoncvs checkout is working fine.
<ajmitch> why is /home/cvs still working then?
<chillywilly> with what root?
<ajmitch> yet /cvsroot/gnue doesn't?
<jbailey> :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gnue co gnue
<ajmitch> hostname makes no difference?
<jbailey> Shouldn't.  It's not that kind of protocol/.
<chillywilly> it shouldn't
<ajmitch> yeah
<lvogel> now it's woikin
<jbailey> lvogel: Did you do anything different?
<lvogel> jbailey's post did it for me
<chillywilly> they b0rked write access stuff for me too now
<ajmitch> does that matter?
<chillywilly> yes it does
<lvogel> <jbailey> :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gnue co gnue -- this worked
<ajmitch> i think they're trying to stop you screwing with the GNUe source ;)
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> masta probably wants me to do something
<ajmitch> ok, so it was missing the /gnue off the cvsroot
<ajmitch> that's why
<lvogel> might want to update the web page
<jbailey> You can skip the extra /gnue when you're using SSH because of a permissions trick, but it's not really correct.
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> just managed to get write access to the dotgnu repository last night
<ajmitch> ssh key cut & paste didn't work right ;)
<chillywilly> how'd you do that?
<chillywilly> :P
<chillywilly> for the debs?
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> it's just the website
<chillywilly> oooh
<chillywilly> that's no fun
<chillywilly> ;)
<ajmitch> why?
<chillywilly> they won't let you muck with any code?
<jbailey> Sounds like me with the Hurd. =)
<ajmitch> there is no code in the 'dotgnu' project, it's all in subprojects
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> I know
<jbailey> Although I guess I've committed a patch now to mig.
<chillywilly> sheesh ajmitch
<ajmitch> and now i'm committed to learning GNOME 2 coding ;)
<ajmitch> i have two weeks before the gstreamer 0.3.1 release is planned with the new mediaplayer
<jbailey> Nice. =)
<ajmitch> should be lotsa fun ;)
<ajmitch> i don't mind, it's not too hard
<ajmitch> a few of us are planning a wireless network for next year
<lvogel> so what's the story behind the module "language" stuff
<lvogel> why is it in its own language?
<ajmitch> you mean .gcd files?
<lvogel> yea
<chillywilly> it is really odl
<chillywilly> object description language
<chillywilly> i.e., idl + some OO stuff
<lvogel> so why not just use .odl instead of .gcd? 
<ajmitch> there are a few differences, but it's quite close, right?
<chillywilly> lvogel: it does not strictly follow the ODMG spec
<ajmitch> partly cos you haven't had the ODMG spec to follow ;)
<chillywilly> ummm, yea that could be why ;)
<lvogel> where do I get started on learning the architecture of this
<chillywilly> I woudl say module guide
<chillywilly> the new forms docs wouls also help
<chillywilly> would
<lvogel> what do I read docbook docs with in linux
<chillywilly> those you have to convert to somthing readbale
<chillywilly> like ps
<chillywilly> html
<chillywilly> or whatever
<chillywilly> db2html file.sgml
<chillywilly> for example
<chillywilly> so you have to install the docbook crap
<chillywilly> or
<lvogel> got a cmd that will do that recursively, or do I have to do it file by file
<chillywilly> you can read neilt's guide on his web site
<chillywilly> lvogel: you just  process th emain file
<chillywilly> it does all the rest
<lvogel> ack, what a pain
<chillywilly> yes, that's why we normally make html docs
<chillywilly> and put them on the site
<chillywilly> docbook is a pain
<lvogel> why not start with man/info pages as a base and man2html/info2html them
<lvogel> why this docbook jazz
<chillywilly> not ym decision
<chillywilly> jamest had all doc sin texinfo
<chillywilly> then they decided to change to docbook
<chillywilly> docbook can actually export to texinfo too
<jbailey> Yeah, now I have to learn docbook.  *sigh*
<jbailey> But hopefully we can finally be done with that texinfo crap. =)
<lvogel> what a friggin mess
<chillywilly> jbailey: you don't like texinfo?

<lvogel> good idea
|darks| (nobody@pD950F525.dip.t-dialin.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jbailey> jbailey: My biggest problem with texinfo is that it's an incomplete markup language and development is happening too slowly.  Other things like docbook have come back and swepped past it.
<lvogel> my problem is it takes me more than two seconds to tinker with it just so I can look at it properly :)
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> docbook?
<jbailey> Like include files are messed up.  I want to include code examples in documentation.  But part of that is that I want them all in seperate files so that I can include them in my 'make check' run.  (Make sure my docs are accurate).  No facility for this in texinfo.
<chillywilly> or texinfo?
<lvogel> they sure would look pretty in a KDEHelp-style setup
<chillywilly> that
