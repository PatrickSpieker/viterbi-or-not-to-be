<Isomer> heh
<Isomer> mine would peak around midnight I think
<Isomer> I tend to code from 10pm to about 2am

<Isomer> anyone up at this hour?
<Yurik> yes
<Isomer> under Windows they have various widgets which they can connect to a SQL database, "Data Aware Objects" or something.  I believe that Java has something similar.  Other than gnue, is there anything similar?
<Isomer> or, is the solution that GNUe provides, portable to other programs other than the forms builder?
<Isomer> or, is the solution that GNUe provides, portable to other programming languages?
<Isomer> For example, can I use corba to connect to geas to do this?
<Yurik> sorry, I can't advise anything concerning GNUe, since I'm not a GNUe participant, I coordinate a competitive project
<Yurik> :)
<Isomer> Does your competitive project provide this?
<Isomer> (heh, damned if you do... :)
<Yurik> well, our structure heavily differs from GNUe's, but we'll provide as much choices how can you use the functionality from the outside as possible, if I understand you correctly
<Yurik> s/choices/variants/
<Isomer> well, I want to develop applications in C or C++, and have access to widgets that don't require me to handle all the database handling.
<Yurik> data handling is hidden into the model in our model (we'll even have no relational database used)
<Yurik> (sorry, my English sucks a lot)
<Yurik> s/into the model/into the system/
<Yurik> I suppose it is impolite to discuss the competitive project here...
<Yurik> but if understand you in the proper way, you'll be able to program your specific applications in C/C++, both objects functionality and client applications
<Isomer> Ok funky
<Isomer> personally I think it's good to discuss "competing" projects
<Isomer> for precisely the same reason I assume you're here :)
<Yurik> well, I'm here to monitor GNUe, just to wondering what guys are doing :)
<Isomer> and I'm sure they'd be interested to hear how you're going too :)
<Isomer> keep 'em all on their toes :)
<Yurik> unfortunately, we can't compete with GNUe really, cause we have started coding recently (we spent several monthes only for design)

<AnDarkon> I've reviewed the MGP and BPP documents and came away with questions. How/towhom should I address these questions?
<jamest> MGP BPP?
<AnDarkon> Module Guide Proposal (Hi James, btw) and Base Package Proposal
<jamest> AnDarkon: who wrote them....
Action: jamest is not sure which docs we're referencing
Action: jamest hopes it isn't him or he'll fell dumb :)
<AnDarkon> MGP: Reinhard and Neil (edited by Derek)
<AnDarkon> same for BPP
<jamest> ahhh
<jamest> ok
<jamest> those are the most recent docs
<AnDarkon> Yep :-)
<jamest> and it would have to be one of those two
<jamest> of derek 
<jamest> of  = or
<jamest> you'd get the most intelligent answers from neil or reinhard
<AnDarkon> Right, and how would they prefer my communication? by email, here or to the mailing list for developers?
<jamest> not that derek isn't intelligent it's just he's not as close to docuemnts
<jamest> and I'm clueless on the current docs (spend too much time in the tools :)
<AnDarkon> I didn't think he would be any slouch in the wetware department :-)

<jamest> whoops
<jamest> wrong win
<AnDarkon> Yeah, the brake is on the left while the accelerator is on the right ;-)
<jamest> :)
<AnDarkon> what does GNUe have working so far?
<jamest> Tools wise....
<jamest>   forms
<jamest>   designer
<jamest>   reports (limited)
<AnDarkon> There's a benefit of having GNUe available for my work; I can concentrate mostly on the Time & Attendance (realtime)  module without having to worry about the frontend or the DB aspects
<jamest>   geas (has performance issues)
<AnDarkon> the designer is for the forms or is that also for biz logic?
<jamest> right now it's forms only
<jamest> we're having interface/performance issues with geas
<AnDarkon> In what way?
<jamest> and neil and reinhard are busy with real life
<jamest> the interface to geas needs work
<jamest> and the performance is terrible
<jamest> the security is terrible
<AnDarkon> the geas itself is the whole point, isn't it? what with the business logic/rules
<jamest> reinhard and neil are fixing these issues but they inherited the system
<jamest> so it's slow going
Action: drochaid wonders what 'real life' is
<AnDarkon> drochaid: usually involves another person
<drochaid> uhm .. nope, got me there

<jamest> <jamest> let me take this main channel
<jamest> <AnDarkon> Ok
<jamest> argh!
<AnDarkon> heh
<jamest> my cut n paste failed
<jamest> hi jcater
<AnDarkon> it happens
<jcater> jamest: 'sup?
<AnDarkon> I'm following so far, James
<jamest> AnDarkon: can you paste it
<jamest> i already closed the windows
<jamest> jcater: form'ing
<AnDarkon> Sure
<AnDarkon> <jamest> so when dealing w/ objects
<AnDarkon> <jamest> internally i see the following mappings
<AnDarkon> <jamest> object = table
<AnDarkon> <jamest> object instance = row in a table
<AnDarkon> <jamest> object method = trigger
<AnDarkon> <jamest> object attribute = field
<AnDarkon> <jamest> object child = master/detail relationship
<AnDarkon> Jason: just so that you know... I am Andrew M... but not the ones you know of :-) I'm just a newcomer with big plans for realtime T&A
<jamest> he's asking how objects will fit into forms
<AnDarkon> Right
Action: AnDarkon resumes listening
<jamest> and I'm telling me how I see them working
<jamest> so anyway at that point
<jamest> forms looks at objects and tables in the same mannor
<jcater> another andrew?
Action: jcater runs scared
<jcater> :)
<jamest> they both have the same capabilities and only the terminology changes a little
<AnDarkon> Just call me Andy :-)
<AnDarkon> www.darand.com/andrew if you want to know my capabilities/qualifications
<AnDarkon> yes, from the forms' perspective, the object always looks/behaves the same while the internal workings of each object may be different for each DB type

Action: Yurik got tired
<AnDarkon> Ok, I'm back
<AnDarkon> Yurik: which specification?
<Yurik> AnDarkon: not GNUe's
<AnDarkon> Ah :-)
<AnDarkon> never mind, then
<AnDarkon> jamest: I had the impression that the forms were also UI-agnostic that it could run under web, X, etc
<jamest> it should be
<jamest> at one time the curses and GUI systems both worked
<jamest> but currently the only one working is wxpython
<jamest> that is going to be fixed soon
<jamest> in fact
<AnDarkon> jamest: How tightly coupled is the forms to the wxpython?
<jamest> not at all
Action: Yurik thinks that UI is not very important thing. Most of the system in enterprise management should run absolutely automatically
<jamest> http://131.220.92.80/~jan/gfc.php
<AnDarkon> so the API to the forms is pretty much standard?
<jamest> jan is working on a php forms client
<AnDarkon> Yurik: I agree. it just so happens that my realtime T&A needs some UI in different forms: Win32, DOS, Web, etc
<jamest> and the interface to the UI system is fairly clean, it needs work 
<AnDarkon> in what way?
<jamest> but it's on the TODO list
<jamest> events should pass a hashed string id for ui elements instead of the python object
<jamest> so that the UI doesn't require access to the GFObjects
<jamest> man
<jamest> jans form client is too cool
<AnDarkon> which browser should I be using? it doesn't seem as cool as you make it be :-)
<jamest> it doesn't work?
<AnDarkon> it works... after a fashion
<AnDarkon> I'm using mozilla
<jamest> i use konqueror
<jamest> what is cool about it
<jamest> is that his goal is too make it look/behave as close to uiwxpython as possble
<jamest> and he's doing a pretty good job of it
<AnDarkon> I guess :-)
<AnDarkon> It took some data
Action: Yurik is wonderning why people use PHP... 
Action: Yurik is also wonderning, does GNUe has its own web connectivity
reinhard (~rm@62.47.45.2) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Yurik> reinhard: hi
<reinhard> hi all
<jamest> hi reinhard
<reinhard> AnDarkon: you have questions on our docs?
<jamest> AnDarkon has questions about some docs you've done
<AnDarkon> LOL
<jamest> ooo
<AnDarkon> Indeed I do
<jamest> you read the logs ;)
<reinhard> :)
<reinhard> i am here for ~20 min
<AnDarkon> Okay, lemme get my notes, they're right here
<AnDarkon> Okay, the GCD files are stored as files; has the discussion about storing them in a database come up and if so, how was it resolved?
<reinhard> the discussion has come up
<reinhard> the main points were
<reinhard> - storing them in database would be big change and take a lot of time
<reinhard> - we need files anyway to "bootstrap"
Action: AnDarkon listens, nodding with each point so far
<reinhard> - storing them in database would mean we need a comfortable way to edit it (via a form)
<AnDarkon> and for most programmers, that's almost taboo heh
<reinhard> - with gcd files we have all those un*x possibilities from grep over awk to sed
<reinhard> - having in ascii file lets you edit the definition w/ vi or emacs even over 9600 modem line or something like that
<reinhard> the final decision was
<reinhard> 1. for now let them be in gcd files
<reinhard> 2. maybe later rethink about moving to database
<reinhard> <fin>
<AnDarkon> My question was based on the fact that we might want to have a distributed network of application servers
<AnDarkon> then again, nfs could solve the problem rather neatly for shared access to the GCD files
<reinhard> yes
<AnDarkon> next question... what's the smallest resolution for the TIME type?
<AnDarkon> I'm hoping it'll be in milliseconds or I'll have to extend it for the T&A module
<reinhard> we know too little about databases
<reinhard> in fact it will depend on the database
<reinhard> but we can only "guarantee" the least common determinator
<AnDarkon> I know enough to know DBs aren't panceas to everything :-)
<reinhard> we have definitions like
<reinhard> "char must be able to store strings up to 255 bytes"
<reinhard> and for every db geas must choose a type that is able to do this
<reinhard> but we have not defined the time type so far
<AnDarkon> Ok
<AnDarkon> Maybe I got here in the nick of time (pun unintended)
<reinhard> :)
<AnDarkon> Okay, next question
<AnDarkon> BPP, page 10, type person defines name_prefix as a char<8> but doesn't use the name_prefix class... oversight?
<reinhard> btw you could make a proposal for the definition of date and time (if you do: please do a realistic one, one that is doable with all databases)
<reinhard> no oversight
<reinhard> name_prefix class should store often used name-prefixes
<reinhard> like
<AnDarkon> I know what you speak of, Oracle doesn't support datetime as well as Informix can; in the worse case scenario, it could be a CHAR field
<reinhard> Mr.
<reinhard> Mrs.
<reinhard> Herr
<reinhard> Frau
<reinhard> but it's only a list where you copy from
<reinhard> and in the person class the filed can contain values that are not in the name_prefix class
<AnDarkon> Ah, so the name similarities is just a coincidence
<reinhard> like
<reinhard> Her Majesty
<reinhard> :)
<reinhard> not a coincidence
<AnDarkon> and where is Federated States of Micronesia? :-)
<reinhard> the field is copied from the other table for comfort
<reinhard> micronesia is in the pacific ocean IIRC
<AnDarkon> ah, okay :-)
<reinhard> :)
<AnDarkon> there's a statement: org::address [] address;
<AnDarkon> can you please tell me what that is? the [] tells me it might be a list of addresses, but I don't want to assume
<reinhard> you're right it's a list of addresses
<AnDarkon> variable list, right?
<reinhard> every person can be assigned more than one address
<reinhard> yes 1:n
<AnDarkon> Okay :-) Glad my wetware is still operating
<reinhard> wetware?
<AnDarkon> <--- points to his brainpan
<reinhard> ah
<AnDarkon> page 30 of BPP, &languagedata;
<AnDarkon> that's it, just like that...
<reinhard> :)
<AnDarkon> one of these `yet to be defined'?
<reinhard> um
<reinhard> sorry i think i don't understand
Action: reinhard has no printed version and therefore doesn't know what page 30 is
<AnDarkon> 7.1.9 Default Data\\ &languagedata; \\ and then there's Chapter 8...
<AnDarkon> nothing more, nothing less so I'm not sure if it really means something or that it's just a mere placeholder
<reinhard> ah oh
<reinhard> i think this is a mistake in the sgml
<reinhard> looks like an include that didn't work
<AnDarkon> Okay :-) then I'll disregard it
<reinhard> we _do_ have a list of all languages w/ their iso code in cvs IIRC
<AnDarkon> That's fine; I just don't want to assume anything
<AnDarkon> Next question :-)
<reinhard> ok
<AnDarkon> for the class currency, the default_decimals is set to whatever the company wants it to be
<AnDarkon> and in the event of a change in management and/or accounting procedures they want to change the decimal position. Have this ever come up in a discussion or two?
<reinhard> no
<reinhard> the default_decimals is specific for the currency
<reinhard> not to the management

<derek> i.e. i was too redneck to add an option to say --with-redneck
<derek> did you see the list mail on unicode 
<derek> and that we should never use str() and related functions?
<derek> and code on how to work around it
<jcater> um
<jcater> I don;t fully agree w/that
<derek> me either
<derek> i just asked if you saw it :)
<jcater> that will KILL performance if you aren't using codecs

<derek> um going to local shop?
<jcater> gibson's
<chillywilly> heh, a donut run
Action: derek called and they will let me phone in an order, but i havent yet
<jcater> do I need to supply that phone number again?
<chillywilly> that's funny
<jcater> really?
Action: derek was going to suprise you with free donuts one day, but felt too weird asking them to pay in advance
<derek> and next time you show up telling you they were on house
<jamest> derek: no way
<jamest> he's miine
<jamest> my bug is nastier

<derek> yeah the 'sit still' module is still in development
<chillywilly> maybe I should try that

<chillywilly> *sigh*
<chillywilly> I'm sorry you don't get our yankee expressions ;)

<jcater> beats being the dumbass
<soulstompp> hi 
<chillywilly> I hope you're not trying to imply anything with that statement or you may find something in your mailbox
<soulstompp> I have a question, I just installed gnuenterprise from CVS
jbailey (~jbailey@HSE-Toronto-ppp319235.sympatico.ca) joined #gnuenterprise.
<soulstompp> and I have everything running now and I want to start toying with the forms portion to see if I can use this for some practice management software I am working on
<jamest> soulstompp: ok
<jamest> what can we do for you?
<soulstompp> is their a main .gfd file that I should run
<soulstompp> that will allow me to access the different packages
<soulstompp> I am just confused on where to go from here
<chillywilly> how can I get the LUG memebers off of perl ;)
<soulstompp> or if someone can point me to docs that I have missed I would appreciate it
<jamest> soulstompp: the packages for our biz apps?
<soulstompp> yeah the accounting for example
<derek> soulstompp: can you wait like 30 minutes till i get the kids in bed and wifey fed?
<derek> i think i can answer a lot for you
<soulstompp> not a problem
<derek> ok will be back in < 30
<soulstompp> thanks I will be here
<derek> ok
<derek> have pizza in oven and kids all ready so have 15 minutes before have to run again for a few :)
<derek> soulstompp: i am going to assume 'practice management' == some sort of doctor/lawyer ERP?
<derek> soulstompp you have a few to discuss?
<soulstompp> yeah we have an interested cardiologist and dentist
<derek> you == your company
<chillywilly> what's that practice management software?
<chillywilly> gnumed?
<chillywilly> that web based thingy
<derek> chillywilly: yes gnumed would be similar to practice management
<soulstompp> I don't know I haven't heard of that
<derek> soulstompp: a few more questions about your needs then i will explain the situation
<chillywilly> there's that and some other one
<derek> a. do the cardiologist/dentist already have something they use (software wise)
<derek> b. do they run gnu/linux
Action: derek likes to get an idea of who is in interested in gnue and how they plan to use it for marketing purposes
<soulstompp> no although they wouldn't have a problem with the server being gnu/linux
<derek> soulstompp: the current situation is something like this.....
<derek> GNUe is several things but its core things are :
<derek> a. a framework for rapid business application development
<derek> b. a prebuilt system using the framework that is highly extensible
<derek> i will say that (a) is split in two ways
<derek> 1. client/server (2 tier) (no application server)
<derek> 2. multi tier (application server)
<derek> the framework for client server is HIGHLY usable and in use in production in some facilities today
<soulstompp> we would be using option 1 as most of these will be small offices with few users
<derek> the multi tier application server is not fully functional, it works but is not production ready
<derek> the biggest issue we face is that we have only build 'custom' solutions
<chillywilly> :(
<derek> so we dont have an 'accounting package' you can download
Action: chillywilly strokes GEAS
<derek> we have a lovely framework with which you could readily build one
<soulstompp> I see
<jamest> the work on a gnue accounting package was written with our app server in mind
<derek> we do have a lot of supply chain and some accounting with specificaitions (read business requirements)
<derek> HOWEVER those specs were built with our application server in mind
<jamest> but not a 2 tier solution
<derek> so they are all object based
<jamest> however the 2-tier tools are pretty fast
<derek> the upside to this is we want gnue success stories 
<derek> and we want them bad
<jamest> at building solutions
<derek> which means im sure you would get more than one of us to help you on practice management software
<derek> IF you were willing to give them back to gnue for others to enjoy
<soulstompp> that sounds great
<derek> i know that isnt as wonderful as being able to download working software today
<derek> but i think you will find gnue builds applications VERY quickly
<soulstompp> this is a new business and all of us are in agreement that GNU is the way to go
<soulstompp> so I would happily contribute everything back to the community
<soulstompp> that is good
<jamest> but spending kwalitee time in #gnuenterprise is pretty wonderfull in it's own way
<derek> and i think that if they have NOTHING at all currently other than paper
<derek> you could give them USEFUL applications by weeks end
<soulstompp> because our only focus will not be just practice managment
<soulstompp> we are looking at other fields as well
<derek> when i say USEFUL, it might not have all bells and whistles but they will be capturing some stuff in a real database
<soulstompp> yeah
<derek> so when more features come on line they can easily start absorbing them
<soulstompp> now how is the reporting end of things
<derek> not the best
<derek> not the worst
<soulstompp> that is an area I would like to help
<derek> i say that because technically its all in a sql database
<derek> so if you bought a version of crystal reports
<soulstompp> I used to do support for Seagate Software Crystal Reports
<derek> or used report lab or etc you could easily get at the data
<derek> our report server i think kicks MAJOR ass
<derek> but its not production ready yet
StormBringer (~eugene@194.84.60.130) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> it generates all XML output for maximum flexibility
<soulstompp> :)
<derek> and it works liek a SERVER
<derek> i.e. i can run in server mode
<derek> so that you can 'cache' reports
<derek> like monthly financials and things
<soulstompp> that is very cool
<derek> it really does some useful things right now
<derek> but its far from production qwality
<derek> btw: one VERY useful thing it does is document merges :)
<derek> which is VERY important for practice management
<soulstompp> yeah
<derek> as they have to write lots of patient and insurance 'letters' or 'form' letters
<derek> we support that pretty cool now
<soulstompp> we have about 4 crystal report guys that can help so the reporting isn't dire right now
<derek> basically you can use ms office, star office, abiword etc to make document
<soulstompp> wow!
<derek> and run it against server to poplulate it
<soulstompp> that is a very nice feature
jan (jan@dial-213-168-88-120.netcologne.de) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<soulstompp> so is their a GUI core?
<soulstompp> meaning the screenshots that are their, such as the login screen
<soulstompp> or do I more or less start the gui portion of the app from scratch?
<jamest> forms is a GUI
<jamest> that ties directly to a datasource
<jamest> what database are you using?
<jamest> as your backend
<soulstompp> postgres
<jamest> you have it there now?
<jamest> running?
<chillywilly> mmmm, postgres
<soulstompp> I have a couple of postgres databases running
<jamest> if so 
<jamest> cool
<jamest> ok now
<jamest> did you install cvs gnue forms/common/designer
<jamest> or did you do a developers install
<soulstompp> I installed the designer
<jamest> a full system install or just the developer install
<jamest> iow did you
<jamest> cd cvs/gnue
<jamest> ./setup.py
<jamest> or did you
<jamest> cd /cvs/gnue/common
<jamest> ./setup.py install
<jamest> cd ../forms
<jamest> ./setup.py install
<jamest> cd ../designer
<jamest> ./setup.py install
<jamest> the first gives you a cvs based install as yourself
<soulstompp> I followed step by step the cvs install guide for RedHat 7.2

Action: jamest needs to look at that guide :)
<jamest> just a sec :)
<soulstompp> k
<jamest> alrighty
<jamest> in /usr/local/gnue/etc/connections.conf
<jamest> put an entry for one of your databases
<jamest> a postgresql example should already be there
<jamest> if that file isn't there then a sample.connections.conf will be in that dir that you can use as a template
<jamest> btw - i'm walking you thru building a ui
<jamest> so you can see how easy it is :)
<soulstompp> I copied the sample one over and have two
<soulstompp> cool
<jamest> so you have your database in there now
<jamest> ?
<jamest> let me know when you do
<soulstompp> should I make the two databases that are listed in the file
<soulstompp> or make my own?
<jamest> make your own
<jamest> those are just samples
<jamest> i think
stbain (GunAndGiz@ip68-10-44-170.rn.hr.cox.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> lemme check something
<stbain> o
<stbain> k
<jamest> most of our sample forms use a gnue database entry
<jamest> the name in brackets in the connections.conf file is the defined name of the connection
<jamest> [gnue] for instance
<jamest> the next 4 lines map that name to a specific database
Action: derek is back, if jamest starts to drown i will help ;) (ha like that will happen)
<jamest> for instance on my system
<soulstompp> okay database gnuetest is created
<jamest> i have a system wide [prod] defined for my users
<jamest> then in my personal conenctions.conf (devel install) i have a [prod] that really points to a devel database
<jamest> so I dont screw up my users
<jamest> ok
<jamest> now type
<jamest> gfdesigner
<derek> soulstompp: preferably point to a database taht has tables already
<jamest> yes
<jamest> please
<derek> so we can show you power of designer right away w/ minimal fuss
<soulstompp> hmmm
<derek> as we will run a wizard that will auto build forms from existing postgres tables
<soulstompp> I don't thik I have acess to any right off
<derek> that is ok
<derek> you can do a blank one
<soulstompp> k
<jamest> in the forms/samples/zipcode
<derek> and we can do a create script to build a sample table
<jamest> there is a pg sql file that will create  a zipcode table in a db
<derek> speaking of that 
<derek> jamest thanks for giving me a state table with flordia in it ;)
<jamest> you're welcome
<soulstompp> k
<soulstompp> done
<jamest> you created the table?
<soulstompp> yeah
<jamest> ok
<jamest> gfdesigner
<jamest> then when it's up
<jamest> File->connect to->the connection you defined that points to the database you created your table in 
<derek> ====
<derek> I recently created a resume in your database.  However, whenever I reached the line to input my home state, if I clicked on what should be "Florida," instead the word "Flordia" pops up.  I do not want it to seem like I cannot spell my own home state properly.  Is there a way for someone to correct this error so that I may update my online resume?  I appreciate your attention to this matter.
<derek>  
<derek> ====
<derek> was a funny 'email' to get :)
<derek> fwiw it made my laugh for the day, since it was a 30 second fix that changed things system wide
<jamest> soulstompp: you ok?
<soulstompp> yeah
<jamest> whoops
<jamest> smack me
<jamest> you don't have to do that :)

<soulstompp> no?
<jcater> mest
<jamest> file -> new -> from wizard

<soulstompp> oh crap I don't have the pypgsql on this one
<jamest> any postgresql driver will work

<derek> i found solution
<chillywilly> yes? :)
<soulstompp> lemme grab the RPM I need
<derek> we could use and ADO driver for common
<derek> m$ says they require a 'first' born
<chillywilly> put glue on the walls?
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> we'll use yours then
<derek> you could trade that bouncing boy for an ADO api ;)(
<chillywilly> you have children to spare
Action: chillywilly only has one
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> we need find someone with a kid so bad that m$ will give them back :)
<derek> soulstompp: how is that rmp'find' going?
<derek> btw you will need probably mxDateTime rpm
<derek> from egenix as well
<derek> it might be mxBase or something (which ever one has mxDateTime)
<chillywilly> ummm
Action: derek slaps guido & company for such poor date/time funcitons
<soulstompp> I am downloading that one now
<soulstompp> mx
<chillywilly> I know of such a kid
<chillywilly> I am 100% that M$ will give back my nephew
<chillywilly> er, 100% sure ;)

<derek> Q. 'you know why the speed limit stops at 68?'
<derek> A. 'cause at 69 you eat it'
<derek> hahahaha
<derek> i still think thats the dumbest joke
<chillywilly> heh
<derek> her other one at that time
<soulstompp> that rpm installed fine but when I make the connection it is saying the driver isn't found
<derek> Q. 'you know the word for 69 in chinese?'
<derek> A. 'twocanchew'
<chillywilly> man
<derek> equally as dumb but tradition at our house i suppose 
<chillywilly> maybe it isn;'t so great to have a mom like that ;)
Action: derek was abused as an adolescent ;)
<jcater> roflmao
<derek> you have more than one version of python i suppose soulstompp
<derek> i assume that driver installed under the 1.5.2 version
<derek> not the 2.x version
<soulstompp> yeah
<soulstompp> I think so because that is what redhat wants to default to
<derek> pygresql is easy to install source
<jamest> soulstompp: we jumped to 2.x
<derek> as its python setup.py install
<derek> i would get tar ball and do
<jamest> thinking distros wouldn't be far behind
<derek> python2.x setup.py install
<jamest> that bites us alot :(
<derek> of pygresql  or what ever
<derek> where .x is your version of python
<soulstompp> yeah that is the way that I did it
<chillywilly> hey debian is cool with that ;)
<soulstompp> oh I mean for the main part
<soulstompp> of installing gnue 
<soulstompp> just not for the driver
<soulstompp> I will go do that
<derek> repeat for driver and you will ok me thinks :)
<derek> jcater you go to gibson's already?
<soulstompp> if I leave the rpm on their so that my 1.5.2 has postgres avaiable
<soulstompp> will that cause problems with the source install?
<derek> not that i know of
<jcater> derek: not yet
<soulstompp> k
<jcater> derek: jamest has me tied to my chair
<derek> you like donut holes right?
<jcater> oh, yeah!
<derek> its one on moriah right?
<jamest> derek: i found a, um, interesting feature in the common dataobject system
<derek> yeah me too
<derek> grids dont work
<derek> i.e. when you do rows
<derek> it fills the rows
<jamest> i couldn't figure out where that feature was implemented
<derek> BUT only gets 3 at a time
<jamest> derek: what db driver?
<derek> um
<derek> pygresql i think
<jamest> set your datasource cache= number up higher
<jamest> and see what happens
<derek> ok
<derek> is 3 default?
<derek> as i dont think i have it set to anything currently
<jamest> um
<jamest> it should be 5
Action: derek is testing
<jamest> my states forms do the right thing
fil_c (username@public1-cosh3-3-cust12.cosh.broadband.ntl.com) left irc: Ping timeout: 14400 seconds
<jamest> provider = pypgsql
<derek> it is 5
<derek> i.e. its looping on 5 records not 3 
Action: derek has bad memory
<jamest> what version of pypgsql?
<jamest> even set to 5
<jamest> it should do the right thin
<jamest> as that is where mine is set
<jamest> and i can see 10 records in rows just fine
<jamest> however
<jamest> i _think_ older pypgsql's did something odd
<jamest> popy IIRC wasn't effected 
<derek> ok that fixed it kind of
<jamest> so you can switch providers to test it
<derek> cache make the loop bigger but still loops
<derek> example
<derek> if i have cache set to 10
<derek> and i have a grid of 10
<jamest> soulstompp: how goes the battle?
<derek> if i navigate the grid to row 10
<derek> and move to row 11
<derek> i see what was in row 1
<derek> i.e. when it caches 10 records it only has those 10 records
<derek> i would EXPECT behavior to cache only 10 at a time
<derek> but if go to 11
<jamest> derek: it does that
<derek> number 1 should fall out of cache
<derek> and 11 brought in
<jamest> perfectly
<jamest> your install is what is screwed up 
<derek> my install?
<jamest> suprize, suprise
<jamest> :)
<jamest> yes
<derek> what is wrong with it?
<derek> i grabbed new cvs last night
<jamest> are you sure you're running a newer pypgsql version?
<derek> and did setup.py install from the root cvs dir
<soulstompp> the driver type for pygresql would be pypgsql right?
<derek> no old pygres version im sure
<derek> ;)
<jamest> soulstompp: yes
<derek> doesnt mean my install is messed up
<derek> means that i have older driver :)
<jamest> yeah, but I mentioned that above
<jamest> issue with older pypgsql
<jamest> which is your install :)
Action: derek is deathly afraid to fix pygresql
<jamest> forms is perfect except for feature here and there :)
<derek> as last time i tried popy and such on this
<derek> machine i was in hell
<jamest> but I keep them to myself so I dont have to adjust them till someone else finds them :)
<derek> read EVERY TIME i try to be productive with forms
<derek> i run into a problem
<derek> and when i go to fix it, it consumes all the time i had for productivity
<derek> so i wont fall in that trap tonight :)
<derek> i.e. i will live with bad caching in order to be productive :)
<derek> as i know i touch that driver i will be fighting it all night
<derek> one of the pains of running redhat 6.2 in a redhat 7.1 world :)
<jamest> :)
<jcater> derek: you're behind the times
<derek> soulstompp: that was not meant to scare you away, gnue is very usable, i just am the user that beats the living hell out of it
<jcater> ot's a redhat 7.2 world now
<derek> jcater: i wont tell you of my alpha machine still running rh5.2 then :)
<derek> which was before redhat put kde on disk and gnome was unusable so it is running fvwm
<jamest> derek is a user from hell
<jamest> he can make a bucket of water crash
<soulstompp> I guess so
<derek> hey its hard work getting things configured in such evil ways
<soulstompp> I still have to support 5.x for a couple hundred users on a web server
<soulstompp> I am not scared of anything
<jamest> i was afraid to meet him in San Fran 
<jan> derek: won't you try debian? You can use windowmanager instead of fvwm...;)
<jamest> figured his mere presence there would trigger the big earthquake
<derek> jan i love debian
<chillywilly> jamest: :)
<derek> only reason rh6.2 exists is im too nervous to kill my laptop
<derek> and have down time
<jcater> derek: send it this way
Action: chillywilly is a debian only kinda guy
<jcater> either jamest or I would love to kill it
<jcater> and give it down time
<chillywilly> haw haw
<jamest> you betcha
<derek> the alpha box is only redhat still cause i cant remember how to dick with the bios (alpha bios' are operating systems) to get debian on it
<derek> i will say using a non intel box is an experience
<derek> and honestly is like going from windows to linux
<jamest> give it to your daughter for 10 minutes and she'll get it running, you're too old to figure it out
<derek> makes you wonder how the hell you lived w/o it
<derek> i.e. thier friggin bios is more advanced that win2000
<jan> if debian alpha  has as much docu as debian powerpc it will be some days of fun.
<soulstompp> I have installed that driver with python 2
<chillywilly> werd
<soulstompp> and it had no problems
<jamest> great!
<soulstompp> but I get the error that their is no database driver for pypgsql
<jamest> you ready for designer?
<jamest> did you reinstall mxdatetime under python2
<soulstompp> I reran the installer and it said that nothing was done because everything was installed fine
<soulstompp> nope that would be the problem
<jamest> one thing we do
<jamest> is try errors on db driver import
<jamest> trap
<jamest> then report it as not installed
<jamest> which is sorta misleading
<soulstompp> okay
<soulstompp> lemme go find that tar ball
<jamest> as the driver can be installed but if it's dependecies are missing then blam
<derek> in gnue/common/scripts$
<derek> there is a file
<derek> gnue-diag.sh
<derek> can you make it executable and run it?
<derek> jamest: we used to do that now we have a diagnostic program :)
<derek> jamest im using pypgsql i guess not pygresql
<derek> soulstompp: for each instance of python you should get a diagnostic
<derek> similar to

<jcater> dude! you're still using the alpha version of 2.2
<derek> can you paste what yo uhave for you python versions here?
<derek> or in #gnue-flood
<derek> jcater: ssshhhh
Action: derek is too lazy to compile new version
<derek> as i keep telling myself no new crap on this machine
<derek> as it really needs debian :)
<jcater> um
<jcater> then don't bitch about unicode issues
<jcater> :)
<derek> rofl
<soulstompp> brb guys gotta meeting
<soulstompp> on a sunday night AHHH!
<jamest> pypgsql is what you'd mentioned before
<derek> ah ok
<jamest> every postgresql dirver has proven a bit odd wrt the spec
<derek> lk;adsfj;fsdaj;klsfdajklfasjf
<derek> i hate this really i do

<derek> and what the fsck is it using postgresql driver for
<jamest> is your connections.conf good?
<derek> ok got wizard to work
<derek> yeah
<derek> for local form
<derek> now will try for one i need to be productive
<derek> piss it dont work

<derek> it appears to be IGNORING port
<derek> i dont see that in the connection string
Action: jamest will look
<derek> but it did work last night
<derek> [hcs]
<derek> comment = HCS Production
<derek> provider = pypgsql
<derek> host = localhost
<derek> port = 9999
<derek> dbname = hcs_prod
<derek> is the connections.conf entry for it
<jamest> port is being ignored
<jamest> well
<jamest> actually
<jamest> it's not even in our docs
<derek> damnit jim it worked yesterday :)
<derek> and since when did 'not in our docs' mean it didnt exist :)
<derek> where did the weasel jcater run off too :)
<derek> he was one that showed me this undocumented feature
<derek> course i changed my connections.conf and deleted the one that worked :(
Action: derek goes to grep ash logs
<jcater> geeze
Action: jcater misread that
Action: jcater read that as something re crap on ash's logs
Action: jcater thought ash was upset
<jcater> undocumented feature?
<jcater> I thought port= was documented
<derek> jcater:  you have any ideas on this issue?
<derek> it worked the other day when we played
<derek> i can psql -h localhost -p 9999 -U hcs_www hcs_prod just fine
<jan> happy carnival night (todays german carnival)!! bye

<jcater> derek: use another driver?
<jamest> it's not in Connections.txt
<derek> sigh but this driver worked last ngiht
<jamest> derek: when was your last cvs update?
<jcater> sigh
<derek> um like 10 minutes ago
<derek> maybe an hour ago
<jamest> before last night?
<jamest> when it worked
<jamest> have you been up to date for a while?
<derek> yeah
<derek> i updated cvs before i got it to work like yesterday or day before
<jamest>  self._connectString = 'host=%s dbname=%s user=%s password=%s'
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> we need to modify connections.txt to say "look in README.databases" to see all supported parameters
<jcater> as each database driver supports different parameters
<jcater> most either support the (host, port) pair or (service) string
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> none of the pgsql drivers support it though
<jamest> and I don't think I've worked on them in ages
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> I swear this was working yesterday
<jcater> how bizarre
<jcater> but you're right... I see nothing in there
<derek> wow now i can make code disappear too ;)
<derek> damn i am good
<jamest> i can't find ref to it in cvs either
<jamest> in the logs
<derek> whats really funny is grepping irc logs
<derek> and i cant find the conversation jcater and i had about it even
<derek> but i know we had taht conversation
<derek> and that we got it to work
<jcater> we did?
<jcater> what conversation?
<jcater>   /msg jamest I think it's working
Action: derek thinks maybe jcater and i were drinking too hard that night or something
<jcater> was that my Merlot and Taco night?
<jcater> as that was some bad sh*t
<jamest> derek
<jamest> you might be able to do
<jamest> host=foo.bar.com:port
<derek> jcater: yeah
<derek> jamest: but port worked before :)
<jamest> dude
<jamest> i've went back over a month
<jamest> it's not in cvs
<derek> jcater: i think he is playing games with us
Action: derek has a cvs snapshot
<derek> from that day
Action: derek goes to look
<soulstompp> hey I am going to have to finish this up tommorow
<jamest> soulstompp: ok
<soulstompp> thank you jamest and derek for all of your help
<jamest> no problem
<jamest> hope to see you tomorrow
<soulstompp> I will get the connection set up tonight
<soulstompp> and be ready for the rest tommorow
<soulstompp> I have a GPL fistfight I gotta finish with the founders :)
<chillywilly> hehe
<soulstompp> I am glad to see that this project has a community that is so helpful
<soulstompp> it is going a long way in my argument
<derek> jamest: where is PGData....
<soulstompp> well that and that the product is so cool

<derek> .....
<derek> jamest: localhost:9999 works
<derek> so the question of the night what happened to 
<derek> port = support :)
<derek> damn still have funky unicode save
Action: derek wets himself
<derek> inline label editing
<derek> can it be true
<jcater> dude
<jcater> that's like 2-3 weeks old
<jamest> derek: self._connectString = '%s::%s:%s:%s::' is for
<jamest> host dbname user password
<jamest> there is no port support there
<jamest> is in place editing older that drag and drop layout and selection by box?
<jamest> if so derek may be in for a real treat
<jcater> I think so
<jamest> is there any need to add port=support to postgresql drivers
<jcater> yes
<jcater> definitely
<jamest> or is the current host:port good enought
<derek> jamest: i like idea of port =
Action: derek trying useful remote form now
<derek> rock
<derek> guys this is killer info
<derek> over my wireless broadband
<derek> did query with local form accessing ssh tunneled postgres db
<derek> 8 fields (5456 records)
<derek> took about 40 seconds
<derek> once they are here
<derek> i navigate with NO lag
<jamest> derek: you probably don't have all the records
<derek> oh im creaming myself here
<jamest> it precaches them
<jamest> so only a cluster at a time
<derek> a query on that set (which wouldd be NORMAL usage)
<derek> is transparent speed wise
<jamest> that was the idea
<derek> argh not having damn updated driver hurts though
<derek> um ok tell me about drag and drop datasource fields
<derek> i.e how do you do it
<derek> as i ahve a fomr now that i want to make master detail
<derek> would be great to drag and drop the new fields onto the form
<jamest> um
<jamest> master/detail still requires you to setup the second datasrouce manually IIRC
<derek> mmm schema editor is nice
<jamest> you should be able to drag and drop from there IIRC
<jamest> just grab a field and drop it
<jamest> however it was segfaulting for me other day
<derek> nope
<derek> no segfault
<derek> but no workie either

<jamest> lemme look
<jamest> jcater is deep into datasources
<derek> i think it broke something else as i cant manually add a datasrouce eitehr
<derek> restarting designer
<derek> ok i cant add new datasource :(
<derek> any ideas
<derek> i tried in object navigator right mouse clicking and choosing new->datasource

<derek> btw: your answer didnt help
<jamest> is this fresh cvs????? 
<derek> at datasrouce level doesnt tell me anything
<derek> do i do

<derek> ok :)

<derek> this is cvs from less than 2 hours ago
<jamest> this is nuts
<derek> to my knowledge
<jamest> that is a placeholder warning 
<jamest> simply saying that the dbdrivers are calling something they dont need to anymore
<jamest> the postgresql drivers _don't_ call that anymore
