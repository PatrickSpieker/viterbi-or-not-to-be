<Isomer> heh
<Isomer> mine would peak around midnight I think
<Isomer> I tend to code from 10pm to about 2am

<Isomer> anyone up at this hour?
<Yurik> yes
<Isomer> under Windows they have various widgets which they can connect to a SQL database, "Data Aware Objects" or something.  I believe that Java has something similar.  Other than gnue, is there anything similar?
<Isomer> or, is the solution that GNUe provides, portable to other programs other than the forms builder?
<Isomer> or, is the solution that GNUe provides, portable to other programming languages?
<Isomer> For example, can I use corba to connect to geas to do this?
<Yurik> sorry, I can't advise anything concerning GNUe, since I'm not a GNUe participant, I coordinate a competitive project
<Yurik> :)
<Isomer> Does your competitive project provide this?
<Isomer> (heh, damned if you do... :)
<Yurik> well, our structure heavily differs from GNUe's, but we'll provide as much choices how can you use the functionality from the outside as possible, if I understand you correctly
<Yurik> s/choices/variants/
<Isomer> well, I want to develop applications in C or C++, and have access to widgets that don't require me to handle all the database handling.
<Yurik> data handling is hidden into the model in our model (we'll even have no relational database used)
<Yurik> (sorry, my English sucks a lot)
<Yurik> s/into the model/into the system/
<Yurik> I suppose it is impolite to discuss the competitive project here...
<Yurik> but if understand you in the proper way, you'll be able to program your specific applications in C/C++, both objects functionality and client applications
<Isomer> Ok funky
<Isomer> personally I think it's good to discuss "competing" projects
<Isomer> for precisely the same reason I assume you're here :)
<Yurik> well, I'm here to monitor GNUe, just to wondering what guys are doing :)
<Isomer> and I'm sure they'd be interested to hear how you're going too :)
<Isomer> keep 'em all on their toes :)
<Yurik> unfortunately, we can't compete with GNUe really, cause we have started coding recently (we spent several monthes only for design)

<AnDarkon> I've reviewed the MGP and BPP documents and came away with questions. How/towhom should I address these questions?
<jamest> MGP BPP?
<AnDarkon> Module Guide Proposal (Hi James, btw) and Base Package Proposal
<jamest> AnDarkon: who wrote them....
Action: jamest is not sure which docs we're referencing
Action: jamest hopes it isn't him or he'll fell dumb :)
<AnDarkon> MGP: Reinhard and Neil (edited by Derek)
<AnDarkon> same for BPP
<jamest> ahhh
<jamest> ok
<jamest> those are the most recent docs
<AnDarkon> Yep :-)
<jamest> and it would have to be one of those two
<jamest> of derek 
<jamest> of  = or
<jamest> you'd get the most intelligent answers from neil or reinhard
<AnDarkon> Right, and how would they prefer my communication? by email, here or to the mailing list for developers?
<jamest> not that derek isn't intelligent it's just he's not as close to docuemnts
<jamest> and I'm clueless on the current docs (spend too much time in the tools :)
<AnDarkon> I didn't think he would be any slouch in the wetware department :-)

<jamest> whoops
<jamest> wrong win
<AnDarkon> Yeah, the brake is on the left while the accelerator is on the right ;-)
<jamest> :)
<AnDarkon> what does GNUe have working so far?
<jamest> Tools wise....
<jamest>   forms
<jamest>   designer
<jamest>   reports (limited)
<AnDarkon> There's a benefit of having GNUe available for my work; I can concentrate mostly on the Time & Attendance (realtime)  module without having to worry about the frontend or the DB aspects
<jamest>   geas (has performance issues)
<AnDarkon> the designer is for the forms or is that also for biz logic?
<jamest> right now it's forms only
<jamest> we're having interface/performance issues with geas
<AnDarkon> In what way?
<jamest> and neil and reinhard are busy with real life
<jamest> the interface to geas needs work
<jamest> and the performance is terrible
<jamest> the security is terrible
<AnDarkon> the geas itself is the whole point, isn't it? what with the business logic/rules
<jamest> reinhard and neil are fixing these issues but they inherited the system
<jamest> so it's slow going
Action: drochaid wonders what 'real life' is
<AnDarkon> drochaid: usually involves another person
<drochaid> uhm .. nope, got me there

<jamest> <jamest> let me take this main channel
<jamest> <AnDarkon> Ok
<jamest> argh!
<AnDarkon> heh
<jamest> my cut n paste failed
<jamest> hi jcater
<AnDarkon> it happens
<jcater> jamest: 'sup?
<AnDarkon> I'm following so far, James
<jamest> AnDarkon: can you paste it
<jamest> i already closed the windows
<jamest> jcater: form'ing
<AnDarkon> Sure
<AnDarkon> <jamest> so when dealing w/ objects
<AnDarkon> <jamest> internally i see the following mappings
<AnDarkon> <jamest> object = table
<AnDarkon> <jamest> object instance = row in a table
<AnDarkon> <jamest> object method = trigger
<AnDarkon> <jamest> object attribute = field
<AnDarkon> <jamest> object child = master/detail relationship
<AnDarkon> Jason: just so that you know... I am Andrew M... but not the ones you know of :-) I'm just a newcomer with big plans for realtime T&A
<jamest> he's asking how objects will fit into forms
<AnDarkon> Right
Action: AnDarkon resumes listening
<jamest> and I'm telling me how I see them working
<jamest> so anyway at that point
<jamest> forms looks at objects and tables in the same mannor
<jcater> another andrew?
Action: jcater runs scared
<jcater> :)
<jamest> they both have the same capabilities and only the terminology changes a little
<AnDarkon> Just call me Andy :-)
<AnDarkon> www.darand.com/andrew if you want to know my capabilities/qualifications
<AnDarkon> yes, from the forms' perspective, the object always looks/behaves the same while the internal workings of each object may be different for each DB type

Action: Yurik got tired
<AnDarkon> Ok, I'm back
<AnDarkon> Yurik: which specification?
<Yurik> AnDarkon: not GNUe's
<AnDarkon> Ah :-)
<AnDarkon> never mind, then
<AnDarkon> jamest: I had the impression that the forms were also UI-agnostic that it could run under web, X, etc
<jamest> it should be
<jamest> at one time the curses and GUI systems both worked
<jamest> but currently the only one working is wxpython
<jamest> that is going to be fixed soon
<jamest> in fact
<AnDarkon> jamest: How tightly coupled is the forms to the wxpython?
<jamest> not at all
Action: Yurik thinks that UI is not very important thing. Most of the system in enterprise management should run absolutely automatically
<jamest> http://131.220.92.80/~jan/gfc.php
<AnDarkon> so the API to the forms is pretty much standard?
<jamest> jan is working on a php forms client
<AnDarkon> Yurik: I agree. it just so happens that my realtime T&A needs some UI in different forms: Win32, DOS, Web, etc
<jamest> and the interface to the UI system is fairly clean, it needs work 
<AnDarkon> in what way?
<jamest> but it's on the TODO list
<jamest> events should pass a hashed string id for ui elements instead of the python object
<jamest> so that the UI doesn't require access to the GFObjects
<jamest> man
<jamest> jans form client is too cool
<AnDarkon> which browser should I be using? it doesn't seem as cool as you make it be :-)
<jamest> it doesn't work?
<AnDarkon> it works... after a fashion
<AnDarkon> I'm using mozilla
<jamest> i use konqueror
<jamest> what is cool about it
<jamest> is that his goal is too make it look/behave as close to uiwxpython as possble
<jamest> and he's doing a pretty good job of it
<AnDarkon> I guess :-)
<AnDarkon> It took some data
Action: Yurik is wonderning why people use PHP... 
Action: Yurik is also wonderning, does GNUe has its own web connectivity
reinhard (~rm@62.47.45.2) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Yurik> reinhard: hi
<reinhard> hi all
<jamest> hi reinhard
<reinhard> AnDarkon: you have questions on our docs?
<jamest> AnDarkon has questions about some docs you've done
<AnDarkon> LOL
<jamest> ooo
<AnDarkon> Indeed I do
<jamest> you read the logs ;)
<reinhard> :)
<reinhard> i am here for ~20 min
<AnDarkon> Okay, lemme get my notes, they're right here
<AnDarkon> Okay, the GCD files are stored as files; has the discussion about storing them in a database come up and if so, how was it resolved?
<reinhard> the discussion has come up
<reinhard> the main points were
<reinhard> - storing them in database would be big change and take a lot of time
<reinhard> - we need files anyway to "bootstrap"
Action: AnDarkon listens, nodding with each point so far
<reinhard> - storing them in database would mean we need a comfortable way to edit it (via a form)
<AnDarkon> and for most programmers, that's almost taboo heh
<reinhard> - with gcd files we have all those un*x possibilities from grep over awk to sed
<reinhard> - having in ascii file lets you edit the definition w/ vi or emacs even over 9600 modem line or something like that
<reinhard> the final decision was
<reinhard> 1. for now let them be in gcd files
<reinhard> 2. maybe later rethink about moving to database
<reinhard> <fin>
<AnDarkon> My question was based on the fact that we might want to have a distributed network of application servers
<AnDarkon> then again, nfs could solve the problem rather neatly for shared access to the GCD files
<reinhard> yes
<AnDarkon> next question... what's the smallest resolution for the TIME type?
<AnDarkon> I'm hoping it'll be in milliseconds or I'll have to extend it for the T&A module
<reinhard> we know too little about databases
<reinhard> in fact it will depend on the database
<reinhard> but we can only "guarantee" the least common determinator
<AnDarkon> I know enough to know DBs aren't panceas to everything :-)
<reinhard> we have definitions like
<reinhard> "char must be able to store strings up to 255 bytes"
<reinhard> and for every db geas must choose a type that is able to do this
<reinhard> but we have not defined the time type so far
<AnDarkon> Ok
<AnDarkon> Maybe I got here in the nick of time (pun unintended)
<reinhard> :)
<AnDarkon> Okay, next question
<AnDarkon> BPP, page 10, type person defines name_prefix as a char<8> but doesn't use the name_prefix class... oversight?
<reinhard> btw you could make a proposal for the definition of date and time (if you do: please do a realistic one, one that is doable with all databases)
<reinhard> no oversight
<reinhard> name_prefix class should store often used name-prefixes
<reinhard> like
<AnDarkon> I know what you speak of, Oracle doesn't support datetime as well as Informix can; in the worse case scenario, it could be a CHAR field
<reinhard> Mr.
<reinhard> Mrs.
<reinhard> Herr
<reinhard> Frau
<reinhard> but it's only a list where you copy from
<reinhard> and in the person class the filed can contain values that are not in the name_prefix class
<AnDarkon> Ah, so the name similarities is just a coincidence
<reinhard> like
<reinhard> Her Majesty
<reinhard> :)
<reinhard> not a coincidence
<AnDarkon> and where is Federated States of Micronesia? :-)
<reinhard> the field is copied from the other table for comfort
<reinhard> micronesia is in the pacific ocean IIRC
<AnDarkon> ah, okay :-)
<reinhard> :)
<AnDarkon> there's a statement: org::address [] address;
<AnDarkon> can you please tell me what that is? the [] tells me it might be a list of addresses, but I don't want to assume
<reinhard> you're right it's a list of addresses
<AnDarkon> variable list, right?
<reinhard> every person can be assigned more than one address
<reinhard> yes 1:n
<AnDarkon> Okay :-) Glad my wetware is still operating
<reinhard> wetware?
<AnDarkon> <--- points to his brainpan
<reinhard> ah
<AnDarkon> page 30 of BPP, &languagedata;
<AnDarkon> that's it, just like that...
<reinhard> :)
<AnDarkon> one of these `yet to be defined'?
<reinhard> um
<reinhard> sorry i think i don't understand
Action: reinhard has no printed version and therefore doesn't know what page 30 is
<AnDarkon> 7.1.9 Default Data\\ &languagedata; \\ and then there's Chapter 8...
<AnDarkon> nothing more, nothing less so I'm not sure if it really means something or that it's just a mere placeholder
<reinhard> ah oh
<reinhard> i think this is a mistake in the sgml
<reinhard> looks like an include that didn't work
<AnDarkon> Okay :-) then I'll disregard it
<reinhard> we _do_ have a list of all languages w/ their iso code in cvs IIRC
<AnDarkon> That's fine; I just don't want to assume anything
<AnDarkon> Next question :-)
<reinhard> ok
<AnDarkon> for the class currency, the default_decimals is set to whatever the company wants it to be
<AnDarkon> and in the event of a change in management and/or accounting procedures they want to change the decimal position. Have this ever come up in a discussion or two?
<reinhard> no
<reinhard> the default_decimals is specific for the currency
<reinhard> not to the management

<derek> i.e. i was too redneck to add an option to say --with-redneck
<derek> did you see the list mail on unicode 
<derek> and that we should never use str() and related functions?
<derek> and code on how to work around it
<jcater> um
<jcater> I don;t fully agree w/that
<derek> me either
<derek> i just asked if you saw it :)
<jcater> that will KILL performance if you aren't using codecs

<derek> um going to local shop?
<jcater> gibson's
<chillywilly> heh, a donut run
Action: derek called and they will let me phone in an order, but i havent yet
<jcater> do I need to supply that phone number again?
<chillywilly> that's funny
<jcater> really?
Action: derek was going to suprise you with free donuts one day, but felt too weird asking them to pay in advance
<derek> and next time you show up telling you they were on house
<jamest> derek: no way
<jamest> he's miine
<jamest> my bug is nastier

<derek> yeah the 'sit still' module is still in development
<chillywilly> maybe I should try that

<chillywilly> *sigh*
<chillywilly> I'm sorry you don't get our yankee expressions ;)

<jcater> beats being the dumbass
<soulstompp> hi 
<chillywilly> I hope you're not trying to imply anything with that statement or you may find something in your mailbox
<soulstompp> I have a question, I just installed gnuenterprise from CVS
jbailey (~jbailey@HSE-Toronto-ppp319235.sympatico.ca) joined #gnuenterprise.
<soulstompp> and I have everything running now and I want to start toying with the forms portion to see if I can use this for some practice management software I am working on
<jamest> soulstompp: ok
<jamest> what can we do for you?
<soulstompp> is their a main .gfd file that I should run
<soulstompp> that will allow me to access the different packages
<soulstompp> I am just confused on where to go from here
<chillywilly> how can I get the LUG memebers off of perl ;)
<soulstompp> or if someone can point me to docs that I have missed I would appreciate it
<jamest> soulstompp: the packages for our biz apps?
<soulstompp> yeah the accounting for example
<derek> soulstompp: can you wait like 30 minutes till i get the kids in bed and wifey fed?
<derek> i think i can answer a lot for you
<soulstompp> not a problem
<derek> ok will be back in < 30
<soulstompp> thanks I will be here
<derek> ok
<derek> have pizza in oven and kids all ready so have 15 minutes before have to run again for a few :)
<derek> soulstompp: i am going to assume 'practice management' == some sort of doctor/lawyer ERP?
<derek> soulstompp you have a few to discuss?
<soulstompp> yeah we have an interested cardiologist and dentist
<derek> you == your company
<chillywilly> what's that practice management software?
<chillywilly> gnumed?
<chillywilly> that web based thingy
<derek> chillywilly: yes gnumed would be similar to practice management
<soulstompp> I don't know I haven't heard of that
<derek> soulstompp: a few more questions about your needs then i will explain the situation
<chillywilly> there's that and some other one
<derek> a. do the cardiologist/dentist already have something they use (software wise)
<derek> b. do they run gnu/linux
Action: derek likes to get an idea of who is in interested in gnue and how they plan to use it for marketing purposes
<soulstompp> no although they wouldn't have a problem with the server being gnu/linux
<derek> soulstompp: the current situation is something like this.....
<derek> GNUe is several things but its core things are :
<derek> a. a framework for rapid business application development
<derek> b. a prebuilt system using the framework that is highly extensible
<derek> i will say that (a) is split in two ways
<derek> 1. client/server (2 tier) (no application server)
<derek> 2. multi tier (application server)
<derek> the framework for client server is HIGHLY usable and in use in production in some facilities today
<soulstompp> we would be using option 1 as most of these will be small offices with few users
<derek> the multi tier application server is not fully functional, it works but is not production ready
<derek> the biggest issue we face is that we have only build 'custom' solutions
<chillywilly> :(
<derek> so we dont have an 'accounting package' you can download
Action: chillywilly strokes GEAS
<derek> we have a lovely framework with which you could readily build one
<soulstompp> I see
<jamest> the work on a gnue accounting package was written with our app server in mind
<derek> we do have a lot of supply chain and some accounting with specificaitions (read business requirements)
<derek> HOWEVER those specs were built with our application server in mind
<jamest> but not a 2 tier solution
<derek> so they are all object based
<jamest> however the 2-tier tools are pretty fast
<derek> the upside to this is we want gnue success stories 
<derek> and we want them bad
<jamest> at building solutions
<derek> which means im sure you would get more than one of us to help you on practice management software
<derek> IF you were willing to give them back to gnue for others to enjoy
<soulstompp> that sounds great
<derek> i know that isnt as wonderful as being able to download working software today
<derek> but i think you will find gnue builds applications VERY quickly
<soulstompp> this is a new business and all of us are in agreement that GNU is the way to go
<soulstompp> so I would happily contribute everything back to the community
<soulstompp> that is good
<jamest> but spending kwalitee time in #gnuenterprise is pretty wonderfull in it's own way
<derek> and i think that if they have NOTHING at all currently other than paper
<derek> you could give them USEFUL applications by weeks end
<soulstompp> because our only focus will not be just practice managment
<soulstompp> we are looking at other fields as well
<derek> when i say USEFUL, it might not have all bells and whistles but they will be capturing some stuff in a real database
<soulstompp> yeah
<derek> so when more features come on line they can easily start absorbing them
<soulstompp> now how is the reporting end of things
<derek> not the best
<derek> not the worst
<soulstompp> that is an area I would like to help
<derek> i say that because technically its all in a sql database
<derek> so if you bought a version of crystal reports
<soulstompp> I used to do support for Seagate Software Crystal Reports
<derek> or used report lab or etc you could easily get at the data
<derek> our report server i think kicks MAJOR ass
<derek> but its not production ready yet
StormBringer (~eugene@194.84.60.130) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> it generates all XML output for maximum flexibility
<soulstompp> :)
<derek> and it works liek a SERVER
<derek> i.e. i can run in server mode
<derek> so that you can 'cache' reports
<derek> like monthly financials and things
<soulstompp> that is very cool
<derek> it really does some useful things right now
<derek> but its far from production qwality
<derek> btw: one VERY useful thing it does is document merges :)
<derek> which is VERY important for practice management
<soulstompp> yeah
<derek> as they have to write lots of patient and insurance 'letters' or 'form' letters
<derek> we support that pretty cool now
<soulstompp> we have about 4 crystal report guys that can help so the reporting isn't dire right now
<derek> basically you can use ms office, star office, abiword etc to make document
<soulstompp> wow!
<derek> and run it against server to poplulate it
<soulstompp> that is a very nice feature
jan (jan@dial-213-168-88-120.netcologne.de) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<soulstompp> so is their a GUI core?
<soulstompp> meaning the screenshots that are their, such as the login screen
<soulstompp> or do I more or less start the gui portion of the app from scratch?
<jamest> forms is a GUI
<jamest> that ties directly to a datasource
<jamest> what database are you using?
<jamest> as your backend
<soulstompp> postgres
<jamest> you have it there now?
<jamest> running?
<chillywilly> mmmm, postgres
<soulstompp> I have a couple of postgres databases running
<jamest> if so 
<jamest> cool
<jamest> ok now
<jamest> did you install cvs gnue forms/common/designer
<jamest> or did you do a developers install
<soulstompp> I installed the designer
<jamest> a full system install or just the developer install
<jamest> iow did you
<jamest> cd cvs/gnue
<jamest> ./setup.py
<jamest> or did you
<jamest> cd /cvs/gnue/common
<jamest> ./setup.py install
<jamest> cd ../forms
<jamest> ./setup.py install
<jamest> cd ../designer
<jamest> ./setup.py install
<jamest> the first gives you a cvs based install as yourself
<soulstompp> I followed step by step the cvs install guide for RedHat 7.2

Action: jamest needs to look at that guide :)
<jamest> just a sec :)
<soulstompp> k
<jamest> alrighty
<jamest> in /usr/local/gnue/etc/connections.conf
<jamest> put an entry for one of your databases
<jamest> a postgresql example should already be there
<jamest> if that file isn't there then a sample.connections.conf will be in that dir that you can use as a template
<jamest> btw - i'm walking you thru building a ui
<jamest> so you can see how easy it is :)
<soulstompp> I copied the sample one over and have two
<soulstompp> cool
<jamest> so you have your database in there now
<jamest> ?
<jamest> let me know when you do
<soulstompp> should I make the two databases that are listed in the file
<soulstompp> or make my own?
<jamest> make your own
<jamest> those are just samples
<jamest> i think
stbain (GunAndGiz@ip68-10-44-170.rn.hr.cox.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> lemme check something
<stbain> o
<stbain> k
<jamest> most of our sample forms use a gnue database entry
<jamest> the name in brackets in the connections.conf file is the defined name of the connection
<jamest> [gnue] for instance
<jamest> the next 4 lines map that name to a specific database
Action: derek is back, if jamest starts to drown i will help ;) (ha like that will happen)
<jamest> for instance on my system
<soulstompp> okay database gnuetest is created
<jamest> i have a system wide [prod] defined for my users
<jamest> then in my personal conenctions.conf (devel install) i have a [prod] that really points to a devel database
<jamest> so I dont screw up my users
<jamest> ok
<jamest> now type
<jamest> gfdesigner
<derek> soulstompp: preferably point to a database taht has tables already
<jamest> yes
<jamest> please
<derek> so we can show you power of designer right away w/ minimal fuss
<soulstompp> hmmm
<derek> as we will run a wizard that will auto build forms from existing postgres tables
<soulstompp> I don't thik I have acess to any right off
<derek> that is ok
<derek> you can do a blank one
<soulstompp> k
<jamest> in the forms/samples/zipcode
<derek> and we can do a create script to build a sample table
<jamest> there is a pg sql file that will create  a zipcode table in a db
<derek> speaking of that 
<derek> jamest thanks for giving me a state table with flordia in it ;)
<jamest> you're welcome
<soulstompp> k
<soulstompp> done
<jamest> you created the table?
<soulstompp> yeah
<jamest> ok
<jamest> gfdesigner
<jamest> then when it's up
<jamest> File->connect to->the connection you defined that points to the database you created your table in 
<derek> ====
<derek> I recently created a resume in your database.  However, whenever I reached the line to input my home state, if I clicked on what should be "Florida," instead the word "Flordia" pops up.  I do not want it to seem like I cannot spell my own home state properly.  Is there a way for someone to correct this error so that I may update my online resume?  I appreciate your attention to this matter.
<derek>  
<derek> ====
<derek> was a funny 'email' to get :)
<derek> fwiw it made my laugh for the day, since it was a 30 second fix that changed things system wide
<jamest> soulstompp: you ok?
<soulstompp> yeah
<jamest> whoops
<jamest> smack me
<jamest> you don't have to do that :)

<soulstompp> no?
<jcater> mest
<jamest> file -> new -> from wizard

<soulstompp> oh crap I don't have the pypgsql on this one
<jamest> any postgresql driver will work

<derek> i found solution
<chillywilly> yes? :)
<soulstompp> lemme grab the RPM I need
<derek> we could use and ADO driver for common
<derek> m$ says they require a 'first' born
<chillywilly> put glue on the walls?
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> we'll use yours then
<derek> you could trade that bouncing boy for an ADO api ;)(
<chillywilly> you have children to spare
Action: chillywilly only has one
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> we need find someone with a kid so bad that m$ will give them back :)
<derek> soulstompp: how is that rmp'find' going?
<derek> btw you will need probably mxDateTime rpm
<derek> from egenix as well
<derek> it might be mxBase or something (which ever one has mxDateTime)
<chillywilly> ummm
Action: derek slaps guido & company for such poor date/time funcitons
<soulstompp> I am downloading that one now
<soulstompp> mx
<chillywilly> I know of such a kid
<chillywilly> I am 100% that M$ will give back my nephew
<chillywilly> er, 100% sure ;)

<derek> Q. 'you know why the speed limit stops at 68?'
<derek> A. 'cause at 69 you eat it'
<derek> hahahaha
<derek> i still think thats the dumbest joke
<chillywilly> heh
<derek> her other one at that time
<soulstompp> that rpm installed fine but when I make the connection it is saying the driver isn't found
<derek> Q. 'you know the word for 69 in chinese?'
<derek> A. 'twocanchew'
<chillywilly> man
<derek> equally as dumb but tradition at our house i suppose 
<chillywilly> maybe it isn;'t so great to have a mom like that ;)
Action: derek was abused as an adolescent ;)
<jcater> roflmao
<derek> you have more than one version of python i suppose soulstompp
<derek> i assume that driver installed under the 1.5.2 version
<derek> not the 2.x version
<soulstompp> yeah
<soulstompp> I think so because that is what redhat wants to default to
<derek> pygresql is easy to install source
<jamest> soulstompp: we jumped to 2.x
<derek> as its python setup.py install
<derek> i would get tar ball and do
<jamest> thinking distros wouldn't be far behind
<derek> python2.x setup.py install
<jamest> that bites us alot :(
<derek> of pygresql  or what ever
<derek> where .x is your version of python
<soulstompp> yeah that is the way that I did it
<chillywilly> hey debian is cool with that ;)
<soulstompp> oh I mean for the main part
<soulstompp> of installing gnue 
<soulstompp> just not for the driver
<soulstompp> I will go do that
<derek> repeat for driver and you will ok me thinks :)
<derek> jcater you go to gibson's already?
<soulstompp> if I leave the rpm on their so that my 1.5.2 has postgres avaiable
<soulstompp> will that cause problems with the source install?
<derek> not that i know of
<jcater> derek: not yet
<soulstompp> k
<jcater> derek: jamest has me tied to my chair
<derek> you like donut holes right?
<jcater> oh, yeah!
<derek> its one on moriah right?
<jamest> derek: i found a, um, interesting feature in the common dataobject system
<derek> yeah me too
<derek> grids dont work
<derek> i.e. when you do rows
<derek> it fills the rows
<jamest> i couldn't figure out where that feature was implemented
<derek> BUT only gets 3 at a time
<jamest> derek: what db driver?
<derek> um
<derek> pygresql i think
<jamest> set your datasource cache= number up higher
<jamest> and see what happens
<derek> ok
<derek> is 3 default?
<derek> as i dont think i have it set to anything currently
<jamest> um
<jamest> it should be 5
Action: derek is testing
<jamest> my states forms do the right thing
fil_c (username@public1-cosh3-3-cust12.cosh.broadband.ntl.com) left irc: Ping timeout: 14400 seconds
<jamest> provider = pypgsql
<derek> it is 5
<derek> i.e. its looping on 5 records not 3 
Action: derek has bad memory
<jamest> what version of pypgsql?
<jamest> even set to 5
<jamest> it should do the right thin
<jamest> as that is where mine is set
<jamest> and i can see 10 records in rows just fine
<jamest> however
<jamest> i _think_ older pypgsql's did something odd
<jamest> popy IIRC wasn't effected 
<derek> ok that fixed it kind of
<jamest> so you can switch providers to test it
<derek> cache make the loop bigger but still loops
<derek> example
<derek> if i have cache set to 10
<derek> and i have a grid of 10
<jamest> soulstompp: how goes the battle?
<derek> if i navigate the grid to row 10
<derek> and move to row 11
<derek> i see what was in row 1
<derek> i.e. when it caches 10 records it only has those 10 records
<derek> i would EXPECT behavior to cache only 10 at a time
<derek> but if go to 11
<jamest> derek: it does that
<derek> number 1 should fall out of cache
<derek> and 11 brought in
<jamest> perfectly
<jamest> your install is what is screwed up 
<derek> my install?
<jamest> suprize, suprise
<jamest> :)
<jamest> yes
<derek> what is wrong with it?
<derek> i grabbed new cvs last night
<jamest> are you sure you're running a newer pypgsql version?
<derek> and did setup.py install from the root cvs dir
<soulstompp> the driver type for pygresql would be pypgsql right?
<derek> no old pygres version im sure
<derek> ;)
<jamest> soulstompp: yes
<derek> doesnt mean my install is messed up
<derek> means that i have older driver :)
<jamest> yeah, but I mentioned that above
<jamest> issue with older pypgsql
<jamest> which is your install :)
Action: derek is deathly afraid to fix pygresql
<jamest> forms is perfect except for feature here and there :)
<derek> as last time i tried popy and such on this
<derek> machine i was in hell
<jamest> but I keep them to myself so I dont have to adjust them till someone else finds them :)
<derek> read EVERY TIME i try to be productive with forms
<derek> i run into a problem
<derek> and when i go to fix it, it consumes all the time i had for productivity
<derek> so i wont fall in that trap tonight :)
<derek> i.e. i will live with bad caching in order to be productive :)
<derek> as i know i touch that driver i will be fighting it all night
<derek> one of the pains of running redhat 6.2 in a redhat 7.1 world :)
<jamest> :)
<jcater> derek: you're behind the times
<derek> soulstompp: that was not meant to scare you away, gnue is very usable, i just am the user that beats the living hell out of it
<jcater> ot's a redhat 7.2 world now
<derek> jcater: i wont tell you of my alpha machine still running rh5.2 then :)
<derek> which was before redhat put kde on disk and gnome was unusable so it is running fvwm
<jamest> derek is a user from hell
<jamest> he can make a bucket of water crash
<soulstompp> I guess so
<derek> hey its hard work getting things configured in such evil ways
<soulstompp> I still have to support 5.x for a couple hundred users on a web server
<soulstompp> I am not scared of anything
<jamest> i was afraid to meet him in San Fran 
<jan> derek: won't you try debian? You can use windowmanager instead of fvwm...;)
<jamest> figured his mere presence there would trigger the big earthquake
<derek> jan i love debian
<chillywilly> jamest: :)
<derek> only reason rh6.2 exists is im too nervous to kill my laptop
<derek> and have down time
<jcater> derek: send it this way
Action: chillywilly is a debian only kinda guy
<jcater> either jamest or I would love to kill it
<jcater> and give it down time
<chillywilly> haw haw
<jamest> you betcha
<derek> the alpha box is only redhat still cause i cant remember how to dick with the bios (alpha bios' are operating systems) to get debian on it
<derek> i will say using a non intel box is an experience
<derek> and honestly is like going from windows to linux
<jamest> give it to your daughter for 10 minutes and she'll get it running, you're too old to figure it out
<derek> makes you wonder how the hell you lived w/o it
<derek> i.e. thier friggin bios is more advanced that win2000
<jan> if debian alpha  has as much docu as debian powerpc it will be some days of fun.
<soulstompp> I have installed that driver with python 2
<chillywilly> werd
<soulstompp> and it had no problems
<jamest> great!
<soulstompp> but I get the error that their is no database driver for pypgsql
<jamest> you ready for designer?
<jamest> did you reinstall mxdatetime under python2
<soulstompp> I reran the installer and it said that nothing was done because everything was installed fine
<soulstompp> nope that would be the problem
<jamest> one thing we do
<jamest> is try errors on db driver import
<jamest> trap
<jamest> then report it as not installed
<jamest> which is sorta misleading
<soulstompp> okay
<soulstompp> lemme go find that tar ball
<jamest> as the driver can be installed but if it's dependecies are missing then blam
<derek> in gnue/common/scripts$
<derek> there is a file
<derek> gnue-diag.sh
<derek> can you make it executable and run it?
<derek> jamest: we used to do that now we have a diagnostic program :)
<derek> jamest im using pypgsql i guess not pygresql
<derek> soulstompp: for each instance of python you should get a diagnostic
<derek> similar to

<jamest> is your connections.conf good?
<derek> ok got wizard to work
<derek> yeah

<jamest> port is being ignored
<jamest> well
<jamest> actually
<jamest> it's not even in our docs
<derek> damnit jim it worked yesterday :)
<derek> and since when did 'not in our docs' mean it didnt exist :)
<derek> where did the weasel jcater run off too :)
<derek> he was one that showed me this undocumented feature
<derek> course i changed my connections.conf and deleted the one that worked :(
Action: derek goes to grep ash logs
<jcater> geeze
Action: jcater misread that
Action: jcater read that as something re crap on ash's logs
Action: jcater thought ash was upset
<jcater> undocumented feature?
<jcater> I thought port= was documented
<derek> jcater:  you have any ideas on this issue?
<derek> it worked the other day when we played
<derek> i can psql -h localhost -p 9999 -U hcs_www hcs_prod just fine

<jcater> derek: use another driver?
<jamest> it's not in Connections.txt
<derek> sigh but this driver worked last ngiht
<jamest> derek: when was your last cvs update?
<jcater> sigh
<derek> um like 10 minutes ago
<derek> maybe an hour ago
<jamest> before last night?
<jamest> when it worked
<jamest> have you been up to date for a while?
<derek> yeah
<derek> i updated cvs before i got it to work like yesterday or day before
<jamest>  self._connectString = 'host=%s dbname=%s user=%s password=%s'
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> we need to modify connections.txt to say "look in README.databases" to see all supported parameters
<jcater> as each database driver supports different parameters
<jcater> most either support the (host, port) pair or (service) string
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> none of the pgsql drivers support it though
<jamest> and I don't think I've worked on them in ages
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> I swear this was working yesterday
<jcater> how bizarre
<jcater> but you're right... I see nothing in there
<derek> wow now i can make code disappear too ;)
<derek> damn i am good
<jamest> i can't find ref to it in cvs either
<jamest> in the logs
<derek> whats really funny is grepping irc logs
<derek> and i cant find the conversation jcater and i had about it even
<derek> but i know we had taht conversation
<derek> and that we got it to work
<jcater> we did?
<jcater> what conversation?
<jcater>   /msg jamest I think it's working
Action: derek thinks maybe jcater and i were drinking too hard that night or something
<jcater> was that my Merlot and Taco night?
<jcater> as that was some bad sh*t
<jamest> derek
<jamest> you might be able to do
<jamest> host=foo.bar.com:port
<derek> jcater: yeah
<derek> jamest: but port worked before :)
<jamest> dude
<jamest> i've went back over a month
<jamest> it's not in cvs
<derek> jcater: i think he is playing games with us
Action: derek has a cvs snapshot
<derek> from that day
Action: derek goes to look
<soulstompp> hey I am going to have to finish this up tommorow
<jamest> soulstompp: ok
<soulstompp> thank you jamest and derek for all of your help
<jamest> no problem
<jamest> hope to see you tomorrow
<soulstompp> I will get the connection set up tonight
<soulstompp> and be ready for the rest tommorow
<soulstompp> I have a GPL fistfight I gotta finish with the founders :)
<chillywilly> hehe
<soulstompp> I am glad to see that this project has a community that is so helpful
<soulstompp> it is going a long way in my argument

<derek> jamest: localhost:9999 works
<derek> so the question of the night what happened to 
<derek> port = support :)
<derek> damn still have funky unicode save
Action: derek wets himself
<derek> inline label editing
<derek> can it be true
<jcater> dude
<jcater> that's like 2-3 weeks old
<jamest> derek: self._connectString = '%s::%s:%s:%s::' is for
<jamest> host dbname user password
<jamest> there is no port support there
<jamest> is in place editing older that drag and drop layout and selection by box?
<jamest> if so derek may be in for a real treat
<jcater> I think so
<jamest> is there any need to add port=support to postgresql drivers
<jcater> yes
<jcater> definitely
<jamest> or is the current host:port good enought
<derek> jamest: i like idea of port =
Action: derek trying useful remote form now
<derek> rock
<derek> guys this is killer info
<derek> over my wireless broadband
<derek> did query with local form accessing ssh tunneled postgres db
<derek> 8 fields (5456 records)
<derek> took about 40 seconds
<derek> once they are here
<derek> i navigate with NO lag
<jamest> derek: you probably don't have all the records
<derek> oh im creaming myself here
<jamest> it precaches them
<jamest> so only a cluster at a time
<derek> a query on that set (which wouldd be NORMAL usage)
<derek> is transparent speed wise
<jamest> that was the idea
<derek> argh not having damn updated driver hurts though
<derek> um ok tell me about drag and drop datasource fields
<derek> i.e how do you do it
<derek> as i ahve a fomr now that i want to make master detail
<derek> would be great to drag and drop the new fields onto the form
<jamest> um
<jamest> master/detail still requires you to setup the second datasrouce manually IIRC
<derek> mmm schema editor is nice
<jamest> you should be able to drag and drop from there IIRC
<jamest> just grab a field and drop it
<jamest> however it was segfaulting for me other day
<derek> nope
<derek> no segfault
<derek> but no workie either

<derek> this is cvs from less than 2 hours ago
<jamest> this is nuts

<psu> good stuff
Action: psu will probably have to face this all in a couple of years - or maybe not ;-)
<reinhard> psu: look forward to it ;)
<psu> my personal guess is
<psu> that the first referendum will be a narrow "NO" votes
<psu> based on FUD whipped up by media (esp. newspapers)
<psu> but that it won't matter
<psu> as the large multi-nationals will start using euros in UK anyway
<psu> and we will become a de facto dual currency economy
<psu> e.g. all new employees will be paid in euros,
<psu> all new suppliers will be required to bill in euros
<psu> etc etc
<psu> then some n years later, after many job losses,
<psu> a second referendum will eventually vote "YES"
<psu> all IMHO, natch

<derek> http://www.chrisrice.com/edges.htm#Cartoons
<derek> our favorite verse
<derek> Fred and Wilma Flintstone sing "YabbaDabbaLujah!"
<derek> Scooby-Doo and Shaggy, "ScoobyDoobyLujah!"
<derek> And the Jetson?s dog named Astro, "Ruh-Ro-Ru-Rah!"
<derek> but we are big scooby fans here
<chillywilly> scooby rocks
<psu> but only the early ones
<chillywilly> how do you spell convience?
<psu> scrappy-doo was lame
<chillywilly> (i.e., is that right ;P_
<chillywilly> psu: uh, no
Action: psu is some ashamed to have an opinion on this
<derek> psu scrappy was way dumb
<derek> original scoob and shag are the only way
<chillywilly> you even see that one british cross dressing comic dude?
<chillywilly> he's hilarious
<derek> back when they had that other one too
<derek> um....
<chillywilly> he did a whoel scooby thing
<derek> the sandbuggy one
<chillywilly> did this history bit too
<derek> man its gonna drive me mad not remember than sand buggy show
<derek> speed buggy
<derek> now that was a good scooby spin off
<derek> unlike scrappy doo
<chillywilly> speed buggy was coool
<derek> http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/doc/speedbuggy/clip.html
<chillywilly> all the characters looked similar though'
<derek> yeah that was the idea :)
Action: chillywilly wathes cartoon network
<psu> the more time I spend in IRC, the more I find I have in common with you guys - eerie
<chillywilly> er, watches
<psu> we have 2 new cartoon (weell, kids) channels from this a.m.
<psu> c/o the BBC
<derek> tinker == shaggy
<psu> British Broadcasting Corporation
<derek> mark == fred
<derek> debbie == daphne
<derek> speed buggy == scooby
<derek> they just didnt have a thelma :)
<psu> velma
<derek> er velma
<chillywilly> your bad
<derek> debbie was hotter than daphne though
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> she was a cartoon
<derek> best line was had really good buddy with a brother 2 years younger
<derek> that hung out with us
Action: chillywilly commits more junk to cvs ;)
<derek> there was a cartoon called 'beverly hill teens' before school when we were like in 9th grade
<derek> so he was in 6th or 7th grade i think
<derek> and we teased him
<derek> about him thinking bianca (or someone) was hot 
<derek> and he said...
<derek> 'well she is'
<derek> and we gave him that look
<derek> and he added
<derek> 'for a cartoon'
<derek> we gave him crap about that for YEARS
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> jcater is lazy about his .cvsignore files ;)
<chillywilly> that bugs me
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> weee
<psu> derek - have you seen http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/02/08/208246 
<psu> ?
<psu> A theme we both agree with, I suspect
<chillywilly> it's nice to contribute something (even if it is not code quite yet)
<derek> yes i saw and i like
<psu> anyway 
<psu> gotta head off to work
<chillywilly> never
<chillywilly> work is for the birds
<psu> I keep suggesting they should pay me even if I don't show, but they never seem that keen ;-)
<chillywilly> bah, what good are they then?
Action: chillywilly could get away with that as he work off site all the time and really has no boss looking over his shoulder
<derek> rofl
<psu> "I don't work because I have to - just for those little luxuries like bread and shoes"
<derek> if you learn how to pitch the pay for no show let me know

<jamest> morning
<drochaid> hey jamest
<drochaid> I've been swamped trying to get things moving here for the last few days ... has there been a designer build since the 3rd feb?
<drochaid> I *may* actually get some time to pay for a while by the end of this week :)
<jamest> um
<jamest> nope
<drochaid> s/pay/play
<jamest> no new snapshots
<drochaid> ah well, I'll keep hacking 0.1.1 to bits then :)
<jamest> play not pay :( drat, jamest was hoping to double what he makes on gnue...lets see....zero times two....
<jamest> ooo
<jamest> looks like my pay did double !
<drochaid> lmao
<AnDarkon> if you used an Intel CPU in your calculations, zero is not equal to zero times two :-)
<drochaid> hey, let me triple it for you ;)
<jamest> AnDarkon: so i'd be up to .00000000000132 cents an hour!
<jamest> rock!
<AnDarkon> That's more than what I make now!
<AnDarkon> You lucky dog!
<jamest> yip, I'm living high on the hog......gonna get me a package of ramen noodles next month....been saving up for them 
<AnDarkon> if you time it just right, you can get two for the price of one
<AnDarkon> Get some rice if you can, the broth make for great flavoring :-)
<jamest> :)
<AnDarkon> you want a quick and cheap chili soup recipe?
<jamest> mmmm chili
<AnDarkon> One pound ground beef (ground pork, chicken or turkey is fine)
<AnDarkon> large jar of salsa
<AnDarkon> Large can of tomato juice
<AnDarkon> two cans of kidney beans
<AnDarkon> brown the meat and drain
<AnDarkon> and throw the rest together and bring up to heat. Spice to taste

jbailey (~jbailey@HSE-Toronto-ppp319235.sympatico.ca) joined #gnuenterprise.
<AnDarkon> Hi Bailey
<jbailey> Hello.
<jamest> well
<jamest> i'd used tcl in the past and wasn't happy with it
<jamest> lots of people on the list either already liked python or didn't object to it
Action: jamest doesn't recal the specifics of it
<jamest> there was  a lot of debate IIRC
<AnDarkon> I bet :-)
<AnDarkon> I was deliberating between Python and Java. I had already concluded that perl, while being very veristale (sp), would get too spaghettiy in large projects
<AnDarkon> what cinched is was Jython heh; the fact that I could run Python code on top of java machines cinched Python as the winner
<Isomer> heh
Action: jamest dislikes java with a passion
<Isomer> jamest: out of curiousity why?
<jamest> well
Action: Isomer suspects that this could be a long answer
<jamest> i have to support java apps here
<jamest> a major problem with java is the inconsistancies in the java VM
<jamest> so I have users that are forces to run specific versions of browsers to run some university apps
<AnDarkon> just like with C compilers
<Isomer> Ok, Cool, Fair enough :)
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> 3:15am
<Isomer> bed time
<AnDarkon> In the early days, I couldn't link borland libraries with Microsoft code
<AnDarkon> and vice versa
<Isomer> since I have to be coherent in <6hours
<AnDarkon> sleeping makes you coherent? ;-)
<jamest> it basically ends up a huge game of mix and match
<jamest> so one machine in the office has to have netscape 4.07 or something
<jamest> as that's the only one that runs all the apps the user requires
<AnDarkon> it makes me feel better for having decided on Python :-)
<AnDarkon> At least Python's credo guarantees that a number is stored the same way
<jamest> in fact speaking with some of the developers of these apps here on campus
<jamest> they gave up on java on the client
<jamest> and were redoing the systems to run java on the web server
<AnDarkon> jsp, right?
<jamest> which makes the whole cross platform benefit of java kinda moot
<jamest> jsp yes
<jamest> however i gave up on java back when swing was not part of java itself
<jamest> which shows my experience isn't that recent :)
<jamest> however the support side of things is still a pain for me :(
<jamest> oooo
<jamest> one last stab at java
<jamest> i can't resist
<jamest> I used to be able to get GCC to run on far more platforms that a JVM
<jamest> which I always found somewhat amusing :)
<jamest> not sure if that's still the case
Action: jamest has a history in this channel of being a java hater :)
<AnDarkon> I haven't encountered a system yet that didn't have gcc (other than SCO Unix)
<dsmith> AnDarkon: gcc is the portability layer
<dsmith> Too bad C doesn't have fixed sized type, like Java.
<dsmith> Doesn't the newer C standards have that?  in32 is guaranteed to be 32 bits or something?
<AnDarkon> C does, it's not just stored in the same exact method
<AnDarkon> big eidan, little eidan
Action: dsmith has been a C programmer for about 16 years
<jbailey> dsmith: uint_32_t I think.
<dsmith> jbailey: Yeah, that's it.
<dsmith> The one thing I liked about Java.
<jbailey> THere's a whole collection of types like that.  I would love to see them officially deprecate the old "int".
<reinhard> AnDarkon: IIRC there _is_ gcc on SCO Unix
<AnDarkon> reinhard: Not back when I was working on SCO Unix :-) I'm not saying that gcc wouldn't run, just that it was the only system that I worked on which didn't have gcc on it at the time
<reinhard> i'm not 100% sure though
<reinhard> it's a long time for me, too :)
<AnDarkon> :-) even though I've 17 years under my belt with C/C++, I'd rather program in Python. I like instant gratification heh
<jbailey> Working on SCO Unix is like poking myself in the eye with a stick.
<AnDarkon> and working with Xenix would be like poking yourself in the eye with a branding iron, right? :-)
<AnDarkon> on a 286, even
<jbailey> Yeah, but noone uses Xenix really.  I keep running into SCO sites that people want fixed.
<jbailey> And they never seem to understand that the only way to truly fix sco is with mke2fs.
<AnDarkon> jbailey: heh, unfortunately it's not an acceptable choices at some places, especially these who bought an excellent accounting package in the '80s.
<jbailey> Yeah =(
<AnDarkon> Just recently, I helped someone add `linux' to the terminfo database. What an experience
<reinhard> AnDarkon: oh at least terminfo
<jbailey> It's less painful than getting ncurses to compile with the native compiler. =)
<AnDarkon> The accounting package isn't the problem; it's that today's packages don't pass muster so they stay with it
<reinhard> termcap is more fun :)
<reinhard> you will laugh
<AnDarkon> jbailey: I gave up trying and hacked some wrappers for the native curses heh
<reinhard> but i support exactly that type of accounting pckage from the 80's that runs under SCO
<AnDarkon> reinhard: You do? Do you remember Wordperfect for Unix? I loved that package :-)
<reinhard> we had lyrix
<reinhard> it was an sco only thing iirc
pattieja (~pattieja@www.pcxperience.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jbailey> AnDarkon: Do you have any idea why `ld' doesn't build for SCO?  I thought they switched to ELF now...
<AnDarkon> jbailey: what kind of errors did you get?
<jbailey> binutils just doesn't generate the configs in that directory.  They've always prefered the native SCO linker, I think for the multilibs supports.
<AnDarkon> you can sometimes get a link error whenever the non-ELF (I forget the name of the format now) objects are linked along with ELF objects
<reinhard> COFF
<AnDarkon> Right, thanks :-)
<AnDarkon> it's been way too long
dres (~dres@4.18.171.42) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jbailey> Excellent.  I see that they've disabled the linker in binutils because it doesn't understand weak symbols in COFF.  Should be safe to enable for me, then.
<jbailey> IIRC, gcc-3 dropped support for COFF on sco.
<AnDarkon> I didn't know gcc supported COFF :-)

<jamest> um
<jamest> the _pg import was old pygresql syntax IIRC
<soulstompp> isit?
<jamest> that was the non-standard interface to postgresql
<jamest> pygresql's DB API 2.0 compliant one is import pgdb

<AnDarkon> what is it about Andrew M? And why is he such a holy terror?
Action: psu doesn't know - I am post-AndrewM
<AnDarkon> Me, too
<psu> Andrew Murie did the original code for GEAS
<psu> which reinhard & neilt are now re-hacking
<AnDarkon> am I to infer that the original GEAS is somewhat a hairball?
<AnDarkon> s/is/was/
<psu> I think it would be fairer to say
<psu> that it was written by/for a company for its own purposes
<psu> and then contibuted back to the community
<psu> and thus did what they wanted rather better
<psu> than what the project wanted/needed
<AnDarkon> a la Netscape?
<psu> plus everyone's ideas about what an App Server should be has evoleved somewhat
<psu> yes, excpet it was always intended to be GPL/FSF copyright from start
<AnDarkon> Ok
<psu> AndrewM may be gone
<psu> but his home directory lives on...
<psu> http://goats.gnue.org/~andrewm/
<reinhard> just to talk about good old days
<reinhard> the main point about andrew m. is
<reinhard> the coder of geas was named andrew murie
<reinhard> his boss (who also was here very often was also named andrew
<dneighbo> at one time there were 3 andrews on this project all from new zealand within like 150km of one another
<reinhard> plus the name another employee of this company (who also wrote little parts of the geas code) was also andrew
<dneighbo> two of which were andrewm
<reinhard> then ajmitch is andrew m(itchel)
<dneighbo> andrewm (all of them) were good guys
<reinhard> so AnDarkon is andrew m. number 3
<dneighbo> :)
<reinhard> and andrew number 6 or like that :)
<psu> ok this is going to look silly 
<psu> but I keep missing Isomer
<dneighbo> btw: the joke for a while was

<dneighbo> -----
<dneighbo> andrew m.
<dneighbo> andru
<dneighbo> andre
<dneighbo> and then
<dneighbo> ajmitch (andrew m)
<dneighbo> so the joke was 
<dneighbo> to live in new zealand must you have andr in your name?
Action: dneighbo thinks AnDarkon is just a kiwi in disguise ;)
<reinhard> some days we entered irc and said something
<psu> Isomer & me keep missing each other - him @ work, me @ sleep & vice versa
<reinhard> like
<reinhard> "hi andr*"
<reinhard> :)
<dneighbo> isomer is really remosi
<dneighbo> so if you have data on remosi they are one in the same
<psu> I would /query him, but I'm not 100% sure I know what I'm talking about
<psu> shall I just cyt & paste main channel & let you all have a good laugh?
<psu> & correct if necess?
<dneighbo> he is a kiwi
<dneighbo> sure
<psu> Hi Isomer
<psu> Did anyone ever answer your query from yesterday
<psu> about widgets?
<psu> I'm no expert
<psu> but based on what I've read here
<psu> I think you could use some of the GNUe Tools
<psu> If all you want is a series of "hooks" 
<psu> to enable your C/C++ code to talk to a database
<psu> then you could use GNUe Common 
<psu> This already has abstraction for databases
<psu> and will have abstraction for RPC
<psu> when jcater has the time
<psu> so you can talk CORBA, SOAP, XML-RPC to your d/b
<psu> If by "widget"
<psu> you actually mean having data-aware controls
<psu> then GNUe Forms should do what you want
<psu> Main issue is that the current version of GNUe Forms
<psu> is written in python 
<psu> so assumes all triggers for data controls are in python too
<psu> However
<psu> there has already been some discussion about writing triggers in C
<psu> basically, just use a python wrapper to call the C code
<psu> even our python fanatics have admitted
<psu> they might have to use C at times 
<psu> for speed & efficiency
<psu> Longer term I believe the plan is to write an alternative version 
<psu> of GNUe Forms native in C
<psu> s/to write/to find a C fanatic who can be persuaded to volunteer to write
<psu> Anyway 
<psu> any duff info i have given you can be corrected  
<psu> by someone who actually knows what they are talking about ;-)
<psu> ok
<psu> end flood...

Action: dneighbo has other thing running
<dneighbo> reading now
<dneighbo> im not sure i agree
<dneighbo> i dont know what he is wanting to do
<dneighbo> if he wants database abstraction for C code he might be better off right now today to look at libGDA
<psu> ok
<dneighbo> as writing bindings for our gnue-common is probably more trouble than he is looking for
<dneighbo> if he is looking to use application server
<dneighbo> then yes via corba today he could use our app server with his front end
<dneighbo> and write methods in python or C
<jan> hi psu.
<dneighbo> if he is looking to us gfd, he could write a forms engine in C though i wouldnt recommend it at this stage of the game
<dneighbo> so some of it depends on his 'needs' in order to answer properly

<dneighbo> arent prop software vendors great?
<dneighbo> you have a product that works but needs some 'fixes'

<chillywilly> lol
<jcater> "no, I didn't say sausage! I said "dots".  Clean yourn ears out, you little whipper snapper!"
Action: ajmitch_ thinks this channel is just weird
<chillywilly> hey ajmitch_
<chillywilly> did you get your patch in?
<dneighbo> jcater you ever tried Howard's donuts there in memphis?
<jcater> ajmitch_: that's why you love us :)
<chillywilly> or did jcater say no, you're patch is not good enough!
<jcater> dneighbo: um... a VERY close second place
<ajmitch_> jcater: hehe sure
<ajmitch_> chillywilly: i dunno
Action: drochaid is still adicted to the chan ... just can't follow it :)
<jcater> ajmitch_: I didn't know you did the MySQL patch!!
<ajmitch_> jcater: what code was committed?
Action: chillywilly thinks it is funny jcater and ajmitch_ hacked the same thing
<chillywilly> ajmitch_: you still hanging out at your parent's?
<jcater> I committed mine before I got the email re yours
Action: ajmitch_ is typing from a win95 box right now
<jcater> or I wouldn't committed yours
<jcater> but we both did basically the same thing
<ajmitch_> chillywilly: had to download mozilla, couldn't put up with IE5

<ajmitch_> bbl
Action: chillywilly found a nifty server that supports ODMG
<chillywilly> http://4suite.org
<chillywilly> hey python mastas
<chillywilly> is there any standard lexer and/or parser generator for python?
<chillywilly> or would it be more to one's advatage to swig an interface the flex and bison code?
<chillywilly> advantage
<jcater> chillywilly: not sure
<chillywilly> s/the/to the/
<chillywilly> well if one was ambitious I am sure they would hack flex and python to produce python code, but I am not that ambitious
<chillywilly> er, bison not [ython
<chillywilly> python
<chillywilly> this is interesting

<dsmith> chillywilly: Working with commercial version of sendmail
<dneighbo> soulstompp i will be back soon, sorry tied up right now :(
<dneighbo> should take your postgres login
<dneighbo> if it doesnt try this
<dneighbo> psql -h hostname -U username dbname
<dneighbo> where hostname is machine/ip address postgres is on
<dneighbo> and user name is username you are entering in login screen
<dneighbo> and dbname is where zipcodes are
<dneighbo> i.e. which database
<dneighbo> i assume postgres is not listening in tcp/ip mode
<dneighbo> OR
<dneighbo> that you have security set in such a way its not liking forms trying ot authenticate against it

Action: jamest is sorry he asked
<jamest> :)
<jamest> jcater ran away?
<dneighbo> yeah muttered
<dneighbo> <jcater> that bastard grinds me on datasources and wont even buy me a meager donut
<dneighbo> <jcater> smack jamest when he comes in
<dneighbo> were his last lines
<jamest> hmmmmm
<jamest> man, he's sure changed his toon
<jamest> tune
<jamest> last i knew he was muttering about some delphi luving fsf commie from AZ
<jamest> anyone know who he was talking about?
Action: dneighbo looks around
<jamest> oooo,
<dneighbo> no idea
<jamest> i think he said the dude used db2
dsmith (dsmith@cherry7.comerica.com) left irc: "later.."
<dneighbo> soulstompp can you paste your connections.conf file for the datbase you are trying to attach to?
<soulstompp> [gnuetest]
<soulstompp> comment = this is my test
<soulstompp> provider = pypgsql
<soulstompp> host = localhost
<soulstompp> dbname = gnue
<dneighbo> on the machine you are using forms on do
<jamest> you have a postgresql database named gnue?
<dneighbo> psql -h localhost -U validusername gnue
<dneighbo> and tell me what you get
<jamest> and do you have your postgresql listening on tcp/ip?
<soulstompp> yeah got it doing that yesterday
<soulstompp> I think I put the wrong database name in
<dneighbo> what is output from 
<soulstompp> the config
<dneighbo> psql -h localhost -U validusername gnue
<soulstompp> no database
<soulstompp> it's gnuetest
<dneighbo> then thats the problem (or at least one of them)
<dneighbo> what the hell
<dneighbo>  a little fishy just swam across my machine
<dneighbo> i have seen that before (once or twice)
<dneighbo> anyone have a clue what it is?
<jamest> chillywilly's trout
<dneighbo> um looked like it
<jamest> it went missing last night
<jamest> he's worried sick
<dneighbo> but seriously anyone know what it was?
<jamest> what os?
<dneighbo> soulstompp change dbname = gnue to dbname = gnuetest
<dneighbo> then try
<dneighbo> psql -h localhost -U username gnuetest
<dneighbo> if that works
<dneighbo> retry your form
<dneighbo> let me know how it goes
<soulstompp> and it's good
<dneighbo> debian sid
<dneighbo> have seen it on red hat too
<dneighbo> it just slowly swims across 1 time and doesnt come back
<dneighbo> i have only seen it maybe 3 times in 3 years
Action: dneighbo wonders if its some timed joke
<dneighbo> or if i have been hacked
<dneighbo> though this machine should be pretty hard to get to from outside world
<jamest> it's a gnome easter egg
<dneighbo> ah what triggers it?
<jamest> There's an Easter Egg in Gnome, which gives you a 1 in 4000 chance of fatting fish swimming across your screen.
<dneighbo> what is the 4000 chance?
<jamest> groups.google.com
<dneighbo> funny
<jamest> one post claimed it has to do with the panel
<dneighbo> i tell you if something can happen to my systems chances are it will :)
<jamest> each time you use it, it increments a counter
<dneighbo> most people probably never seen damn thing and i have seen it on virtually every linux system i have :)
<dneighbo> at least im not crazy :)
<dneighbo> er will completely crazy
<jamest> was jcater comming back?
<dneighbo> yeah i think
<dneighbo> bbl
<jamest> soulstompp: so where are you at wrt the database?
<soulstompp> I got connected and I am playing with the wizard
<jamest> cool
<jamest> is it working out ok for you?
<soulstompp> seems to be 
<jamest> any feedback?
<soulstompp> I went through the wizard and got the form set up
<soulstompp> and I added a button
<soulstompp> do I need a button to make these changes?
<soulstompp> or is just filling out the fields sufficient
<soulstompp> and then doing a commit?
<jamest> ?
<jamest> you don't need buttons on a form for anything
<jamest> you get queries and commits for free 
<jamest> via the menu, toolbar, or keyboard shortcuts
<soulstompp> very cool
<soulstompp> I am getting a segmentation fault everytime that I try to delete this button off of my form
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> you can't do that from designer right now
<soulstompp> oh okay
<jamest> the right click delete is our quick exit feature
<soulstompp> :)
<soulstompp> deleted it from the XML doc
<soulstompp> no biggie
<jamest> at this point in time
<jamest> i find myself doing 1/2 in designer 1/2 in vi|emacs
<soulstompp> I needed an exit shortcut anyway
<jamest> a month ago I was doing 1/4 designer
<jamest> so were getting there :)
<dneighbo> hmmm you all suck
<dneighbo> im 3/4 1/4
<jamest> dneighbo: we're power users
<dneighbo> the trick is dont make mistakes
<dneighbo> though im a little disadvantage as i save in unicode :)
<jamest> got to make it do the things designer can't do :)
<jamest> j/k
<dneighbo> so every tiem i play with a form i have to use emacs to 'fix' it
<soulstompp> ls

<dneighbo> jamest: you got cardwell web cam back up i see
<jamest> :)
<soulstompp> :)
<dneighbo> who did the :q earlier
<dneighbo> i have a new one
<dneighbo> :q
<dneighbo> 20 demerits for the vi user.
<jamest> hey now!
<soulstompp> I did the earlier :q
<jamest> something odd about myself
<jamest> i randomly type vi or emacs to edit
<jamest> no pattern to it
<dneighbo> um its explainable
<dneighbo> jamest i assume you are trying to type 'edit'
<dneighbo> and like most complex words you just guess
<dneighbo> sometimes you guess vi sometimes emacs
<jamest> that's it!
<soulstompp> one more question on this
<jamest> thanks dneighbo ewe R sew smarte
<dneighbo> just dont try that flordia editor :)
<jamest> soulstompp: shoot
Action: dneighbo was gonna tell that customer, oh you are right let me fix that
<dneighbo> floorda
<jamest> roflamo
<soulstompp> when I am designing my database for use with this form wizard
<soulstompp> will I be better off if I do the database in an OODB or relational design
<soulstompp> or does it really matter
<dneighbo>  /msg jamest soulstompp is gulliable enough to try to really use it... hahahahaha
<dneighbo> um use what works for you
<soulstompp> lol
<dneighbo> relational will be easier for two tier
<jamest> i do relational
<soulstompp> alright
<jamest> the form can do master/detail
<dneighbo> when we get geas (appserver) up to speed
<jamest> but designer can't auto set it up
<dneighbo> we will probably make a 'conversion' tool
<jamest> what I do
<jamest> is make forms for each table
<dneighbo> so you write your objects in geas
<jamest> put the blocks together
<dneighbo> and map your relational tables to them
<jamest> and hand modify the datasource entries
<dneighbo> or somethng similar
Action: dneighbo must run
<dneighbo> tata
<dneighbo> :q
<dneighbo> er

<chillywilly> 2-tier sucks!
<chillywilly> ;P
<soulstompp> sounds good thanks
<soulstompp> I am gonna go grab something to eat and play with this for a while
<soulstompp> thanks for all of the help 
<jamest> no problem
<jamest> we're dying for feedback
Action: chillywilly watches jay and silent bob strikes back
<soulstompp> alright I will give you some feedback tommorow hopefully it will be useful
<jamest> cool

<derek> for a site i do work for, they are a recruitment firm
<derek> they have online candidate/employer databases
<derek> one thing i hate is doing mainentance as i either would need to write web stuff to do it
<derek> which is silly to me as web sucks for such things imho
<derek> so i used to ssh into the server and use psql and raw SQL statements
<chillywilly> web rocks
<chillywilly> j/k
<dtm> the web does not suck!  dont say that the web sucks!!
<derek> which was nice in that it kept my sql up to date :)
<dtm> chilly and I _like_ the web!!
<chillywilly> derek: you are just web prejudiced
<derek> but now in about 30 minutes i wrote two nice forms to do the management

<derek> i also hope to give them some READONLY forms for 'searching'
<derek> currently i have some pretty kick arse web search forms
<derek> but i dont like them cause they are web based :)
<derek> i hope to get mail merge wizards for them and other things

<derek> 'nah, i dont feel like it lets do something else'
<derek> they could tell i was listening as i giggled, now they shut the door :)
Action: derek wonders if maybe its the honeymoon

<jamest> not a clue
<derek> or my beta python version?
<jamest> well
<derek> as i really dont want to spend all night upgrading python
<derek> if that isnt the issue
<jamest> people have said that it works with pyth 2.2

<derek> ups me a tower to put my amd in and i will do that
<derek> until then i odnt have debian here
<chillywilly> you have an amd board?
Action: chillywilly is a bit poort ya know
<derek> to save me some time jamest can you tell me which .py file in designer does the save?
<derek> so i can start 'debugging' the problem
<jamest> um
<jamest> i haven't looked 
<jamest> but
<derek> or tell me what to grep for
<jamest> GObj should do the save
<derek> i.e. class or routine
<jamest> dumpXML 
<derek> ok will start there
<jamest> is part of the core GObj
<jamest> and a few classes override that
<jamest> but for the most part that is it

<jamest> derek: that is completely outside our control
<chillywilly> hmmm
<jamest> it's being generated from the wx import
<chillywilly> and ACLs
<derek> yeah i know
<derek> just letting you know its happening
<jamest> ok
<derek> what seems to happen is if gfdes crashes
<derek> the next time i start it, i get that
<derek> then if i run again its fine
<derek> so its like the crash corrupts memory or something
<derek> but if i look in top etc no evidence of its tehre
<derek> anyhow
<derek> odd
<derek> if i save a blank form it saves fine

<chillywilly> er, Seeks
<derek> hmmm add some widgets and it saves fine
<derek> you want a pet peeve bug, good glad you asked
<derek> we dont 'hourglass' properly
<jamest> did someone say we wanted bugs?
<derek> i.e. when designer is 'thinking' the hourglass doesnt exist when hovering over the application
<derek> argh and after running the wizard
<derek> designer never seems to shut down right
<chillywilly> jamest: you hear something?
<jamest> the wind? 
<chillywilly> jamest: I thought I may have heard someone whining
<derek> ok, here is the deal
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> if i save blank form it works
<derek> if i save hand created form it works
<jamest> hmmmm, now that you mention it.....i thouhgt it was two weasels mating outdoors
<derek> if i save a form after i run the wizard it does unicode
<derek> rofl
Action: derek thinks of the budlight commericals, but those are ferrets
<jamest> so the wizard is messing it up
<chillywilly> jamest: it was more like a whale call
<jamest> that's odd
<jamest> derek: give me a sec and I'll try it
<derek> jamest: i dont know if wizard is messing it up persay
<derek> but i can say after using the wizard it does it but not before
<derek> but im doing more complex form with the wizard
<derek> so it could be something eles
<derek> er else
<derek> but whats odd is if i shut down designer then try to open a form that i replace the ^@ with it still happens
<derek> which makes me think its something that wizard creates but not the wizard itself
<jamest> can you do me a favor?
<jamest> try and run the forms/sample/button/forms/form.gfd?
<jamest> i'll try designer wizard while you do that :)
<jamest> ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<jcater> yeah, I'd imagine
<jcater> I'll be back shortly

Action: derek thinks this, hmmm sounds like you need new xxxxxx, btw i have to leave, sounds fishy ;)
<derek> hmmm well upgrade to pyxml 7.0 didnt fix things
<jamest> can someone update and test designer against pre pg 7.2 database
<jamest> make usre the wizard still workds
<jamest> designer works w/o issue here derek
<jamest> no problems at all
<derek> doesnt suprise me
<derek> probably python2.2a

<derek> i just want to get this machine on debian soon
<chillywilly> do it
<derek> and dont really want to recompile python and friends on it 
<jcater> do you still have the source directory where you installed?
<chillywilly> go for it
<jcater> i.e., do you have the Makefile?
<derek> where installed what?
<derek> python?
<jcater> you installed from source, right?
<jcater> yes
<derek> nope i deleted that dir
<derek> jcater what is bothering me about this problem
<derek> if i opne desinger and do NOTHING and save the form (ie blank form)
<derek> it saves fine
<derek> even if i drop some stuff on the form it saves fine
<derek> but if open and existing form and do save as
<derek> poof
<derek> hmm a normal save kills too
<derek> damn thought i was on to a pattern
<derek> ok its on second save
<derek> most odd
<derek> if i open designer
<derek> drop some widgets on it and do a 'save'
<derek> it saves just fine
<derek> if i open that file back up in designer
<derek> do NOTHING
<derek> cept file->save
<derek> it saves it with the ^@
<derek> this ranting on whats happening helping any?
<derek> or should i just give in and say its my system and move along
<jcater> does anyone else use python2.2?
<jamest> not i
<jcater> as I'm not kidding... a lot changed in 2.2
<jamest> IIRC unicode support was big in 2.2
<derek> since you all are on debian can you try 2.2 easily?
<jamest> it would break all my dependencies
<jamest> and I'm on a deathline with some forms stuff
<jcater> content may be a Unicode string or a byte string; the expat reader module produces always Unicode strings. 
<derek> um fuck me
<derek> i was right
<derek> stringio i think is the problem
<derek> * In Python 2.1, the StringIO module (though not cStringIO) supported Unicode. This capability is accidentally not present in Python 2.2.
<jcater> umrofl
<jcater>  accidentally not present in Python 2.2.
<jcater> sigh
<derek> fsck fsck fsck
<derek> explains why SECOND time it happens
<derek> is stringio is used to READ the xml file
<derek> iirc
<derek> so my first guess hours ago was probably the right one 
<derek> btw: that accidently is funny seeing how its from OFFICIAL python page
<jamest> so basically 
<derek> jcater: woudl this be symptom of not having unicode stringio?
<jamest> youre' screwed
<jcater> crap
<jcater> that's on the known bugs page
<derek> jamest: thats ok i have lots o vaseline
<jcater> I was looking at the 2.2a4 known bugs page
<jamest> good
<jamest> lube up 
<jcater> bot the 2.2-final known-bugs :(
<jamest> as you're going to have to reinstall python :)
<chillywilly> have you figured it out fellas?
<derek> well not really
<jamest> unless they provide a workarround
<derek> i can use 'emacs' to fix things
<derek> for now
<derek> but this is big
<chillywilly> unicode not present in python 2.2a?
<jcater> hang on
<derek> as we need to not tell people to use 2.2
<jcater> I'll patch
<derek> or we need to fix our code to not use stringio
<derek> jcater: and you thought i was TEASING when i said i work hard to provide a system that finds bugs :)
<jcater> where are you seeing StringIO being used?

<chillywilly> just stay away from me mr. crabby I've had enough of you kind for today thank you
Action: chillywilly notes crazymike was a crabby little pain today
<chillywilly> :P
<derek> so can we 'fix' it
<derek> or do we need to say we dont work well with 2.2 until they fix bug
<chillywilly> dudes
<chillywilly> this is rediculous
<chillywilly> http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99991905
<jcater> derek: can you update cvs and see if this is still happening
Action: jcater isn't so sure now that this patch will work
<derek> brimming with confidence eh
<derek> seems to still have the issue
<derek> wiping directory
<derek> and doing new co and setup.py first
<jcater> ok
<jcater> if the same issue
<jcater> then we are 2.2 incompatable
<jcater> for the indeterminable future
<derek> thats probably not too horrid as im the only one insane enough to run 2.2 :)
<chillywilly> ;P
<jcater> I hope they come out w/2.2.1 before major distro's bump up to 2.2.x support
<chillywilly> not even debian ustable has 2.2!
<chillywilly> er, unstable
<jcater> derek: you are in violation of our support contract until you downgrade to 2.1.2
<jcater> :)
<derek> strike three
<derek> no dice
<jcater> ?
<derek> saving a form
<derek> then reopening and saving
<derek> still gets ^@

<jamest> what's the problem?
<moi_je> I have downloaded the version 0.7-2 as RPM and when i try to install it it keeps saying  PyXML = 0.6.5 is needed by 4Suite-0.11-2. But i already have 4Suite installed on my machine
<jamest> oooo
<jamest> i really can't help with that
<jamest> i'm a debian user
<jamest> and don't know much about dependency issues in RH
<jamest> i was thinking source installs
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> we do have some RH7.2 users around here
<jamest> but none seem to be available right now
<jamest> :(
