<psu> hi all
<chillywilly> howdy
<psu> hi Isomer - you awake?
<psu> late night for cw  ;-)
<chillywilly> I don't think he is
<chillywilly> sorta
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> I should go to bed
<chillywilly> but want to finish something and check it in
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> so sue me :P
<StormBringer> is there an orbit-python hacker alive?  ;)
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> he died
<chillywilly> ;P
<StormBringer> chillywilly: sad ;)   and who was he?
<chillywilly> andrewm
<chillywilly> j/k
<StormBringer> j/k ?
<chillywilly> other ppl loke neilt have hacked up orbit-python examples
<chillywilly> like
Action: chillywilly has not

<psu> cw - we have enough andrewm's around here
<chillywilly> and maybe that wacky req dude
<chillywilly> er, reinhard
<psu> they can't all have joined "the choir invisible"
<StormBringer> reinhard: hello
<chillywilly> reinhard: sup g
<StormBringer> reinhard: are you the orbit-python supa hacker?
<chillywilly> psu: ah yes but we've only has one true 'andrewm'
<chillywilly> s/has/had
<chillywilly> he was the bane of my existence
<chillywilly> ;)
<StormBringer> chillywilly: what happened with him?
<psu> heh
<chillywilly> he went away
<StormBringer> chillywilly: smoke?
<chillywilly> (probably to the nut house_
<psu> reminds me of the soccer fans chant
<psu> "There's only one AndrewM"

<psu> hi reinhard
<psu> how's euro going?
<psu> or is it too painful to talk about? 
<psu> ;/
<reinhard> hi all
<chillywilly> dude
<chillywilly> what's shakin'?
<reinhard> my head ;)
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> why?
<reinhard> psu: euro is going very well
<psu> good stuff
Action: psu will probably have to face this all in a couple of years - or maybe not ;-)
<reinhard> psu: look forward to it ;)
<psu> my personal guess is
<psu> that the first referendum will be a narrow "NO" votes
<psu> based on FUD whipped up by media (esp. newspapers)
<psu> but that it won't matter
<psu> as the large multi-nationals will start using euros in UK anyway
<psu> and we will become a de facto dual currency economy
<psu> e.g. all new employees will be paid in euros,
<psu> all new suppliers will be required to bill in euros
<psu> etc etc
<psu> then some n years later, after many job losses,
<psu> a second referendum will eventually vote "YES"
<psu> all IMHO, natch
<reinhard> psu: interesting theory :)
<reinhard> but not too far from realistic

<chillywilly> cool
<derek> s/of/the
<psu> KC encourages you to "add value" by putting working hyperlinks in

Action: psu wonders if he dares to link to http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/ for derek's mention of "mcdonalds" on Fri ;-)
<derek> huh?
Action: derek look sup url
<chillywilly> why would mickey dees be in the KC?
<psu> a sort of anti-MS 6.0 smart link
<psu> cw - mentioned in passing in t&a discussions

<derek> but we are big scooby fans here
<chillywilly> scooby rocks
<psu> but only the early ones
<chillywilly> how do you spell convience?
<psu> scrappy-doo was lame
<chillywilly> (i.e., is that right ;P_
<chillywilly> psu: uh, no
Action: psu is some ashamed to have an opinion on this
<derek> psu scrappy was way dumb
<derek> original scoob and shag are the only way
<chillywilly> you even see that one british cross dressing comic dude?
<chillywilly> he's hilarious
<derek> back when they had that other one too
<derek> um....
<chillywilly> he did a whoel scooby thing
<derek> the sandbuggy one
<chillywilly> did this history bit too
<derek> man its gonna drive me mad not remember than sand buggy show

<chillywilly> speed buggy was coool

<chillywilly> all the characters looked similar though'
<derek> yeah that was the idea :)
Action: chillywilly wathes cartoon network
<psu> the more time I spend in IRC, the more I find I have in common with you guys - eerie
<chillywilly> er, watches

<chillywilly> your bad
<derek> debbie was hotter than daphne though
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> she was a cartoon
<derek> best line was had really good buddy with a brother 2 years younger
<derek> that hung out with us
Action: chillywilly commits more junk to cvs ;)
<derek> there was a cartoon called 'beverly hill teens' before school when we were like in 9th grade
<derek> so he was in 6th or 7th grade i think
<derek> and we teased him
<derek> about him thinking bianca (or someone) was hot 
<derek> and he said...
<derek> 'well she is'
<derek> and we gave him that look
<derek> and he added
<derek> 'for a cartoon'
<derek> we gave him crap about that for YEARS
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> jcater is lazy about his .cvsignore files ;)
<chillywilly> that bugs me

<chillywilly> it's nice to contribute something (even if it is not code quite yet)
<derek> yes i saw and i like
<psu> anyway 
<psu> gotta head off to work
<chillywilly> never
<chillywilly> work is for the birds
<psu> I keep suggesting they should pay me even if I don't show, but they never seem that keen ;-)
<chillywilly> bah, what good are they then?

<jamest> morning
<drochaid> hey jamest
<drochaid> I've been swamped trying to get things moving here for the last few days ... has there been a designer build since the 3rd feb?
<drochaid> I *may* actually get some time to pay for a while by the end of this week :)
<jamest> um
<jamest> nope
<drochaid> s/pay/play
<jamest> no new snapshots
<drochaid> ah well, I'll keep hacking 0.1.1 to bits then :)
<jamest> play not pay :( drat, jamest was hoping to double what he makes on gnue...lets see....zero times two....
<jamest> ooo
<jamest> looks like my pay did double !
<drochaid> lmao
<AnDarkon> if you used an Intel CPU in your calculations, zero is not equal to zero times two :-)
<drochaid> hey, let me triple it for you ;)
<jamest> AnDarkon: so i'd be up to .00000000000132 cents an hour!
<jamest> rock!
<AnDarkon> That's more than what I make now!
<AnDarkon> You lucky dog!
<jamest> yip, I'm living high on the hog......gonna get me a package of ramen noodles next month....been saving up for them 
<AnDarkon> if you time it just right, you can get two for the price of one
<AnDarkon> Get some rice if you can, the broth make for great flavoring :-)
<jamest> :)
<AnDarkon> you want a quick and cheap chili soup recipe?
<jamest> mmmm chili
<AnDarkon> One pound ground beef (ground pork, chicken or turkey is fine)
<AnDarkon> large jar of salsa
<AnDarkon> Large can of tomato juice
<AnDarkon> two cans of kidney beans
<AnDarkon> brown the meat and drain
<AnDarkon> and throw the rest together and bring up to heat. Spice to taste

<AnDarkon> James, how was the decision to use python made? I made the same decision before I found GNU enterprise. I'm curious about the thinking process that came to that point :-)

<AnDarkon> Hi Bailey
<jbailey> Hello.
<jamest> well
<jamest> i'd used tcl in the past and wasn't happy with it
<jamest> lots of people on the list either already liked python or didn't object to it
Action: jamest doesn't recal the specifics of it
<jamest> there was  a lot of debate IIRC
<AnDarkon> I bet :-)
<AnDarkon> I was deliberating between Python and Java. I had already concluded that perl, while being very veristale (sp), would get too spaghettiy in large projects
<AnDarkon> what cinched is was Jython heh; the fact that I could run Python code on top of java machines cinched Python as the winner
<Isomer> heh
Action: jamest dislikes java with a passion
<Isomer> jamest: out of curiousity why?
<jamest> well
Action: Isomer suspects that this could be a long answer
<jamest> i have to support java apps here
<jamest> a major problem with java is the inconsistancies in the java VM
<jamest> so I have users that are forces to run specific versions of browsers to run some university apps
<AnDarkon> just like with C compilers
<Isomer> Ok, Cool, Fair enough :)
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> 3:15am
<Isomer> bed time
<AnDarkon> In the early days, I couldn't link borland libraries with Microsoft code
<AnDarkon> and vice versa
<Isomer> since I have to be coherent in <6hours
<AnDarkon> sleeping makes you coherent? ;-)
<jamest> it basically ends up a huge game of mix and match
<jamest> so one machine in the office has to have netscape 4.07 or something
<jamest> as that's the only one that runs all the apps the user requires
<AnDarkon> it makes me feel better for having decided on Python :-)
<AnDarkon> At least Python's credo guarantees that a number is stored the same way
<jamest> in fact speaking with some of the developers of these apps here on campus
<jamest> they gave up on java on the client
<jamest> and were redoing the systems to run java on the web server
<AnDarkon> jsp, right?
<jamest> which makes the whole cross platform benefit of java kinda moot
<jamest> jsp yes
<jamest> however i gave up on java back when swing was not part of java itself
<jamest> which shows my experience isn't that recent :)
<jamest> however the support side of things is still a pain for me :(
<jamest> oooo
<jamest> one last stab at java
<jamest> i can't resist
<jamest> I used to be able to get GCC to run on far more platforms that a JVM
<jamest> which I always found somewhat amusing :)
<jamest> not sure if that's still the case
Action: jamest has a history in this channel of being a java hater :)
<AnDarkon> I haven't encountered a system yet that didn't have gcc (other than SCO Unix)
<dsmith> AnDarkon: gcc is the portability layer
<dsmith> Too bad C doesn't have fixed sized type, like Java.
<dsmith> Doesn't the newer C standards have that?  in32 is guaranteed to be 32 bits or something?
<AnDarkon> C does, it's not just stored in the same exact method
<AnDarkon> big eidan, little eidan
Action: dsmith has been a C programmer for about 16 years
<jbailey> dsmith: uint_32_t I think.
<dsmith> jbailey: Yeah, that's it.
<dsmith> The one thing I liked about Java.
<jbailey> THere's a whole collection of types like that.  I would love to see them officially deprecate the old "int".
<reinhard> AnDarkon: IIRC there _is_ gcc on SCO Unix
<AnDarkon> reinhard: Not back when I was working on SCO Unix :-) I'm not saying that gcc wouldn't run, just that it was the only system that I worked on which didn't have gcc on it at the time
<reinhard> i'm not 100% sure though
<reinhard> it's a long time for me, too :)
<AnDarkon> :-) even though I've 17 years under my belt with C/C++, I'd rather program in Python. I like instant gratification heh
<jbailey> Working on SCO Unix is like poking myself in the eye with a stick.
<AnDarkon> and working with Xenix would be like poking yourself in the eye with a branding iron, right? :-)
<AnDarkon> on a 286, even
<jbailey> Yeah, but noone uses Xenix really.  I keep running into SCO sites that people want fixed.
<jbailey> And they never seem to understand that the only way to truly fix sco is with mke2fs.
<AnDarkon> jbailey: heh, unfortunately it's not an acceptable choices at some places, especially these who bought an excellent accounting package in the '80s.
<jbailey> Yeah =(
<AnDarkon> Just recently, I helped someone add `linux' to the terminfo database. What an experience
<reinhard> AnDarkon: oh at least terminfo
<jbailey> It's less painful than getting ncurses to compile with the native compiler. =)
<AnDarkon> The accounting package isn't the problem; it's that today's packages don't pass muster so they stay with it
<reinhard> termcap is more fun :)
<reinhard> you will laugh
<AnDarkon> jbailey: I gave up trying and hacked some wrappers for the native curses heh
<reinhard> but i support exactly that type of accounting pckage from the 80's that runs under SCO
<AnDarkon> reinhard: You do? Do you remember Wordperfect for Unix? I loved that package :-)
<reinhard> we had lyrix
<reinhard> it was an sco only thing iirc
pattieja (~pattieja@www.pcxperience.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jbailey> AnDarkon: Do you have any idea why `ld' doesn't build for SCO?  I thought they switched to ELF now...
<AnDarkon> jbailey: what kind of errors did you get?
<jbailey> binutils just doesn't generate the configs in that directory.  They've always prefered the native SCO linker, I think for the multilibs supports.
<AnDarkon> you can sometimes get a link error whenever the non-ELF (I forget the name of the format now) objects are linked along with ELF objects
<reinhard> COFF
<AnDarkon> Right, thanks :-)
<AnDarkon> it's been way too long
dres (~dres@4.18.171.42) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jbailey> Excellent.  I see that they've disabled the linker in binutils because it doesn't understand weak symbols in COFF.  Should be safe to enable for me, then.
<jbailey> IIRC, gcc-3 dropped support for COFF on sco.
<AnDarkon> I didn't know gcc supported COFF :-)

<AnDarkon> Hi
<psu> it;s the not-so-dreaded AndrewM !
<AnDarkon> No, I'm a different Andrew M... Just call me Andy :-)
<AnDarkon> what is it about Andrew M? And why is he such a holy terror?
Action: psu doesn't know - I am post-AndrewM
<AnDarkon> Me, too
<psu> Andrew Murie did the original code for GEAS
<psu> which reinhard & neilt are now re-hacking
<AnDarkon> am I to infer that the original GEAS is somewhat a hairball?
<AnDarkon> s/is/was/
<psu> I think it would be fairer to say
<psu> that it was written by/for a company for its own purposes
<psu> and then contibuted back to the community
<psu> and thus did what they wanted rather better
<psu> than what the project wanted/needed
<AnDarkon> a la Netscape?
<psu> plus everyone's ideas about what an App Server should be has evoleved somewhat
<psu> yes, excpet it was always intended to be GPL/FSF copyright from start
<AnDarkon> Ok
<psu> AndrewM may be gone
<psu> but his home directory lives on...
<psu> http://goats.gnue.org/~andrewm/
<reinhard> just to talk about good old days
<reinhard> the main point about andrew m. is
<reinhard> the coder of geas was named andrew murie
<reinhard> his boss (who also was here very often was also named andrew
<dneighbo> at one time there were 3 andrews on this project all from new zealand within like 150km of one another
<reinhard> plus the name another employee of this company (who also wrote little parts of the geas code) was also andrew
<dneighbo> two of which were andrewm
<reinhard> then ajmitch is andrew m(itchel)
<dneighbo> andrewm (all of them) were good guys
<reinhard> so AnDarkon is andrew m. number 3
<dneighbo> :)
<reinhard> and andrew number 6 or like that :)
<psu> ok this is going to look silly 
<psu> but I keep missing Isomer
<dneighbo> btw: the joke for a while was
<dneighbo> Treshna
<dneighbo> -----
<dneighbo> andrew m.
<dneighbo> andru
<dneighbo> andre
<dneighbo> and then
<dneighbo> ajmitch (andrew m)
<dneighbo> so the joke was 
<dneighbo> to live in new zealand must you have andr in your name?
Action: dneighbo thinks AnDarkon is just a kiwi in disguise ;)
<reinhard> some days we entered irc and said something
<psu> Isomer & me keep missing each other - him @ work, me @ sleep & vice versa
<reinhard> like
<reinhard> "hi andr*"
<reinhard> :)
<dneighbo> isomer is really remosi
<dneighbo> so if you have data on remosi they are one in the same
<psu> I would /query him, but I'm not 100% sure I know what I'm talking about
<psu> shall I just cyt & paste main channel & let you all have a good laugh?

<dneighbo> sure
<psu> Hi Isomer
<psu> Did anyone ever answer your query from yesterday
<psu> about widgets?
<psu> I'm no expert
<psu> but based on what I've read here
<psu> I think you could use some of the GNUe Tools
<psu> If all you want is a series of "hooks" 
<psu> to enable your C/C++ code to talk to a database
<psu> then you could use GNUe Common 
<psu> This already has abstraction for databases
<psu> and will have abstraction for RPC
<psu> when jcater has the time
<psu> so you can talk CORBA, SOAP, XML-RPC to your d/b
<psu> If by "widget"
<psu> you actually mean having data-aware controls
<psu> then GNUe Forms should do what you want
<psu> Main issue is that the current version of GNUe Forms
<psu> is written in python 
<psu> so assumes all triggers for data controls are in python too
<psu> However
<psu> there has already been some discussion about writing triggers in C
<psu> basically, just use a python wrapper to call the C code
<psu> even our python fanatics have admitted
<psu> they might have to use C at times 
<psu> for speed & efficiency
<psu> Longer term I believe the plan is to write an alternative version 
<psu> of GNUe Forms native in C
<psu> s/to write/to find a C fanatic who can be persuaded to volunteer to write
<psu> Anyway 
<psu> any duff info i have given you can be corrected  
<psu> by someone who actually knows what they are talking about ;-)
<psu> ok
<psu> end flood...
Action: psu has obviously stunned everyone else into silence ;)

<jan> Hi!
<psu> hi jan
Action: dneighbo has other thing running
<dneighbo> reading now
<dneighbo> im not sure i agree
<dneighbo> i dont know what he is wanting to do
<dneighbo> if he wants database abstraction for C code he might be better off right now today to look at libGDA
<psu> ok
<dneighbo> as writing bindings for our gnue-common is probably more trouble than he is looking for
<dneighbo> if he is looking to use application server
<dneighbo> then yes via corba today he could use our app server with his front end
<dneighbo> and write methods in python or C
<jan> hi psu.
<dneighbo> if he is looking to us gfd, he could write a forms engine in C though i wouldnt recommend it at this stage of the game
<dneighbo> so some of it depends on his 'needs' in order to answer properly
<psu> yep

<dneighbo> arent prop software vendors great?
<dneighbo> you have a product that works but needs some 'fixes'
<dneighbo> but they have a NEW version that doesnt do anything really great for you
<dneighbo> and so any fix you need is ' the new version has the fixed '
<dneighbo> only thing is new version isnt part of your support/upgrade contract
<dneighbo> i swear its so bad im suprised i didnt here

<dneighbo> basically the new version cures cancer, solves world hunger and achieves world peas ;)
<soulstompp> but only if you pay extra for the platinum edition
<soulstompp> standard edition only gives you a larger penis
<dneighbo> roflmao
<dneighbo> soulstompp you sure you dont work for this company?

<soulstompp> never seen a VAR that added any value
<psu> it depends
<psu> my last employer's core business was selling finance systems
<psu> but we were also a VAR for a well-known reporting package
<psu> If you bought the package from them, you got a load of CDs
<psu> If you bought from us, you got the CDs, some setup/training consultancy,
<soulstompp> thats cool
<soulstompp> I guess their are some out their
<psu> plus the critical schema definition layer that enabled package to talk to our DB
<psu> which I ended up being responsible for maintaining 
<psu> in my "spare" time 
<soulstompp> oh no thats not right
<dneighbo> hey now
<dneighbo> VAR = Vaseline Applied Regularly
<dneighbo> get from vendor == take it in rear
<soulstompp> so true
<dneighbo> get from var == take in rear w/ added vaseline ;)

<soulstompp> comment = this is my test
<soulstompp> provider = pypgsql
<soulstompp> host = localhost
<soulstompp> dbname = gnue
<dneighbo> on the machine you are using forms on do
<jamest> you have a postgresql database named gnue?
<dneighbo> psql -h localhost -U validusername gnue
<dneighbo> and tell me what you get
<jamest> and do you have your postgresql listening on tcp/ip?
<soulstompp> yeah got it doing that yesterday
<soulstompp> I think I put the wrong database name in
<dneighbo> what is output from 
<soulstompp> the config
<dneighbo> psql -h localhost -U validusername gnue
<soulstompp> no database
<soulstompp> it's gnuetest
<dneighbo> then thats the problem (or at least one of them)
<dneighbo> what the hell
<dneighbo>  a little fishy just swam across my machine
<dneighbo> i have seen that before (once or twice)
<dneighbo> anyone have a clue what it is?

<dneighbo> um looked like it
<jamest> it went missing last night
<jamest> he's worried sick
<dneighbo> but seriously anyone know what it was?
<jamest> what os?
<dneighbo> soulstompp change dbname = gnue to dbname = gnuetest
<dneighbo> then try
<dneighbo> psql -h localhost -U username gnuetest
<dneighbo> if that works
<dneighbo> retry your form
<dneighbo> let me know how it goes
<soulstompp> and it's good
<dneighbo> debian sid
<dneighbo> have seen it on red hat too
<dneighbo> it just slowly swims across 1 time and doesnt come back
<dneighbo> i have only seen it maybe 3 times in 3 years
Action: dneighbo wonders if its some timed joke
<dneighbo> or if i have been hacked
<dneighbo> though this machine should be pretty hard to get to from outside world
<jamest> it's a gnome easter egg
<dneighbo> ah what triggers it?
<jamest> There's an Easter Egg in Gnome, which gives you a 1 in 4000 chance of fatting fish swimming across your screen.
<dneighbo> what is the 4000 chance?
<jamest> groups.google.com
<dneighbo> funny
<jamest> one post claimed it has to do with the panel
<dneighbo> i tell you if something can happen to my systems chances are it will :)
<jamest> each time you use it, it increments a counter
<dneighbo> most people probably never seen damn thing and i have seen it on virtually every linux system i have :)
<dneighbo> at least im not crazy :)
<dneighbo> er will completely crazy
<jamest> was jcater comming back?
<dneighbo> yeah i think

<jamest> soulstompp: so where are you at wrt the database?
<soulstompp> I got connected and I am playing with the wizard
<jamest> cool
<jamest> is it working out ok for you?
<soulstompp> seems to be 
<jamest> any feedback?
<soulstompp> I went through the wizard and got the form set up
<soulstompp> and I added a button
<soulstompp> do I need a button to make these changes?
<soulstompp> or is just filling out the fields sufficient
<soulstompp> and then doing a commit?
<jamest> ?
<jamest> you don't need buttons on a form for anything
<jamest> you get queries and commits for free 
<jamest> via the menu, toolbar, or keyboard shortcuts
<soulstompp> very cool
<soulstompp> I am getting a segmentation fault everytime that I try to delete this button off of my form
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> you can't do that from designer right now
<soulstompp> oh okay
<jamest> the right click delete is our quick exit feature
<soulstompp> :)
<soulstompp> deleted it from the XML doc
<soulstompp> no biggie
<jamest> at this point in time
<jamest> i find myself doing 1/2 in designer 1/2 in vi|emacs
<soulstompp> I needed an exit shortcut anyway
<jamest> a month ago I was doing 1/4 designer
<jamest> so were getting there :)
<dneighbo> hmmm you all suck
<dneighbo> im 3/4 1/4
<jamest> dneighbo: we're power users
<dneighbo> the trick is dont make mistakes
<dneighbo> though im a little disadvantage as i save in unicode :)
<jamest> got to make it do the things designer can't do :)

<dneighbo> um use what works for you
<soulstompp> lol
<dneighbo> relational will be easier for two tier
<jamest> i do relational
<soulstompp> alright
<jamest> the form can do master/detail
<dneighbo> when we get geas (appserver) up to speed
<jamest> but designer can't auto set it up
<dneighbo> we will probably make a 'conversion' tool
<jamest> what I do
<jamest> is make forms for each table
<dneighbo> so you write your objects in geas
<jamest> put the blocks together
<dneighbo> and map your relational tables to them

<chillywilly> noe more netertainment for you
<chillywilly> er entertainment even
Action: derek has damage to inflict on forms
<jamest> when ken finds out she's more plastic than person
<jamest> "Hey! These aren't real!"
<derek> jamest: do you have any idea if the unicode issue is in our code
<jamest> not a clue
<derek> or my beta python version?
<jamest> well
<derek> as i really dont want to spend all night upgrading python
<derek> if that isnt the issue
<jamest> people have said that it works with pyth 2.2
<chillywilly> apt-get install python2.1
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> chillywilly: yes yes i wish
<derek> ups me a tower to put my amd in and i will do that
<derek> until then i odnt have debian here
<chillywilly> you have an amd board?
Action: chillywilly is a bit poort ya know
<derek> to save me some time jamest can you tell me which .py file in designer does the save?
<derek> so i can start 'debugging' the problem
<jamest> um
<jamest> i haven't looked 
<jamest> but
<derek> or tell me what to grep for
<jamest> GObj should do the save
<derek> i.e. class or routine
<jamest> dumpXML 
<derek> ok will start there
<jamest> is part of the core GObj
<jamest> and a few classes override that
<jamest> but for the most part that is it
Action: chillywilly takes more notes!

<chillywilly> hmmm
<jamest> it's being generated from the wx import
<chillywilly> and ACLs
<derek> yeah i know
<derek> just letting you know its happening
<jamest> ok
<derek> what seems to happen is if gfdes crashes
<derek> the next time i start it, i get that
<derek> then if i run again its fine
<derek> so its like the crash corrupts memory or something
<derek> but if i look in top etc no evidence of its tehre
<derek> anyhow
<derek> odd
<derek> if i save a blank form it saves fine

<derek> hmmm add some widgets and it saves fine
<derek> you want a pet peeve bug, good glad you asked
<derek> we dont 'hourglass' properly
<jamest> did someone say we wanted bugs?
<derek> i.e. when designer is 'thinking' the hourglass doesnt exist when hovering over the application
<derek> argh and after running the wizard
<derek> designer never seems to shut down right
<chillywilly> jamest: you hear something?
<jamest> the wind? 
<chillywilly> jamest: I thought I may have heard someone whining
<derek> ok, here is the deal
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> if i save blank form it works
<derek> if i save hand created form it works
<jamest> hmmmm, now that you mention it.....i thouhgt it was two weasels mating outdoors
<derek> if i save a form after i run the wizard it does unicode
<derek> rofl
Action: derek thinks of the budlight commericals, but those are ferrets
<jamest> so the wizard is messing it up
<chillywilly> jamest: it was more like a whale call
<jamest> that's odd
<jamest> derek: give me a sec and I'll try it
<derek> jamest: i dont know if wizard is messing it up persay
<derek> but i can say after using the wizard it does it but not before
<derek> but im doing more complex form with the wizard
<derek> so it could be something eles
<derek> er else
<derek> but whats odd is if i shut down designer then try to open a form that i replace the ^@ with it still happens
<derek> which makes me think its something that wizard creates but not the wizard itself
<jamest> can you do me a favor?
<jamest> try and run the forms/sample/button/forms/form.gfd?
<jamest> i'll try designer wizard while you do that :)

<jcater> yeah, I'd imagine
<jcater> I'll be back shortly

Action: jcater is away: bbiab
Action: derek thinks this, hmmm sounds like you need new xxxxxx, btw i have to leave, sounds fishy ;)
<derek> hmmm well upgrade to pyxml 7.0 didnt fix things
<jamest> can someone update and test designer against pre pg 7.2 database
<jamest> make usre the wizard still workds
<jamest> designer works w/o issue here derek
<jamest> no problems at all
<derek> doesnt suprise me
<derek> probably python2.2a
<derek> but i really wish that had better proof of that
<derek> im afraid to update i have something pretty much works

<derek> i just want to get this machine on debian soon
<chillywilly> do it
<derek> and dont really want to recompile python and friends on it 
<jcater> do you still have the source directory where you installed?
<chillywilly> go for it
<jcater> i.e., do you have the Makefile?
<derek> where installed what?
<derek> python?
<jcater> you installed from source, right?
<jcater> yes
<derek> nope i deleted that dir
<derek> jcater what is bothering me about this problem
<derek> if i opne desinger and do NOTHING and save the form (ie blank form)
<derek> it saves fine
<derek> even if i drop some stuff on the form it saves fine
<derek> but if open and existing form and do save as
<derek> poof
<derek> hmm a normal save kills too
<derek> damn thought i was on to a pattern
<derek> ok its on second save
<derek> most odd
<derek> if i open designer
<derek> drop some widgets on it and do a 'save'
<derek> it saves just fine
<derek> if i open that file back up in designer
<derek> do NOTHING
<derek> cept file->save
<derek> it saves it with the ^@
<derek> this ranting on whats happening helping any?
<derek> or should i just give in and say its my system and move along
<jcater> does anyone else use python2.2?
<jamest> not i
<jcater> as I'm not kidding... a lot changed in 2.2
<jamest> IIRC unicode support was big in 2.2
<derek> since you all are on debian can you try 2.2 easily?
<jamest> it would break all my dependencies
<jamest> and I'm on a deathline with some forms stuff
<jcater> content may be a Unicode string or a byte string; the expat reader module produces always Unicode strings. 
<derek> um fuck me
<derek> i was right
<derek> stringio i think is the problem
<derek> * In Python 2.1, the StringIO module (though not cStringIO) supported Unicode. This capability is accidentally not present in Python 2.2.
<jcater> umrofl
<jcater>  accidentally not present in Python 2.2.
<jcater> sigh
<derek> fsck fsck fsck
<derek> explains why SECOND time it happens
<derek> is stringio is used to READ the xml file
<derek> iirc
<derek> so my first guess hours ago was probably the right one 
<derek> btw: that accidently is funny seeing how its from OFFICIAL python page
<jamest> so basically 
<derek> jcater: woudl this be symptom of not having unicode stringio?
<jamest> youre' screwed
<jcater> crap
<jcater> that's on the known bugs page
<derek> jamest: thats ok i have lots o vaseline
<jcater> I was looking at the 2.2a4 known bugs page
<jamest> good
<jamest> lube up 
<jcater> bot the 2.2-final known-bugs :(
<jamest> as you're going to have to reinstall python :)
<chillywilly> have you figured it out fellas?
<derek> well not really
<jamest> unless they provide a workarround
<derek> i can use 'emacs' to fix things
<derek> for now
<derek> but this is big
<chillywilly> unicode not present in python 2.2a?
<jcater> hang on
<derek> as we need to not tell people to use 2.2
<jcater> I'll patch
<derek> or we need to fix our code to not use stringio
<derek> jcater: and you thought i was TEASING when i said i work hard to provide a system that finds bugs :)
<jcater> where are you seeing StringIO being used?
<derek> um
<derek> in Designer.py i think

<derek> that help
<jcater> sigh
Action: jcater thinks it's only relevant when reading from an xml file
<jcater> as it's expat generating the unicode, which stringio don't know what to do with
<jcater> damn
<jcater> that sentence sounded like something chillywilly would write
<chillywilly> just stay away from me mr. crabby I've had enough of you kind for today thank you
Action: chillywilly notes crazymike was a crabby little pain today
<chillywilly> :P
<derek> so can we 'fix' it
<derek> or do we need to say we dont work well with 2.2 until they fix bug
<chillywilly> dudes
<chillywilly> this is rediculous
<chillywilly> http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99991905
<jcater> derek: can you update cvs and see if this is still happening
Action: jcater isn't so sure now that this patch will work
<derek> brimming with confidence eh
<derek> seems to still have the issue
<derek> wiping directory
<derek> and doing new co and setup.py first
<jcater> ok
<jcater> if the same issue
<jcater> then we are 2.2 incompatable
<jcater> for the indeterminable future
<derek> thats probably not too horrid as im the only one insane enough to run 2.2 :)
<chillywilly> ;P
<jcater> I hope they come out w/2.2.1 before major distro's bump up to 2.2.x support
<chillywilly> not even debian ustable has 2.2!
<chillywilly> er, unstable
<jcater> derek: you are in violation of our support contract until you downgrade to 2.1.2
<jcater> :)
<derek> strike three
<derek> no dice
<jcater> ?
<derek> saving a form
<derek> then reopening and saving
<derek> still gets ^@
<derek> um but i still stringio's
<derek> what did you change?
<jcater> Designer.py
<derek> what did you change in it though?

<psu> hi moi_je
<psu> I'm afraid early morning in Europe is prob
<psu> the worst time to catch people on this channel
<psu> especially if you want real python people ;-)
<psu> Main issue with python and GNUe
<psu> usually is that GNUe needs python 2.x
<psu> and most people have 1.5.x
<psu> the catch -
<psu> when you install 2.x 
<psu> there is a tendancy
<psu> for not all of the python tools to recognise the upgrade
<psu> so you end up with a half 1.5.x/half 2.x python install
<psu> This is actually so common 
<psu> that one of the guys has written a python-checking script
<psu> to check everything out
<derek> moi_je: you still have problems?

<btami> Hi! I am Bajusz Tamas from Hungary, and this is my first talking on IRC ever.
<jamest> hello
<btami> I'v got some problem with installing kinterbasedb win32
<btami> on the "Select python installation to use " window there is nothing to select
<btami> what is the problem (I installed python2.2 before OK)
<btami> Is anybody used kinterbasedb on win2k ?
<reinhard> btami: sorry this is a channel specialized on the gnuenterprise project
<reinhard> i guess kinterbasedb is a kde thing
<reinhard> so you might try #kde instead
<reinhard> they might be able to help you
<jamest> btami: wiat
<jamest> wait
<jamest> reinhard: that's the interbase database driver
<btami> yes
<reinhard> oh sorry
Action: reinhard goes back to his corner
<jamest> :)
<reinhard> :)
<jamest> we currently don't have a kinterbase tester
<jamest> :(
<jamest> i will say that python2.2 will give you troubles with designer
<btami> I want to be, but dont know how
<jamest> as it seems Python 2.2 left out unicode support for their stringio module :( 
<jamest> it's on the known bugs page
<jamest> however
<btami> thanks, I will try 2.1
<jamest> so you may want to drop back to python 2.1
<jamest> then
<jamest> are you wanting to develop on this stuff or just use it?
<btami> I wanting to test it on win2k
<jamest> if you wish to develop on it you would require a full python install
<jamest> however if you just want to use it
<btami> I installed 2.2 (full)
<jamest> the win32 binaries include a wrappered python w/ dependencies
<jamest> so you don't have to install anything other than the driver (in some cases)
<jamest> the one thing we can't do
<jamest> is include all the db drivers
<jamest> as their licenses restrict it
<jamest> so we play it safe and include
<jamest> postgresql, mysql, odbc
<jamest> with instructions on how to add other drivers into our install
Action: jamest wishes he knew where those instructions are
<jamest> i will look
<jamest> with this kind of setup if you get the kinterbase driver opened
<jamest> you should be able to copy support into the system
<jamest> however this has mainly been tested with Oracle
<btami> i can't use kinterbasedb from source, because it requires MS C compiler (I dont have)
alexey (alex@strel.techkran.vladimir.ru) left irc: "[x]chat"
<jamest> be back in a sec (work calls)
<btami> and the kinterbasedb*.exe does not let me "select python installed to use"
<btami> but I will try to downgrade to python 2.1
<btami> tomorrow :)

<jamest> hello
<conrad> morning jamest
<conrad> Haven't been in here for ages. Was just sticking my nose in for a look.....  :-)
<jamest> :)
<jamest> it has been a while
<conrad> How's things going?
<jamest> great!
<jamest> for the most part
<jamest> at least for me
<jamest> i think some of us would disagree
<jamest> poor reinhard is swamped with that nasty "real work" thing
<conrad> gnue ready to take over the world yet?
Action: jamest feels for him
<conrad> Oh, know what that is like.
<jamest> um, i think we need to patch a few thing before we take over the world
<jamest> maybe in 10 years or so :)
<conrad> Cool....  :-)
<jamest> what have you been up to.....
<jamest> freeing up time so you can help out ?
<conrad> I should have another look and play with it, I suppose.
<jamest> :)
<jamest> i don't think there is a single tool that'd i'd use from tarball
<jamest> i know there are major features/changes in forms and designer in cvs
<jamest> and I believe lots of fixes for geas in cvs
<jamest> reinhard?
<conrad> Study, life, study, arguments with about our contracts, study, and life....  I think that sums up my life. :-)
<conrad> Hmmm.... maybe not the best time for me to play with it then. 
<conrad> I'm a little off building from cvs at the moment. I haven't been able to get gnucash cvs to build for about 3 months despite the fact that it works for everyone else.....
<jamest> lol
<jamest> there is a slight difference though
<jamest> we only have 129 dependencies not 136
<jamest> j/k
<conrad> :-)
<jamest> our requirements system is a lot smaller
<jamest> and
<jamest> we've got a setup script for developers
<jamest> and a diag script to tell you what is causing problems on your system
<jamest> I don't have any trouble installing it :)  
<conrad> My system is just broken.
<jamest> heck
<conrad> I have all the dependencies, but something is just stuffed.
<jamest> even Derek can get it to run
<jamest> :)
<conrad> Anyway. I should head to bed. I'll hang around for a few days (until I next fall off the server, anyway).
<jamest> ok
<jamest> :)
<conrad> Night.

<jamest> is there some apt-get or dpkg trick to force reinstall of entire system
<jamest> a crash took the GUI partially down
<dneighbo> can you do like
<dneighbo> apt-get dist-upgrade
<jamest> and dkpg --install *
<jamest> with a dkpg-reconfigure -a 
<jamest> isn't working
<jamest> dneighbo: doubt it as I did that 1 day before the crash
<jamest> so it's fairly up to date
<jamest> but i'll try
<dneighbo>  dpkg --get-selections | cut -f1 | \
<dneighbo>      xargs apt-get --reinstall install
<dneighbo> that must have scared him off
<jcater> omg

<jamest> i bet they don't even have doughnuts
<jcater> no!
<jcater> they don't
<jcater> the only thing this town is "famous" for is it's "Slug Burgers"

<jamest>  dpkg --get-selections | awk '$2 ~ /^install$/ { print "apt-get install --reinstall -y " $1 }' > ~/reinst
<jamest> then I run the script
<jamest> seems to be happier that way
Action: jamest makes note.....must learn more about awk
<dneighbo> cool
<dneighbo> so it works?
<jamest> won't know for a while
<dneighbo> um in python how do you do a case statement or elseif?
<dneighbo> i dont have my python book with me
<jamest> if ():
<jamest>   blah
<jamest> elif:
<dneighbo> ah
<jamest>   blah
<dneighbo> i tried elseif and else if
<dneighbo> muchas gracias
<jamest> n oprob
<dneighbo> how can you do compound conditionals?
<dneighbo> like
<jamest> ?
<dneighbo> if (myfoo == "") AND (yourfoo == ""):
<dneighbo> it doesnt seem to like AND
<dneighbo> is it &&
<jamest> and should work
<dneighbo> and ||
<dneighbo> or something
<jcater> dneighbo: python is case-sensitive
<dneighbo> ah
Action: dneighbo thwacks self in head
<jamest> oooo
<jamest> let us do that!
<dneighbo> that fixed it
<dneighbo> dont need the elif now :)
<dneighbo> as i can just make really ugly if instead
<jamest> dneighbo: you have glimpse?
<dneighbo> um not on here i dont think
<dneighbo> but im on debian so wouldnt be hard to get
<dneighbo> why?
<dneighbo> sigh how do you set env options to be permanent
<dneighbo> like http_proxy
<jcater> either as root, vi /etc/profile
<jcater> or ~/.bash_profile
Action: jcater would recommend the /etc/profile if this is your workstation/personal machine
Action: dneighbo still wants to know why jamest wanted to know if i had glimpse
<jamest> dneighbo: as you can glimpseindex the gnue cvs tree
<jamest> and get lots and lots of examples of python 
<dneighbo> ah
<jamest> glimpse and | grep if
<dneighbo> wright:/home/dneighbo# apt-get install glimpse
<dneighbo> Reading Package Lists... Done
<dneighbo> Building Dependency Tree... Done
<dneighbo> Package glimpse has no available version, but exists in the database.
<dneighbo> This typically means that the package was mentioned in a dependency and
<dneighbo> never uploaded, has been obsoleted or is not available with the contents
<dneighbo> of sources.list
<dneighbo> E: Package glimpse has no installation candidate
<dneighbo> wright:/home/dneighbo# 
<jamest> drat
<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> maybe tomorrow :)
<jamest> i don't know why they did that
<jamest> it has been gone a long time now
<dneighbo> um maybe we should ask in #debian
<dneighbo> jcater should i just fax you my steno pad?
<stbain> can't you just tar.gz that steno pad and email it to him?

Action: dneighbo was wondering if i could fax my steno pad :)
<jcater> sure
<jcater> I need more kindling for the fire
<jcater> dudes!
<jcater> if you are religious at all
<jcater> please keep my cousin Lee in your prayers
<chillywilly> what's wrong?
<jcater> this morning, he was putting a stick of wood in his wood stove
<jcater> and apparently there was a gas leak elsewhere
<jcater> his trailer no longer exists
<jcater> and he's in ICU
<jamest> wow
<chillywilly> man
<jamest> i'm sorry to hear that
<jamest> anyone else hurt?
<jcater> not to my knowledge
<dneighbo> momma
<dneighbo> that is ouchie
<jcater> he was separated, so kids and wife were elsewhere
<dneighbo> i think burns have to be the WORST kind of injury
<chillywilly> hmm
<chillywilly> this is interesting
<chillywilly> oh wait
<dneighbo> chillywilly you investigate gnu friends web site yet?
<dsmith> jcater: Where does your cousin live?
<dneighbo> and fsdn - free software developers network
<chillywilly> no
<chillywilly> what are you talking about?
<dneighbo> appears they are going ot try to mimic osdn
<chillywilly> who is?
<dneighbo> as i know rms is clamoring for a free software version of sourceforge
<chillywilly> that would be cool
<dneighbo> gnu friends seems like slashdot
<chillywilly> I see
<dneighbo> and there was talk of free software version of freshmeat
<chillywilly> interestin
<dneighbo> chillywilly cool but stupid
<chillywilly> where did you hear about this?
<dneighbo> if they want to make a flippin difference
<chillywilly> in the news?
<dneighbo> code something that needs coding
<dneighbo> dont code something that just replaces word open with free
<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> :(
<chillywilly> I disagree
<chillywilly> open source is too liberal and does not do good for the movement
<chillywilly> you even have admitted this yourself
<chillywilly> SF is a prime example
<chillywilly> it is now going the way of prop.
<chillywilly> we need Free resources
<dneighbo> in that instance i think its ok
<chillywilly> but we do have advogato
<chillywilly> wrt gnu friends
<dneighbo> take thier last gpl release and make/maintain a free fork
<chillywilly> that's what savannah is
<dneighbo> but up until recently it was gpl
<chillywilly> and I am sure it will be hacked on and mutated
<dneighbo> anyhow no time to argue
<chillywilly> form that code base
<chillywilly> er, from
Action: jcater thinks you should look at the "spirit" of the project
<jcater> not the use of words "open sourcE" and "free"
<jcater> dsmith: he's in New Albany, MS
<chillywilly> it's about having our voice, the FS philosophy is definitely not the same as OS
<jcater> "our" ... I'd prefer not to be pigeon holed :)
<chillywilly> you prefer not to be associated witht eh FS community?
Action: jcater doesn't have time to argue either, though
<jcater> chillywilly: you are putting words in my mouth
<jcater> of course I like to be associated w/FS community
<chillywilly> how is one supposed to take that statement then?
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I gotta work
<chillywilly> then work
<jcater> yessa, boss, sir
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> I am no boss
<chillywilly> just merely ststing I will not be offended if you have to go work, instaed of arguing with me ;)

<drochaid> did someone say 'argue' ? :)
<chillywilly> you wanna go?
<drochaid> heh
<drochaid> always ;)
Action: chillywilly is ready
<chillywilly> but you have to disagree with me first, not sense in arguing for aguement's sake
<drochaid> can't be bothered reading up .. what we arguing about?
<chillywilly> s/not/no
<chillywilly> bah
<drochaid> do I have to agree with my argument, or can I just argue blindly and illogically?
<chillywilly> there will be no arguments for argument's sake here
<chillywilly> ;P
<jcater> chillywilly was just saying we should be intolerant of anyone "Open Source" and mail bomb their petty SourceForge site
<jcater> and DoS the OSDN sites
<chillywilly> no, but we are Free to disgaree and do things our way
<chillywilly> than you very much
<drochaid> lol
<dneighbo> chillywilly i think the problem is in someways
<drochaid> I couldn't care less about the petty politics of 'open' vs 'free'
<dneighbo> idealistically i think that FSF is good barometer
<dneighbo> but practically they are a little over the top
<dneighbo> example...
<dneighbo> i think Christianity as a faith sets forth good values
<dneighbo>   -- thus i think abortion is wrong
<dneighbo> now there are a few ways i can 'cause' this
<dneighbo> 1. is educate people
<dneighbo> 2. is have a tender heart to those in that situation
<dneighbo> 3. is picket/protest
<chillywilly> don't tell me the FSF implemetations is equivalent to bombing abortion clinics
<dneighbo> 4. is threaten and harass anyone that has done or performs this
<dneighbo> 5. is i can physically harm those that do this
<dneighbo> i thikn FSF hs been a 3 for a long time
Action: jcater prefers the 1 and 2 route
<dneighbo> but more and more they are becoming a 4
<dneighbo> i think would denounce a 5
<dneighbo> so im not saying thats what they do
<chillywilly> show me where they are harassing ppl?
<dneighbo> i tend to think that 1 and 2 are more EFFECTIVE ways of fixing the problem
<dneighbo> chillywilly : visit their booth sometime
<chillywilly> some ppl go overboard
<dneighbo> talk to rms or bkuhn for an hour sometime
<chillywilly> doesn't mean that's the way it should be done or the way things are being done
<dneighbo> they claime much of thier 4 is (harassing) is really education
<chillywilly> I have spoken to bradley before
Action: drochaid prefers option 6 [unlisted] ... be tolerant and accept that they do not share your view and have no reason to subscribe to your view point
<dneighbo> i.e. let me interrupt you while you speak for an hour every 30 seconds to tell you how wrong you are
<chillywilly> my only rms encounter was so he could yell at me for saying 
<dneighbo> is good 'education'
<chillywilly> 'Linux'
<chillywilly> which was gay
<chillywilly> sorry, lame
<dneighbo> drochaid i list your option six as more a 1 or 2
<dneighbo> er 2
<jcater> chillywilly: if FSF was about 1 or 2, then they would be exhibiting at COMDEX, et al
<drochaid> okies dneighbo ... just a terminology problem there :)
<jcater> and not setting up shop a LWE to bitch about the L part
<dneighbo> well i see 6 as an 'i dont care' 2 :)
<dneighbo> unless you generally are mean spirited :)
<drochaid> no, don't care is very definately not the case
<dneighbo> when i mean dont care, i mean you dont care about changing their belief
<chillywilly> tell me what this has to do with FSDN and GNU friends?
<drochaid> realisation that some people will NEVER agree with you, and the will to live in peace is more the point
<jcater> why would there be a FSDN?
<jcater> because of the F vs O
<jcater> ?
Action: jcater has never seen OSDN be Free-unfriendly
<jcater> quite the opposite
<jcater> so what is the purpose of FSDN other than a statement/division?
<dneighbo> fwiw: i wasnt saying these things are horrid or vile or not even useful
<dneighbo> i was calling attention to are we spending time wisely?
<chillywilly> who is in charge of OSDN?
<chillywilly> VA?
<dneighbo> probably
<dneighbo> chillywilly point is why does it matter
<chillywilly> I rest my case
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> that's no case
<jcater> that's called an excuse
<chillywilly> you talk to loic and you find out just how friendly they are about contributiung code to SF
<jcater> sometimes I feel that the whole FS movement is in its "teenage" years... i.e., always right and always able to do it better than everyone else (not that this is wrong, but it's the whole cocky attitude)
<chillywilly> seriously if you were a real OS advocate you would be a FS advocate by default, but VA, ESR, et. al. don;t even fit into that category
<jcater> labeling is a very dangerous thing to do
<dneighbo> so SF didnt take his patches
jamest (jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) got netsplit.
<dneighbo> were they valid patches?
<chillywilly> it was all well and good
<dneighbo> if they were then he has a real gripe and a real reason to fork
<chillywilly> they wanted him to sign copyright over to then so they could take his stuff and roll it into their prop. product
<dneighbo> and he should EDUCATE (see item 1) in a polite way (see item 2) about the problems 
<chillywilly> I dunno about you
<chillywilly> that doesn't sound appealing to me
<dneighbo> iirc he basically threw his cards on the table and stomped away
<dneighbo> and sounded like a baby not getting his way
<chillywilly> he did
<jcater> chillywilly: well, copyright assignment is not unusual
<dneighbo> losing ALL credibility to anyone outside the FS movement directly
<jcater> and to extrapolate simply based on that point is a futile exercise
<dneighbo> now that said i respect loic and i understand his frustrations but i think they could have been handled better
<jcater> it's not at all unusual for a project to accept patches, the patches must be under the same/close license
<chillywilly> you think VA is going to give an inch at all?
<dneighbo> in essence look what it did
<dneighbo> a. anyone not in fs camp simply utter 'damn little FSF zealot whinners shut up already'
<dneighbo> b. anyone in fs camp said, 'wow what a suprise va linux has head up butt'
<dneighbo> so really who wins?
<dneighbo> im not saying he shoudl have waited on VA
<dneighbo> but i think he could of brought things public in a cordial way
<dneighbo> giving VA linux the chance to either
<dneighbo> a. fix the problems
<dneighbo> b. say something dumb (put foot in mouth)
<chillywilly> heh, FS ppl always look like whiners....so to comabt this what do you do? You put your money where your mouth and build something for the sake of freedom
<dneighbo> c. lay silent in which case (silence is guilt)
<chillywilly> but then you get those who like to complain oh we should bbe doing this
<dneighbo> chillywilly i couldnt agree more
jamest (~jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) returned to #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> sorry, but GNU has never really been totally about doing something technologically superior but providing a Free alternative
<chillywilly> I mena heck why are we here...we could just use SAP or something
<dneighbo> correct
<dneighbo> im not sure what point you are arguing here
<dneighbo> no one said fsf should be about freedom
<dneighbo> we were arguing about the best way to combat non freedom (remember the 1 - 5 list) :)
<chillywilly> but somehow you don;t like how they go about trying to get that freedom
<dneighbo> correct
<dneighbo> i like american freedom for example (what little is left) ;)
<dneighbo> but i dont advocate we drop bombs on people to keep it
<chillywilly> neither do I, but now you are opening another can of worms
<jcater> my current frustration is that we are promoting our way of thinking... but instead of promoting in the "Revolution"-way (i.e., spread of democracy from the bottom up until a country revolts internally), we take the Hitler approach (all others are wrong and must be decimated)
<jcater> that's not a complete analogy, of course...
<jcater> sigh

psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> yes i think to be good it will take 'grass roots' level

<jcater> I think the movement as a whole does

Action: dsmith remembers all those companies that tried to make a disto based on Debain, and failed.

<dneighbo> Your mail server is infected with a strain of virii that hit IIS servers. Because of this infection, it is trying to spread to other machines, and my logs show it trying to penetrate my system.
<dneighbo> I picked this up off my server logs today, I thought I would extend you the courtesy to let you know so that you could fix it.  In the future,  I would consider a more secure operating system and web serving software.

<chillywilly> yes

<chillywilly> woops
Action: chillywilly didn't realize that was an email
<chillywilly> duh
<dneighbo> i sent it off
<chillywilly> cool
<dneighbo> didnt even do it anonymously
<dneighbo> i put your email on it

<chillywilly> you should've said like Debian GNU/Linux and Apache web server
<chillywilly> ;P
<dneighbo> with a sign line of all joo base belongz 2 me
<dneighbo> chillywilly i had that at first but figured didnt want to sound political

<chillywilly> yea
<dneighbo> or they coudl view it as me infecting them to get them to switch or something

<chillywilly> even if you made it crash the best access you could get would be for www-data

<jamest> man i love windows
<jamest> just booted up a laptop

<jamest> it has a small icon checked in the corner (remember password)
<jamest> so i think damn i wonder if that was me that forgot to uncheck that
<jamest> typed in my name
<jamest> hit enter
<jamest> it logged me in w/ my password

<dneighbo> how can i type cast it?
<dneighbo> so i could do somethign like
<dneighbo> if (pos_rec[0] < 100):
<dneighbo>   pos_rec[0] = pos_rec[0] * 10
<dneighbo> or something?
<dneighbo> or do i not have to 'cast' in python?
Action: dneighbo forgets
<dneighbo> pascal is very picky about such things
<jamest> cast to what?
<jamest> int() float() str()
<jamest> if (int(pos_rec[0]) < 100):
<jamest> btw - you coding in python?????
<dneighbo> float()
<dneighbo> jamest yeah
<chillywilly> if (float(pos_rec[0]) < 100):
<dneighbo> sweet
Action: chillywilly thought you only needed to cast if the operators were different otherwise it uses default type of the object 9whatever it is set to)
<chillywilly> s/9/)/
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> s/9/(/
<dtm> root@phat-o-tha-LAN #  werd -HUP
<chillywilly> i.e., python does type coercion
<chillywilly> do you need the cast if you compare it to 100.0?
<jamest> at times yes
<dneighbo> sigh this sucks nuts
<dneighbo> chillywilly it dont BITCH if i dont cast it
<dneighbo> BUT it dont do what i want if i dont :)
<dneighbo> jamest: way around
<dneighbo> float(mystring)
<chillywilly> sup dtm
<dneighbo> get error empty string
<dneighbo> Value Error: empty string float()
ajmitch_ (ajmitch@fire.lug.net.nz) left irc: "[BX] I got sucked into /dev/null!"
<dneighbo> er
<dneighbo> Value Error: empty string for float()
<jamest> a couple of ways
<chillywilly> there's no method to convert?
<jamest> mystring and float(mystring) 
<dneighbo> i mean i could do if (mystring <> '')
<jamest> would give either None or a float
<jamest>  a and float(a) or 0
<jamest> would give either string or 0
<jamest> :)
<dneighbo> hmm now you have me confused
<dneighbo> i suppose here the right answer is say if string not ''
<dneighbo> and save me the grief
<dneighbo> now that i think about it
<dneighbo> see python is so good it forces you to do things right :)
<jamest> >>> a = None
<jamest> >>> print a and float(a)
<jamest> None
<jamest> >>> print a and float(a) or 0
<jamest> 0
<jamest> >>> a = "1"
<jamest> >>> print a and float(a)
<jamest> 1.0
<jamest> >>> print a and float(a) or 0
<jamest> 1.0
<jamest> >>>
<jamest> but I'm being a bit mean maybe
<jamest> if mystring: 
<jamest>   foo =  float(mystring) + bar
<jamest> else:
<jamest>   foo = bar

<chillywilly> ack

<chillywilly> one is enogh
<chillywilly> enough even
<dneighbo_> ok jamest
<dneighbo_> print ("FTE %d * %d/100 %d") % (fte, float(pos_rec[11]), (float(pos_rec[11])/100))
<dneighbo_> how can i make those %d 's put output like 2.2
<dneighbo_> instead of 2
<chillywilly> you use printf formatters
Action: dneighbo_ is trying to do some debugging
<chillywilly> in front of the %d
<dneighbo_> is it 2%d
<dneighbo_> or something, me always forget
Action: chillywilly does nto recall either
<chillywilly> er, not
<jamest> what are you trying to do?
<chillywilly> specify how digits pas the decimal are shown
<chillywilly> how many
<dneighbo_> yes
<dneighbo_> a %d shows 0
<dneighbo_> but the output to file shows .024
<dneighbo_> or something
<dneighbo_> i want the print w/ %d to show the decimals
<dneighbo_>         pos_rec[27] = str(fte * (float(pos_rec[11])/100))
<dneighbo_> doesnt seem to be doing what i WANT
<dneighbo_> so trying to see what values it has so made a print statement
<dneighbo_>         print ("FTE 2%d * 2%d/100 2%d") % (fte, float(pos_rec[11]), (float(pos_rec[11])/

<chillywilly> 0.2
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> 0.2%d
<chillywilly> does
<chillywilly> number.12
<dneighbo_> must be printf then not print?
<jamest> um
<jamest> it's c convention for the most part
<chillywilly> print understands printf formatting strings
<dneighbo_> yes but its been like 8 years since C
<dneighbo_> my first question was how do i do it in C :)
<chillywilly> well I just todl you dude
<jamest> %width.precision
<dneighbo_> sometimes this channel is as bad as #debian ;)
<chillywilly> you do '0.number_of_decimals_you_want%d'
<jamest> print "%4.2f" % 4.3
<dneighbo_> so is it
<chillywilly> jamest: correct width.precision
<dneighbo_> thank you :)
<chillywilly> [18:08:54] <chillywilly> width.num_digits%d
<chillywilly> :P
<jamest> misplaced % 
<chillywilly> see I wasn't lying
<jamest> :P
<chillywilly> woops
<chillywilly> you're right
<chillywilly> bad chillywilly
<jamest> we need to rename the channel
<jamest> er retopic it
<chillywilly> uh oh
<chillywilly> why?
<dneighbo_> joy that worked, you elevated back to non #debian status :)
<jamest> Welcome to GNU Enterprise.  We try to help.
<chillywilly> :D
<dneighbo_> they say business is all about benchmarks
<dneighbo_> we know the BOTTOM of help
<chillywilly> well dagnabit I would've figured out my blunder eventually
<dneighbo_> thats #debian :)
<jamest> without starting a huge debate
<chillywilly> disclaimer:
<jamest> i need forms to do dynamic menus
<jamest> now
<dneighbo_> use gpd's
<chillywilly> in the even that chillywilly tries to help, please bear in mind he's not always 100% accurate
<chillywilly> er, event
<dneighbo_> and integrate them into the menu structure
<dneighbo_> that woudl be my vote
<dneighbo_> or do you mean REALLY dynamic menus
<dneighbo_> like triggers editing them
<jamest> yes
<jamest> I'm building the internals now
<dneighbo_> well i still vote read gpd
<dneighbo_> into menu structure then allow for its manipulation
<jamest> that would be an option in what I have
<chillywilly> wtf is a gpd?
<chillywilly> gnue process definition?
<dneighbo_> gnue process definition
<dneighbo_> what navigator uses
<chillywilly> jinx
<jamest> dislcaimer
<jamest> I have a huge dealline
<chillywilly> you owe me a coke
<chillywilly> what does navigator do?
<jamest> I know this has issues with internals with forms that most people don't know about 
Action: chillywilly has not played with that
<jamest> but here is what I have now
<jamest> GMenu
<jamest>   keymapperEvent - The name of a keymapper event entry that would have the same effect as
<jamest>                  - firing
<jamest>   triggerName    - the NAMED trigger this menu item should fire upon selection
<jamest>   type           - Normal, Seperator, Dynamic
<jamest>   label          - the displayed text on the menu (& before the char that defs the alt-hotkey)
<jamest>   enabled        - is this item active
<dneighbo_> jamest i dont care WHAT you say
<jamest> the forms parser can now do 
<jamest> <menu>
<dneighbo_> im not gonna fight you out of adding a feature ive been screaming for :)
<jamest>   <menu>
<jamest>       <menu>
<jamest>     </menu>
<jamest>    </menu>
<jamest>  </menu>
<jamest> however
<jamest> this might suck
<dneighbo_> BUT i still strongly suggest you use the .gpd to read in the menu structure
<jamest> as I'm allowing gfd people to override menus
<dneighbo_> so you dont have to menus into gfd's
<jamest> dneighbo: note in my posting
<jamest> type = Dynamic
<jamest> in which case the trigger named is used to create the submenu
<chillywilly> so in designer will I be able to drag and drop menu widgets?
<dneighbo_> but as stated we need menus (for me navigator is cool, but my users want menus)
<chillywilly> and name them what I like
<jamest> the entire menu structure for forms will be in a file in gnue/etc
<dneighbo_> chillywilly eventually
<jamest> so you can do site customizations to the menu
<dneighbo_> i think desinger will let one edit gpd's
<jamest> designer will edit any GObj based tree
<dneighbo_> sigh
<chillywilly> whatever that means
<jamest> it may need told about the .gpd extension
Action: chillywilly has yet to get heavily invilved in forms (yet)
<dneighbo_> i thought that is a large part of what .gpd was
<dneighbo_> i.e. instead of gnue/etc menu structure
<chillywilly> er, using them I mean
<jamest> dneighbo: that's a process definition
<jamest> file - save 
<jamest> isn't a biz process
<jamest> however
<jamest> via a dynamic menu entry 
<jamest> you can add a gpd extension
<jamest> and you can put as many of these as you like into your sites gnue/etc/forms-menu
<jamest> also
<chillywilly> you ever commit that text version of thr forms ref? ;)
<chillywilly> pretty please
<jamest> this structure would also be used internally by things like designer
<dneighbo_> ok i guess im thinking
<jamest> that have nothing to do with process flow
<dneighbo_> gnue/etc is fine for file/save etc
<dneighbo_> but you should really be doing customizations via gpd's
<dneighbo_> unless its something odd
<jamest> dneighbo: if i want a form to have
<jamest> file
<dneighbo_> i mean part of me says i could care less if the other menu items (that would go in gnue/etc) were hard coded
<jamest>  print normal
<jamest>  print abnormal
<jamest>  print your mama
<dneighbo_> yes
<jamest> and I only want this in one form
<dneighbo_> i just dont want to advocate a system of doing menus in gnue/etc
<jamest> you'd make it part of the biz process?
<dneighbo_> ok i think you said soemthign that hit home
<dneighbo_> if i want it in the framework (on EVERY form) it shoudl go in gnue/etc
<jamest> right
<dneighbo_> if i want it on only SOME forms it should be in a gpd
<jamest> that is what I'm saying
<jamest> and if you want your gpd in your menu system
<jamest> you'd add a single entry in gnue/etc/forms-menu
<dtm> hi guys.
<dneighbo_> yes
<dtm> dneighbo: werd.
<jamest> and it wouldn't be in designer
<dneighbo_> works for me
<dneighbo_> hi dtm 
<jamest> eventually you may wnat it in designer
<jamest> so you'd add it to gnue/etc/designer-menu
<jamest> now back to my question
<jamest> :)
<dtm> hey have you guys ever heard of a piece of software called Noah, which is designed to support associations and NPOs?  
<jamest> chillywilly: i will do ASAP, i promise
<jamest> i was going to nest menu's like above
<chillywilly> :D
<chillywilly> I love you
<jamest> however I want to alter existing structures
<chillywilly> I love you all
<chillywilly> group hug!
<dtm> i love you, chilly
<dtm> i love you guys!!
<jamest> so in form a i need to replace the save
<jamest> add a line under it called save differently
<chillywilly> where's jc at?
<jamest> add a line under that called save somewhat differently
<jamest> this doesn't really lend itself to a nested <menu> structure
<jamest> as if we have a 
<jamest> a menu system that gets deeply nested
<jamest> by default
<dtm> I dont know if these guys are the authors or merely resellers of NOAH, but here's a url:  http://www.jlsystems.com/e-noah.htm
<dtm> I didn't know if that type of thing falls under gnue's umbrella at all, or in its short term goals.
<jamest> then my form need to add an entry after Tools - Foobulators - Phase I Foobulation Units - ReDeFooBulator
<dtm> NOAH seems to sort of be to association membership management, as ERP is to a medium to large corp.
<jamest> i dont want to create a nest with all that crap in it
<chillywilly> ouch!
<jamest> in my gfd
<chillywilly> my foobulator is broken!
Action: dtm defoobulates chillywilly
<chillywilly> dtm: stop ntouching my foobulator
<jamest> instead I was wondering about doing this
<dtm> a;sljdl;
<chillywilly> lol
Action: dtm hungers ......  for food
<jamest> location="tools.foobulators.phase1" leader="redefoobulator"
<dtm> mom has something in the crockpot; i dont know what it is but it smells like pizza and so i want pizza!  but this is black goop!
<chillywilly> ask her what it is
<jamest> er
<dneighbo_> who
<dneighbo_> whoa
<dneighbo_> why woudl you create a nest in your gfd?
<dneighbo_> i thought we were saying if its in ALL forms its gnue/etc
<jamest> location="tools.foobulators.phase1" leader="redefoobulator" name="eXtremefoobulator2000" label="eXtreme Foobulatoin" help="More foobulation than the church will allow"
<dneighbo_> if its in some forms its in .gpd
<dneighbo_> why would you ever make it in a .gfd
<dneighbo_> only time a gfd should touch the menu
<dneighbo_> would be to dyanmically alter it
<jamest> all forms in gnue/etc
<jamest> however i have a case now
<jamest> where they want numerous save optoins (don't even ask)
<dneighbo_> is it for one form or all forms
<jamest> this is one form
<dneighbo_> if its one form it shoudl be in gnue/etc
<dneighbo_> if its one form
<dneighbo_> should make a gpd
<jamest> ????
<jamest> that doesn't make sense
<dneighbo_> and have the form call the gpd
<dneighbo_> um
<jamest> it's like a custom menu for an app
<dneighbo_> i dont think menu structures belong in forms
<jamest> not a process description
<dneighbo_> i think you are tied on process description verbiage
<jamest> and gpd is the basis of workflow
<dneighbo_> um yes and no
<dneighbo_> gpd could do some workflow stuff or provide hooks
<dneighbo_> but its made to do what you are saying
<dneighbo_> it can call outside apps
<dneighbo_> reports
<dneighbo_> other forms
<dneighbo_> etc etc
<jamest> i don't want it to call other forms
<jamest> i want it to call custom triggers defined in this one form
<dneighbo_> i just think it will be vile to have menus in gfd's
<jamest> that manipulate the data in the form in a specific mannor
<dneighbo_> gpd's are supposed to be able to do that
<dneighbo_> gpd is supposed to be able to call triggers
Action: jamest is stressed
<jamest> i have < 3 days to go live with this
<jamest> sigh
<dneighbo_> maybe im way wrong but doing what you are saying to me says please then lets throw gpd away
<dneighbo_> as gpd is not workflow
<dneighbo_> it was merely going to be an easier way to call a workflow engine
<dneighbo_> and publish menus based on roles etc
<dneighbo_> but i guess you should talk to jcater
<dneighbo_> im sure he will probably agree with you
<jamest> so you'd have your master gpd contain form specific alteration?
<dneighbo_> though i think thats bad design to do same concept intwo places
<dneighbo_> jamest: no silly
<dneighbo_> concept of self
<dneighbo_> so you could have a form call call to load the gpd
<dneighbo_> er let me restate that
<dneighbo_> what ever form has focus is self
<dneighbo_> so in the gpd you called some trigger for a form and used self
<dneighbo_> it would perform it on the form that had focus
<dneighbo_> i.e. your gpd wouldnt have HARDCODED form name
<dneighbo_> rather self.dosomethign()
<dneighbo_> if that makes sense
<jamest> ok
<jamest> now this menu entry executes a trigger that was to be defined in the form
<dneighbo_> but you coudl have it CALL hardcoded things if you so desired
<jamest> you'd move that out of the form?
<jamest> and into the gpd?
<dneighbo_> why
<jamest> well

#gnuenterprise: mode change '+o neilt' by ChanServ!ChanServ@services.
<jamest> it seems nuts to put logic in the form
<chillywilly> sup neilt
<dneighbo_> depends on the logic :)
<neilt> hello all
<dneighbo_> but yes if was NON form specific trigger put in gpd or shared triggers
<jamest> take field a, b, c, d perform this alteratoin, store in field e and save
<chillywilly> form.troutslap(dneighbo)
<jamest> it's dead on form specific
<jamest> also
<dneighbo_> right so put that trigger in the form
<dneighbo_> not the gpd
<neilt> i have just changed my whole thought process on gcd classes :)
<jamest> triggers will be able to enable, disable menu entried
<jamest> also
<jamest> designer menus would migrate to this
<chillywilly> neilt: er, why?
<jamest> so you'd want your entire designer menu in a pgd?
<jamest> gpd?
Action: jamest is getting confused
<dneighbo_> i think so
<chillywilly> neilt: we should do ODL it handles object relationships, exceptions, and other goodies
<dneighbo_> er wait designer menus i would see like the gnue/etc ones
<dneighbo_> though i see no reason for not supporting gpds there if so desire 
<jamest> i think you misunderstand my purpose
<dneighbo_> once again maybe gpd is wrong name for it
<chillywilly> neilt: it is also pretty simplified and not too complex...I think andrewm wanted to do harder things like public, prvate, protected, ....
<jamest> i'm making a menu system that can be dynamically defined and exposable to triggers
<jamest> that any gnue app could use
<dneighbo_> right
<dneighbo_> im not denying that
<jamest> now ahving RBAC on this might be nice
<dneighbo_> im saying that most of the time you arent going to want to define things dynamically 100%
<chillywilly> neilt: but anyway, what's your thought process now?
<dneighbo_> that is where you use gpd
<dneighbo_> i hate irc
<dneighbo_> i think face to face adn white board would have this solved in minutes
<jamest> not really 
<neilt> ahh, because i have been trained now
<dneighbo_> again consult jcater and let him give you input
Action: dneighbo_ is used to being misunderstood
<jamest> as I can't see "save" needing rbac
Action: dneighbo_ still thinks blocks are wasted elements :)
<jamest> but I can see forms or designer being able to disable it
<jamest> sigh
Action: chillywilly is away: supper
<jamest> there are no docs on gpd's
<dneighbo_> yes there are
<dneighbo_> um....
<jamest> gack!
<jamest> dude
<jamest> gpd sample

<jamest>       </step>
<jamest>     </process>
<jamest> that is not a menu entry
<jamest> that's a multistep process
<jamest> where can I see docs
Action: jamest really does have a deathline approaching rapidly
<dneighbo_> um they must have been emailed
<jamest> fsck
Action: jamest may just hack a custom gfclient w/ extra menu entires
<dneighbo_> as it was skleins original proposal that was used to start it
<jamest> as this is turning into something well beyond anything I can do in the time alloted
<dneighbo_> do what you think is best like i said i think jcater will agree with you that <menu> should coexist with gpd
<dneighbo_> i tend to disagree
<dneighbo_> but nothing new there
<dneighbo_> i would even be ok with that really if gpd's are read to make menus
<jamest> um
<jamest> anyone have docs?
<dneighbo_> anyone know date time functions in python
<dneighbo_> how can i do equiv of now()
<jamest> um
<jamest> i think i have that 
<jamest> just a sec
<dneighbo_> and make it formatted to human being date time?
<dneighbo_> or
<dneighbo_> begin = now()
<dneighbo_> end = now()
<dneighbo_> print pretty_time(end-begin)
<jamest> http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-time.html
<dneighbo_> hmm their sample doesnt even work :)
<dneighbo_> guess my version of ptyon is different
<jamest> what are you wanting?
<dneighbo_> nevermind clock()
<dneighbo_> is perfect for windows
<dneighbo_> clock()
<dneighbo_> do stuff
[19:00] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<dneighbo_> print "It took %2.10f to do stuff" % clock()
<chillywilly> localtime()
<chillywilly> returns a time tuple
<chillywilly> clock() does CPU time in seconds
<chillywilly> asctime()
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> asctime(tuple) does a nice string
<chillywilly> representation

<dtm> hey guys.  openoffice.org is a great escape from the evil empoire
<dtm> empire
<dtm> i highly recommend their products
<dtm> they can **WRITE** M$ Word, etc, formats
<jcater> dude
<jamest> yip
<dtm> word 95, 2000, XP, etc
<jcater> if it was FreeOffice, I would
<jcater> but that whole Open nomicer just ruins it for me

<dtm> jamest: yeah i have 256M ram on my powermac 8500 and once it starts it's ok but i'm not a performance minded fewl
<jamest> oh i user staroffice, but on my multiuser machines it's a bitch
<jamest> i user?
<jamest> i robot!
<jamest> s/user/use
<dtm> HEH.
<dtm> why a bitch?
<jamest> cause I've seen a single ppt file cause a staroffice sessoin to grow to 196MB
<jamest> this is uncool on a system that has lots of people logged on 24/7
<dtm> i wonder what the difference is between their multiuser installation and single user installation
<jamest> not much
<jamest> the multiuser install requires that each user install from it
<dtm> no comprendo because what could there be other than one set of bins and libs, and then global or ~user confs?
<dtm> so it does more than just like how gimp does it?
<jamest> which copies some bins into $HOME/Office52 dir
<dtm> gimp has an initial setup mode somewhat
<jamest> along w/ other stuff
<jamest> the killer is the resources it sucks
<dtm> sure
<dtm> so do you have to run an installer per useR?
<jamest> yes
<jamest> i setup a script to do it the first time a user attempts to run staroffice
<dtm> i wonder why not do it like gimp
<dtm> without bothering the user but for one "yes/no" question
<jcater> dtm: so when the StarOffice is released based on that code, it's easier to enforce licenses :)
<dtm> hmmmmmmmmmmm
<dtm> how would that be? :)
<dtm> easier?
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> I don't work for Sun
<jcater> :)
<jcater> that was simply my guess :)
<jamest> honestly 
<jcater> btw, anyone had much experience w/WordPerfect/Linux?
<jamest> i think multiuser was a hack
<jamest> and it's flaky as hell IMHO
<jcater> I tend to agree
<dtm> no but i had experience administrating multiuser Applixware and staroffice in 1999 at VA
<jcater> as StarOffice was really meant to be a boxed product iirc
<dtm> jcater: you mean standalone single user?
<jcater> yeah
<dtm> Applix Anyware is a neat idea.
<jcater> as in CompUSA single user
<dtm> afaik, Sun has a similar model for staroffice
<dtm> with a server side backend and a distributable java based frontend
<dtm> ASP model
Action: jamest shudders
<jamest> WordPerfect Java Edition
<dtm> hey, what a way to encourage hardware sales?  ;)
<dtm> hahehhe
<dtm> you'll buy a 200 user license for Staroffice and they'll throw in an Enterprise 10000 to go with it
<dtm> right?
<jamest> :)
<jamest> soon they might not be able to give them away :)
<dtm> whoops, back to the mainframe model again.  hey everybody pitch in and move the IT industry back over there again.  Put your backs into it!!
Action: jamest had a battle getting linux in the dept
<dtm> jamest: why battle?
<jamest> resistance to unproven tech
<jamest> vs windows/solaris
<jamest> now
<dtm> sheesh
<jcater> I started out with BSD
<dtm> well Solaris is alright though
<jamest> this was years ago
<jcater> as it was hard to say it was unproven :)
<jcater> then moved to linux
<jamest> now one of those people asked me the other day if we should dump solaris
<jamest> and we're looking into a win4lin setup for windows apps
<dtm> oh yay
<jamest> so that windows runs on a central server and is served to those only when needed
<dtm> well win4lin is alright i guess
<dtm> i've read about their app server a bit, a while ago
<jcater> win4lin rocks my socks
<dtm> i met them at LWCE long ago
<jamest> what was your impression
<dtm> well  i just met the CFO and i think someone in sales, and they were cool
<dtm> good personalities , pretty young
<jamest> it's a _small_ company
<dtm> looked like in their thirties or so
<jamest> has to be
<dtm> yeah and they were outside the main pavillion or whatever you call it
<jamest> their PBX system was like
<dtm> oh have you been onsite/
<dtm> ?
<jamest> To speak with foobeana in sales press 1
<jamest> To speak with Barfeena in accounting press 2
<dtm> what's that?
<dtm> oh
<dtm> i see
<jamest> sorry
<dtm> you called em
<jamest> their phone system
<dtm> oh it referenced them by personal name? :)
<jcater> win4lin is actually based on the old SCO Merge
<jamest> yip
<dtm> oh?
<dtm> what did SCO do?
<dtm> i'm not aware of this
<dtm> did they buy a buncha IP from sco?
<dtm> is that how they got started?
<jcater> I think so
<jcater> sco had a unix platform, an X server for Windows, a Windows server or Unix, and Tarantella, some Client/Server model
<jcater> the middle 2 were actually bought from Vision
<jcater> but Caldera bought the Unix division
<jcater> and Tarantella, IIRC, branched off into another company
<jcater> btu I always wondered what happened to Merge
<jcater> then a month ago I bought win4lin
<jcater> and the install scripts still internally called it Merge
<jcater> ;)
<jcater> and that's a 2 minute recent history of SCO
<jcater> I could go back to pre-'95 if you'd like
<dtm> excellent
<dtm> hm.
<jcater> before 1995, SCO was 20% owned by Microsoft
<jcater> :)(
<dtm> heh
<jcater> bet most didn't know that
<dtm> yeah i researched XENIX in about 1996-1997, couldn't find anything
<dtm> oh yeah i knew that
<jcater> the Xenix code was from MS iirc
<dtm> and that XENIX was owned by M$
<dtm> XENIX was the evolved product of UNIX(tm), right?
<dtm> and then that became unixware(tm)?
<jcater> unixware was Novell for a while
<jcater> then SCO bought from Novell
<jcater> UnixWare was planned to phase out OpenServer
<dtm> yeah but as far as the product evolution, unix became xenix which became unixware, right?
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> well
<dtm> oh boy  well maybe i just need to reread my postmortem history docs? :)
<jcater> the original SCO Unices were based on Xenix too
<jcater> but Unixware was a late purchase for SCO
<dtm> purchase from novell, huh?
<dtm> what the heck did openserver come from
<jcater> SCO Unix 4.2.3.x grew up into OpenServer
<jcater> SCO Unix 4.2.5.x aka OpenServer
<jcater> err, 4.2.4.x grew up into OpenServer
<jcater> and SCO Unix iirc was based on SysV
<jcater> um
<jcater> that's the point that jcater entered the Unix markey
<jcater> market
<jcater> so I can't go further back w/history :)
<jcater> my first *nix experience was with SCO
<jcater> which completely ruined me
<dtm> you poor guy
<dtm> and they had their own smb server too
<dtm> must have been awful to try to make that work
<dtm> due to M$
<dtm> ;alkjds;
<jcater> um
<jcater> I tried once'
<jcater> and installed samba
<jcater> their SCO Advanced File Server (iirc)
<jcater> was a bitch to get working
<jcater> and it was per-user licensing
Action: jcater shivers at the thought of that product
Action: jcater is still shivering

<dtm> well i'm impressed that you read a bunch of those allbusiness.com links
<dtm> that stuff is the Schmidt.
<dtm> most of it is pretty brief and concise
<dtm> and short
<dtm> and to the point
<dtm> and small
<dtm> and not big
<dtm> nor lengthy
<chillywilly> I skimmed a little
<chillywilly> the links you had in your email I read
<chillywilly> (before)
<dtm> you should read them all; i read about 90% of the links out of that whole business plan directory in < 1hr
<chillywilly> what is the outline for your business plan?
<dtm> prolly like 20 mins
<dtm> standard outline
<dtm> same as in those links
<dtm> more or less
<chillywilly> oh, ok
<dtm> i'm done with the first 1/2 or so which is considered the Executive Summary
<chillywilly> you create a budget and stuff?
<dtm> no; the only budget is our personal budget
<dtm> which is ok because we're a flow-through org
<dtm> there's no corporation
<dtm> so that means there are no organizational profits
<chillywilly> well, I wouldn't want outside investors anyway
<dtm> not officially
<chillywilly> why should I even need any
<chillywilly> ?
<dtm> there could be a shared bank account
<dtm> no you dont need any
<chillywilly> right now we're doing all of this for Free/free ;)
<dtm> yeah well if you wanna do justice to yourself, your family, gnue, and FD then you'd better write a bidness Plan :)
<chillywilly> another factor though would be that GNUe needs to mature a little more and get some real solutions ;)
<chillywilly> FD can go to hell
<dtm> i'm starting to capitalize it because it's not just a plan; it's a living document known as The Plan
<chillywilly> oops
<dtm> hahahaha
<chillywilly> did I say that out loud?
<dtm> you sillyfool
<chillywilly> guess that wasn't nice
<dtm> ok well focus on a solution rather than a problem
<chillywilly> FD is a emocracy in sheeps clothing ;)
<chillywilly> er democracy
<chillywilly> we are....actually
<dtm> start on a Plan! ;)
<chillywilly> I would not wan to do something grandose like FD
<chillywilly> it's unrealistic
<dtm> hey i was thinking of being some sort of bizdev advisor for open projects
<chillywilly> that would be cool
<dtm> just to help with something, as opposed to nothing
<dtm> especially for people who have nothing
<dtm> coz i'm not an expert
<chillywilly> can anyone reach oss.sgi.com?
<dtm> doesn't look good
<dtm> your kernel is sunk!
<chillywilly> nah
<dtm> it's dead in the water!
<chillywilly> it's down like this once in a while
<chillywilly> jheyI
<dtm> oh well you'll never reboot again!
<chillywilly> I am going to compile the preempt patch
<dtm> what's that for/
<dtm> ?
<dtm> preempt what?
<dtm> the whole kernel?
<chillywilly> then my kernel will kick your kernel's ass
<dtm> d0yh
<dtm> yeah they're toast past Exoduse
<dtm> yeah they're toast past Exodus
<chillywilly> yes, it's a patch to preempt the kernel and let user processes run
<dtm> in Santa Clara where i used to work
<dtm> huh
<chillywilly> makes things run faster
<dtm> you mean for user processes to preempt the kernel?!
<chillywilly> yes!
<dtm> tha fuk?
<dtm> intellestink
<dtm> good gravy
<chillywilly> reduces latency
<chillywilly> I just wanna give it a try once
<dtm> that cna't include the whoel kernel though, right?
<chillywilly> should be fun :)
<dtm> doesn't that just mean that it preempts all other processes?
<dtm> or what
<chillywilly> there's certain parts where the kernel sits in a spin lock
<dtm> or does this only apply to certain kinds of processes or operations
<chillywilly> kernel processes can be preempted in favor of a user process to get better thoughput
<chillywilly> reduce latency
<chillywilly> etc.
Bill_H (~chamilto@ga-cmng-u1-c3a-384.cmngga.adelphia.net) left #gnuenterprise ("Yawn! Tired...not bored").
<chillywilly> the guy who wrote the patch says he gets a 200% improvement so I thought I'd give it a shot and see if things ran a bit faster
<dtm> improvement on what
<chillywilly> I forget what it was, maybe it was latency
<chillywilly> that he "measured"
<chillywilly> http://www.tech9.net/rml/linux/
<chillywilly> read about it there home skillet
Action: jcater is back (gone 00:17:43)
<jcater> gosh darn it, don't know what he measured... but it's obviously better (just look at those numbers)
<chillywilly> heh
<jcater> ;)
<chillywilly> there's a
<jcater> j/k
<chillywilly> well int heory a preemptable kernel should perform better anyway
<chillywilly> and I am adventurous enough to try it
<chillywilly> so so sue me
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> anyway, if you visit the page
<chillywilly> you;l see that he measured latency in the kernel
<chillywilly> he has a patch that does the stats
<jcater> lol
<chillywilly> so my guess was right
<jcater> looks interesting
<chillywilly> Preemption Latency Measurement Tool
<chillywilly> http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/preempt-stats/v2.4/preempt-stats-rml-2.4.17-2.patch
<chillywilly> you get to deal with the sam fun stuff as SMP machines do
<chillywilly> (when hacking a preemptive kernel)
<chillywilly> jpy!
<chillywilly> er, joy
<chillywilly> http://www.kerneltrap.com/article.php?sid=328&mode=thread&order=0
<chillywilly> there's cool links about it under 'Relative links:'
<chillywilly> I think preemption allows you to get hard real-time processing
<chillywilly> which is also cool for embedded systems
<chillywilly> basically the idle (kernel) task gets preempted by higher priority processes
<chillywilly> afaict
<chillywilly> this should be fun
<chillywilly> :)
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> that was an interesting article
Action: jcater is gonna try it on his office workstation tomorrow
<jcater> what's the worst that can happen?

<soulstompp> but so that I have something to show tommorow does anyone have screen shots
<chillywilly> well maybe jcater can speak up here
<chillywilly> he knows a bit more about this than I
<soulstompp> the other half is probably just the rpm sticking things where it shouldn't

<jamest_> um

<jamest_> not really
<jamest_> we both got busy
<jamest_> morning jcater
<jcater> morning
<jamest_> i switched navigator to spawn forms instead of system call them
<jamest_> that way it doesn't block while a form is running
<jamest_> but I have not commited it 
<jamest_> i wantted to make sure you didn't have a reason for using system 
<jamest_> also was wondering if you'd looked into having it add to windows start menu
<jamest_> oooo
<jamest_> and the -u web doesn't seem to work, was it completed
Action: jamest_ is playing with navigator in case you can't tell
<dneighbo> > Has anyone made a techonlogy compare paper between
<dneighbo> > SapDB and other Databases ? especially  we are interested 
<dneighbo> > here in a compare against Oracle.
<dneighbo> A comparison SAP DB <--> Oracle (SQL) was prepared, will now be put
<dneighbo> into a nice english html-form and be available in March.
<dneighbo>  
<dneighbo> Elke
<dneighbo> SAP Labs Berlin
<dneighbo> for you jcater ;)
<dneighbo> jamest_ -u web used to work
<dneighbo> i.e. well it 'kind' of worked
<jamest_> well
<dneighbo> didnt segfault out but wasnt fully functional
<dneighbo> iirc
<jamest_> it only pulls up first menu list
<dneighbo> ok thats what it was doing for me too :)
<jamest_> then gives a can't find url 
<jamest_> on any click
<jamest_> also
<jamest_> it's borked on windows
<jamest_> :)
<dneighbo> didnt try on windows, but i will take your word :)\
<jamest_> but so is forms in general
<jamest_> really, really borked
<jamest_> try running it sometime 
<jcater> jamest_: re the navigator spawning a new instance: that was my plan all along, I just didn't have time to  do it (the spawn was a quick hack)
<jamest_> ok
<jamest_> then i'll commit it
<jamest_> in a bit
<jcater> btw, re the -u web interface
<jcater> wxPython isn't playing nice
<jcater> I'm trying to trap the click, but apparently there's a bug in wx
<jcater> I sent an email to wxPython
<jcater> and the response was "you are doing it wrong, I'm sure... look at the examples"
<jcater> it's one friggin line!!!!
<jcater> how can I get one line wrong that was copied from the examples
<jcater> sigh
Action: jcater digresses

<dneighbo> jcater / jamest_ (kde users): have you all used kivio? (or whatever visio klone kde kreated?
Action: dneighbo saw some screen shots and it looked decent, but wondered the functionality
<jcater> I have it installed, but have not actually used it
<dneighbo> dia is nice but you cant to PROFESSIONAL stuff with it
<dneighbo> read you cant make things 'purdy' for management
<jcater> dneighbo: you looked at the poll results?
Action: jcater is surprised how many ppl use MySQL for business data
<jcater> and how many "others" there are
<dneighbo> jcater: i really suspect most people consider dynamic db driven web applications as 'business apps'
<dneighbo> thus the mysql numbers
<jcater> I wondered the same thing
<dneighbo> btw: most linux folks IN MY HUMBLE OPINION dont have lots of business experience 
<dneighbo> and so mysql is to me like access
<dneighbo> a good 'starter' db
<jcater> poor souls
<dneighbo> and lots of folks doing first business consulting etc
<dneighbo> pick it up cause its easy and the BIG feature sell is its xplatform
<dneighbo> natively
<dneighbo> not through cygwin
<dneighbo> the other number im kind of suprised
<dneighbo> as i think we have all the BIG ones listed
<dneighbo> wow looking at numbers
<dneighbo> im impressed to see 11 oracle
Action: jcater wonders how many don't know what the backend db is (so are thinking SQL Ledger and not Postgres)
<dneighbo> not suprised that oracle has market share mind you
<jcater> (just using SQL Ledger as an example)
<dneighbo> suprised that Oracle (highly expensive) users are looking at free software ERP
<dneighbo> i.e. like you :)
<jcater> it shouldn't be that surprising, really
<dneighbo> er what i mean is i think we see an IT trent
<dneighbo> er trend
<dneighbo> shops are sick of paying high dollar levies to be treated like crap
<dneighbo> so the higher the price tag and more shit you are treated more likely you are to come in search of FS
<jcater> well, it's no secret that IT budgets have been slashed, yet the technological needs have not shrunken at all
<dneighbo> i dont know how oracle treats its customers
<dneighbo> but i know it is expensive :)
<jcater> <Oracle Salesman> "but expensive is relative"
<jcater> <Oracle Salesman> "it's about value"
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> <deke2os> "im game, if you throw in some lube to make it a little easier to 'take'"
<dneighbo> ya right
<dneighbo> btw : did we ever make a branch so we can patch pg issues on windows/odbc/db2
<dneighbo> and make a 0.1.3 or whatever release?
<jcater> it trips me out the consultants who we bring in who think the products they supply should be supplied at a cost relative to the about of money we save over the long run
<jcater> instead of how much the product is actually worth
<dneighbo> yeah dont think it would be justice if every product was priced this way
<dneighbo> toilet paper for example
<dneighbo> i mean w/o it, lets face it you would be buying a lot more underwear (assuming you are into personal hygeine)
<jcater> that's typically the type of argument we get
<dneighbo> say underwear is 2.00 a pair and now you have to buy like 40 pair a year instead of 2 pair
<dneighbo> thats a saving of what 78 dollars
<dneighbo> if you go throw a roll of tp a week
<dneighbo> thats 52 rolls
<jcater> so, we will charge you regular price for the toilet paper, but the holder is gonna cost $140
<jcater> so, that's a ROI of 18 months
<dneighbo> so that so you should be paying like 2 bucks a roll
<dneighbo> instead of the .33 cents a roll you pay now (assuming you can get 4 rolls for 1.00 on sale)
<jcater> plus, let's not forget that our toulet paper holder is not a perfect product... expect to replace it every three years
<jcater> however, if you sign by March 1
<jcater> we will include replacement in your Support Contract
<dneighbo> yes toilet paper is bad example as its really not REUSABLE
<dneighbo> the prime example woudl be a tooth brush
<jcater> hehe
<dneighbo> instead of 1.00 for a brush that lasts a year
<dneighbo> you pay 200 for a toothbrush
<jcater> we should get PSU to write up a "toothbrush consultant" example
<dneighbo> as brushing your teeth saves on average 2 cavities a year
<jcater> to illustrate our point :)
<dneighbo> and cavities cost 800 to fill
<dneighbo> so 200 for a brush that saves you 1600 is an INCREDIBLE deal
<dneighbo> then the 500 for the toothpaste contract
<dneighbo> thats where the REAL value is
<dneighbo> i mean for 700 you will have your money back in less than 6 mos
<dneighbo> how incredible is that?
<dneighbo> what is funny is anyone reading this would probably die laughing
<dneighbo> but this is common thing in IT industry
<jcater> but it's SOOOO true
<jcater> what I love
<jcater> is their toothbrushes
<jcater> require their own special "holder"
<jcater> custom installed, of course
<dneighbo> hmm that is a VAR thing
<dneighbo> the vendor just makes sure his toothpaste is incompatiable with other vendors brushes
<dneighbo> so you are locked into that toothpaste contract
<dneighbo> or forced to buy a new brush
<jcater> you can't reuse your existing holders ("I know the slots are the same size; but ours it calibrated especially for our toothbrushes.  Also, who's to say your holder can withstand the extra load")
<dneighbo> yeah crest's holders just dont 'scale' well
<jcater> ooooo
<dneighbo> i mean a family of 5 or 6 and your screwed
<jcater> let's not forget "user training"
<dneighbo> and floss
<dneighbo> thats high performance dental care
<dneighbo> you pay top dollar for floss
<jcater> yes
<jcater> and one member of the family will need to be flown to our "flossing seminar"
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> this wouldnt be so funny
<jcater> BUT it's in Miami this year
<dneighbo> if it werent a comparable analogy to it industry
<jcater> so what member wouldn't mind going to Miami
<dneighbo> jcater: this month i went to dentist
<dneighbo> and for only 4,500 i can get crest 'reach' toothbrush certified
<dneighbo> with that cert i am like 80% less likely to have ginvitis which is a huge value
<dneighbo> peridontial disease is SO costly 
<dneighbo> i can hardly wait
<dneighbo> of course the joke here is that 
<dneighbo> the toothbrush vendor regularly is able to sell brush, paste and floss to folks with dentures :)
<jcater> :)
<jcater> of course, the vendor has a 20% stake in the Denture company
<jcater> "to spread his risk"
Action: dneighbo thinks that perhaps i should make a small list of things that are 'cheap' but highly useful
<dneighbo> then see if they have some 'money saving' value like the toothbrush
<jcater> "If VARs sold Toothbrushes..."
<dneighbo> then write up a little mini 
<dneighbo> "what if the rest of the world operated like a software company..."
<dneighbo> we ahvent even relaly touched on the 'monoply' implications here :)
<dneighbo> just on the no value ones :)
<jcater> yip
<dneighbo> btw: i do quote and word of the day
<dneighbo> the quote today.... (so fitting)
<dneighbo> "As long as people will accept crap, it will be financially profitable to dispense it." -- Dick Cavett
<dneighbo> read people wouldnt buy a 200 dollar tooth brush and a 500 toothpaste contract
<dneighbo> they will buy millions of dollars in software license fees
<dneighbo> though i think slowly people are stopping the trend
<dneighbo> whether it be because of reduced budgets or waking up and smelling the coffee

<moi_je> hi everybody
<moi_je> I try to start gfdesigner. It brings only Missing GNUe config fileDB000:. What can i do?
<dneighbo> go to where the sample.gnue.conf file is
<dneighbo> and do
<chillywilly> take the sample gnue.conf file ans chage it to your liking
<dneighbo> cp sample.gnue.conf gnue.conf
<dneighbo> chillywilly there should be no chagnes to gnue.conf
<dneighbo> it should pretty much work out of box
<chillywilly> my bad
<dneighbo> i.e. just copy the sample
<chillywilly> connections.conf
<chillywilly> hey, anyone know how to read from the parallel port in dos?
<dneighbo> chillywilly : you can customize gnue.conf but not recommended unless you know what you are doing or have a need you want addressed specifically :)
<dneighbo> yeah install linux
<chillywilly> fewl
<chillywilly> this is a work machine
<chillywilly> I want to crack the software so we don't have to use the stupid dongle that you have to put on the parallel port
<chillywilly> I think they have the db username and password in the dongle
<chillywilly> they use watcom sql engine
<moi_je> dneighbo: I seem to have already both files connections.conf and gnue.conf
<chillywilly> are there python drivers for that/.

<jamest_> you running ok now?
<moi_je> jamest_:i was just able to start the first sample with gfclient. Nothing special. Now i am fighting to start a complex example
<jamest_> ok
<moi_je> to use gfclient with postgresql how can i specify the driver?
<jamest_> in your connections.conf
<jamest_> you define your database types
<jamest_> with names inside the []
<jamest_> [foo]
<jamest_> for instance
<jamest_> then in the gfd file you have datasource lines
<jamest_> part of which read database="foo"
<jamest_> or
<jamest_> you can embed <database> tags inside the gfd
<jamest_> file itself
<jamest_> i don't recall the <database> tag format exactly
<jamest_> but it's in the forms tech_ref file in the doc directory
<moi_je> jamest_: i found the connections.conf file and there is as provider pypgsql. Maybe the problem is there. Do you know what should be written as provider?
<moi_je> ok i check the tech_ref file

<chillywilly> hrrrm
<jcater> not sure the differences in their difference sql servers
<chillywilly> well this app that I have on our work laptop uses watcom sql v. 4.0
<chillywilly> there's a dll that is the odmc driver
<chillywilly> I tried to use the little command line utility to connect but I don't know what username and password it accepts ;)
<chillywilly> from dos
<chillywilly> I was playing with it from dos
<chillywilly> s/odmc/odbc
<chillywilly> cool

<chillywilly> this may work
<chillywilly> does the sybase driver support SQL Anywhere?
<chillywilly> hrrrm
<chillywilly> isn't this their main db server?
<jcater> um
<jcater> Sybase ASE (Adaptive Server Enterprise)
Action: jcater thinks that's just a name change, though
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> as they still call the "design" software "SQL Anywhere Studio"
<chillywilly> well watcom turned into sql anywhere
<jcater> http://www.sybase.com/products/databaseservers
<chillywilly> uhuh
<chillywilly> but I dunno how I can get the username and password that the inspection software uses to connect to the db
<jcater> dunno
<chillywilly> I cna start up the engine using one of the other command line tools
<chillywilly> but when I use the little sql client it braks at me
<chillywilly> er, barks
<chillywilly> btw, I was looking at some code in common and was wondering what GObj is exactly?
<chillywilly> just a generic GNUe object?
<jcater> just a generic object 
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> that can be expressed as XML
<chillywilly> uhuh
<chillywilly> would it be cool if geas could store GObjs?
<jcater> um
<jcater> not sure
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> well, cool, yeah
<jcater> but not sure of usefulness
<chillywilly> well from what I can tell all that's really in there is triggers and the xml output/input ability
<chillywilly> what derives from GObj?
<jcater> there's a few other convenience functions in there
<jcater> but that's basically what it's for
<jcater> um
<jcater> GFForm
<jcater> GFBlock
<jcater> GFEntry
<jcater> GFBox
<jcater> ...
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> would it be useful if all business objects on the app serverwere GObjs?
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> you are giving me a headache :)
<jcater> I haven't given that much thought
<chillywilly> or if you could transparently get persistence of GObjs
<chillywilly> ;P
<jcater> well, the only persistance I see us needing is storing the objects in their corresponding XML file
<chillywilly> why does GObj remind me so much of GObject in the new glib?
<jcater> so the point of GObj is already to provide transparent persistence via xml
<jcater> I suppose
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> ok, you see that 4suite server?
<chillywilly> they store everything as xml docs
<chillywilly> provide a bunch of protocols
<chillywilly> and do distributed transactions
<chillywilly> it looked cool
<jcater> ok
<chillywilly> not that I am saying that we should borrow it, just stating it was interesting ;)
<chillywilly> http://4suite.org
<chillywilly> it's a python thing
<chillywilly> so, does having GObjs witht he ability to output xml help you generate forms? Is that how you use it?
<jcater> basically, yeah
<jcater> I've seen 4suite, but am very hesitant when it comes to 
<jcater> basing our products off of someone else's
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> I agree
<chillywilly> just stating that it might contain some nice ideas
<chillywilly> design ideas anyway
<chillywilly> I wouldn't really want to use someone else's app server
<chillywilly> plus it wouldn't be any fun ;)
<chillywilly> maybe I should concentrate on an ODMG python binding to store any type of python object
<chillywilly> I dunno
<chillywilly> anyway, GObj just kinda caught my eye
<chillywilly> think about it, lemme know if anything smacks you upside the head ;)

<jamest> how official is it?

<jcater> um
<jcater> what do you mean?
<jcater> how official?
<jamest> i mean is it still just a toy

<jcater> well, in derek's, I think so
<jamest> we've never released it IIRC
<jcater> but I think it's quite useful
<jamest> but jamest like
<jamest> it's very usefull
Action: jcater wonders if he shouldn't add a "tree-style" interface first
<jamest> hmmm
<jcater> as far as I'm concerned, it's pretty damn official
<jamest> i don't have time tonight
<jcater> just maybe lacking a few desired interface methods
<jamest> but you might be able to rip the event handler (unused) in forms UIwxpython
<jcater> but, hell, so is forms :)
<jamest> to possibly grab those events you're missing in UIwxweb
<jamest> ah hell
<jamest> i'll try it
<jamest> deadlines shmedlines
<jcater> I can work on nav if ya'd like
<jcater> not a problem
<jamest> doesn't matter
<jamest> i wanna get windows support polished up tonight in there
<jamest> and maybe figure out wtf is going on with forms in win32
<jcater> ok
<jamest> the UI is corrupt and it won't save
<jcater> I don't think that'll interfere too much
<jcater> eeew
<jcater> it's derek's fault, you know
<jamest> yeah, i know
<jamest> we need to get chilly a 50lb trout and have me keep derek away from our code

<jan> Hi!
<stbain> hello
<jamest> hey jan
<jamest> saw you've been working on block support some :)
<jan> hi jamest. 
<jan> yep. but the biggest problem, i've spared up ;) for later:  master-detail relationship 
<jamest> man
<jamest> i wish you could interface to our python stuff
<jan> now DB writing is working.
<jamest> as you'd almost be done by now :)
<jamest> i haven't seen a php/python bridge though :(
<jan> (but just for postgres. I like OIDs)
<jan> We could do it by SOAP. There are a lot of good implementations out there.
<jamest> that might be less time for you
<jamest> maybe?
Action: jamest doesn't know what's involved
<jan> I'm not shure how to write the python part, but if there would be a gnue-common webservice, possibly with a similar interface like GEAS....
<jamest> sigh
Action: jan is dreaming... (he has no idea about the gnue-common gnue-forms interface.
<jamest> there was work done on gnue-rpc
<jamest> but it's halted as our AI has more pressing issues :)
<jan> AI? 
<jamest> jcater
<jamest> he's an AI

<jamest> jan: did you get that paperwork taken care of?
<jan> I've send the mail, but haven't got any answer yet. (neither email, nor paper)
<jan> jcater: whats about the status of the rpc commdriver? And how can I test it?
<jcater> well
<jcater> it's currently broken, so won't be of much use
<jcater> the real issue is that gcommon is a library, not necessarily a service
<jcater> so I'm not sure how that would work
<jcater> it's as easy to do XML-RPC in Python as in PHP, though
<jcater> I do know that
<jcater> (both are fairly easy to do)
<jan> I like easy stuff. :)
<jcater> real issue is the persistence factor
<jan> I haven't seen much of the gnue-common code, but for me the most important part is the db abstraction layer.
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> it's pretty cool
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> now that would be worth creating a "service" for
Action: jcater is thinking...
<jamest> run!
Action: jamest dives for cover
<jan> help! my donughts are away!!!
<jan> persistence is no very big problem. the php client is saving all cached data at the end of a call and restores it at the begin of a call. not nice. not fast, but working.
<jamest> jan
<jamest> while you're here
<jan> yep!
<jamest> something that i was thinking about adding to forms
<jamest> was the ability to say that forms pages are steps
<jamest> so that I could rapidly design a web form that is one or more steps
<jamest> then on the last page a commit is done
<jamest> as personally I _hate_ making html forms 
<jan> Ok, thats a possibility. Whats about a "WIZARD" attribut in the <form..> tag?
<jamest> hmmmmm
<jamest> i really haven't giving this a lot of thought
<jamest> just a wishlist item that didn't seem remotely close to be available
<jamest> but at the rate youre going..... :)
<jamest> i'm not sure how the normal client would deal with this type of form
<jamest> or if it's even a good fit in the gfd
<jamest> others may want to comment on it first 
<jamest> as I think it's been my dirty little secrete desire
<jan> no problem. I also don't like to change the DTD.
<jan> But it would be great ;)
<jamest> secret even
<jamest> um
<jamest> i hate to say this
<jamest> but I don't think the DTD is stable yet
<jamest> we're only at 0.1.1 release 
<jan> Just thinking of the database demo page. ... its so slow that it hurts. Even on my local computer.
<jamest> where is the overhead?
<jan> Browsing in a list like that is not good.
<jamest> btw - www.gnuenterprise.org is not that much machine
<jamest> it's a celeron 350 w/ 96MBof ramm
<jamest> dude, you need our db driver system
<jamest> it pulls things in small chunks
<jamest> assuming that it's not good cause it loads it all
<jan> Every time php parses the xml file and load session data. Not improved for speed at the moment.
<jamest> ouch
<jamest> that would be a beastie
<jamest> we've even talked about storing pre-parsed object trees to reduce gfclients startup time
<jan> But if i switch on the APC cache (i.e. PHP don't have to parse 2000 lines of code) its getting relatively fast.
<jan> If the basic features are in, i will try to store a little bit more of info into the session cache to let php do the parsing just once a session.
<jamest> ?
<jan> APC caches the preparsed PHP code. PHP don't have to parse the php file every time it is called. Good stuff. But nothing if you change the code every 5 minutes.
<jamest> :)
<jan> jamest: thinking about wizard mode: every page needs back and forth buttons and the last one needs the commit button. After commiting it will jump to the first page again.
<jan> What are the python macros for jumping to the next/prev page?
<jamest> the UI system sends a IIRC requestNEXTBLOCK
<jamest> or requestPREVBLOCK
<jamest> the system then checks to see location of next block in relation to the page
<jcater> jamest: is this "wizard" you are thinking about specifically for a HTML form?
<jamest> i see it usefull in 2 places
<jamest>   html forms are #1
<jamest>   #2 is where I may want the user to fill out trouble ticket of some sort
<jamest>     running a local copy of forms
<jamest>   say you want your reps to always ask the same things in a specific order
<jamest>   or fill out a trouble ticket
<jamest> starting at step 1 and ending at step 4
<jcater> well
<jcater> if we had multipage blocks
<jamest> and you don't want them dealing w/ all the "confusing" parts of a forms app
<jcater> this would be easy to do using existing "pages" concepts
<jamest> just a fill in this, fill in this, fill in this, finish or cancel
<jamest> yes
<jan> A "wizard" form is great for HTML, but if it didn't work with the standart client. This wouldn't be good. Whats about using the normal pages and some triggers to implement it?
<jamest> i just wanted the pages to become treated as steps
<jamest> jan
<jamest> right now forms are of type="tabbed" iirc
<jcater> well, multipage blocks would do that automatically :)
<jamest> which makes the pages become notebook tabs
<jamest> so a type="stepthru"
<jcater> without a new step type
<jan> most demo forms have multiple pages, but are missing the tapped attribut.
<jamest> it's not missing
<jamest> it's an option
<jamest> do you want to just see a page count
<jamest> or do you want tabs with named pages
<jamest> jcater but multipage blocks wouldn't hide all the extras
<jcater> hide what extras?
<jamest> query, print, next/prev foo, jump to record
<jamest> what I was talkign about was a mode that displayed the 1st page
<jamest> and gave a next, back, cancel
<jamest> button
<jan> Thats what i want to say. If you want to use a special type="stepthru" , you have to change the toolbar.
<jamest> and that is all
<jamest> they fill in first page hit next
<jamest> they fill in second page hit next
<jan> 7+---------+---------+------+
<jan> | tabbed  | string  | none |
<jan> +---------+---------+------+
<jan> tabbed has no default!
<jamest> they fill in 3rd page where the next is replaced with Finish as it's the last page of the form
<jamest> press finish
<jamest> and the commit is done
<jan> Or the tech_ref has to be updated.
<jamest> this is so I can replace crappy mailto forms 
<jamest> with gfd forms :) on my website
<jamest> lemme find one
<jcater> I get what you're saying
<jcater> I'm just saying multipage blocks are probably a prerequisite
<jamest> ok
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> mre work
<jcater> and if you had multipage blocks, you could easily simulate such a system without a special tag
<jcater> (even if you did in fact want the special type)
<jan> Pardon, but whats so great about multipage blocks? Is that not the same, as if they all use the same datasource?
Action: jcater is not so sure that multiple blocks can use the same datasource
<jamest> well, i need multipage fields more than multipage blocks
<jan> Ok, there is the cursor problem, but why don't use a trigger to set the cursor.
<jamest> but that goes against the grain of form's current design
<jamest> you can fake multipage fields w/ non-bound fields and triggers
<jamest> but it can get fugly
<jan> So the contact.gfd in the CVS don't work. The datasource of all blocks of contact.gfd is "forms".
Action: jcater needs a good, stiff drink and some donut holes
<jamest> you know
Action: jamest is trying to do that think thing
<jamest> we don't really need multipage anything
<jcater> jan: contact?
<jamest> just a clone="" attribute
<jcater> eek
Action: jcater runs
<jan> jcater?
<jcater> I'm not sure which sample you are referring to
<jamest> I'm describing an old oracle sql*forms feature that was 1/2 baked
<jamest> maybe that scared him away
<jamest> jcater has sql*forms scars too
<jcater> jamest: really????
<jcater> I've never seen a cloned field
<jan> "/forms/samples/contact.gfd
<jamest> it couldn't do cloning perfectly
Action: jcater has read the Oracle Forms tech reference forwards and backwards
<jamest> but you could setup a read only field
<jamest> that held the value of a different field
<jcater> using triggers?
<jamest> kinda like the default thing but it would accept block.field as it's value
<jamest> no
<jamest> this didn't require triggers
<jamest> but was brain dead
Action: jamest only used it a few times
<jcater> jan: ah
<jamest> always fell back to triggers as it worked better
<jcater> jan: technically that form needs to be rewritten
<jamest> ooooo
<jcater> as it's a dataless form, but defined a dataless datasource
<jan> aah. 
<jcater> which isn't necessary
<jcater> blocks don't have to be bound
<jcater> but I'm guessing when this one was written, they did need to be bound
<jamest> any complicated samples using triggers will be dead too
<jamest> except for a few
<jan> why should two blocks share on datasource?
<jan> "/should/shouln't/s
<jamest> internals
<jcater> yeah
<jamest> our datasources implement master/detail
<jan> i think there is no "datasources" directory
<jamest> so they have a concept of current record
<jan> ok, i come back to the thing after implementing master/detail
<jamest> no datasources dir
<jcater> master/detail is very tricky
<jcater> so beware
<jan> is the current record stored in the datasource?
<jamest> that's our generic interface to the system
<jcater> it's cause jamest and I countless sleepless night
<jamest> yes
<jamest> and a link to all it's detail recordsets
<jamest> so that I can cruse thru a master/detail set of data
<jamest> changing masters and children at will
Action: jan is thinking about implementing master/detail when SOAP, orbit and some other bindings are running :)
<jamest> then commit the whole mess
<jamest> she's a beastie
<jamest> but damn if it don't rock
Action: jcater is still giddy about our master/detail setup
<jamest> you sure that isn't quezy?
<jcater> I don't know of another forms implementation that can do master/detail like GNUe can
<jcater> jamest: both
<jcater> definitely both
Action: jan is using dictionary (quezy)
<jamest> it's probably misspelled
<jamest> like everything I type
<jamest> it means feeling ill
<jamest> in your stomach
<jan> oh, "queasy", yep. thinking about implementing master detail makes me feel queasy
<jan> ;)
<jan> ok, but why don't use a MVC architecture. 
Action: jcater tries to hold his dinner down
<jan> A block is just a view on the datasource
<jamest> um
<jamest> that was more like how the old system was going to work
<jcater> actually, we kinda do
<jcater> in a twisted kind of way
Action: jamest doesn't recall if I'd actually ended up implementing it that way
<jamest> it's a fusion of old design and new
<jamest> and it's offspring walk a bit funny, and have only 4 toes
<jan> like it is allways. (look at GEAS)  ;)
Action: jcater chokes on his food
<jamest> :)
<jamest> poor jcater
<jcater> nothing like getting a donut hole stuck in your throught while cracking up laughing
Action: jan hopes jcater isn't feeling too queasy.
Action: jan is looking at the code
<jan> ok, forget my idea.  GFdatasource is pretty empty to be a MVC model.
<jamest> oooo
<jamest> GFDatasource is a wrapper
<jamest> it's part of that old new mergering thing
Action: jan is hidding away
<jamest> go to common/src
<jamest> GDataSource
<jamest> GDataObjects
<jamest> and the entire dbdrivers/* dir structure
<jamest> oooooo
<jan> ok, i confess. I forgot the heritage of GFDatasource
<jamest> make sure you don't have a family history of mental illness
<jan> but nevertheless GFBlock is caring for too much to make it a simple view.
<jan> nop.  no metal illness just mental sickness. i'm preparing myself to do a master/detail.... mini implementation.
<jamest> ewwwww
<jamest> masochist
<jamest> :)
<jan> Oh, great ive implemented a master detail implementation in one single block. 
<jan> Ok, thats enough master detail for tonight.
<jan> :)
<jamest> lol
<jan> jamest: have a look at the demo3 of the php client. I made a pre alpha version of a wizard.
<jamest> thats what I'm after
<jcater> url?
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> www.gnuenterprise.org/~jan/gfc.php
<jamest> i set him up an account so we can always show this stuff off :)
<jamest> in fact
<jcater> cool
<jamest> I've put that url into a few mails 
<jamest> one to the mysql mailing list
<jamest> and one to that prof. from the univ of australia(?)
<jamest> <cough>no pressure jan<cough>
Action: jan 's hands a bibbering...
<jamest> bibbering
<jamest> ?
<jan> .  /a/are/s
<jan> bibbering=zittern=fa dou 
<jan> ok?
<jamest> yip
<jamest> shaking i assume
Action: jan put the dict away
<jamest> is that form taking data?
<jamest> i can't seem to type on it
<jamest> if this works......
Action: jamest will do a happy dance
<jamest> i have to hand code html forms today
<jamest> with this puppy
<jamest> a form could be built in designer in seconds
<jamest> that is input only from the web
<jan> yeah. only thing is form cannot send mail to you... , or is there a dbdriver/mailto ?    ;)
<jamest> lol
<jamest> no
<jamest> but
<jamest> the trigger system in forms core could do it
<jcater> conceptually, it wouldn't be a problem to have a "write-only" database driver that actually sends an email :)
<jamest> hell
<jcater> our dbdriver system is quite flexible
<jamest> at this point a db backend trigger would do the trick for me
<jamest> the time this would save 
<jcater> :)
<jcater> for me too
<jamest> jan
<jamest> um
<jamest> no pressure
<jamest> but how close would you say this is to, um
<jamest> production ready ?
<jamest> :)
<jamest> <cough>no pressure <cough>
<jan> eh. eh. 
<jamest> seriously
<jan> there should be done some bug squaching i think
stbain (GunAndGiz@ip68-10-44-170.rn.hr.cox.net) left irc: "www.gunandgiz.com"
<jan> and if you don't need the master detail stuff at once .....
<jamest> nope
<jamest> i don't 
<jan> ... no RPC, SOAP, orbit,.... just postgres.....
<jamest> with this type of setup today
<jamest> i could get a list of fields from my user
<jamest> create a simple transactions_foo table 
<jamest> run designer
<jamest> get the base form
<jamest> then adjust the layout in real time with the user
<jamest> and we'd be done
<jamest> not to mention
<jamest> that the normal forms client would still currently treat this as a normal form
<jamest> so they could use _exact_ same def file to look at the data
<jan> yep. just the code is a little bit different. 
<jamest> lol i just realized something
<jan> speaking of two forms using one db f.e. 
<jamest> I'm not wearing socks
<jamest> they must have rocked right out of here
<jamest> still got shoes on though
<jamest> crafty little buggers those socks
Action: jan is wondering about jamest. thought only Al bundy is allways missing his socks.
<jamest> :)
<jamest> well
<jamest> i have both hands on the keyboard 
<jamest> instead of one in my pants
<jamest> so I'm ok
<jamest> i think
Action: jcater hopes so
<jan> :)
<jcater> I know this wizard stuff is exciting to ya jamest
<jcater> but please keep your hands on the keyboard
<jamest> um, sure, yeah, ok
<jamest> you bet
Action: jamest makes sure he still doesn't have a webcam
<jcater> rofl
<jamest> yip, nothing going on here
<jamest> hey jan....tell me again about the new wizard support?
<jamest> j/k
<jan> just open the demo3 again. (some changes :) )
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> toolbar is back
<jamest> can't type
<jamest> lower arrow doesn't work
<jamest> i wonder if konq is causing this
<jcater> probably
<jcater> I had issues w/konq and his first form
<jcater> but mozilla seemed to work
<jamest> cd
<jan> yep, i just use mozilla, because i don't want to download the whole kde stuff.
<jcater> dude
<jcater> it's peaceful in here
<jcater> chilly must be sick
<jcater> :)
<jan> jamest: do you want to test php-form email dbdriver?
<jamest> sure
<jan> ok, i will put your email into it!  ;)
<jamest> fine w/ me
<jcater> jan: that's goatluvin@gnue.org
<jcater> in case you didn't know his email
<jcater> :)
<jan> oh, i uploaded an jamest@gx version.
<jan> ok, it should be ready now. 
<jan> jamest: take care for your mailbox
<jamest> jcater: typo
<jamest> goatluvd@gnue.org
<jcater> ah
<jamest> remember
<jcater> do it every timer
<jamest> i'm not a willing participant
<jcater> sure
<jcater> <snicker>
<jan> uups. havent changed mail address. 
<jamest> :)
<jamest> actually 
<jamest> jamest@gnuenterprise.org would be best
<jan> now it should be ok
<jamest> wow
<jamest> my mozilla is 0.8.1
<jan> 8.1 should not be very stable.
<jan> got mail? :)
<jamest> he says as it crashes 
<jan> the mail format is a bit weard. 
<jamest> um
<jamest> i got it
<jamest> even this would be handy
<jamest> however
<jamest> we really need to be carefull
<jamest> and figure out how to wrap this into common and reference forms as well
<jamest> this stuff is so cool i want it now though :(
<jamest> btw jan
<jan> you just need a cached form i.e. a form without datasources and a commit handler who flushes the cache into a mail.
<jamest> how did you get the form layout down so well?
<jamest> lol
<jamest> so basically we could have this today in forms as well
<jamest> via our pre-commit trigger at the form level
<jan> yep. So easy.
<jamest> i never thought of that
<jamest> dude
<jamest> we need to get php and python playing together
<jamest> as if we could link your stuff into common and forms core
<jan> Ok, tomorow night i will test your triggers to send mails.
<jamest> i don't think i'd ever have socks again
<jan> yep would be great.
<jamest> this is too cool
<jamest> i wonder....
<jamest> jcater: you here?
<jcater> wonder no more!
<jcater> yes I am
<jamest> wasn't there a zope/php adaptor somewhere?
<jcater> yip
<jcater> http://www.zope.org/Members/Ioan/PHPObject
<jcater> I haven't used it and don't know exactly what it's doing
<jamest> i wonder if it'd short circuit the connection to gnue-common and php
<jan> yes. great stuff. Main routine is: x=os.system("php "+file1+" > "+file2)
<jamest> is it ?
<jan> ***sniff **** nobody cares for a good php python connection *** sniff****
<jamest> i do
<jamest> very much so
<jan> yes. it is.....* sniff**
<jamest> man
<jamest> that's pretty weak
<jamest> os.system
<jamest> lol
<jcater> roflmao
<jcater> oh well
<jcater> I said I'd never actually used it
<jan> I was so happy to hear about that thing, but after downloading just 6166 bytes i got a strange feeling about it.
<jamest> lol
<jcater> um
<jan> I think the only good binding is to connect php java and python altogether. By using Enterprise J Beans the persistenz problem is allmost solved.....
<jcater> ok
Action: jcater is thinking out loud here
<jcater> but if we don't mind restricting this to apache for the near future
<jcater> we might want to look at mod_python or mod_snake
<jcater> http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/apache/2000/11/08/wrangler.html
<jan> jamest: should i leave the php form pointing on you email?
<jamest> thats fine with me
<jamest> as long as you like
<jan> ok. So you allways know when I m testing...
<jan> = ca. 2000 mail per hour ;)
<jamest> :)
<jamest> echo "jamest: jan" >> /etc/aliases
<jcater> Mod_python is an Apache module that embeds the Python interpreter within the server. With mod_python you can write web-based applications in Python that will run many times faster than traditional CGI and will have access to advanced features such as ability to retain database connections and other data between hits and access to Apache internals. 
<jamest> ooooo
<jan> Even if java is the best direct binding, i didn't like the sound of it. I would prefer RPC or SOAP.
<jamest> and gfclient is a python module
<jamest> so if we can get it to work w/ jan's stuff
<jamest> we are there
<jan> great deal. because mod_php and mod_python can can use internal redirects....

<jan> yep. But you can tell me what do you think is better.
<jan> I will implement it. ( tomorow )
<jamest> ok
<jan> I should have a look on the navigator stuff. Does it defines which buttons should be shown and which not?
<jamest> forms can't do that yet
<jamest> we're working on it
<jan> do you have an idea how to code it? Should it be defined in the gfd file? An special entity <option type=toolbar> <button prev on> button commit off.....
<jamest> there is the start of a proposal on this in common/doc/Menus.txt
<jamest> a small amount of code is in cvs
Action: jan is having a look
<jamest> and some i haven't checked in
<jan> ok, i will use it to generate a simple menu structure. but should the <MENU....> entities be in the gfd or in the gpd file?
<jamest> lol
<jamest> that's subject to debate
<jamest> i originally put them in the gfd file
<jamest> i still think they belong there in some cases
<jan> And. If there are gpd files, why dont use sub transactions for the gfds and transaction for a process in the gpd. Voila Wizard functionally for beginners.
<jamest> um
Action: jamest is pretty tired
<jan> Ok. lets handel it like the row attribut in the block and the entry tag. 
<jamest> but are you talking about transactions in the workflow?
<jamest> so that a group of actions roll out at once
<jamest> ?
<jan> yep. me too.. ok, we will talk about that later.
<jan> good nite.  eeh. good morning.
<jamest> :)
<jan> CU
<jamest> l8r
Action: jan is dreaming about gnue-forms 1.0
<jcater> sounds like a nightmare to me
jan (jan@dial-194-8-196-20.netcologne.de) left #gnuenterprise.
<dnWork> sigh looks like i missed a lot
Nick change: dnWork -> derek
<derek> no one home?
<jamest> home
<jcater> howdy
<derek> wow two criminals same time
<jamest> no bother to read the logs
<derek> er i mean good people are here
<derek> dont bother?
<jamest> we blamed everything on you
<derek> that good huh
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> btw, how dare you cause the enron collapse
<derek> rofl
<derek> looks like more phpForms talk
<derek> which ires me to no end, but hey i suppose it has to happen at some point
<jamest> trying to merge into core
cnrd-away (conrad@dial-ctb023.webone.com.au) got netsplit.
Action: derek cringes
cnrd-away (~conrad@dial-ctb023.webone.com.au) returned to #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> so that the python forms core and common can be used
<derek> im not real fond of changing forms so that it works with 'php'
<jcater> eh?
Action: jcater doesn't recall that being discussed
<derek> btw: there is still lots of room in navigator
<derek> but i consider it both useful and official
<derek> btw: jamest you say you've seen jan has been playing with blocks
<derek> where are you seeing this?
<derek> as i dont see commits?
<jamest> he doesn't have cvs commit
<jamest> his web client supports blocks
<derek> then how are you seeing what he is changing?
<jcater> he isn't changing our codebase
<derek> also WHY php?
<jamest> because 
<jamest> 1) it's what he knows
<derek> i mean from the log it sounds like he is reimplementing all of common
<jamest> 2) he's willing to work on it
<derek> which seems silly
<jamest> 3) he's open to merging into the python code
<derek> in the same amount of time he could probably learn one of the python embeded deals
<jamest> if you read the logs he's installing mod_python tonight
<derek> read my thing isnt: php sucks dont use it
<derek> my thing is: 75% of the crap is reusable if you use something in python :)
<jamest> um
<jamest> that was what we were talking about
<jamest> ways to reuse what we have
<jamest> he's downloading mod_python
<jamest> i don't see the problem
<jamest> as he's willing to work with us
<jamest> and he doesn't want to reimplement everything
<jamest> at least that's the impression I'm gettig from him
<jamest> the cool thing is
<jamest> if this works 
<jamest> someone will be able to take the lessons learned
<jamest> and write a UIhtml.py for the main system
<jamest> but until someone has time to work on it
<jamest> and I'm pretty sure i don't
<jamest> nothing would be getting done
<jamest> what was demo'd tonight was nothing short of breathtaking
<jamest> i have forms in html that took forever to create
<jamest> as it sits today
<derek> nevermind dont have time to argue my points
<jamest> i got a mail from a gfd form running on his client
<derek> huh?
<jamest> his client saves data
<jamest> as part of our discussoin
<jamest> he whipped up a forms to email interface
<jamest> this thing as it sits today 
<derek> im not saying its bad
<jamest> partially implemented blows away every html forms package I've seen
<jamest> as I can create my forms in designer now
<derek> im saying better if used common
<derek> personally i suppose i dont really care as for most part i think web as client licks bag :)
<jamest> i do to
<derek> and with ssh tunneling, i get better performance and more functionality
<jamest> however for single form input
<jamest> i still need that
<derek> but some people like this type of thing so its good
alexey (alex@techkran.vladimir.ru) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> no, this does more
<jamest> his client is a forms client
<derek> yes, who said it wasnt?
<jamest> but I'd suggested it may be nice to make a form of type stepthru
<jamest> like we have tabbed
<derek> it has uses
<jamest> yes
<jamest> ive got a few forms at work
<jamest> that took my student days to layout
<jamest> designer could do it in minutes
<derek> i guess im just not overtly running around excited as jade and i had functionality surpassing this pre our gnue days
<derek> all in php and a bit faster
<derek> just we quickly came to conculsion web apps suck :)
<derek> for some stuff best thing since sliced bread for real apps, sucky :)
<derek> i.e. we have a full featured time and attendence piece all in php
<derek> it does well
<derek> but i cant imagine supply chain in it
<jamest> i'm not talking about putting everything in it
<jamest> i wouldn't have as many hours in forms if i was wanting pure web interface

<dtm> somebody here has administrated Staroffice before in a multiuser environment, right/
<dtm> ?
<jamest> yes
<derek> a competitor
<derek> http://www.accelio.com/
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> konq does not like that site
<derek> yikes that site is marketing hell
<derek> lots of babble about greatness with a link
<derek> that basically just rewords prior page buzzwords
<jcater> that's not a Free competitor, though
<jcater> right?
<derek> no
<derek> but i see it as market share we have to gain
<derek> i.e. 
<derek> oracle forms
<derek> jet forms
<derek> and 
<derek> similar prop products
<derek> are who we can target to 'replace'
<jcater> yes
<derek> so its nice to 'understand' how they work
<derek> so we can 'compare' ourselves to them when people ask
<derek> i use prop product X but i dont want to upgrade anymore, can gnue help me?
<jamest> i didn't think jetforms was close to us
<jamest> i thought it was about electronic paper forms
Action: jcater has yet to see what the fsck jetforms is
<derek> it is, to a large degree
<derek> BUT i think gnue will do that
<jcater> I've seen nothing but marketing so far
<jamest> where a form was an instance of a paper form
<jamest> with a digital signature
<derek> i.e. if we make 'capture' product that is a normal gnue form
<derek> but then make reporter do 'mail' merge type 'presentation'
<derek> which we already have a base for
<derek> we could probably compete in the market
<derek> jcater did you find a fix to that unicode issue?
Action: derek is debating on compiling older python as its kind of pain in ass to resave forms :)
<jcater> um
<jcater> I'm not entirely sure we can work around it
<jcater> I would highly recommend downgrading to 2.1.2
<derek> yeah
<jcater> I've used 2.1.1 for quite some time
<derek> its just a toss up, i hate to put ANY more time into this machine
<jcater> and 2.1.2 fixed some bugs I've never come across :)
<derek> as i desperately want to wipe it
<jcater> well
<jcater> what's the holdup?
<derek> i dont have any other machine
<derek> and i cant be w/o a machine (read i dont trust things going 'smoothly'
<derek> the original plan was to get debian all solid on my desktop pc
<derek> and get all functionality working there
<derek> so not using laptop anymore
<derek> then know its safe to toast laptop and put debian on it
<derek> i was about 3 applications short of things on desktop pc
<derek> when the mother board went south
<derek> hell i even had gnucash 1.6 working on it :)O
Action: derek scared them all off
<derek> i want to write a gnue app
<derek> what shoudl i write?
<derek> that has a chance of being used but isnt so complex that it wont see fruit for years?

<chillywilly> sup dawgs
Action: chillywilly compiles kernel 2.5.4 ;)
<jcater> yo
<jcater> I installed that pre-emptive patch this morning
<jcater> seems to work well
<jcater> X seems to respond better
<chillywilly> I couldn't get my kernel to compile
<chillywilly> ;I was having issues with sgi's cvs
<chillywilly> I think
<chillywilly> notice any improvement?
<jcater> yeah
<chillywilly> cool
<jcater> responsiveness is better
<jamest> l8r
<jcater> nite
<chillywilly> nice
jamest (jamest@fh-dialup-201091.flinthills.com) left irc: "[x]chat"
<chillywilly> now I have to get it working
<jcater> um
<jcater> I thougth I read on their patch
<jcater> that it's included in main tree as of 2.5.4
<chillywilly> 2.5.4 has the preemption stuff
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> but does it have xfs
<chillywilly> I need that
<jcater> dunno
Action: chillywilly has to check that out
<chillywilly> actually I could try and clean up the sgi tree and reapply those patches
<chillywilly> but I said, eh what the hell lets go for 2.5.x
<chillywilly> live dangerously or something ;)
<chillywilly> no xfs in 2.5.x though :(
<chillywilly> they need to get their act together so they can get into the main tree
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> as reiser and ext3 are already there
<jcater> they better get on the ball if
<jcater> they want mainstream support
<chillywilly> well, what I heard is that they do not interface correctly with the kernel but have some hacks in there
<chillywilly> they don't use the VFS layer
<jcater> I was hoping the patch would help w/my disk access + X issues
<jcater> it helped a teenie bit
<chillywilly> did it?
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> I'm still confused about that
<jcater> I had a K6/400 Mhz + my current hard drive
