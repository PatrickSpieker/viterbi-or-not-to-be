<psu> hi all
<chillywilly> howdy
<psu> hi Isomer - you awake?
<psu> late night for cw  ;-)
<chillywilly> I don't think he is
<chillywilly> sorta
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> I should go to bed
<chillywilly> but want to finish something and check it in
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> so sue me :P
<StormBringer> is there an orbit-python hacker alive?  ;)
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> he died
<chillywilly> ;P
<StormBringer> chillywilly: sad ;)   and who was he?
<chillywilly> andrewm
<chillywilly> j/k
<StormBringer> j/k ?
<chillywilly> other ppl loke neilt have hacked up orbit-python examples
<chillywilly> like
Action: chillywilly has not

<psu> cw - we have enough andrewm's around here
<chillywilly> and maybe that wacky req dude
<chillywilly> er, reinhard
<psu> they can't all have joined "the choir invisible"
<StormBringer> reinhard: hello
<chillywilly> reinhard: sup g
<StormBringer> reinhard: are you the orbit-python supa hacker?
<chillywilly> psu: ah yes but we've only has one true 'andrewm'
<chillywilly> s/has/had
<chillywilly> he was the bane of my existence
<chillywilly> ;)
<StormBringer> chillywilly: what happened with him?
<psu> heh
<chillywilly> he went away
<StormBringer> chillywilly: smoke?
<chillywilly> (probably to the nut house_
<psu> reminds me of the soccer fans chant
<psu> "There's only one AndrewM"

<psu> hi reinhard
<psu> how's euro going?
<psu> or is it too painful to talk about? 
<psu> ;/
<reinhard> hi all
<chillywilly> dude
<chillywilly> what's shakin'?
<reinhard> my head ;)
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> why?
<reinhard> psu: euro is going very well
<psu> good stuff
Action: psu will probably have to face this all in a couple of years - or maybe not ;-)
<reinhard> psu: look forward to it ;)
<psu> my personal guess is
<psu> that the first referendum will be a narrow "NO" votes
<psu> based on FUD whipped up by media (esp. newspapers)
<psu> but that it won't matter
<psu> as the large multi-nationals will start using euros in UK anyway
<psu> and we will become a de facto dual currency economy
<psu> e.g. all new employees will be paid in euros,
<psu> all new suppliers will be required to bill in euros
<psu> etc etc
<psu> then some n years later, after many job losses,
<psu> a second referendum will eventually vote "YES"
<psu> all IMHO, natch
<reinhard> psu: interesting theory :)
<reinhard> but not too far from realistic

<chillywilly> cool
<derek> s/of/the
<psu> KC encourages you to "add value" by putting working hyperlinks in

Action: psu wonders if he dares to link to http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/ for derek's mention of "mcdonalds" on Fri ;-)
<derek> huh?
Action: derek look sup url
<chillywilly> why would mickey dees be in the KC?
<psu> a sort of anti-MS 6.0 smart link
<psu> cw - mentioned in passing in t&a discussions

<derek> but we are big scooby fans here
<chillywilly> scooby rocks
<psu> but only the early ones
<chillywilly> how do you spell convience?
<psu> scrappy-doo was lame
<chillywilly> (i.e., is that right ;P_
<chillywilly> psu: uh, no
Action: psu is some ashamed to have an opinion on this
<derek> psu scrappy was way dumb
<derek> original scoob and shag are the only way
<chillywilly> you even see that one british cross dressing comic dude?
<chillywilly> he's hilarious
<derek> back when they had that other one too
<derek> um....
<chillywilly> he did a whoel scooby thing
<derek> the sandbuggy one
<chillywilly> did this history bit too
<derek> man its gonna drive me mad not remember than sand buggy show

<chillywilly> speed buggy was coool

<chillywilly> all the characters looked similar though'
<derek> yeah that was the idea :)
Action: chillywilly wathes cartoon network
<psu> the more time I spend in IRC, the more I find I have in common with you guys - eerie
<chillywilly> er, watches

<chillywilly> your bad
<derek> debbie was hotter than daphne though
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> she was a cartoon
<derek> best line was had really good buddy with a brother 2 years younger
<derek> that hung out with us
Action: chillywilly commits more junk to cvs ;)
<derek> there was a cartoon called 'beverly hill teens' before school when we were like in 9th grade
<derek> so he was in 6th or 7th grade i think
<derek> and we teased him
<derek> about him thinking bianca (or someone) was hot 
<derek> and he said...
<derek> 'well she is'
<derek> and we gave him that look
<derek> and he added
<derek> 'for a cartoon'
<derek> we gave him crap about that for YEARS
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> jcater is lazy about his .cvsignore files ;)
<chillywilly> that bugs me

<chillywilly> it's nice to contribute something (even if it is not code quite yet)
<derek> yes i saw and i like
<psu> anyway 
<psu> gotta head off to work
<chillywilly> never
<chillywilly> work is for the birds
<psu> I keep suggesting they should pay me even if I don't show, but they never seem that keen ;-)
<chillywilly> bah, what good are they then?

<jamest> morning
<drochaid> hey jamest
<drochaid> I've been swamped trying to get things moving here for the last few days ... has there been a designer build since the 3rd feb?
<drochaid> I *may* actually get some time to pay for a while by the end of this week :)
<jamest> um
<jamest> nope
<drochaid> s/pay/play
<jamest> no new snapshots
<drochaid> ah well, I'll keep hacking 0.1.1 to bits then :)
<jamest> play not pay :( drat, jamest was hoping to double what he makes on gnue...lets see....zero times two....
<jamest> ooo
<jamest> looks like my pay did double !
<drochaid> lmao
<AnDarkon> if you used an Intel CPU in your calculations, zero is not equal to zero times two :-)
<drochaid> hey, let me triple it for you ;)
<jamest> AnDarkon: so i'd be up to .00000000000132 cents an hour!
<jamest> rock!
<AnDarkon> That's more than what I make now!
<AnDarkon> You lucky dog!
<jamest> yip, I'm living high on the hog......gonna get me a package of ramen noodles next month....been saving up for them 
<AnDarkon> if you time it just right, you can get two for the price of one
<AnDarkon> Get some rice if you can, the broth make for great flavoring :-)
<jamest> :)
<AnDarkon> you want a quick and cheap chili soup recipe?
<jamest> mmmm chili
<AnDarkon> One pound ground beef (ground pork, chicken or turkey is fine)
<AnDarkon> large jar of salsa
<AnDarkon> Large can of tomato juice
<AnDarkon> two cans of kidney beans
<AnDarkon> brown the meat and drain
<AnDarkon> and throw the rest together and bring up to heat. Spice to taste

<AnDarkon> James, how was the decision to use python made? I made the same decision before I found GNU enterprise. I'm curious about the thinking process that came to that point :-)

<AnDarkon> Hi Bailey
<jbailey> Hello.
<jamest> well
<jamest> i'd used tcl in the past and wasn't happy with it
<jamest> lots of people on the list either already liked python or didn't object to it
Action: jamest doesn't recal the specifics of it
<jamest> there was  a lot of debate IIRC
<AnDarkon> I bet :-)
<AnDarkon> I was deliberating between Python and Java. I had already concluded that perl, while being very veristale (sp), would get too spaghettiy in large projects
<AnDarkon> what cinched is was Jython heh; the fact that I could run Python code on top of java machines cinched Python as the winner
<Isomer> heh
Action: jamest dislikes java with a passion
<Isomer> jamest: out of curiousity why?
<jamest> well
Action: Isomer suspects that this could be a long answer
<jamest> i have to support java apps here
<jamest> a major problem with java is the inconsistancies in the java VM
<jamest> so I have users that are forces to run specific versions of browsers to run some university apps
<AnDarkon> just like with C compilers
<Isomer> Ok, Cool, Fair enough :)
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> 3:15am
<Isomer> bed time
<AnDarkon> In the early days, I couldn't link borland libraries with Microsoft code
<AnDarkon> and vice versa
<Isomer> since I have to be coherent in <6hours
<AnDarkon> sleeping makes you coherent? ;-)
<jamest> it basically ends up a huge game of mix and match
<jamest> so one machine in the office has to have netscape 4.07 or something
<jamest> as that's the only one that runs all the apps the user requires
<AnDarkon> it makes me feel better for having decided on Python :-)
<AnDarkon> At least Python's credo guarantees that a number is stored the same way
<jamest> in fact speaking with some of the developers of these apps here on campus
<jamest> they gave up on java on the client
<jamest> and were redoing the systems to run java on the web server
<AnDarkon> jsp, right?
<jamest> which makes the whole cross platform benefit of java kinda moot
<jamest> jsp yes
<jamest> however i gave up on java back when swing was not part of java itself
<jamest> which shows my experience isn't that recent :)
<jamest> however the support side of things is still a pain for me :(
<jamest> oooo
<jamest> one last stab at java
<jamest> i can't resist
<jamest> I used to be able to get GCC to run on far more platforms that a JVM
<jamest> which I always found somewhat amusing :)
<jamest> not sure if that's still the case
Action: jamest has a history in this channel of being a java hater :)
<AnDarkon> I haven't encountered a system yet that didn't have gcc (other than SCO Unix)
<dsmith> AnDarkon: gcc is the portability layer
<dsmith> Too bad C doesn't have fixed sized type, like Java.
<dsmith> Doesn't the newer C standards have that?  in32 is guaranteed to be 32 bits or something?
<AnDarkon> C does, it's not just stored in the same exact method
<AnDarkon> big eidan, little eidan
Action: dsmith has been a C programmer for about 16 years
<jbailey> dsmith: uint_32_t I think.
<dsmith> jbailey: Yeah, that's it.
<dsmith> The one thing I liked about Java.
<jbailey> THere's a whole collection of types like that.  I would love to see them officially deprecate the old "int".
<reinhard> AnDarkon: IIRC there _is_ gcc on SCO Unix
<AnDarkon> reinhard: Not back when I was working on SCO Unix :-) I'm not saying that gcc wouldn't run, just that it was the only system that I worked on which didn't have gcc on it at the time
<reinhard> i'm not 100% sure though
<reinhard> it's a long time for me, too :)
<AnDarkon> :-) even though I've 17 years under my belt with C/C++, I'd rather program in Python. I like instant gratification heh
<jbailey> Working on SCO Unix is like poking myself in the eye with a stick.
<AnDarkon> and working with Xenix would be like poking yourself in the eye with a branding iron, right? :-)
<AnDarkon> on a 286, even
<jbailey> Yeah, but noone uses Xenix really.  I keep running into SCO sites that people want fixed.
<jbailey> And they never seem to understand that the only way to truly fix sco is with mke2fs.
<AnDarkon> jbailey: heh, unfortunately it's not an acceptable choices at some places, especially these who bought an excellent accounting package in the '80s.
<jbailey> Yeah =(
<AnDarkon> Just recently, I helped someone add `linux' to the terminfo database. What an experience
<reinhard> AnDarkon: oh at least terminfo
<jbailey> It's less painful than getting ncurses to compile with the native compiler. =)
<AnDarkon> The accounting package isn't the problem; it's that today's packages don't pass muster so they stay with it
<reinhard> termcap is more fun :)
<reinhard> you will laugh
<AnDarkon> jbailey: I gave up trying and hacked some wrappers for the native curses heh
<reinhard> but i support exactly that type of accounting pckage from the 80's that runs under SCO
<AnDarkon> reinhard: You do? Do you remember Wordperfect for Unix? I loved that package :-)
<reinhard> we had lyrix
<reinhard> it was an sco only thing iirc
pattieja (~pattieja@www.pcxperience.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jbailey> AnDarkon: Do you have any idea why `ld' doesn't build for SCO?  I thought they switched to ELF now...
<AnDarkon> jbailey: what kind of errors did you get?
<jbailey> binutils just doesn't generate the configs in that directory.  They've always prefered the native SCO linker, I think for the multilibs supports.
<AnDarkon> you can sometimes get a link error whenever the non-ELF (I forget the name of the format now) objects are linked along with ELF objects
<reinhard> COFF
<AnDarkon> Right, thanks :-)
<AnDarkon> it's been way too long
dres (~dres@4.18.171.42) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jbailey> Excellent.  I see that they've disabled the linker in binutils because it doesn't understand weak symbols in COFF.  Should be safe to enable for me, then.
<jbailey> IIRC, gcc-3 dropped support for COFF on sco.
<AnDarkon> I didn't know gcc supported COFF :-)

<AnDarkon> Hi
<psu> it;s the not-so-dreaded AndrewM !
<AnDarkon> No, I'm a different Andrew M... Just call me Andy :-)
<AnDarkon> what is it about Andrew M? And why is he such a holy terror?
Action: psu doesn't know - I am post-AndrewM
<AnDarkon> Me, too
<psu> Andrew Murie did the original code for GEAS
<psu> which reinhard & neilt are now re-hacking
<AnDarkon> am I to infer that the original GEAS is somewhat a hairball?
<AnDarkon> s/is/was/
<psu> I think it would be fairer to say
<psu> that it was written by/for a company for its own purposes
<psu> and then contibuted back to the community
<psu> and thus did what they wanted rather better
<psu> than what the project wanted/needed
<AnDarkon> a la Netscape?
<psu> plus everyone's ideas about what an App Server should be has evoleved somewhat
<psu> yes, excpet it was always intended to be GPL/FSF copyright from start
<AnDarkon> Ok
<psu> AndrewM may be gone
<psu> but his home directory lives on...
<psu> http://goats.gnue.org/~andrewm/
<reinhard> just to talk about good old days
<reinhard> the main point about andrew m. is
<reinhard> the coder of geas was named andrew murie
<reinhard> his boss (who also was here very often was also named andrew
<dneighbo> at one time there were 3 andrews on this project all from new zealand within like 150km of one another
<reinhard> plus the name another employee of this company (who also wrote little parts of the geas code) was also andrew
<dneighbo> two of which were andrewm
<reinhard> then ajmitch is andrew m(itchel)
<dneighbo> andrewm (all of them) were good guys
<reinhard> so AnDarkon is andrew m. number 3
<dneighbo> :)
<reinhard> and andrew number 6 or like that :)
<psu> ok this is going to look silly 
<psu> but I keep missing Isomer
<dneighbo> btw: the joke for a while was
<dneighbo> Treshna
<dneighbo> -----
<dneighbo> andrew m.
<dneighbo> andru
<dneighbo> andre
<dneighbo> and then
<dneighbo> ajmitch (andrew m)
<dneighbo> so the joke was 
<dneighbo> to live in new zealand must you have andr in your name?
Action: dneighbo thinks AnDarkon is just a kiwi in disguise ;)
<reinhard> some days we entered irc and said something
<psu> Isomer & me keep missing each other - him @ work, me @ sleep & vice versa
<reinhard> like
<reinhard> "hi andr*"
<reinhard> :)
<dneighbo> isomer is really remosi
<dneighbo> so if you have data on remosi they are one in the same
<psu> I would /query him, but I'm not 100% sure I know what I'm talking about
<psu> shall I just cyt & paste main channel & let you all have a good laugh?

<dneighbo> sure
<psu> Hi Isomer
<psu> Did anyone ever answer your query from yesterday
<psu> about widgets?
<psu> I'm no expert
<psu> but based on what I've read here
<psu> I think you could use some of the GNUe Tools
<psu> If all you want is a series of "hooks" 
<psu> to enable your C/C++ code to talk to a database
<psu> then you could use GNUe Common 
<psu> This already has abstraction for databases
<psu> and will have abstraction for RPC
<psu> when jcater has the time
<psu> so you can talk CORBA, SOAP, XML-RPC to your d/b
<psu> If by "widget"
<psu> you actually mean having data-aware controls
<psu> then GNUe Forms should do what you want
<psu> Main issue is that the current version of GNUe Forms
<psu> is written in python 
<psu> so assumes all triggers for data controls are in python too
<psu> However
<psu> there has already been some discussion about writing triggers in C
<psu> basically, just use a python wrapper to call the C code
<psu> even our python fanatics have admitted
<psu> they might have to use C at times 
<psu> for speed & efficiency
<psu> Longer term I believe the plan is to write an alternative version 
<psu> of GNUe Forms native in C
<psu> s/to write/to find a C fanatic who can be persuaded to volunteer to write
<psu> Anyway 
<psu> any duff info i have given you can be corrected  
<psu> by someone who actually knows what they are talking about ;-)
<psu> ok
<psu> end flood...
Action: psu has obviously stunned everyone else into silence ;)

<jan> Hi!
<psu> hi jan
Action: dneighbo has other thing running
<dneighbo> reading now
<dneighbo> im not sure i agree
<dneighbo> i dont know what he is wanting to do
<dneighbo> if he wants database abstraction for C code he might be better off right now today to look at libGDA
<psu> ok
<dneighbo> as writing bindings for our gnue-common is probably more trouble than he is looking for
<dneighbo> if he is looking to use application server
<dneighbo> then yes via corba today he could use our app server with his front end
<dneighbo> and write methods in python or C
<jan> hi psu.
<dneighbo> if he is looking to us gfd, he could write a forms engine in C though i wouldnt recommend it at this stage of the game
<dneighbo> so some of it depends on his 'needs' in order to answer properly
<psu> yep

<dneighbo> arent prop software vendors great?
<dneighbo> you have a product that works but needs some 'fixes'
<dneighbo> but they have a NEW version that doesnt do anything really great for you
<dneighbo> and so any fix you need is ' the new version has the fixed '
<dneighbo> only thing is new version isnt part of your support/upgrade contract
<dneighbo> i swear its so bad im suprised i didnt here

<dneighbo> basically the new version cures cancer, solves world hunger and achieves world peas ;)
<soulstompp> but only if you pay extra for the platinum edition
<soulstompp> standard edition only gives you a larger penis
<dneighbo> roflmao
<dneighbo> soulstompp you sure you dont work for this company?

<soulstompp> never seen a VAR that added any value
<psu> it depends
<psu> my last employer's core business was selling finance systems
<psu> but we were also a VAR for a well-known reporting package
<psu> If you bought the package from them, you got a load of CDs
<psu> If you bought from us, you got the CDs, some setup/training consultancy,
<soulstompp> thats cool
<soulstompp> I guess their are some out their
<psu> plus the critical schema definition layer that enabled package to talk to our DB
<psu> which I ended up being responsible for maintaining 
<psu> in my "spare" time 
<soulstompp> oh no thats not right
<dneighbo> hey now
<dneighbo> VAR = Vaseline Applied Regularly
<dneighbo> get from vendor == take it in rear
<soulstompp> so true
<dneighbo> get from var == take in rear w/ added vaseline ;)

<soulstompp> comment = this is my test
<soulstompp> provider = pypgsql
<soulstompp> host = localhost
<soulstompp> dbname = gnue
<dneighbo> on the machine you are using forms on do
<jamest> you have a postgresql database named gnue?
<dneighbo> psql -h localhost -U validusername gnue
<dneighbo> and tell me what you get
<jamest> and do you have your postgresql listening on tcp/ip?
<soulstompp> yeah got it doing that yesterday
<soulstompp> I think I put the wrong database name in
<dneighbo> what is output from 
<soulstompp> the config
<dneighbo> psql -h localhost -U validusername gnue
<soulstompp> no database
<soulstompp> it's gnuetest
<dneighbo> then thats the problem (or at least one of them)
<dneighbo> what the hell
<dneighbo>  a little fishy just swam across my machine
<dneighbo> i have seen that before (once or twice)
<dneighbo> anyone have a clue what it is?

<dneighbo> um looked like it
<jamest> it went missing last night
<jamest> he's worried sick
<dneighbo> but seriously anyone know what it was?
<jamest> what os?
<dneighbo> soulstompp change dbname = gnue to dbname = gnuetest
<dneighbo> then try
<dneighbo> psql -h localhost -U username gnuetest
<dneighbo> if that works
<dneighbo> retry your form
<dneighbo> let me know how it goes
<soulstompp> and it's good
<dneighbo> debian sid
<dneighbo> have seen it on red hat too
<dneighbo> it just slowly swims across 1 time and doesnt come back
<dneighbo> i have only seen it maybe 3 times in 3 years
Action: dneighbo wonders if its some timed joke
<dneighbo> or if i have been hacked
<dneighbo> though this machine should be pretty hard to get to from outside world
<jamest> it's a gnome easter egg
<dneighbo> ah what triggers it?
<jamest> There's an Easter Egg in Gnome, which gives you a 1 in 4000 chance of fatting fish swimming across your screen.
<dneighbo> what is the 4000 chance?
<jamest> groups.google.com
<dneighbo> funny
<jamest> one post claimed it has to do with the panel
<dneighbo> i tell you if something can happen to my systems chances are it will :)
<jamest> each time you use it, it increments a counter
<dneighbo> most people probably never seen damn thing and i have seen it on virtually every linux system i have :)
<dneighbo> at least im not crazy :)
<dneighbo> er will completely crazy
<jamest> was jcater comming back?
<dneighbo> yeah i think

<jamest> soulstompp: so where are you at wrt the database?
<soulstompp> I got connected and I am playing with the wizard
<jamest> cool
<jamest> is it working out ok for you?
<soulstompp> seems to be 
<jamest> any feedback?
<soulstompp> I went through the wizard and got the form set up
<soulstompp> and I added a button
<soulstompp> do I need a button to make these changes?
<soulstompp> or is just filling out the fields sufficient
<soulstompp> and then doing a commit?
<jamest> ?
<jamest> you don't need buttons on a form for anything
<jamest> you get queries and commits for free 
<jamest> via the menu, toolbar, or keyboard shortcuts
<soulstompp> very cool
<soulstompp> I am getting a segmentation fault everytime that I try to delete this button off of my form
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> you can't do that from designer right now
<soulstompp> oh okay
<jamest> the right click delete is our quick exit feature
<soulstompp> :)
<soulstompp> deleted it from the XML doc
<soulstompp> no biggie
<jamest> at this point in time
<jamest> i find myself doing 1/2 in designer 1/2 in vi|emacs
<soulstompp> I needed an exit shortcut anyway
<jamest> a month ago I was doing 1/4 designer
<jamest> so were getting there :)
<dneighbo> hmmm you all suck
<dneighbo> im 3/4 1/4
<jamest> dneighbo: we're power users
<dneighbo> the trick is dont make mistakes
<dneighbo> though im a little disadvantage as i save in unicode :)
<jamest> got to make it do the things designer can't do :)

<dneighbo> um use what works for you
<soulstompp> lol
<dneighbo> relational will be easier for two tier
<jamest> i do relational
<soulstompp> alright
<jamest> the form can do master/detail
<dneighbo> when we get geas (appserver) up to speed
<jamest> but designer can't auto set it up
<dneighbo> we will probably make a 'conversion' tool
<jamest> what I do
<jamest> is make forms for each table
<dneighbo> so you write your objects in geas
<jamest> put the blocks together
<dneighbo> and map your relational tables to them

<chillywilly> noe more netertainment for you
<chillywilly> er entertainment even
Action: derek has damage to inflict on forms
<jamest> when ken finds out she's more plastic than person
<jamest> "Hey! These aren't real!"
<derek> jamest: do you have any idea if the unicode issue is in our code
<jamest> not a clue
<derek> or my beta python version?
<jamest> well
<derek> as i really dont want to spend all night upgrading python
<derek> if that isnt the issue
<jamest> people have said that it works with pyth 2.2
<chillywilly> apt-get install python2.1
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> chillywilly: yes yes i wish
<derek> ups me a tower to put my amd in and i will do that
<derek> until then i odnt have debian here
<chillywilly> you have an amd board?
Action: chillywilly is a bit poort ya know
<derek> to save me some time jamest can you tell me which .py file in designer does the save?
<derek> so i can start 'debugging' the problem
<jamest> um
<jamest> i haven't looked 
<jamest> but
<derek> or tell me what to grep for
<jamest> GObj should do the save
<derek> i.e. class or routine
<jamest> dumpXML 
<derek> ok will start there
<jamest> is part of the core GObj
<jamest> and a few classes override that
<jamest> but for the most part that is it
Action: chillywilly takes more notes!

<chillywilly> hmmm
<jamest> it's being generated from the wx import
<chillywilly> and ACLs
<derek> yeah i know
<derek> just letting you know its happening
<jamest> ok
<derek> what seems to happen is if gfdes crashes
<derek> the next time i start it, i get that
<derek> then if i run again its fine
<derek> so its like the crash corrupts memory or something
<derek> but if i look in top etc no evidence of its tehre
<derek> anyhow
<derek> odd
<derek> if i save a blank form it saves fine

<derek> hmmm add some widgets and it saves fine
<derek> you want a pet peeve bug, good glad you asked
<derek> we dont 'hourglass' properly
<jamest> did someone say we wanted bugs?
<derek> i.e. when designer is 'thinking' the hourglass doesnt exist when hovering over the application
<derek> argh and after running the wizard
<derek> designer never seems to shut down right
<chillywilly> jamest: you hear something?
<jamest> the wind? 
<chillywilly> jamest: I thought I may have heard someone whining
<derek> ok, here is the deal
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> if i save blank form it works
<derek> if i save hand created form it works
<jamest> hmmmm, now that you mention it.....i thouhgt it was two weasels mating outdoors
<derek> if i save a form after i run the wizard it does unicode
<derek> rofl
Action: derek thinks of the budlight commericals, but those are ferrets
<jamest> so the wizard is messing it up
<chillywilly> jamest: it was more like a whale call
<jamest> that's odd
<jamest> derek: give me a sec and I'll try it
<derek> jamest: i dont know if wizard is messing it up persay
<derek> but i can say after using the wizard it does it but not before
<derek> but im doing more complex form with the wizard
<derek> so it could be something eles
<derek> er else
<derek> but whats odd is if i shut down designer then try to open a form that i replace the ^@ with it still happens
<derek> which makes me think its something that wizard creates but not the wizard itself
<jamest> can you do me a favor?
<jamest> try and run the forms/sample/button/forms/form.gfd?
<jamest> i'll try designer wizard while you do that :)

<jcater> yeah, I'd imagine
<jcater> I'll be back shortly

Action: jcater is away: bbiab
Action: derek thinks this, hmmm sounds like you need new xxxxxx, btw i have to leave, sounds fishy ;)
<derek> hmmm well upgrade to pyxml 7.0 didnt fix things
<jamest> can someone update and test designer against pre pg 7.2 database
<jamest> make usre the wizard still workds
<jamest> designer works w/o issue here derek
<jamest> no problems at all
<derek> doesnt suprise me
<derek> probably python2.2a
<derek> but i really wish that had better proof of that
<derek> im afraid to update i have something pretty much works

<derek> i just want to get this machine on debian soon
<chillywilly> do it
<derek> and dont really want to recompile python and friends on it 
<jcater> do you still have the source directory where you installed?
<chillywilly> go for it
<jcater> i.e., do you have the Makefile?
<derek> where installed what?
<derek> python?
<jcater> you installed from source, right?
<jcater> yes
<derek> nope i deleted that dir
<derek> jcater what is bothering me about this problem
<derek> if i opne desinger and do NOTHING and save the form (ie blank form)
<derek> it saves fine
<derek> even if i drop some stuff on the form it saves fine
<derek> but if open and existing form and do save as
<derek> poof
<derek> hmm a normal save kills too
<derek> damn thought i was on to a pattern
<derek> ok its on second save
<derek> most odd
<derek> if i open designer
<derek> drop some widgets on it and do a 'save'
<derek> it saves just fine
<derek> if i open that file back up in designer
<derek> do NOTHING
<derek> cept file->save
<derek> it saves it with the ^@
<derek> this ranting on whats happening helping any?
<derek> or should i just give in and say its my system and move along
<jcater> does anyone else use python2.2?
<jamest> not i
<jcater> as I'm not kidding... a lot changed in 2.2
<jamest> IIRC unicode support was big in 2.2
<derek> since you all are on debian can you try 2.2 easily?
<jamest> it would break all my dependencies
<jamest> and I'm on a deathline with some forms stuff
<jcater> content may be a Unicode string or a byte string; the expat reader module produces always Unicode strings. 
<derek> um fuck me
<derek> i was right
<derek> stringio i think is the problem
<derek> * In Python 2.1, the StringIO module (though not cStringIO) supported Unicode. This capability is accidentally not present in Python 2.2.
<jcater> umrofl
<jcater>  accidentally not present in Python 2.2.
<jcater> sigh
<derek> fsck fsck fsck
<derek> explains why SECOND time it happens
<derek> is stringio is used to READ the xml file
<derek> iirc
<derek> so my first guess hours ago was probably the right one 
<derek> btw: that accidently is funny seeing how its from OFFICIAL python page
<jamest> so basically 
<derek> jcater: woudl this be symptom of not having unicode stringio?
<jamest> youre' screwed
<jcater> crap
<jcater> that's on the known bugs page
<derek> jamest: thats ok i have lots o vaseline
<jcater> I was looking at the 2.2a4 known bugs page
<jamest> good
<jamest> lube up 
<jcater> bot the 2.2-final known-bugs :(
<jamest> as you're going to have to reinstall python :)
<chillywilly> have you figured it out fellas?
<derek> well not really
<jamest> unless they provide a workarround
<derek> i can use 'emacs' to fix things
<derek> for now
<derek> but this is big
<chillywilly> unicode not present in python 2.2a?
<jcater> hang on
<derek> as we need to not tell people to use 2.2
<jcater> I'll patch
<derek> or we need to fix our code to not use stringio
<derek> jcater: and you thought i was TEASING when i said i work hard to provide a system that finds bugs :)
<jcater> where are you seeing StringIO being used?
<derek> um
<derek> in Designer.py i think
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue/designer/src$ grep -r StringIO *
<derek> DataSourceEditor.py:import sys, os, cPickle, traceback, StringIO
<derek> DataSourceEditor.py:     buffer = StringIO.StringIO()
<derek> Debugger.py:from StringIO import StringIO
<derek> Debugger.py:      debugInstance.setForm(GFParser.loadForm(StringIO(caller.rootObject.dumpXML(treeDump=1)), debugInstance))
<derek> Designer.py:from StringIO import StringIO
<derek> Designer.py:      self.newInstance(forms, buffer=StringIO(form.dumpXML()))
<derek> SchemaViewer.py:import sys, os, cPickle, traceback, StringIO
<derek> SchemaViewer.py:      buffer = StringIO.StringIO()
[21:48] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue/designer/src$ 
<derek> that help
<jcater> sigh
Action: jcater thinks it's only relevant when reading from an xml file
<jcater> as it's expat generating the unicode, which stringio don't know what to do with
<jcater> damn
<jcater> that sentence sounded like something chillywilly would write
<chillywilly> just stay away from me mr. crabby I've had enough of you kind for today thank you
Action: chillywilly notes crazymike was a crabby little pain today
<chillywilly> :P
<derek> so can we 'fix' it
<derek> or do we need to say we dont work well with 2.2 until they fix bug
<chillywilly> dudes
<chillywilly> this is rediculous
<chillywilly> http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99991905
<jcater> derek: can you update cvs and see if this is still happening
Action: jcater isn't so sure now that this patch will work
<derek> brimming with confidence eh
<derek> seems to still have the issue
<derek> wiping directory
<derek> and doing new co and setup.py first
<jcater> ok
<jcater> if the same issue
<jcater> then we are 2.2 incompatable
<jcater> for the indeterminable future
<derek> thats probably not too horrid as im the only one insane enough to run 2.2 :)
<chillywilly> ;P
<jcater> I hope they come out w/2.2.1 before major distro's bump up to 2.2.x support
<chillywilly> not even debian ustable has 2.2!
<chillywilly> er, unstable
<jcater> derek: you are in violation of our support contract until you downgrade to 2.1.2
<jcater> :)
<derek> strike three
<derek> no dice
<jcater> ?
<derek> saving a form
<derek> then reopening and saving
<derek> still gets ^@
<derek> um but i still stringio's
<derek> what did you change?
<jcater> Designer.py
<derek> what did you change in it though?
<jcater> line 299
<jcater> #
<jcater> # Workaround for Python 2.2's big unicode bug!!!
<jcater> #
<jcater> if sys.version[:5] == "2.2.0":
<jcater>   from cStringIO import StringIO

<jcater> it's not that he "wants" to watch a movie
<jcater> but he "has" to :)
<chillywilly> isn't that the way it always is?
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> there's just some movies you *have* to watch
<jcater> dude
<jcater> doesn't everyone agree that we should support our free software coders?
<jcater> well, I wanna start a fund
<jcater> to get jamest broadband!!!!!
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> I need broadband
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> 90% of which will go directly to getting jamest broadband
<jcater> (ignore any KK receipts on file)
<chillywilly> and the other 10%?
<chillywilly> bah
<jamest> rofl
<jamest> just because my cvs commit/update responce time is measured in calendar months not seconds
<jamest> I'm just fine with my 56k modem, washhouse out back, and whale oil lighting system
Action: jamest is reliving the 90s in all their glory
<chillywilly> you go jamest!
Action: chillywilly just realizes he did nothing constructive tonight
<chillywilly> ah well
<jcater> chillywilly: just like old times, eh?
<jamest> lol
<chillywilly> what's that supposed to me?
<chillywilly> er, mean
<chillywilly> fuck you all
<jcater> chillywilly: all at once?
<jcater> damn, you are good
<chillywilly> finally you admit it
<chillywilly> bastard
Action: jcater wishes he had that stamina
<jcater> after 2 hrs of being fscked by forms, I'm given out
<chillywilly> lay off the donuts
<chillywilly> jcater: I swear if you ever had anyrthing nice to say to me I would keel over and die
<jcater> chillywilly: you have a clever nick

<jamest> what's the problem?
<moi_je> I have downloaded the version 0.7-2 as RPM and when i try to install it it keeps saying  PyXML = 0.6.5 is needed by 4Suite-0.11-2. But i already have 4Suite installed on my machine
<jamest> oooo
<jamest> i really can't help with that
<jamest> i'm a debian user
<jamest> and don't know much about dependency issues in RH
<jamest> i was thinking source installs

<jamest> but none seem to be available right now
<jamest> :(
<moi_je> ok maybe i try a bit later or on another channel. Do you know the python channel?
