<chillywilly> hi reinhard
<reinhard> good morning
<furiousbl> I'm sorry if this is off topic, but can someone recommend a light weight erp that will run on NT? I've decided not to use gnuenterprise because a) I have no linux experience/skills , b) my company is very small (8 employees).
<ajmitch> GNUe runs on NT :)
<furiousbl> the app server too?
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> ask reinhard about appserver stuff
<reinhard> which appserver?
<reinhard> do we have an appserver?
<reinhard> (j/k)
<furiousbl> from the faq : "The GNUe Application Server works natively on Mac OS X. It does not currently work on Windows, but support is anticipated. "
<furiousbl> i take it the faq is out of date ? :)
<reinhard> probably
<reinhard> i have to talk to psu about the web page
<reinhard> much of it is out of date wrt appserver
<reinhard> because there's much on the web page that still refers to GEAS (v1)
<furiousbl> what version is it at now?
<reinhard> to make clear: it's not psu's _fault_, but he's the one that can fix it :)
<reinhard> furiousbl: what we call GEAS (v1) is an application server that we got contributed
<reinhard> however after some time of hacking in that code we decided to rewrite from scratch
<reinhard> which we now call "appserver" to have a clear distinction
<furiousbl> i c!
<furiousbl> sorry if I sound a bit thick, I'm quite by the sheer size/scale of the project
<furiousbl> i wish there was an idiots guide to gnuenterprise (I might even write one if I ever get it up and running)
<furiousbl> to make sure i've got this right, to get gnuenterpise running on NT, i need :
<furiousbl> -oracle db
<furiousbl> -gnu enterprise tools
<furiousbl> - one or more gnuenterprise packages
<furiousbl> am I missing something?
<reinhard> um....
<reinhard> i think we have to tell you that there are no gnuenterprise packages yet...
<reinhard> well to be precise there are some qite usable samples
<furiousbl> lol... 'scuse me while I go and cry
<reinhard> but if you are after "accounting" or "invoicing" then you'd have to wait
<reinhard> there are some ready to use apps that are managed under the "roof" of the gnuenterprise meta project
<reinhard> like nola or acclite
<reinhard> but there are no "gnuenterprise packages" yet
<furiousbl> i c
<furiousbl> so to install an app like nola or acclite, i still need gnuenterprise tools and oracle?
<reinhard> i think no
<reinhard> however i really don't know them
<furiousbl> ok, thanks for your help reinhard
<reinhard> maybe somebody else can help here??
<furiousbl> looks like it's back to the drawing board :)
<reinhard> sorry, we're working on it :)
<furiousbl> don't apologise! what are my other options? shell out $$$$$ to sap or peoplesoft? no thanks
<furiousbl> i hope one day my business is bg enought o justify running gnuenterprise :)
<reinhard> well
<reinhard> one of the goals of gnuenterprise is to fit even the smalles business
<ajmitch> oracle is certainly not a requirement, thankfully! :)
<ajmitch> it is just one of the supported databases
<furiousbl> sorry, i was thinking of compiere
<furiousbl> out of curiosity, if there are no packags, who uses gnuenterprise at the moment? people who write their own packages?
<ajmitch> yeah, custom systems that use forms & reports
<furiousbl> i found nola, but I can't find a homepage for acclite.. does anyone have a url please?
<ajmitch> nope, not yet :)
<furiousbl> let me guess... acclite is in alpha or pre-releaset oo right?
<ajmitch> acclite is nola with patches & extra stuff :)
<ajmitch> afaik
<furiousbl> lol... i give up. quickbooks, here i come! (j/k)

<jamest> fr2ty: we have no prepackaged app to do this
<jamest> but i feel the tools would be capable of doing it
<fr2ty> jamest: so i will follow the channel/site/and lists
<fr2ty> is there information designed for non-tech people already available? When do you expect the project to address such an audience?
<jamest> fr2ty: are you a developer or end user?
<fr2ty> end user
<fr2ty> this might not be the perfect channel for such questions anyway...
<jamest> it's the perfect channel for dang near anything you care to ask
<jamest> :)
<fr2ty> :-)
<jamest> this is a great way to get gnue info but people here are helpful whenever then can be about anything
<jamest> as for when....
<jamest> if gnue is anything it's slow moving with wild spurts of activity
<jamest> so I can't really give a timeline 
<fr2ty> Which mailing list would serve me best? 
<fr2ty> I don't mind following developer's discussions, I am pretty much interested in the interiors of such applications, although my programming skills are, hmmm, let's say,basic. (not the interpreter:-)
<fr2ty> I will dld and explore the GNUe tools, let's see what I can do. Thank you James, I  will come back some time later. Happy coding
<jamest> um
<fr2ty> yep?
<jamest> gnue@gnu.org would be best I think
<jamest> the developer list is ok too
<jamest> but IRC is probably a best bet for help
<jamest> as for the tools
<fr2ty> thx, I will subscribe to it. 
<jamest> i would play with gnue-designer and gnue-forms
<jamest> if you have a database installed
<fr2ty> good advice,  I will do that in the next few days and come back. Thank you.
<jamest> no prob
<fr2ty> mysql for example?
<jamest> should work fine
<fr2ty> ok
<jamest> we support lots of databases
<fr2ty> thx and out :-)
<jamest> we would not recommend mysql for biz data though
<jamest> s/we/a fair number of us in the channel
<fr2ty> yes, but it should work for my test cases. Now I have a really good point to start. Thank you.

<dtm> heheheh
<dtm> derek: dude, M$ has given $1B buyout offers to companies like Intuit.  i wonder if they've got a $1B Tux-flavored ace in the hole.
<dtm> unlike with those proprietary foolz like Intuit, it's not like they could threaten to destroy them in the marketplace.
<dtm> i recall the surfacing of a corporate memo from M$ to Intuit that said basically "if you refuse, just think of what we'll do to you in the marketplace with that $1B"
<dtm> as a threat
<dtm> i think that ended up in court iirc
<derek> well the big thing is there isnt much 'IP' to be had with Linux companies
<derek> in sense that redhats biggest asset is GPL
<dtm> heheh
<derek> and as you say they cant really threaten to put them under any more than they already are
<dtm> wow it would be amazing if somehow that protected them from M$ buyout, and kept redhat honest, almost like blood over the door on passover.
<derek> i.e. linux is enemy number one to them
<dtm> yeah
<dtm> what are they gonna do?  give away Windows servers?
<dtm> they do to some strategic customers, but not in masses like with IE
<derek> likely i would suspect that m$ buyout will be of someone like xandros
<derek> the people (investors) behind ximian/xandros and friends (LGP)
<derek> are shady money grubbers with no care for the validity of linux
<derek> if m$ waved the big dollars at them they would sell 
<derek> the thing is even if they did i dont know what damage it really would do in sense that code is GPL
<derek> though they would own the copyright of anything produced there
<derek> which would allow them to use in own products
<derek> at this point it might be cheaper for m$ to buy
<dtm> whoa.
<dtm> i had no idea.
<derek> SuSE, RedHat and Mandrake
ariel_ (~ariel@ppp-217-133-244-153.dialup.tiscali.it) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<derek> and simply shut them down
<dtm> so M$ could buy Ximian's parent and... yeah.  
<derek> i.e. at a billion a piece
<dtm> well sure  :)
<derek> 3 billion to shut down linux distribution and support channels should sound like a smoking deal to them :)
<dtm> i bet you there's a M$ war room somewhere wher ethey've played that out
Action: derek is away: work
<dtm> actually i wonder why they haven't done it.
<dtm> they do that stuff all the time.
<dtm> given M$'s paranoid-narcissistic perosnality, the only thing they could do with em is shut em down.  
<dtm> they're nothing but "competition"
<dtm> "threat"
<dtm> "enemy"
<dtm> they're of no use in operation.
<dtm> drivers, OS, personnel, marketing, and customer base.  all alien.
<dtm> heh and the IP.
<dtm> the copyrights owned by those companies are a way to poison or subvert the rest of the community
<dtm> geez, seriously, why dont they do this?
<dtm> they MUST have thought of this.
<dtm> if they took over ownership of copyrights held by SuSE or redhat or Ximian over core drivers, libraries, or kernel patches, they could some damage.
<dtm> well, the public would fork the older versions.
<dtm> as they stand today.
<dtm> so we'd lose some manpower, until the good employees quit a la Bero formerly of Redhat
<dtm> and form a new company  :>
<dtm> or go somewhere and continue to hax0r at least in spare time
<dtm> so unlike with a proprietary competitor, they could spend $1B apiece just to set us back a few years
<dtm> i wonder why they dont do that with key smaller companies like Wine or Ximian.  like illegal copying, that stuff does proliferate the use of M$ software which benefits M$ indirectly.
<dtm> i heard a statistic that 80% of all illegal copying ends up being profitable to the company, because it increases mindshare and skill
<dtm> whereas otherwise they would have used a competitor, something $0, or nothing at all
<dtm> which means that most illegal copiers are believed to have not been likely to buy software anyhow

<reinhard> re M$ could buy redhat, suse and mandrake and could shut down linux distribution worldwide

<esands> Say your've got a list of items with 40 fields, but you want to display 3 of them to select the correct item to edit
<esands> Excellent
<jcater> my picture was showing the greyed out lower records, though :)
<esands> Oh
<esands> What about the last blank un-greyed record?
<jcater> I did an insert record there
<jcater> so that's actually a record
<ajmitch> hello sirs
<Isomer> evenin'
<ajmitch> veyr nice, jcater-san
<esands> afternoon isn't it?
<ajmitch> or morning, if one got up late :)
<esands>  jcater: Have you got the gfd for that screen
<jcater> jcater-san?
<jcater> more like jcater-sans-sleep
<ajmitch> heh

Action: jcater must get some rest now
<jcater> I have to get over this damn flu

<jcater> uggh
<jcater> can't sleep
<jcater> anyone know how I can take a file
<jcater> and output non-duplicate lines
<jcater> ?
<jcater> via command line?
Action: jcater thought there was a sort option, but can't find it
<Isomer> uniq 
<Isomer> ?
<Isomer> sort | uniq ?
<ajmitch> sort -u
<ajmitch> ?
<ajmitch> uniq is probably best
<Isomer> ajmitch: only if he has gnu sort :)
<jcater> ah
<jcater> cool
<jcater> both work
<jcater> the "man sort" page for -u
<jcater> is very misleading
<ajmitch> Isomer: there shall be no other! ;)
<jcater> as that's not what I got from reading it
Action: jcater is a debian-ite all the way
<jcater> so I'm sure it's gnu sort :)
<Isomer> ajmitch: yeah, but when people ask, it's polite to give them a command that will work naerly everywhere
<Isomer> also, sort -u doesn't have quite the same flags as uniq
<Isomer> uniq can use -d etc

<ajmitch> it's only jcater, don't need to be polite ;)
<jcater> Isomer: yeah, in his defense, he knows my setup :)
<jcater> but that is a good point in general
<esands> Here is an example uniq type "w | tail +3 | cut  -b19-35 | sort | uniq | wc -l"
