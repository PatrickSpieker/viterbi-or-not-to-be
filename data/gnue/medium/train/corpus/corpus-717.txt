<chillywilly> hi reinhard
<reinhard> good morning
<furiousbl> I'm sorry if this is off topic, but can someone recommend a light weight erp that will run on NT? I've decided not to use gnuenterprise because a) I have no linux experience/skills , b) my company is very small (8 employees).
<ajmitch> GNUe runs on NT :)
<furiousbl> the app server too?
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> ask reinhard about appserver stuff
<reinhard> which appserver?
<reinhard> do we have an appserver?
<reinhard> (j/k)
<furiousbl> from the faq : "The GNUe Application Server works natively on Mac OS X. It does not currently work on Windows, but support is anticipated. "
<furiousbl> i take it the faq is out of date ? :)
<reinhard> probably
<reinhard> i have to talk to psu about the web page
<reinhard> much of it is out of date wrt appserver
<reinhard> because there's much on the web page that still refers to GEAS (v1)
<furiousbl> what version is it at now?
<reinhard> to make clear: it's not psu's _fault_, but he's the one that can fix it :)
<reinhard> furiousbl: what we call GEAS (v1) is an application server that we got contributed
<reinhard> however after some time of hacking in that code we decided to rewrite from scratch
<reinhard> which we now call "appserver" to have a clear distinction
<furiousbl> i c!
<furiousbl> sorry if I sound a bit thick, I'm quite by the sheer size/scale of the project
<furiousbl> i wish there was an idiots guide to gnuenterprise (I might even write one if I ever get it up and running)
<furiousbl> to make sure i've got this right, to get gnuenterpise running on NT, i need :
<furiousbl> -oracle db
<furiousbl> -gnu enterprise tools
<furiousbl> - one or more gnuenterprise packages
<furiousbl> am I missing something?
<reinhard> um....
<reinhard> i think we have to tell you that there are no gnuenterprise packages yet...
<reinhard> well to be precise there are some qite usable samples
<furiousbl> lol... 'scuse me while I go and cry
<reinhard> but if you are after "accounting" or "invoicing" then you'd have to wait
<reinhard> there are some ready to use apps that are managed under the "roof" of the gnuenterprise meta project
<reinhard> like nola or acclite
<reinhard> but there are no "gnuenterprise packages" yet
<furiousbl> i c
<furiousbl> so to install an app like nola or acclite, i still need gnuenterprise tools and oracle?
<reinhard> i think no
<reinhard> however i really don't know them
<furiousbl> ok, thanks for your help reinhard
<reinhard> maybe somebody else can help here??
<furiousbl> looks like it's back to the drawing board :)
<reinhard> sorry, we're working on it :)
<furiousbl> don't apologise! what are my other options? shell out $$$$$ to sap or peoplesoft? no thanks
<furiousbl> i hope one day my business is bg enought o justify running gnuenterprise :)
<reinhard> well
<reinhard> one of the goals of gnuenterprise is to fit even the smalles business
<ajmitch> oracle is certainly not a requirement, thankfully! :)
<ajmitch> it is just one of the supported databases
<furiousbl> sorry, i was thinking of compiere
<furiousbl> out of curiosity, if there are no packags, who uses gnuenterprise at the moment? people who write their own packages?
<ajmitch> yeah, custom systems that use forms & reports
<furiousbl> i found nola, but I can't find a homepage for acclite.. does anyone have a url please?
<ajmitch> nope, not yet :)
<furiousbl> let me guess... acclite is in alpha or pre-releaset oo right?
<ajmitch> acclite is nola with patches & extra stuff :)
<ajmitch> afaik
<furiousbl> lol... i give up. quickbooks, here i come! (j/k)

<jamest> fr2ty: we have no prepackaged app to do this
<jamest> but i feel the tools would be capable of doing it
<fr2ty> jamest: so i will follow the channel/site/and lists
<fr2ty> is there information designed for non-tech people already available? When do you expect the project to address such an audience?
<jamest> fr2ty: are you a developer or end user?
<fr2ty> end user
<fr2ty> this might not be the perfect channel for such questions anyway...
<jamest> it's the perfect channel for dang near anything you care to ask
<jamest> :)
<fr2ty> :-)
<jamest> this is a great way to get gnue info but people here are helpful whenever then can be about anything
<jamest> as for when....
<jamest> if gnue is anything it's slow moving with wild spurts of activity
<jamest> so I can't really give a timeline 
<fr2ty> Which mailing list would serve me best? 
<fr2ty> I don't mind following developer's discussions, I am pretty much interested in the interiors of such applications, although my programming skills are, hmmm, let's say,basic. (not the interpreter:-)
<fr2ty> I will dld and explore the GNUe tools, let's see what I can do. Thank you James, I  will come back some time later. Happy coding
<jamest> um
<fr2ty> yep?
<jamest> gnue@gnu.org would be best I think
<jamest> the developer list is ok too
<jamest> but IRC is probably a best bet for help
<jamest> as for the tools
<fr2ty> thx, I will subscribe to it. 
<jamest> i would play with gnue-designer and gnue-forms
<jamest> if you have a database installed
<fr2ty> good advice,  I will do that in the next few days and come back. Thank you.
<jamest> no prob
<fr2ty> mysql for example?
<jamest> should work fine
<fr2ty> ok
<jamest> we support lots of databases
<fr2ty> thx and out :-)
<jamest> we would not recommend mysql for biz data though
<jamest> s/we/a fair number of us in the channel
<fr2ty> yes, but it should work for my test cases. Now I have a really good point to start. Thank you.

<dtm> heheheh
<dtm> derek: dude, M$ has given $1B buyout offers to companies like Intuit.  i wonder if they've got a $1B Tux-flavored ace in the hole.
<dtm> unlike with those proprietary foolz like Intuit, it's not like they could threaten to destroy them in the marketplace.
<dtm> i recall the surfacing of a corporate memo from M$ to Intuit that said basically "if you refuse, just think of what we'll do to you in the marketplace with that $1B"
<dtm> as a threat
<dtm> i think that ended up in court iirc
<derek> well the big thing is there isnt much 'IP' to be had with Linux companies
<derek> in sense that redhats biggest asset is GPL
<dtm> heheh
<derek> and as you say they cant really threaten to put them under any more than they already are
<dtm> wow it would be amazing if somehow that protected them from M$ buyout, and kept redhat honest, almost like blood over the door on passover.
<derek> i.e. linux is enemy number one to them
<dtm> yeah
<dtm> what are they gonna do?  give away Windows servers?
<dtm> they do to some strategic customers, but not in masses like with IE
<derek> likely i would suspect that m$ buyout will be of someone like xandros
<derek> the people (investors) behind ximian/xandros and friends (LGP)
<derek> are shady money grubbers with no care for the validity of linux
<derek> if m$ waved the big dollars at them they would sell 
<derek> the thing is even if they did i dont know what damage it really would do in sense that code is GPL
<derek> though they would own the copyright of anything produced there
<derek> which would allow them to use in own products
<derek> at this point it might be cheaper for m$ to buy
<dtm> whoa.
<dtm> i had no idea.
<derek> SuSE, RedHat and Mandrake
ariel_ (~ariel@ppp-217-133-244-153.dialup.tiscali.it) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<derek> and simply shut them down
<dtm> so M$ could buy Ximian's parent and... yeah.  
<derek> i.e. at a billion a piece
<dtm> well sure  :)
<derek> 3 billion to shut down linux distribution and support channels should sound like a smoking deal to them :)
<dtm> i bet you there's a M$ war room somewhere wher ethey've played that out
Action: derek is away: work
<dtm> actually i wonder why they haven't done it.
<dtm> they do that stuff all the time.
<dtm> given M$'s paranoid-narcissistic perosnality, the only thing they could do with em is shut em down.  
<dtm> they're nothing but "competition"
<dtm> "threat"
<dtm> "enemy"
<dtm> they're of no use in operation.
<dtm> drivers, OS, personnel, marketing, and customer base.  all alien.
<dtm> heh and the IP.
<dtm> the copyrights owned by those companies are a way to poison or subvert the rest of the community
<dtm> geez, seriously, why dont they do this?
<dtm> they MUST have thought of this.
<dtm> if they took over ownership of copyrights held by SuSE or redhat or Ximian over core drivers, libraries, or kernel patches, they could some damage.
<dtm> well, the public would fork the older versions.
<dtm> as they stand today.
<dtm> so we'd lose some manpower, until the good employees quit a la Bero formerly of Redhat
<dtm> and form a new company  :>
<dtm> or go somewhere and continue to hax0r at least in spare time
<dtm> so unlike with a proprietary competitor, they could spend $1B apiece just to set us back a few years
<dtm> i wonder why they dont do that with key smaller companies like Wine or Ximian.  like illegal copying, that stuff does proliferate the use of M$ software which benefits M$ indirectly.
<dtm> i heard a statistic that 80% of all illegal copying ends up being profitable to the company, because it increases mindshare and skill
<dtm> whereas otherwise they would have used a competitor, something $0, or nothing at all
<dtm> which means that most illegal copiers are believed to have not been likely to buy software anyhow

<reinhard> re M$ could buy redhat, suse and mandrake and could shut down linux distribution worldwide

<esands> Say your've got a list of items with 40 fields, but you want to display 3 of them to select the correct item to edit
<esands> Excellent
<jcater> my picture was showing the greyed out lower records, though :)
<esands> Oh
<esands> What about the last blank un-greyed record?
<jcater> I did an insert record there

<jcater> can't sleep
<jcater> anyone know how I can take a file
<jcater> and output non-duplicate lines
<jcater> ?
<jcater> via command line?
Action: jcater thought there was a sort option, but can't find it
<Isomer> uniq 
<Isomer> ?
<Isomer> sort | uniq ?
<ajmitch> sort -u
<ajmitch> ?
<ajmitch> uniq is probably best
<Isomer> ajmitch: only if he has gnu sort :)
<jcater> ah
<jcater> cool
<jcater> both work
<jcater> the "man sort" page for -u
<jcater> is very misleading
<ajmitch> Isomer: there shall be no other! ;)
<jcater> as that's not what I got from reading it
Action: jcater is a debian-ite all the way
<jcater> so I'm sure it's gnu sort :)
<Isomer> ajmitch: yeah, but when people ask, it's polite to give them a command that will work naerly everywhere
<Isomer> also, sort -u doesn't have quite the same flags as uniq
<Isomer> uniq can use -d etc

<btami> hi
<btami> psu: have you got my e-mail?

<psu> btami: not yet. If it's what I think it is, it could easily take

<btami> it's that
<psu> well, KeithJagrs will be pleased ;-)
<KeithJagrs> ????
<psu> KeithJagrs: I managed to "persuade"£ btami to do us a 
<psu> Win .exe without the debug window as well
<KeithJagrs> yeah!
<KeithJagrs> how did you manage btami?
<psu> but given that btami has to e-mail it to me 
<psu> and then I have to uplaod it
<psu> on dial-up, it may take a few hours ;-)
<btami> console=0 in *.conf files
<btami> oh, sorry 
<KeithJagrs> well, I've thinking about it.  Maybe its better to have the debugging console. Specially in this early stages of gnue tools.
<KeithJagrs> so you can point  out the bugs
<KeithJagrs> psu: you are on dial-up? why?
<btami> this was the original reason i made it that way
<psu> I think it depends. If, like you, you want to put it in front of end-users
<psu> KeithJagrs: my cable company have been saying broadband is "imminent" for 18 months
<KeithJagrs> yes. but until now I've been just playing with forms or designer.
<psu> I'm afraid the week I finally break down &get it from the phone company instead
<psu> will be the week they finally offer it ;-)
<KeithJagrs> psu: where are you located?
<psu> Great Britain
<KeithJagrs> hmmm
<KeithJagrs> what about cable?
<KeithJagrs> o sorry.. i read phone company
<psu> my cable company have been saying broadband is "imminent" for 18 months ;-)
<KeithJagrs> then what about ISDN 
<psu> British Telecom have a wonderful attitude to broadband
<KeithJagrs> or ADSL or something
<psu> You go on the waiting list, and when they get 400 people on your exchange wanting it 
<psu> they consider it ;-)

<psu> compared to cable
<jcater> btami: howdy

<jcater> hrm
<psu> I just know that O'Toole's Rule will apply and the week I finally break down

<btami> i'm starting intro.gfd
<btami> then pgdn
<KeithJagrs> where in Great Britain, psu?

<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> ok possibly my last post didn't get through
<reinhard> so again:
<reinhard> hi psu
<reinhard> i have a few questions on the website
<KeithJagrs> hey 
<KeithJagrs> hey is there an organization chart for the GNUe project?
<psu> since when has joining #gnuenterprise been an "oops" ;-)
<reinhard> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/geas.php
<reinhard> seems to refer to old geasgeas
<reinhard> if it's not too much effort
<reinhard> i think it would be good to
<reinhard> a) rename the page to appserver.php and
<reinhard> b) take the text from appserver/README
<psu> KeithJagrs: bizarlly enough, I have the www.oxymoronlist.com site open as we speak ;-)
<reinhard> psu: lol
<psu> reinhard: it *should* refer to the new appserver - I will check 
<psu> I know the filename is wrong - same for /tools/gnurpc.php -> common.php
<KeithJagrs> heeh
<psu> no, the text is wrong too, isn't it?
<psu> I'll get that fixed
Action: psu will have to get the README text off the savannah web site as I don;t have
<psu> the code CVS checked at at the moment
<psu> My hard disc is full to bursting, so anything non-essential went 
<psu> (inc. frozen bubbles)
<KeithJagrs> I'd like to contribute to the gnue project. Not by coding, at first. I don't consider myself a programmer.
<nickr> Frozen Bubble IS essential
<psu> I need to re-partition and reduce the non-free partition on this PC
<KeithJagrs> I'd like to help in the definition of roadmap. I think it's essential
<psu> as I never use it any more
<psu> I agree. Biggest problem will be that we can't realistically put dates on 
<psu> as per mailing list
<psu> but 
<psu> we have cross-dependancies.
<psu> The one that has been most significant the last year has been 
<psu> we didn't really want to start on apps until we have a prototype app server
<KeithJagrs> I see
<psu> but this particular circle looks as if it is being squared 
<psu> I'm sure there will be others as we go 
<psu> e.g. Financials needs feature foo in Forms for feature bar
<psu> feature bar is in Financials 0.5, feature foo is in Forms 1.2
<KeithJagrs> yes. Maybe it is better to put efforts on tools first, then in packages
<psu> which originally have same release date targets, but one or other slips
<KeithJagrs> but foreseeing those needs
<psu> KeithJagrs: that's sort of what we've done, I guess
<KeithJagrs> well yes
<psu> the Tools are not pefect, but I think they belie their 0.x.0 or 0.0.x version numbers
<KeithJagrs> anyways
<psu> in terms of kick-ass functionality
Action: psu is learning fluent deke-speak ;-)
<KeithJagrs> hmm
<nickr> psu: you are good at this selling gnue thing
<KeithJagrs> so in terms of commercial apps, what would be some more accurate version numbers for the current releases? In your opinion..
<reinhard> psu: another point for appserver web page
<reinhard> there are two current documents (whitepaper and api doc)
<reinhard> IMHO it would make sense if the html version was online
<reinhard> (at least the html version that is) :)
<revDeke> if windows is on 2000 forms is at least at version 10.0
<KeithJagrs> heheeheeh
<revDeke> compared to other opensource (sic) stuff we are probably somewhere between 1.0 and 2.0
<revDeke> it all depends
<psu> reinhard: ok. Are these in CVS too? Or still in ~reinhard/ ?
<KeithJagrs> I mean, on the basis that version 1.0.0 is usually the one considered ready for production
<reinhard> they are in appserver/doc api whitepaper
<reinhard> you just have to do
<revDeke> apache, gtk and the likes were good about version numbering and so i think 0.4.0 is realistic if you use them as a baseline
<reinhard> make html
<reinhard> make ps
<reinhard> make pdf
<reinhard> etc.
<revDeke> if you use other projects claiming to be version 8.0 and such we are probably similar
<reinhard> revDeke: you refering to Exel 8.0 here?
<nickr> HP/UX Version 14
<reinhard> ;)
<psu> what is nola's version number ?
<reinhard> aehm i mean excel not exel
<reinhard> psu: last point
<revDeke> psu: dont know
<revDeke> i woudl label at a 0.2.0 right now (acclite)
<reinhard> i would like to see the "GNU Enterprise: Module Design Proposal" marked as "obsoleted"
<revDeke> and i expect it to ramp up VERY quickly
<reinhard> on http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/docs.php
<revDeke> as the low version number is simply because its not really tested
<revDeke> reinhard: i would not
<revDeke> i think its still pertinent
chillywilly (~danielb@mke-24-167-202-50.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> it needs updating but i plan to revive it very soon
<revDeke> as i plan on pumping out a lot of modules
<KeithJagrs> well
<revDeke> and i want something as my template... though i might replace it with an open office version
<KeithJagrs> what about roadmap, anyway?
<revDeke> i have been screaming roadmap for a bit
<revDeke> its not that simple though 
<revDeke> in due time
<chillywilly> reverend Deke?
<revDeke> yes
<chillywilly> hehe
<KeithJagrs> revDeke: cool
<revDeke> KeithJagrs: we have multiple things going on 
<KeithJagrs> good effort
<revDeke> so its hard to compile a road map
<revDeke> as things are interdependent
<chillywilly> well that's an excuse if I ever heard one ;
<chillywilly> ;)
<revDeke> so you need to do all roadmaps in a cohesive manner
<KeithJagrs> I think roadmap should be done on concensus. not one persons effort
<revDeke> yet thats huge task :)
Action: psu said that 
<revDeke> with lots of players
<psu> ;-)
<revDeke> i suspect someone will have to compile the TODOs of the tools and such
<revDeke> and make a draft roadmap
<revDeke> and solicit feedback
<chillywilly> blah, it's garbage night
<revDeke> and modify the feedback into the roadmaps, rinse and repeat a few times
<revDeke> and there is something go by
<chillywilly> I guess I should drag it out to the road
<KeithJagrs> revDeke: good idea
<revDeke> the other issue is getting a road map might not be too bad for the 'next' release but a good roadmap will include 2 to 3 releases out
<KeithJagrs> what about setting up a Wiki?
<revDeke> i dont care for wiki, but certainly folks can do so
<revDeke> i think wiki is good for user driven content that needs minimal controls
<revDeke> but official documentation, guides, roadmaps and such
<chillywilly> wiki good, deke baaad
<revDeke> that need tighter review and control are not good for wiki IMHO
<reinhard> psu: that's all
<reinhard> psu: if i can help you with the text (for appserver.php) or the docs please tell me
<chillywilly> hey hey reinhard
<nickr> most wikis these days allow you to have at least access control.
<reinhard> psu: not sure if there is a possibility that i could update the docs on the web page myself as often as i change them
<chillywilly> GGV has a local buffer overflow when reading corrupted
<chillywilly>  PS and PDF documents.
<reinhard> however it's bedtime today for me
<reinhard> night all
<psu> reinhard: we should have the web site in CVS real soon now
<psu> nite reinhard
<chillywilly> night reinhard
<KeithJagrs> nite reinhard
<psu> KeithJagrs: re. wiki, I refer to my post to the mailing list
<psu> we already have 10 channels of communication
<KeithJagrs> 10 channels?
Action: psu would support a wiki if it replaced some of those
<psu> rather than just became number 11
<KeithJagrs> ok

<KeithJagrs> chillywilly: ;)
<revDeke> webforums suck for developers
<revDeke> i have no problem people making what works best for them
<KeithJagrs> ok
<revDeke> but dont expect developers (those most capable of helping) to spread accross 15 different mediums
<nickr> mailing lists are great because they are easy to ignore
<nickr> it takes no effortr
<KeithJagrs> not for developers then. but for discussions on features an such.
<KeithJagrs> and roadmaps
<KeithJagrs> you have to ackowlede the advantages or forums for some uses
<KeithJagrs> they are easier to browse than a mailing lists archive
<KeithJagrs> err, the advantages OF forums

<KeithJagrs> I mean:
<KeithJagrs> Lindows.com has fixed a date for the "General Release" of its operating system software, promising that Lindows 3.0 will be available from mid-November. 
<chillywilly> TNN and USA are the same network right?
<chillywilly> and they bought scifi channel?
<chillywilly> and killed Farscape :'(
<chillywilly> bastards
<KeithJagrs> scfi channel? don't have that one
<KeithJagrs> what is/was farscape about?
<chillywilly> man...it's only the best frelling scifi show ;)
<KeithJagrs> hmm
<chillywilly> John Crighton (sp?) an astronaut gets shot through a worm hole to find himself on a living ship ( a leviathon) with escaped prisoners
<chillywilly> er, alien escaped prisoners
<chillywilly> that's the jist but it's a little more invoved than that
<KeithJagrs> hmmm
<chillywilly> involved
<KeithJagrs> living ship?
<chillywilly> yep
<KeithJagrs> like HAL?
<chillywilly> a Leviathon named Moya
<KeithJagrs> what's a leviathon
<chillywilly> a biomechanical ship
<chillywilly> that is a sentient being
<chillywilly> it has a pilot that is "bonded" to the shipt
<KeithJagrs> kind of like 2001 space odissey
<chillywilly> they are a race of aliens whose sole purpose it to travel space
<chillywilly> pilots that is
<chillywilly> not really
<chillywilly> Farscape has many stry lines
<chillywilly> all the characters on Moya do
<chillywilly> it is really a cool story
<KeithJagrs> I see
<chillywilly> but they're not going to be able to finish it
<KeithJagrs> you sure?
<chillywilly> case they did not renew the contract for the 5th year
<KeithJagrs> hmmm
<KeithJagrs> is scifi a channel like discovery?
<chillywilly> http://www.scifi.com/farscape/
<chillywilly> no, it's scifi ;)
<chillywilly> http://www.savefarscape.com I think that should work too
<ajmitch> nobody cares about farscape, chillywilly
<ajmitch> face it, it's crap ;)

<Mr_You> hi yurik
<esands> doesn't generate sql though.  I just managed to get pgdesigner compiled. Simple but looks useful
<Mr_You> never heard of pgdesigner
<esands> http://www.hardgeus.com/projects/pgdesigner/
<esands> Couples others that run on linux I discover as well:
<esands> http://www.alzabo.org/ (perl nightmare to install, needs mason)
<Mr_You> pretty cool
<Mr_You> I wonder if you could build that into GNUe.
<Mr_You> maybe one day ;-)
Yurik_ (~yrashk@as5300.kharkov.ukrtel.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Mr_You> maybe GNUe Designer could have "New->Form" and "New->Schema" or somethin.
Bill_H (~chamilto@ga-cmng-cuda2-c3b-64.cmngga.adelphia.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Yurik_> Mr_You: hi
<Mr_You> might have to mention it again.
<Mr_You> wb yurik
<esands> http://www.codebydesign.com/DataArchitect/ ($30, but lots of features)
<esands> I guess someone could pgdesigner is in c++
<Mr_You> hehe.. that picture in the corner is kinda funy
<esands> Problem is with SQL is that different DBs have different requirements 
<Mr_You> yeah, but you could possibly build it into the DB extraction routines.
<Mr_You> well, I guess it would only be useful for designer.
<Mr_You> unless you wanted to be able to create tables from a Form
<esands> True, I'm sure someone here is up to it. 8)
<esands> Definitely wouldn't want that from an admin pov.  
<Mr_You> whatcha mean?
<esands> Enough trouble keeping users safe as it is. 
<esands> Safe from doing something nasty to the system
<Mr_You> well.. to create/edit Forms it requires you have some sort of ability to build a database table.. as things get complicated a schema designer is a good addition to Form building.
<Mr_You> it would fit right in with Designer.
<Mr_You> right now I think it reads schemas
<esands> With that yes, but not from forms
<Mr_You> oh yeah I see ;-)
<esands> heh
<esands> What type of schemas does the designer read?
<Mr_You> what DBs?
<esands> pg
<Mr_You> actually I guess it just reads individual tables.
<esands> Yeah
<Mr_You> I believe the wizard will query your datasource (db table) and help build a form 
<Mr_You> so I mispoke.
Yurik (~yrashk@as5300.kharkov.ukrtel.net) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<esands> I guess in that sense, doesn't help you put together then schema though
<Mr_You> nah the schema would mean multiple tables.. 
<Mr_You> so now we have another wish list item ;-)
<chillywilly> sigh
<Mr_You> thanks to you ;-)  or if someoneelse has mentioned it I haven't heard it
<Mr_You> what up chill?
<chillywilly> there's multi-datasource in thw works already
<chillywilly> j00 must sbscribe to the commit list
Action: chillywilly works his mojo on Mr_You
<Mr_You> ok, well that has nothing to do with schema design ;-)
