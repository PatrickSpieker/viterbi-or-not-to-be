<chillywilly> hi reinhard
<reinhard> good morning
<furiousbl> I'm sorry if this is off topic, but can someone recommend a light weight erp that will run on NT? I've decided not to use gnuenterprise because a) I have no linux experience/skills , b) my company is very small (8 employees).
<ajmitch> GNUe runs on NT :)
<furiousbl> the app server too?
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> ask reinhard about appserver stuff
<reinhard> which appserver?
<reinhard> do we have an appserver?
<reinhard> (j/k)
<furiousbl> from the faq : "The GNUe Application Server works natively on Mac OS X. It does not currently work on Windows, but support is anticipated. "
<furiousbl> i take it the faq is out of date ? :)
<reinhard> probably
<reinhard> i have to talk to psu about the web page
<reinhard> much of it is out of date wrt appserver
<reinhard> because there's much on the web page that still refers to GEAS (v1)
<furiousbl> what version is it at now?
<reinhard> to make clear: it's not psu's _fault_, but he's the one that can fix it :)
<reinhard> furiousbl: what we call GEAS (v1) is an application server that we got contributed
<reinhard> however after some time of hacking in that code we decided to rewrite from scratch
<reinhard> which we now call "appserver" to have a clear distinction
<furiousbl> i c!
<furiousbl> sorry if I sound a bit thick, I'm quite by the sheer size/scale of the project
<furiousbl> i wish there was an idiots guide to gnuenterprise (I might even write one if I ever get it up and running)
<furiousbl> to make sure i've got this right, to get gnuenterpise running on NT, i need :
<furiousbl> -oracle db
<furiousbl> -gnu enterprise tools
<furiousbl> - one or more gnuenterprise packages
<furiousbl> am I missing something?
<reinhard> um....
<reinhard> i think we have to tell you that there are no gnuenterprise packages yet...
<reinhard> well to be precise there are some qite usable samples
<furiousbl> lol... 'scuse me while I go and cry
<reinhard> but if you are after "accounting" or "invoicing" then you'd have to wait
<reinhard> there are some ready to use apps that are managed under the "roof" of the gnuenterprise meta project
<reinhard> like nola or acclite
<reinhard> but there are no "gnuenterprise packages" yet
<furiousbl> i c
<furiousbl> so to install an app like nola or acclite, i still need gnuenterprise tools and oracle?
<reinhard> i think no
<reinhard> however i really don't know them
<furiousbl> ok, thanks for your help reinhard
<reinhard> maybe somebody else can help here??
<furiousbl> looks like it's back to the drawing board :)
<reinhard> sorry, we're working on it :)
<furiousbl> don't apologise! what are my other options? shell out $$$$$ to sap or peoplesoft? no thanks
<furiousbl> i hope one day my business is bg enought o justify running gnuenterprise :)
<reinhard> well
<reinhard> one of the goals of gnuenterprise is to fit even the smalles business
<ajmitch> oracle is certainly not a requirement, thankfully! :)
<ajmitch> it is just one of the supported databases
<furiousbl> sorry, i was thinking of compiere
<furiousbl> out of curiosity, if there are no packags, who uses gnuenterprise at the moment? people who write their own packages?
<ajmitch> yeah, custom systems that use forms & reports
<furiousbl> i found nola, but I can't find a homepage for acclite.. does anyone have a url please?
<ajmitch> nope, not yet :)
<furiousbl> let me guess... acclite is in alpha or pre-releaset oo right?
<ajmitch> acclite is nola with patches & extra stuff :)
<ajmitch> afaik
<furiousbl> lol... i give up. quickbooks, here i come! (j/k)

<jamest> fr2ty: we have no prepackaged app to do this
<jamest> but i feel the tools would be capable of doing it
<fr2ty> jamest: so i will follow the channel/site/and lists
<fr2ty> is there information designed for non-tech people already available? When do you expect the project to address such an audience?
<jamest> fr2ty: are you a developer or end user?
<fr2ty> end user
<fr2ty> this might not be the perfect channel for such questions anyway...
<jamest> it's the perfect channel for dang near anything you care to ask
<jamest> :)
<fr2ty> :-)
<jamest> this is a great way to get gnue info but people here are helpful whenever then can be about anything
<jamest> as for when....
<jamest> if gnue is anything it's slow moving with wild spurts of activity
<jamest> so I can't really give a timeline 
<fr2ty> Which mailing list would serve me best? 
<fr2ty> I don't mind following developer's discussions, I am pretty much interested in the interiors of such applications, although my programming skills are, hmmm, let's say,basic. (not the interpreter:-)
<fr2ty> I will dld and explore the GNUe tools, let's see what I can do. Thank you James, I  will come back some time later. Happy coding
<jamest> um
<fr2ty> yep?
<jamest> gnue@gnu.org would be best I think
<jamest> the developer list is ok too
<jamest> but IRC is probably a best bet for help
<jamest> as for the tools
<fr2ty> thx, I will subscribe to it. 
<jamest> i would play with gnue-designer and gnue-forms
<jamest> if you have a database installed
<fr2ty> good advice,  I will do that in the next few days and come back. Thank you.
<jamest> no prob
<fr2ty> mysql for example?
<jamest> should work fine
<fr2ty> ok
<jamest> we support lots of databases
<fr2ty> thx and out :-)
<jamest> we would not recommend mysql for biz data though
<jamest> s/we/a fair number of us in the channel
<fr2ty> yes, but it should work for my test cases. Now I have a really good point to start. Thank you.

<dtm> heheheh
<dtm> derek: dude, M$ has given $1B buyout offers to companies like Intuit.  i wonder if they've got a $1B Tux-flavored ace in the hole.
<dtm> unlike with those proprietary foolz like Intuit, it's not like they could threaten to destroy them in the marketplace.
<dtm> i recall the surfacing of a corporate memo from M$ to Intuit that said basically "if you refuse, just think of what we'll do to you in the marketplace with that $1B"
<dtm> as a threat
<dtm> i think that ended up in court iirc
<derek> well the big thing is there isnt much 'IP' to be had with Linux companies
<derek> in sense that redhats biggest asset is GPL
<dtm> heheh
<derek> and as you say they cant really threaten to put them under any more than they already are
<dtm> wow it would be amazing if somehow that protected them from M$ buyout, and kept redhat honest, almost like blood over the door on passover.
<derek> i.e. linux is enemy number one to them
<dtm> yeah
<dtm> what are they gonna do?  give away Windows servers?
<dtm> they do to some strategic customers, but not in masses like with IE
<derek> likely i would suspect that m$ buyout will be of someone like xandros
<derek> the people (investors) behind ximian/xandros and friends (LGP)
<derek> are shady money grubbers with no care for the validity of linux
<derek> if m$ waved the big dollars at them they would sell 
<derek> the thing is even if they did i dont know what damage it really would do in sense that code is GPL
<derek> though they would own the copyright of anything produced there
<derek> which would allow them to use in own products
<derek> at this point it might be cheaper for m$ to buy
<dtm> whoa.
<dtm> i had no idea.
<derek> SuSE, RedHat and Mandrake
ariel_ (~ariel@ppp-217-133-244-153.dialup.tiscali.it) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<derek> and simply shut them down
<dtm> so M$ could buy Ximian's parent and... yeah.  
<derek> i.e. at a billion a piece
<dtm> well sure  :)
<derek> 3 billion to shut down linux distribution and support channels should sound like a smoking deal to them :)
<dtm> i bet you there's a M$ war room somewhere wher ethey've played that out
Action: derek is away: work
<dtm> actually i wonder why they haven't done it.
<dtm> they do that stuff all the time.
<dtm> given M$'s paranoid-narcissistic perosnality, the only thing they could do with em is shut em down.  
<dtm> they're nothing but "competition"
<dtm> "threat"
<dtm> "enemy"
<dtm> they're of no use in operation.
<dtm> drivers, OS, personnel, marketing, and customer base.  all alien.
<dtm> heh and the IP.
<dtm> the copyrights owned by those companies are a way to poison or subvert the rest of the community
<dtm> geez, seriously, why dont they do this?
<dtm> they MUST have thought of this.
<dtm> if they took over ownership of copyrights held by SuSE or redhat or Ximian over core drivers, libraries, or kernel patches, they could some damage.
<dtm> well, the public would fork the older versions.
<dtm> as they stand today.
<dtm> so we'd lose some manpower, until the good employees quit a la Bero formerly of Redhat
<dtm> and form a new company  :>
<dtm> or go somewhere and continue to hax0r at least in spare time
<dtm> so unlike with a proprietary competitor, they could spend $1B apiece just to set us back a few years
<dtm> i wonder why they dont do that with key smaller companies like Wine or Ximian.  like illegal copying, that stuff does proliferate the use of M$ software which benefits M$ indirectly.
<dtm> i heard a statistic that 80% of all illegal copying ends up being profitable to the company, because it increases mindshare and skill
<dtm> whereas otherwise they would have used a competitor, something $0, or nothing at all
<dtm> which means that most illegal copiers are believed to have not been likely to buy software anyhow

<reinhard> re M$ could buy redhat, suse and mandrake and could shut down linux distribution worldwide

<esands> Say your've got a list of items with 40 fields, but you want to display 3 of them to select the correct item to edit
<esands> Excellent
<jcater> my picture was showing the greyed out lower records, though :)
<esands> Oh
<esands> What about the last blank un-greyed record?
<jcater> I did an insert record there

<jcater> can't sleep
<jcater> anyone know how I can take a file
<jcater> and output non-duplicate lines
<jcater> ?
<jcater> via command line?
Action: jcater thought there was a sort option, but can't find it
<Isomer> uniq 
<Isomer> ?
<Isomer> sort | uniq ?
<ajmitch> sort -u
<ajmitch> ?
<ajmitch> uniq is probably best
<Isomer> ajmitch: only if he has gnu sort :)
<jcater> ah
<jcater> cool
<jcater> both work
<jcater> the "man sort" page for -u
<jcater> is very misleading
<ajmitch> Isomer: there shall be no other! ;)
<jcater> as that's not what I got from reading it
Action: jcater is a debian-ite all the way
<jcater> so I'm sure it's gnu sort :)
<Isomer> ajmitch: yeah, but when people ask, it's polite to give them a command that will work naerly everywhere
<Isomer> also, sort -u doesn't have quite the same flags as uniq
<Isomer> uniq can use -d etc

<btami> hi
<btami> psu: have you got my e-mail?

<psu> btami: not yet. If it's what I think it is, it could easily take

<btami> it's that
<psu> well, KeithJagrs will be pleased ;-)
<KeithJagrs> ????
<psu> KeithJagrs: I managed to "persuade"£ btami to do us a 
<psu> Win .exe without the debug window as well
<KeithJagrs> yeah!
<KeithJagrs> how did you manage btami?
<psu> but given that btami has to e-mail it to me 
<psu> and then I have to uplaod it
<psu> on dial-up, it may take a few hours ;-)
<btami> console=0 in *.conf files
<btami> oh, sorry 
<KeithJagrs> well, I've thinking about it.  Maybe its better to have the debugging console. Specially in this early stages of gnue tools.
<KeithJagrs> so you can point  out the bugs
<KeithJagrs> psu: you are on dial-up? why?
<btami> this was the original reason i made it that way
<psu> I think it depends. If, like you, you want to put it in front of end-users
<psu> KeithJagrs: my cable company have been saying broadband is "imminent" for 18 months
<KeithJagrs> yes. but until now I've been just playing with forms or designer.
<psu> I'm afraid the week I finally break down &get it from the phone company instead
<psu> will be the week they finally offer it ;-)
<KeithJagrs> psu: where are you located?
<psu> Great Britain
<KeithJagrs> hmmm
<KeithJagrs> what about cable?
<KeithJagrs> o sorry.. i read phone company
<psu> my cable company have been saying broadband is "imminent" for 18 months ;-)
<KeithJagrs> then what about ISDN 
<psu> British Telecom have a wonderful attitude to broadband
<KeithJagrs> or ADSL or something
<psu> You go on the waiting list, and when they get 400 people on your exchange wanting it 
<psu> they consider it ;-)

<psu> compared to cable
<jcater> btami: howdy

<jcater> hrm
<psu> I just know that O'Toole's Rule will apply and the week I finally break down

<btami> i'm starting intro.gfd
<btami> then pgdn
<KeithJagrs> where in Great Britain, psu?

<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> ok possibly my last post didn't get through
<reinhard> so again:
<reinhard> hi psu
<reinhard> i have a few questions on the website
<KeithJagrs> hey 
<KeithJagrs> hey is there an organization chart for the GNUe project?
<psu> since when has joining #gnuenterprise been an "oops" ;-)
<reinhard> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/geas.php
<reinhard> seems to refer to old geasgeas
<reinhard> if it's not too much effort
<reinhard> i think it would be good to
<reinhard> a) rename the page to appserver.php and
<reinhard> b) take the text from appserver/README
<psu> KeithJagrs: bizarlly enough, I have the www.oxymoronlist.com site open as we speak ;-)
<reinhard> psu: lol
<psu> reinhard: it *should* refer to the new appserver - I will check 
<psu> I know the filename is wrong - same for /tools/gnurpc.php -> common.php
<KeithJagrs> heeh
<psu> no, the text is wrong too, isn't it?
<psu> I'll get that fixed
Action: psu will have to get the README text off the savannah web site as I don;t have
<psu> the code CVS checked at at the moment
<psu> My hard disc is full to bursting, so anything non-essential went 
<psu> (inc. frozen bubbles)
<KeithJagrs> I'd like to contribute to the gnue project. Not by coding, at first. I don't consider myself a programmer.
<nickr> Frozen Bubble IS essential
<psu> I need to re-partition and reduce the non-free partition on this PC
<KeithJagrs> I'd like to help in the definition of roadmap. I think it's essential
<psu> as I never use it any more
<psu> I agree. Biggest problem will be that we can't realistically put dates on 
<psu> as per mailing list
<psu> but 
<psu> we have cross-dependancies.
<psu> The one that has been most significant the last year has been 
<psu> we didn't really want to start on apps until we have a prototype app server
<KeithJagrs> I see
<psu> but this particular circle looks as if it is being squared 
<psu> I'm sure there will be others as we go 
<psu> e.g. Financials needs feature foo in Forms for feature bar
<psu> feature bar is in Financials 0.5, feature foo is in Forms 1.2
<KeithJagrs> yes. Maybe it is better to put efforts on tools first, then in packages
<psu> which originally have same release date targets, but one or other slips
<KeithJagrs> but foreseeing those needs
<psu> KeithJagrs: that's sort of what we've done, I guess
<KeithJagrs> well yes
<psu> the Tools are not pefect, but I think they belie their 0.x.0 or 0.0.x version numbers
<KeithJagrs> anyways
<psu> in terms of kick-ass functionality
Action: psu is learning fluent deke-speak ;-)
<KeithJagrs> hmm
<nickr> psu: you are good at this selling gnue thing
<KeithJagrs> so in terms of commercial apps, what would be some more accurate version numbers for the current releases? In your opinion..
<reinhard> psu: another point for appserver web page
<reinhard> there are two current documents (whitepaper and api doc)
<reinhard> IMHO it would make sense if the html version was online
<reinhard> (at least the html version that is) :)
<revDeke> if windows is on 2000 forms is at least at version 10.0
<KeithJagrs> heheeheeh
<revDeke> compared to other opensource (sic) stuff we are probably somewhere between 1.0 and 2.0
<revDeke> it all depends
<psu> reinhard: ok. Are these in CVS too? Or still in ~reinhard/ ?
<KeithJagrs> I mean, on the basis that version 1.0.0 is usually the one considered ready for production
<reinhard> they are in appserver/doc api whitepaper
<reinhard> you just have to do
<revDeke> apache, gtk and the likes were good about version numbering and so i think 0.4.0 is realistic if you use them as a baseline
<reinhard> make html
<reinhard> make ps
<reinhard> make pdf
<reinhard> etc.
<revDeke> if you use other projects claiming to be version 8.0 and such we are probably similar
<reinhard> revDeke: you refering to Exel 8.0 here?
<nickr> HP/UX Version 14
<reinhard> ;)
<psu> what is nola's version number ?
<reinhard> aehm i mean excel not exel
<reinhard> psu: last point
<revDeke> psu: dont know
<revDeke> i woudl label at a 0.2.0 right now (acclite)
<reinhard> i would like to see the "GNU Enterprise: Module Design Proposal" marked as "obsoleted"
<revDeke> and i expect it to ramp up VERY quickly
<reinhard> on http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/docs.php
<revDeke> as the low version number is simply because its not really tested
<revDeke> reinhard: i would not
<revDeke> i think its still pertinent
chillywilly (~danielb@mke-24-167-202-50.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> it needs updating but i plan to revive it very soon
<revDeke> as i plan on pumping out a lot of modules
<KeithJagrs> well
<revDeke> and i want something as my template... though i might replace it with an open office version
<KeithJagrs> what about roadmap, anyway?
<revDeke> i have been screaming roadmap for a bit
<revDeke> its not that simple though 
<revDeke> in due time
<chillywilly> reverend Deke?
<revDeke> yes
<chillywilly> hehe
<KeithJagrs> revDeke: cool
<revDeke> KeithJagrs: we have multiple things going on 
<KeithJagrs> good effort
<revDeke> so its hard to compile a road map
<revDeke> as things are interdependent
<chillywilly> well that's an excuse if I ever heard one ;
<chillywilly> ;)
<revDeke> so you need to do all roadmaps in a cohesive manner
<KeithJagrs> I think roadmap should be done on concensus. not one persons effort
<revDeke> yet thats huge task :)
Action: psu said that 
<revDeke> with lots of players
<psu> ;-)
<revDeke> i suspect someone will have to compile the TODOs of the tools and such
<revDeke> and make a draft roadmap
<revDeke> and solicit feedback
<chillywilly> blah, it's garbage night
<revDeke> and modify the feedback into the roadmaps, rinse and repeat a few times
<revDeke> and there is something go by
<chillywilly> I guess I should drag it out to the road
<KeithJagrs> revDeke: good idea
<revDeke> the other issue is getting a road map might not be too bad for the 'next' release but a good roadmap will include 2 to 3 releases out
<KeithJagrs> what about setting up a Wiki?
<revDeke> i dont care for wiki, but certainly folks can do so
<revDeke> i think wiki is good for user driven content that needs minimal controls
<revDeke> but official documentation, guides, roadmaps and such
<chillywilly> wiki good, deke baaad
<revDeke> that need tighter review and control are not good for wiki IMHO
<reinhard> psu: that's all
<reinhard> psu: if i can help you with the text (for appserver.php) or the docs please tell me
<chillywilly> hey hey reinhard
<nickr> most wikis these days allow you to have at least access control.
<reinhard> psu: not sure if there is a possibility that i could update the docs on the web page myself as often as i change them
<chillywilly> GGV has a local buffer overflow when reading corrupted
<chillywilly>  PS and PDF documents.
<reinhard> however it's bedtime today for me
<reinhard> night all
<psu> reinhard: we should have the web site in CVS real soon now
<psu> nite reinhard
<chillywilly> night reinhard
<KeithJagrs> nite reinhard
<psu> KeithJagrs: re. wiki, I refer to my post to the mailing list
<psu> we already have 10 channels of communication
<KeithJagrs> 10 channels?
Action: psu would support a wiki if it replaced some of those
<psu> rather than just became number 11
<KeithJagrs> ok

<KeithJagrs> chillywilly: ;)
<revDeke> webforums suck for developers
<revDeke> i have no problem people making what works best for them
<KeithJagrs> ok
<revDeke> but dont expect developers (those most capable of helping) to spread accross 15 different mediums
<nickr> mailing lists are great because they are easy to ignore
<nickr> it takes no effortr
<KeithJagrs> not for developers then. but for discussions on features an such.
<KeithJagrs> and roadmaps
<KeithJagrs> you have to ackowlede the advantages or forums for some uses
<KeithJagrs> they are easier to browse than a mailing lists archive

<chillywilly> a biomechanical ship
<chillywilly> that is a sentient being
<chillywilly> it has a pilot that is "bonded" to the shipt
<KeithJagrs> kind of like 2001 space odissey
<chillywilly> they are a race of aliens whose sole purpose it to travel space
<chillywilly> pilots that is
<chillywilly> not really
<chillywilly> Farscape has many stry lines

<chillywilly> it is really a cool story

<esands> doesn't generate sql though.  I just managed to get pgdesigner compiled. Simple but looks useful
<Mr_You> never heard of pgdesigner
<esands> http://www.hardgeus.com/projects/pgdesigner/
<esands> Couples others that run on linux I discover as well:
<esands> http://www.alzabo.org/ (perl nightmare to install, needs mason)
<Mr_You> pretty cool
<Mr_You> I wonder if you could build that into GNUe.
<Mr_You> maybe one day ;-)
Yurik_ (~yrashk@as5300.kharkov.ukrtel.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Mr_You> maybe GNUe Designer could have "New->Form" and "New->Schema" or somethin.

<esands> http://www.codebydesign.com/DataArchitect/ ($30, but lots of features)
<esands> I guess someone could pgdesigner is in c++
<Mr_You> hehe.. that picture in the corner is kinda funy
<esands> Problem is with SQL is that different DBs have different requirements 
<Mr_You> yeah, but you could possibly build it into the DB extraction routines.
<Mr_You> well, I guess it would only be useful for designer.
<Mr_You> unless you wanted to be able to create tables from a Form
<esands> True, I'm sure someone here is up to it. 8)
<esands> Definitely wouldn't want that from an admin pov.  
<Mr_You> whatcha mean?
<esands> Enough trouble keeping users safe as it is. 
<esands> Safe from doing something nasty to the system
<Mr_You> well.. to create/edit Forms it requires you have some sort of ability to build a database table.. as things get complicated a schema designer is a good addition to Form building.
<Mr_You> it would fit right in with Designer.
<Mr_You> right now I think it reads schemas
<esands> With that yes, but not from forms
<Mr_You> oh yeah I see ;-)
<esands> heh
<esands> What type of schemas does the designer read?
<Mr_You> what DBs?
<esands> pg
<Mr_You> actually I guess it just reads individual tables.
<esands> Yeah
<Mr_You> I believe the wizard will query your datasource (db table) and help build a form 
<Mr_You> so I mispoke.

<chillywilly> sigh
<Mr_You> thanks to you ;-)  or if someoneelse has mentioned it I haven't heard it

<derek> hopefully they will join efforts of GBN for what they are wanting
<derek> btw: i find it hilarious that Tony states he will not allow dictatorship and that peopel tried to over take FD
<derek> but then he acts like a dictator dictating what people want to do with this new incarnation
<ajmitch> yup
<derek> and its like wait if its a true 'democracy' if they dont agree with him he is out
<ajmitch> quite typical :)
<derek> but he doesnt liek that idea
<ajmitch> everyone gotta play by his rules
<derek> i didnt bother to make that assertion as when i speak generally his pants come unglued
<ajmitch> he 'owns' the FD idea, so everyone must give him credit :)
<derek> so just pitching GBN will probably put him in an uncrontrollable tantrum
<ajmitch> so?
<ajmitch> i don't think many people support him anymore
<derek> obviously im not too worried :)
<derek> but certainly i stayed quiet on my true feelings as to not 'fan flames'
<ajmitch> hopefully GBN could get a bit more exposure from this
<derek> i.e. im trying to be a good boy

<jcater> lol
<jcater> two messages in a row asking about Oracle 9i support
<derek> oracle rocks
<derek> my question is people looking for ERP that love oracle, why not looking at compiere ;)
<jcater> honestly, that's a good question
<jcater> I don't know if you asked in jest or not
<jcater> but I'd be curious as to why
<jcater> uggh!
<jcater> flu, flu, go away
<jcater> come back another day
<derek> both
ninja (rossg@home.golder.org) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> i was kind of kidding but kind of serious
<derek> as even if i had oracle i would want gnue :)
<derek> but most people dont care about doing it right
<derek> they just want instant gratification
Action: derek is away: work
ra3vat_ (~ds@ics.elcom.ru) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<pradhap> jcater: hi
<jcater> pradhap: howdy
<pradhap> jcater: di you see my mail ??
<derek> pradhap: did you see my question
<pradhap> jcater: did you see my mail ??
<derek> about if you use and have oracle 9i have you seen compiere
<derek> an 'open source' ERP built on oracle 9i and java?
<derek> it isnt a framework like gnue but its packages are far more complete
Action: derek thinks long term you are better off with gnue (and we do work with oracle)
<derek> but am curious if you saw compiere or not
<derek> btw: jcater responded to your email
<jcater> pradhap: you will need DCOracle2
<jcater> from
<jcater> http://www.zope.org/Members/matt/dco2/DCOracle2-1.2.tgz
<derek> ===========
<derek> You will need to install DCOracle2 (a Python Oracle driver) on your
<derek> Debian
<derek> machine in order to access Oracle. This can be obtained from: 
<derek>   http://www.zope.org/Members/matt/dco2/DCOracle2-1.2.tgz
<derek> Untar this file and run "python setup.py".  Be sure your $ORACLE_HOME
<derek> variable is properly set.  Also, on my setup, I have needed: 
<derek>    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib
<derek> at some point in the past. I don't think this had to be set on my most
<derek> recent upgrade, though. 
<derek> This will, of course, require the Oracle OCI8 client libraries on the
<derek> Debian machine. 
<derek> =====================
<jcater> yes, what derek said :)
<derek> i think there is a sample connections.conf entry in the sample as well
<derek> if not jcater can surely provide you with one
<pradhap> fine ..
<derek> or the documentation (new guide) will have one
<jcater> oops, I cut and pasted that response from another email
wayneg (~merlinx@ppp1514.qld.padsl.internode.on.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> so ignore that "on the Debian machine"
<derek> yeah its 'debian' specific
<jcater> if you are not on debian
<jcater> it's not debian specific
<derek> but you gave url for package so its relevant
<jcater> it requires the Oracle OCI8 libraries on whatever platform
<jcater> FreeBSD, Debian, Windows, RedHat, etc
<pradhap> ok
<jcater> my connections.conf file looks like:
<jcater> [op]
<jcater> comment = NCS Production
<jcater> provider = oracle
<jcater> service = PROD.DBS.NCSMAGS.COM
<jcater> just fyi
<pradhap> fine ..
<jcater> where PROD.DBS.NCSMAGS.COM is from my tnsnames.ora file
<jcater> I hope this helps
<jcater> we did answer your question, right?
<pradhap> yes ..
<pradhap> i will try to setup... if any queries, i will be back :-) to disturb you guys ..
<pradhap> thanks for your support guys ...
<jcater> no problem
<jcater> that's why we're here
<pradhap> :D
<pradhap> my doubt was that in zope website, it was give DCOracle2 driver works with Oracle 8... so i thought it will not be compatible with Oracle 9i
<pradhap> that's were i stuck ..
<jcater> well
<jcater> I *think* they are referring to the OCI version
<nickr> ydou guys heard of WSDL?
<jcater> which I don't think changed from Oracle8 to Oracle9
<jcater> I'm actually still on Oracle8
<jcater> so I can't verify that
<jcater> I hope it works for you though
<pradhap> ok i will verify i will mail you ....
<derek> i have
<derek> nickr: wasnt it predecessor to SOAP or a piece of it
<derek> Web Services Definition Language or something?
<nickr> derek: From what I read its like a nameservice for SOAP
<derek> yes
<nickr> Like all the w3c xml standards its terribly verbose
<nickr> http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl
<derek> fwiw: the microsoft .net guy couldnt shut up about this
<derek> which tells me a lot about what it probably means :)
<derek> in a nut shell
<nickr> I think the *concepts* of SOAP and WSDL are useful
<derek> microsoft wants to be the networksolutions
<derek> of WSDL
<nickr> I'm not sure about this particular iteration
<derek> all your WSDL belongs to m$
<nickr> Oh its not a global nameservice
<nickr> its a way of asking a particular host what interfaces they impliment
<nickr> like uhh
<nickr> that thing thatns part of sunrpc
<derek> no im telling you i got 5 DAYS of .net immersion about 4 months ago
<derek> one can run local WSDL
<derek> and one can run a WSDL server
<derek> but mickeysoft wants to control it
<nickr> Well sure
<derek> i.e. say quicken talks to banks via webservices
<nickr> if they are retargeting themselves as service-based
<derek> m$ wants to be the one that holds the WSDL stuff for that
<derek> under prepice
<nickr> makes sense
<derek> bank dont trust microsoft
<derek> quicken dont trust bank
<nickr> Seems silly when its not a big deal to host it yourself
<derek> everyone (sic) trusts microsoft
<derek> re-examine that sentence
<derek> seems silly = microsoft
<nickr> heh.
<derek> seems silly that one would use a global login designed and maintained by the fellows who bring us the I love you and klez
<derek> but m$ still thinks passport is a good idea
<derek> ok going to work for real now
<nickr> I think the concept of passport is good, although a more distributed implimentation would be better
<nickr> er
<nickr> rather
<nickr> a distributed network of trust
<pradhap> bye guys

<lawrence> derek still geting a Segmentation fault with gnue-forms
<lawrence> Splash screen comes up; then font chooser; then segv
<jcater> lawrence: font chooser?
<lawrence> gnue-designer is fine
ninja (rossg@home.golder.org) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<jcater> can you try running with the -s option, and seeing if it still segfaults?
<jcater> or has someone already talked you through this?
<lawrence> looks like -s option did the trick!
<jcater> you probably want to modify your gnue.conf file with: 
<jcater> [forms]
<jcater> disableSplash = 1
<jcater> then you won't have to use the -s option all the time
<jcater> we are having some issues with timeouts on our splash screen
<jcater> it rears it's ugly head on slower machines
<jcater> I guess we either need to find a solution, or disable the splashscreen by default :(
<lawrence> it is a timer issue; 
<lawrence> i don't do any thing an it segv
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> the problem is, if the splashscreen tries to disappear
<jcater> before the main screen is completely drawn
<jcater> it segfaults
<jcater> we can increase the timer more
<jcater> but that's avoiding the problem, not fixing it :)
<lawrence> slow machine? 1.4 athalon with a gig of memory not fast enough?
<jcater> wow
<jcater> this is the first time we've seen this problem
<jcater> on any thing faster than a 266Mhz
<jcater> what OS?
<lawrence> FreeBSD 4.6.2
<jcater> (not that it should matter)
<lawrence> thanks now I can play again

<Arturas> Hello
btami_ (~btami@3e70d731.dialin.enternet.hu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<btami_> hi all
<btami_> Arturas you here?
Nick change: btami_ -> btami
<Arturas> hi Bajusz
<btami> hi
<Arturas> yes, i'm here
<btami> i have this in my sitecustomize.py :
<btami> import sys, locale
<btami> loc = locale.getdefaultlocale()
<btami> if loc[1]:
<btami>   sys.setdefaultencoding(loc[1])
<btami> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, '')
<btami> print 'Default encoding: %s' %sys.getdefaultencoding()
<btami> print 'Locale conventions: %s' %locale.localeconv()
<btami> what do you think ?
<btami> in this way no need to set different encodings
<Arturas> if i understand you correctly
<Arturas> you're offering final user to modify his/her sitecustomize.py
<Arturas> to enable GNUe work with his/her encoding?
<btami> no and yes :)
<btami> i imagine that setup rocess puts sitecustomize.py 
<btami> into some right place
<Arturas> one linux guru noticed, that forcing users to modify sutecustomize.py is no good for several reasons - the most simpliest case would be some other software that needs current sitecustomize and it can't work with other sitecustomize and GNUe, that can't work with current sitecustomize
<Arturas> it's good for us as developers
<Arturas> it's good for some users
<Arturas> but we can't enforce this
<Arturas> and we should be able to support encodings as well as possible with current sitecustomize.py
<btami> maybe we can offer this if there isn't any sitecustomize.py
<Arturas> [i _think_ (i don't know this for sure) that installing python installs sitecustomize.py]   yes, we can :)
<btami> in win32 and python 2.1 2.2 the file doesn't exist per default
<btami> and i think forcing enduser to make this file 
<btami> then write somethong into it
<btami> not a frendly thing
<btami> plus he have to know what is your encoding name
<Arturas> the idea is pretty good, but currently for me is enough not working setup-cvs.py for windows :) :) :)
<btami> ok :)
<btami> l8r

<marioct> I'm new on python, so I can't find the problem .

<Arturas> no
<marioct> so..... what can I do ?
<marioct> :)
<Arturas> if you're not in a big hurry, you can wait for a day or so
<Arturas> we'll find someone who did debs and he'll take a look at it
<nickr> one of the js made them
<nickr> complain to them
<nickr> I think
<Arturas> there was something on mailing list...
<Arturas> one moment
<marioct> thanks.
<Arturas> marioct: you have all the dependencies, don't you?
<nickr> I don't think that error would occur if there were missing dependencies
<Arturas> what would occur then??
<nickr> It'd say it can't import something like mxtime or whatever
<nickr> Or the package wouldn't install
<nickr> its having trouble importing something internal to the package
<marioct> yes
<marioct> I have all the dependencies.
<Arturas> i don't find it in my mailbox, but i seem to remember there was something about it... maybe i'm mistakening

<marioct> what is Error: No Forms Definition File Specified. when I execute gnue-forms ?
<Arturas> you have to put some form file

<psu> conversion table is IIRC

<revDeke> currently they are for postgres
<revDeke> BUT
<revDeke> i plan (or someone else could) convert them to use GNUe Schema Definition
<revDeke> in which case all dbs woudl be supported :)
<lawrence> i ran some demos but they complained about no data 
<lawrence> tables don't exist
<revDeke> what demo?
<lawrence> zipcode stuff went in
<revDeke> jcater: im thinking maybe we make gear files
<revDeke> and navigator files
<revDeke> and one of the launchers on the navigator runs the actual db create scripts?
<lawrence> oh I never got to navigator yet, thanks.
<jcater> revDeke: I'm adding a resetForeignKey, but do note that you are programming for specific UI features
<jcater> if using a combo that way
<psu> for the record, both the downloads/current and downloads/releases dirs
<psu> now have both a debug-on.exe and debug-off.exe for Win 32
<psu> of the Tools 0.4.0a releases
<psu> thanks to btami for all the hard work
<jcater> 0.4.0a?
<psu> well, release 0.4.0, package a
<psu> i.e. still based on the 0.4.0 release tarball
<psu> but with "no wonder jcater hated mcmillan, but we finally got it working" packaging
<jcater> psu: it's a love/hate relationship

<revDeke> jcater: i dont fully understand your question complaint
<revDeke> i.e. resetForeignKey likely would solve my problem know
<revDeke> and i dont mind having to call triggers to get the behavior
<revDeke> i.e. im not saying the framework should do this automagically
<revDeke> perhaps im confused?
<jcater> nevermind
<revDeke> btw: where is the url to your open office user guide

<KeithJagrs> lawrence: are wanting?
<jcater> they are wanting a little TLC

<lawrence> The docs on the web site sell gnue very well

<siesel> hi all
<jcater> hi
<KeithJagrs> hi siesel
<siesel> jcater: btw. the new openoffice developer version should support docbook import+export
<jcater> siesel: not really
<jcater> they say that
<jcater> but that's what I'm using
<jcater> and it doesn't have it
<jcater> I think you need Java 1.4 installed
<jcater> plus a few other things
<siesel> yes, I tried it several times - even on WiNdOwS - but it didn't worked for me :(
<siesel> I thought you would probably have more luck ;)
<siesel> btw. what about the next release? will it be 0.4.1 (i.e. bugfixing) or a 0.5.0 ?
<jcater> my thinking: 
<jcater> if I get curses working well
<jcater> in short time
<jcater> 0.5.0
<jcater> if not, 0.4.1
<siesel> or even 0.6.0 looking at the speed you and jamest are commiting things ;)
<KeithJagrs> 0.5.0 ?? 0.6.0?
<KeithJagrs> it all depend on curses?
<jcater> ?
<jcater> 0.4.1 or 0.5.0
<jcater> curses and my developer's guide
<jcater> I don't want to go 0.5.0 without a good developer's guide finished
<jcater> well
<jcater> finished is a bad word
<jcater> usable :)
<siesel> btw. the developers guide is great. finally I know how to add timestamps, etc. :)

<revDeke> you see if you make a really great user guide and release it
<revDeke> and people find it useful
<revDeke> then when you release 0.5.0 and half the implementation is different
<revDeke> it makes for great luser torture :)
<siesel> that's the problem with documentation: you have to update it. :)
<lawrence> That is the problem with software not documentation. 
<nickr> they should add a feature to designer that makes spikes fly at the user's head
<revDeke> nickr: i think that is on roadmap for 6.6.6

<jcater> how weird
<jcater> which version?
<revDeke> as my linux boxes dont run novel services
<jcater> as I have 4.0 under win98
<revDeke> 4.05
<revDeke> btw: have you PRINTED it
<revDeke> as it looks fine in the viewer
<revDeke> its not until you print it that it looks goofy
<jcater> using acrobat reader for linux
<jcater> I've printed it
<jcater> oh, well
<revDeke> not a huge deal
<jcater> I'm sure ps2pdf is handling something incorrectly
<revDeke> as long as its not wide spread im not losing sleep
<revDeke> and it views fine
<jcater> I can use Acrobat Distiller come release time
<jcater> OpenOffice 643 has an "Export to PDF" menu option
<revDeke> well i would be curious if you make a distiller copy
<revDeke> if the problem goes away
<jcater> but she segfaults every single time I try it
<jcater> so as soon as OO gets that working
<jcater> I'm sure it'll be irrelevant
<jcater> I don't have distiller at home
<jcater> so can't test at the moment
<revDeke> thats ok we wont use distiller
<jcater> well
<jcater> ya know
<jcater> I think MS Word's Export as PDF works

<lawrence> emacs with etags works was the best I found so far
<lawrence> boa crashes
<jcater> kate has good syntax highlighting
<jcater> are you gnome or kde (or neither?)
<jcater> I've heard good things about gedit (for gtk or gnome)
<lawrence> I have major problems with gnome locking X11 
<revDeke> i like gedit a bit
<lawrence> so now i use KDE
<revDeke> im sorry
<revDeke> flux or blackbox is best
<nickr> scripto bold!
<revDeke> rock
<revDeke> actually i would like to try blackbox more
<revDeke> or some other light variants
<revDeke> its weird as now my main computer uses only flux and im used to it and dont feel like im 'missing' things
<revDeke> so its really hard to justify kde or gnome anymore
<revDeke> but for the wife gnome is great (she didnt like kde for some reason)
<revDeke> mainly cause she used the foot first
<revDeke> thats what we call it at our house :)
<revDeke> its not gnome its the foot
<jcater> lawrence: have you tried kate?
<lawrence> gnome is cute
<revDeke> so is kate ;)
<jcater> it's a standard part of KDE 3+
<lawrence> I have kate loaded but have not tried it
<revDeke> jcater how did you get kde3 on debian?
Action: jcater thinks it was in 2.2.2 as well, but 3+ is even better
<revDeke> can you send me the steps in an email?
<revDeke> as i need kde3 to make my music db program work
<revDeke> and i dont want to compile from scratch
<jcater> I could tell you
<jcater> but then I'd have to kill you
<revDeke> does that cost extra?
<lawrence> i ran kde compile and down load over night

ninja (rossg@home.golder.org) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> siesel: I hadn't finished the resetForeignKey stuff
<jcater> I just committed because I had to come home
<siesel> its the parameter stuff which made me changing stuff.
<jcater> ?
<siesel> i've made a form with two dropdowns. The user can choose a state in the first, and should choose a city in the next and will get displayed the zipcode in an style=label entry 
<siesel> the second dropdown is using a parameter in a condition to display just the cities from the state chosen in the first dropdown
<siesel> so I added a setParameter function. 
<jcater> hrm
<siesel> but that didn't work because of caching parameters values in the cparam class and 
<jcater> right
<siesel> because of the dbsig dbdriver replacing the staticCondidition by a preparsed string :(
<siesel> which is also the reason of passing a parameter in the command line is not working at the moment.
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I had intended on runtime parameters to be read only
Action: jcater is trying to think through your example
lawrence (~lawrence@bsd01.necessity.org) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<siesel> yes, thats (should runtime parameter be read only) was the thing I was not so shure about.
<jcater> I guess they don't have to be
<jcater> I suppose we can add a setParameter and get rid of the caching code
<siesel> other possibilities would be to have a 'populateForeignKey' or a 'add/change staticConditions'
<jcater> I doubt the caching code speeded things up much anyway
<siesel> So I will change the dbsig thing too.
<jcater> where's that at?
Action: jcater hadn't noticed it
<siesel> its in __conditiontoSQL  (_dbsig/DBdriver.py)
<siesel> the BAD line is: element._children[i] = self.__conditionToSQL(element._children[i])
<siesel> This will change the GObj tree.
<jcater> well, phooey
Action: jcater wonders what kind of performance hit a change like that will make
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I wonder....
<jcater> should we NOT modify the GObj tree in _dbsig
<jcater> but still create the static condition
<jcater> but add an invalidateCachedConditions() method
<siesel> it will only change the staticConditions, because the rest will allways be newly created
<jcater> ?
<siesel> the dbsig stuff is not REALLY caching anything, but just overwriting child nodes.
<siesel> f.e. 1. time:  and(eq(obj('state'),obj('NY')),gr(obj('sales'),obj('21'))))
<siesel> 2. time:  and("state = NY","sales>21")
<siesel> but its not important how it works now. its important how it should work.
<jcater> it recursively changes stuff until you are left with a single string
<jcater> so that it only has to do that once
<siesel> yes, but the only caching it is doing is to store these strings into the child nodes instead of the old GObjects
<jcater> in the end, there's only one node
<siesel> BUT the whole string should be stored at an other place and the child nodes should be left alone
<jcater> I said that earlier :)
<jcater> <jcater> I wonder....
<jcater> <jcater> should we NOT modify the GObj tree in _dbsig
<jcater> <jcater> but still create the static condition
<jcater> <jcater> but add an invalidateCachedConditions() method
<jcater> maybe not plainly enough
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> there's not a clean solution to this
<jcater> to have changable runtime parameters
<jcater> I guess there are a few cases where that would be desirable, though
<siesel> the other possibility would be to change the staticConditions 
<siesel> using a trigger.
Action: jcater isn't sure what you're calling staticConditions
<jcater> is this the string that's finally built from __conditionsToSQL?
<siesel> no, thats a link from GDataObject to the <condition> childs of a GDatasource
<jcater> ah
<siesel> it is always combined with the "dynamic condition" to build a resultset
<jcater> ok, now it's coming back to me :)
<jcater> so you are thinking we could add a setCondition(<GCondition tree>) method to GDataSource?
<jcater> or something like that
<siesel> that would be great.
<jcater> ok
<jcater> works for me
<siesel> its just a bit OVERKILL for just changing a parameter
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-163.wasp.net.au) left irc: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)
<siesel> I mean, I would like to have both possibilities.
<jcater> true
<jcater> *but*
<jcater> what you are describing is not the typical case
<jcater> err, typical use of a parameter
<jcater> although I'm not opposed to having a setParameter
<jcater> as long as we don't add much more overhead to datasources
<jcater> that's my biggest fear
<jcater> e.g., I have one report using GNUe Reports right now
<jcater> that's a master/detail report
<jcater> there's approx 1,800 records in the master datasource
<jcater> so that's 1,800 times the child datasource is run
Action: jcater is just describing his current GNUe Reports usage
<jcater> I have much more complex reports to do
<siesel> my actual patch to have parameter working is just to NOT cache the static part of the parameters

<jcater> ok
lawrence (~lawrence@bsd01.necessity.org) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> If reports is getting too slow we still can add caching, and probably in a better way :)
<jcater> so, the plans are to add a DataSource.setCondition() and a Form.setParameter() and remove parameter caching?
<jcater> we can see how that works
<jcater> I may be worried about nothing :)
<jcater> but you do understand my worry about reports, right?
<siesel> I fully understand.
<siesel> And I finally know why you add that caching line to parameters
