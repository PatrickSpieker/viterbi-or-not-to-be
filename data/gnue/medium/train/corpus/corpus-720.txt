<chillywilly> hi reinhard
<reinhard> good morning
<furiousbl> I'm sorry if this is off topic, but can someone recommend a light weight erp that will run on NT? I've decided not to use gnuenterprise because a) I have no linux experience/skills , b) my company is very small (8 employees).
<ajmitch> GNUe runs on NT :)
<furiousbl> the app server too?
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> ask reinhard about appserver stuff
<reinhard> which appserver?
<reinhard> do we have an appserver?
<reinhard> (j/k)
<furiousbl> from the faq : "The GNUe Application Server works natively on Mac OS X. It does not currently work on Windows, but support is anticipated. "
<furiousbl> i take it the faq is out of date ? :)
<reinhard> probably
<reinhard> i have to talk to psu about the web page
<reinhard> much of it is out of date wrt appserver
<reinhard> because there's much on the web page that still refers to GEAS (v1)
<furiousbl> what version is it at now?
<reinhard> to make clear: it's not psu's _fault_, but he's the one that can fix it :)
<reinhard> furiousbl: what we call GEAS (v1) is an application server that we got contributed
<reinhard> however after some time of hacking in that code we decided to rewrite from scratch
<reinhard> which we now call "appserver" to have a clear distinction
<furiousbl> i c!
<furiousbl> sorry if I sound a bit thick, I'm quite by the sheer size/scale of the project
<furiousbl> i wish there was an idiots guide to gnuenterprise (I might even write one if I ever get it up and running)
<furiousbl> to make sure i've got this right, to get gnuenterpise running on NT, i need :
<furiousbl> -oracle db
<furiousbl> -gnu enterprise tools
<furiousbl> - one or more gnuenterprise packages
<furiousbl> am I missing something?
<reinhard> um....
<reinhard> i think we have to tell you that there are no gnuenterprise packages yet...
<reinhard> well to be precise there are some qite usable samples
<furiousbl> lol... 'scuse me while I go and cry
<reinhard> but if you are after "accounting" or "invoicing" then you'd have to wait
<reinhard> there are some ready to use apps that are managed under the "roof" of the gnuenterprise meta project
<reinhard> like nola or acclite
<reinhard> but there are no "gnuenterprise packages" yet
<furiousbl> i c
<furiousbl> so to install an app like nola or acclite, i still need gnuenterprise tools and oracle?
<reinhard> i think no
<reinhard> however i really don't know them
<furiousbl> ok, thanks for your help reinhard
<reinhard> maybe somebody else can help here??
<furiousbl> looks like it's back to the drawing board :)
<reinhard> sorry, we're working on it :)
<furiousbl> don't apologise! what are my other options? shell out $$$$$ to sap or peoplesoft? no thanks
<furiousbl> i hope one day my business is bg enought o justify running gnuenterprise :)
<reinhard> well
<reinhard> one of the goals of gnuenterprise is to fit even the smalles business
<ajmitch> oracle is certainly not a requirement, thankfully! :)
<ajmitch> it is just one of the supported databases
<furiousbl> sorry, i was thinking of compiere
<furiousbl> out of curiosity, if there are no packags, who uses gnuenterprise at the moment? people who write their own packages?
<ajmitch> yeah, custom systems that use forms & reports
<furiousbl> i found nola, but I can't find a homepage for acclite.. does anyone have a url please?
<ajmitch> nope, not yet :)
<furiousbl> let me guess... acclite is in alpha or pre-releaset oo right?
<ajmitch> acclite is nola with patches & extra stuff :)
<ajmitch> afaik
<furiousbl> lol... i give up. quickbooks, here i come! (j/k)

<jamest> fr2ty: we have no prepackaged app to do this
<jamest> but i feel the tools would be capable of doing it
<fr2ty> jamest: so i will follow the channel/site/and lists
<fr2ty> is there information designed for non-tech people already available? When do you expect the project to address such an audience?
<jamest> fr2ty: are you a developer or end user?
<fr2ty> end user
<fr2ty> this might not be the perfect channel for such questions anyway...
<jamest> it's the perfect channel for dang near anything you care to ask
<jamest> :)
<fr2ty> :-)
<jamest> this is a great way to get gnue info but people here are helpful whenever then can be about anything
<jamest> as for when....
<jamest> if gnue is anything it's slow moving with wild spurts of activity
<jamest> so I can't really give a timeline 
<fr2ty> Which mailing list would serve me best? 
<fr2ty> I don't mind following developer's discussions, I am pretty much interested in the interiors of such applications, although my programming skills are, hmmm, let's say,basic. (not the interpreter:-)
<fr2ty> I will dld and explore the GNUe tools, let's see what I can do. Thank you James, I  will come back some time later. Happy coding
<jamest> um
<fr2ty> yep?
<jamest> gnue@gnu.org would be best I think
<jamest> the developer list is ok too
<jamest> but IRC is probably a best bet for help
<jamest> as for the tools
<fr2ty> thx, I will subscribe to it. 
<jamest> i would play with gnue-designer and gnue-forms
<jamest> if you have a database installed
<fr2ty> good advice,  I will do that in the next few days and come back. Thank you.
<jamest> no prob
<fr2ty> mysql for example?
<jamest> should work fine
<fr2ty> ok
<jamest> we support lots of databases
<fr2ty> thx and out :-)
<jamest> we would not recommend mysql for biz data though
<jamest> s/we/a fair number of us in the channel
<fr2ty> yes, but it should work for my test cases. Now I have a really good point to start. Thank you.

<dtm> heheheh
<dtm> derek: dude, M$ has given $1B buyout offers to companies like Intuit.  i wonder if they've got a $1B Tux-flavored ace in the hole.
<dtm> unlike with those proprietary foolz like Intuit, it's not like they could threaten to destroy them in the marketplace.
<dtm> i recall the surfacing of a corporate memo from M$ to Intuit that said basically "if you refuse, just think of what we'll do to you in the marketplace with that $1B"
<dtm> as a threat
<dtm> i think that ended up in court iirc
<derek> well the big thing is there isnt much 'IP' to be had with Linux companies
<derek> in sense that redhats biggest asset is GPL
<dtm> heheh
<derek> and as you say they cant really threaten to put them under any more than they already are
<dtm> wow it would be amazing if somehow that protected them from M$ buyout, and kept redhat honest, almost like blood over the door on passover.
<derek> i.e. linux is enemy number one to them
<dtm> yeah
<dtm> what are they gonna do?  give away Windows servers?
<dtm> they do to some strategic customers, but not in masses like with IE
<derek> likely i would suspect that m$ buyout will be of someone like xandros
<derek> the people (investors) behind ximian/xandros and friends (LGP)
<derek> are shady money grubbers with no care for the validity of linux
<derek> if m$ waved the big dollars at them they would sell 
<derek> the thing is even if they did i dont know what damage it really would do in sense that code is GPL
<derek> though they would own the copyright of anything produced there
<derek> which would allow them to use in own products
<derek> at this point it might be cheaper for m$ to buy
<dtm> whoa.
<dtm> i had no idea.
<derek> SuSE, RedHat and Mandrake
ariel_ (~ariel@ppp-217-133-244-153.dialup.tiscali.it) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<derek> and simply shut them down
<dtm> so M$ could buy Ximian's parent and... yeah.  
<derek> i.e. at a billion a piece
<dtm> well sure  :)
<derek> 3 billion to shut down linux distribution and support channels should sound like a smoking deal to them :)
<dtm> i bet you there's a M$ war room somewhere wher ethey've played that out
Action: derek is away: work
<dtm> actually i wonder why they haven't done it.
<dtm> they do that stuff all the time.
<dtm> given M$'s paranoid-narcissistic perosnality, the only thing they could do with em is shut em down.  
<dtm> they're nothing but "competition"
<dtm> "threat"
<dtm> "enemy"
<dtm> they're of no use in operation.
<dtm> drivers, OS, personnel, marketing, and customer base.  all alien.
<dtm> heh and the IP.
<dtm> the copyrights owned by those companies are a way to poison or subvert the rest of the community
<dtm> geez, seriously, why dont they do this?
<dtm> they MUST have thought of this.
<dtm> if they took over ownership of copyrights held by SuSE or redhat or Ximian over core drivers, libraries, or kernel patches, they could some damage.
<dtm> well, the public would fork the older versions.
<dtm> as they stand today.
<dtm> so we'd lose some manpower, until the good employees quit a la Bero formerly of Redhat
<dtm> and form a new company  :>
<dtm> or go somewhere and continue to hax0r at least in spare time
<dtm> so unlike with a proprietary competitor, they could spend $1B apiece just to set us back a few years
<dtm> i wonder why they dont do that with key smaller companies like Wine or Ximian.  like illegal copying, that stuff does proliferate the use of M$ software which benefits M$ indirectly.
<dtm> i heard a statistic that 80% of all illegal copying ends up being profitable to the company, because it increases mindshare and skill
<dtm> whereas otherwise they would have used a competitor, something $0, or nothing at all
<dtm> which means that most illegal copiers are believed to have not been likely to buy software anyhow

<reinhard> re M$ could buy redhat, suse and mandrake and could shut down linux distribution worldwide

<esands> Say your've got a list of items with 40 fields, but you want to display 3 of them to select the correct item to edit
<esands> Excellent
<jcater> my picture was showing the greyed out lower records, though :)
<esands> Oh
<esands> What about the last blank un-greyed record?
<jcater> I did an insert record there

<jcater> can't sleep
<jcater> anyone know how I can take a file
<jcater> and output non-duplicate lines
<jcater> ?
<jcater> via command line?
Action: jcater thought there was a sort option, but can't find it
<Isomer> uniq 
<Isomer> ?
<Isomer> sort | uniq ?
<ajmitch> sort -u
<ajmitch> ?
<ajmitch> uniq is probably best
<Isomer> ajmitch: only if he has gnu sort :)
<jcater> ah
<jcater> cool
<jcater> both work
<jcater> the "man sort" page for -u
<jcater> is very misleading
<ajmitch> Isomer: there shall be no other! ;)
<jcater> as that's not what I got from reading it
Action: jcater is a debian-ite all the way
<jcater> so I'm sure it's gnu sort :)
<Isomer> ajmitch: yeah, but when people ask, it's polite to give them a command that will work naerly everywhere
<Isomer> also, sort -u doesn't have quite the same flags as uniq
<Isomer> uniq can use -d etc

<btami> hi
<btami> psu: have you got my e-mail?

<psu> btami: not yet. If it's what I think it is, it could easily take

<btami> it's that
<psu> well, KeithJagrs will be pleased ;-)
<KeithJagrs> ????
<psu> KeithJagrs: I managed to "persuade"£ btami to do us a 
<psu> Win .exe without the debug window as well
<KeithJagrs> yeah!
<KeithJagrs> how did you manage btami?
<psu> but given that btami has to e-mail it to me 
<psu> and then I have to uplaod it
<psu> on dial-up, it may take a few hours ;-)
<btami> console=0 in *.conf files
<btami> oh, sorry 
<KeithJagrs> well, I've thinking about it.  Maybe its better to have the debugging console. Specially in this early stages of gnue tools.
<KeithJagrs> so you can point  out the bugs
<KeithJagrs> psu: you are on dial-up? why?
<btami> this was the original reason i made it that way
<psu> I think it depends. If, like you, you want to put it in front of end-users
<psu> KeithJagrs: my cable company have been saying broadband is "imminent" for 18 months
<KeithJagrs> yes. but until now I've been just playing with forms or designer.
<psu> I'm afraid the week I finally break down &get it from the phone company instead
<psu> will be the week they finally offer it ;-)
<KeithJagrs> psu: where are you located?
<psu> Great Britain
<KeithJagrs> hmmm
<KeithJagrs> what about cable?
<KeithJagrs> o sorry.. i read phone company
<psu> my cable company have been saying broadband is "imminent" for 18 months ;-)
<KeithJagrs> then what about ISDN 
<psu> British Telecom have a wonderful attitude to broadband
<KeithJagrs> or ADSL or something
<psu> You go on the waiting list, and when they get 400 people on your exchange wanting it 
<psu> they consider it ;-)

<psu> compared to cable
<jcater> btami: howdy

<jcater> hrm
<psu> I just know that O'Toole's Rule will apply and the week I finally break down

<btami> i'm starting intro.gfd
<btami> then pgdn
<KeithJagrs> where in Great Britain, psu?

<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> ok possibly my last post didn't get through
<reinhard> so again:
<reinhard> hi psu
<reinhard> i have a few questions on the website
<KeithJagrs> hey 
<KeithJagrs> hey is there an organization chart for the GNUe project?
<psu> since when has joining #gnuenterprise been an "oops" ;-)
<reinhard> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/geas.php
<reinhard> seems to refer to old geasgeas
<reinhard> if it's not too much effort
<reinhard> i think it would be good to
<reinhard> a) rename the page to appserver.php and
<reinhard> b) take the text from appserver/README
<psu> KeithJagrs: bizarlly enough, I have the www.oxymoronlist.com site open as we speak ;-)
<reinhard> psu: lol
<psu> reinhard: it *should* refer to the new appserver - I will check 
<psu> I know the filename is wrong - same for /tools/gnurpc.php -> common.php
<KeithJagrs> heeh
<psu> no, the text is wrong too, isn't it?
<psu> I'll get that fixed
Action: psu will have to get the README text off the savannah web site as I don;t have
<psu> the code CVS checked at at the moment
<psu> My hard disc is full to bursting, so anything non-essential went 
<psu> (inc. frozen bubbles)
<KeithJagrs> I'd like to contribute to the gnue project. Not by coding, at first. I don't consider myself a programmer.
<nickr> Frozen Bubble IS essential
<psu> I need to re-partition and reduce the non-free partition on this PC
<KeithJagrs> I'd like to help in the definition of roadmap. I think it's essential
<psu> as I never use it any more
<psu> I agree. Biggest problem will be that we can't realistically put dates on 
<psu> as per mailing list
<psu> but 
<psu> we have cross-dependancies.
<psu> The one that has been most significant the last year has been 
<psu> we didn't really want to start on apps until we have a prototype app server
<KeithJagrs> I see
<psu> but this particular circle looks as if it is being squared 
<psu> I'm sure there will be others as we go 
<psu> e.g. Financials needs feature foo in Forms for feature bar
<psu> feature bar is in Financials 0.5, feature foo is in Forms 1.2
<KeithJagrs> yes. Maybe it is better to put efforts on tools first, then in packages
<psu> which originally have same release date targets, but one or other slips
<KeithJagrs> but foreseeing those needs
<psu> KeithJagrs: that's sort of what we've done, I guess
<KeithJagrs> well yes
<psu> the Tools are not pefect, but I think they belie their 0.x.0 or 0.0.x version numbers
<KeithJagrs> anyways
<psu> in terms of kick-ass functionality
Action: psu is learning fluent deke-speak ;-)
<KeithJagrs> hmm
<nickr> psu: you are good at this selling gnue thing
<KeithJagrs> so in terms of commercial apps, what would be some more accurate version numbers for the current releases? In your opinion..
<reinhard> psu: another point for appserver web page
<reinhard> there are two current documents (whitepaper and api doc)
<reinhard> IMHO it would make sense if the html version was online
<reinhard> (at least the html version that is) :)
<revDeke> if windows is on 2000 forms is at least at version 10.0
<KeithJagrs> heheeheeh
<revDeke> compared to other opensource (sic) stuff we are probably somewhere between 1.0 and 2.0
<revDeke> it all depends
<psu> reinhard: ok. Are these in CVS too? Or still in ~reinhard/ ?
<KeithJagrs> I mean, on the basis that version 1.0.0 is usually the one considered ready for production
<reinhard> they are in appserver/doc api whitepaper
<reinhard> you just have to do
<revDeke> apache, gtk and the likes were good about version numbering and so i think 0.4.0 is realistic if you use them as a baseline
<reinhard> make html
<reinhard> make ps
<reinhard> make pdf
<reinhard> etc.
<revDeke> if you use other projects claiming to be version 8.0 and such we are probably similar
<reinhard> revDeke: you refering to Exel 8.0 here?
<nickr> HP/UX Version 14
<reinhard> ;)
<psu> what is nola's version number ?
<reinhard> aehm i mean excel not exel
<reinhard> psu: last point
<revDeke> psu: dont know
<revDeke> i woudl label at a 0.2.0 right now (acclite)
<reinhard> i would like to see the "GNU Enterprise: Module Design Proposal" marked as "obsoleted"
<revDeke> and i expect it to ramp up VERY quickly
<reinhard> on http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/docs.php
<revDeke> as the low version number is simply because its not really tested
<revDeke> reinhard: i would not
<revDeke> i think its still pertinent
chillywilly (~danielb@mke-24-167-202-50.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> it needs updating but i plan to revive it very soon
<revDeke> as i plan on pumping out a lot of modules
<KeithJagrs> well
<revDeke> and i want something as my template... though i might replace it with an open office version
<KeithJagrs> what about roadmap, anyway?
<revDeke> i have been screaming roadmap for a bit
<revDeke> its not that simple though 
<revDeke> in due time
<chillywilly> reverend Deke?
<revDeke> yes
<chillywilly> hehe
<KeithJagrs> revDeke: cool
<revDeke> KeithJagrs: we have multiple things going on 
<KeithJagrs> good effort
<revDeke> so its hard to compile a road map
<revDeke> as things are interdependent
<chillywilly> well that's an excuse if I ever heard one ;
<chillywilly> ;)
<revDeke> so you need to do all roadmaps in a cohesive manner
<KeithJagrs> I think roadmap should be done on concensus. not one persons effort
<revDeke> yet thats huge task :)
Action: psu said that 
<revDeke> with lots of players
<psu> ;-)
<revDeke> i suspect someone will have to compile the TODOs of the tools and such
<revDeke> and make a draft roadmap
<revDeke> and solicit feedback
<chillywilly> blah, it's garbage night
<revDeke> and modify the feedback into the roadmaps, rinse and repeat a few times
<revDeke> and there is something go by
<chillywilly> I guess I should drag it out to the road
<KeithJagrs> revDeke: good idea
<revDeke> the other issue is getting a road map might not be too bad for the 'next' release but a good roadmap will include 2 to 3 releases out
<KeithJagrs> what about setting up a Wiki?
<revDeke> i dont care for wiki, but certainly folks can do so
<revDeke> i think wiki is good for user driven content that needs minimal controls
<revDeke> but official documentation, guides, roadmaps and such
<chillywilly> wiki good, deke baaad
<revDeke> that need tighter review and control are not good for wiki IMHO
<reinhard> psu: that's all
<reinhard> psu: if i can help you with the text (for appserver.php) or the docs please tell me
<chillywilly> hey hey reinhard
<nickr> most wikis these days allow you to have at least access control.
<reinhard> psu: not sure if there is a possibility that i could update the docs on the web page myself as often as i change them
<chillywilly> GGV has a local buffer overflow when reading corrupted
<chillywilly>  PS and PDF documents.
<reinhard> however it's bedtime today for me
<reinhard> night all
<psu> reinhard: we should have the web site in CVS real soon now
<psu> nite reinhard
<chillywilly> night reinhard
<KeithJagrs> nite reinhard
<psu> KeithJagrs: re. wiki, I refer to my post to the mailing list
<psu> we already have 10 channels of communication
<KeithJagrs> 10 channels?
Action: psu would support a wiki if it replaced some of those
<psu> rather than just became number 11
<KeithJagrs> ok

<KeithJagrs> chillywilly: ;)
<revDeke> webforums suck for developers
<revDeke> i have no problem people making what works best for them
<KeithJagrs> ok
<revDeke> but dont expect developers (those most capable of helping) to spread accross 15 different mediums
<nickr> mailing lists are great because they are easy to ignore
<nickr> it takes no effortr
<KeithJagrs> not for developers then. but for discussions on features an such.
<KeithJagrs> and roadmaps
<KeithJagrs> you have to ackowlede the advantages or forums for some uses
<KeithJagrs> they are easier to browse than a mailing lists archive

<chillywilly> a biomechanical ship
<chillywilly> that is a sentient being
<chillywilly> it has a pilot that is "bonded" to the shipt
<KeithJagrs> kind of like 2001 space odissey
<chillywilly> they are a race of aliens whose sole purpose it to travel space
<chillywilly> pilots that is
<chillywilly> not really
<chillywilly> Farscape has many stry lines

<chillywilly> it is really a cool story

<esands> doesn't generate sql though.  I just managed to get pgdesigner compiled. Simple but looks useful
<Mr_You> never heard of pgdesigner
<esands> http://www.hardgeus.com/projects/pgdesigner/
<esands> Couples others that run on linux I discover as well:
<esands> http://www.alzabo.org/ (perl nightmare to install, needs mason)
<Mr_You> pretty cool
<Mr_You> I wonder if you could build that into GNUe.
<Mr_You> maybe one day ;-)
Yurik_ (~yrashk@as5300.kharkov.ukrtel.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Mr_You> maybe GNUe Designer could have "New->Form" and "New->Schema" or somethin.

<esands> http://www.codebydesign.com/DataArchitect/ ($30, but lots of features)
<esands> I guess someone could pgdesigner is in c++
<Mr_You> hehe.. that picture in the corner is kinda funy
<esands> Problem is with SQL is that different DBs have different requirements 
<Mr_You> yeah, but you could possibly build it into the DB extraction routines.
<Mr_You> well, I guess it would only be useful for designer.
<Mr_You> unless you wanted to be able to create tables from a Form
<esands> True, I'm sure someone here is up to it. 8)
<esands> Definitely wouldn't want that from an admin pov.  
<Mr_You> whatcha mean?
<esands> Enough trouble keeping users safe as it is. 
<esands> Safe from doing something nasty to the system
<Mr_You> well.. to create/edit Forms it requires you have some sort of ability to build a database table.. as things get complicated a schema designer is a good addition to Form building.
<Mr_You> it would fit right in with Designer.
<Mr_You> right now I think it reads schemas
<esands> With that yes, but not from forms
<Mr_You> oh yeah I see ;-)
<esands> heh
<esands> What type of schemas does the designer read?
<Mr_You> what DBs?
<esands> pg
<Mr_You> actually I guess it just reads individual tables.
<esands> Yeah
<Mr_You> I believe the wizard will query your datasource (db table) and help build a form 
<Mr_You> so I mispoke.

<chillywilly> sigh
<Mr_You> thanks to you ;-)  or if someoneelse has mentioned it I haven't heard it

<derek> hopefully they will join efforts of GBN for what they are wanting
<derek> btw: i find it hilarious that Tony states he will not allow dictatorship and that peopel tried to over take FD
<derek> but then he acts like a dictator dictating what people want to do with this new incarnation
<ajmitch> yup
<derek> and its like wait if its a true 'democracy' if they dont agree with him he is out
<ajmitch> quite typical :)
<derek> but he doesnt liek that idea
<ajmitch> everyone gotta play by his rules
<derek> i didnt bother to make that assertion as when i speak generally his pants come unglued
<ajmitch> he 'owns' the FD idea, so everyone must give him credit :)
<derek> so just pitching GBN will probably put him in an uncrontrollable tantrum
<ajmitch> so?
<ajmitch> i don't think many people support him anymore
<derek> obviously im not too worried :)
<derek> but certainly i stayed quiet on my true feelings as to not 'fan flames'
<ajmitch> hopefully GBN could get a bit more exposure from this
<derek> i.e. im trying to be a good boy

<jcater> lol
<jcater> two messages in a row asking about Oracle 9i support
<derek> oracle rocks
<derek> my question is people looking for ERP that love oracle, why not looking at compiere ;)
<jcater> honestly, that's a good question
<jcater> I don't know if you asked in jest or not
<jcater> but I'd be curious as to why
<jcater> uggh!
<jcater> flu, flu, go away
<jcater> come back another day
<derek> both
ninja (rossg@home.golder.org) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> i was kind of kidding but kind of serious
<derek> as even if i had oracle i would want gnue :)
<derek> but most people dont care about doing it right
<derek> they just want instant gratification
Action: derek is away: work
ra3vat_ (~ds@ics.elcom.ru) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<pradhap> jcater: hi
<jcater> pradhap: howdy
<pradhap> jcater: di you see my mail ??
<derek> pradhap: did you see my question
<pradhap> jcater: did you see my mail ??
<derek> about if you use and have oracle 9i have you seen compiere
<derek> an 'open source' ERP built on oracle 9i and java?
<derek> it isnt a framework like gnue but its packages are far more complete
Action: derek thinks long term you are better off with gnue (and we do work with oracle)
<derek> but am curious if you saw compiere or not
<derek> btw: jcater responded to your email
<jcater> pradhap: you will need DCOracle2
<jcater> from
<jcater> http://www.zope.org/Members/matt/dco2/DCOracle2-1.2.tgz
<derek> ===========
<derek> You will need to install DCOracle2 (a Python Oracle driver) on your
<derek> Debian
<derek> machine in order to access Oracle. This can be obtained from: 
<derek>   http://www.zope.org/Members/matt/dco2/DCOracle2-1.2.tgz
<derek> Untar this file and run "python setup.py".  Be sure your $ORACLE_HOME
<derek> variable is properly set.  Also, on my setup, I have needed: 
<derek>    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib
<derek> at some point in the past. I don't think this had to be set on my most
<derek> recent upgrade, though. 
<derek> This will, of course, require the Oracle OCI8 client libraries on the
<derek> Debian machine. 
<derek> =====================
<jcater> yes, what derek said :)
<derek> i think there is a sample connections.conf entry in the sample as well
<derek> if not jcater can surely provide you with one
<pradhap> fine ..
<derek> or the documentation (new guide) will have one
<jcater> oops, I cut and pasted that response from another email
wayneg (~merlinx@ppp1514.qld.padsl.internode.on.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> so ignore that "on the Debian machine"
<derek> yeah its 'debian' specific
<jcater> if you are not on debian
<jcater> it's not debian specific
<derek> but you gave url for package so its relevant
<jcater> it requires the Oracle OCI8 libraries on whatever platform
<jcater> FreeBSD, Debian, Windows, RedHat, etc
<pradhap> ok
<jcater> my connections.conf file looks like:
<jcater> [op]
<jcater> comment = NCS Production
<jcater> provider = oracle
<jcater> service = PROD.DBS.NCSMAGS.COM
<jcater> just fyi
<pradhap> fine ..
<jcater> where PROD.DBS.NCSMAGS.COM is from my tnsnames.ora file
<jcater> I hope this helps
<jcater> we did answer your question, right?
<pradhap> yes ..
<pradhap> i will try to setup... if any queries, i will be back :-) to disturb you guys ..
<pradhap> thanks for your support guys ...
<jcater> no problem
<jcater> that's why we're here
<pradhap> :D
<pradhap> my doubt was that in zope website, it was give DCOracle2 driver works with Oracle 8... so i thought it will not be compatible with Oracle 9i
<pradhap> that's were i stuck ..
<jcater> well
<jcater> I *think* they are referring to the OCI version
<nickr> ydou guys heard of WSDL?
<jcater> which I don't think changed from Oracle8 to Oracle9
<jcater> I'm actually still on Oracle8
<jcater> so I can't verify that
<jcater> I hope it works for you though
<pradhap> ok i will verify i will mail you ....
<derek> i have
<derek> nickr: wasnt it predecessor to SOAP or a piece of it
<derek> Web Services Definition Language or something?
<nickr> derek: From what I read its like a nameservice for SOAP
<derek> yes
<nickr> Like all the w3c xml standards its terribly verbose
<nickr> http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl
<derek> fwiw: the microsoft .net guy couldnt shut up about this
<derek> which tells me a lot about what it probably means :)
<derek> in a nut shell
<nickr> I think the *concepts* of SOAP and WSDL are useful
<derek> microsoft wants to be the networksolutions
<derek> of WSDL
<nickr> I'm not sure about this particular iteration
<derek> all your WSDL belongs to m$
<nickr> Oh its not a global nameservice
<nickr> its a way of asking a particular host what interfaces they impliment
<nickr> like uhh
<nickr> that thing thatns part of sunrpc
<derek> no im telling you i got 5 DAYS of .net immersion about 4 months ago
<derek> one can run local WSDL
<derek> and one can run a WSDL server
<derek> but mickeysoft wants to control it
<nickr> Well sure
<derek> i.e. say quicken talks to banks via webservices
<nickr> if they are retargeting themselves as service-based
<derek> m$ wants to be the one that holds the WSDL stuff for that
<derek> under prepice
<nickr> makes sense
<derek> bank dont trust microsoft
<derek> quicken dont trust bank
<nickr> Seems silly when its not a big deal to host it yourself
<derek> everyone (sic) trusts microsoft
<derek> re-examine that sentence
<derek> seems silly = microsoft
<nickr> heh.
<derek> seems silly that one would use a global login designed and maintained by the fellows who bring us the I love you and klez
<derek> but m$ still thinks passport is a good idea
<derek> ok going to work for real now
<nickr> I think the concept of passport is good, although a more distributed implimentation would be better
<nickr> er
<nickr> rather
<nickr> a distributed network of trust
<pradhap> bye guys

<lawrence> derek still geting a Segmentation fault with gnue-forms
<lawrence> Splash screen comes up; then font chooser; then segv
<jcater> lawrence: font chooser?
<lawrence> gnue-designer is fine
ninja (rossg@home.golder.org) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<jcater> can you try running with the -s option, and seeing if it still segfaults?
<jcater> or has someone already talked you through this?
<lawrence> looks like -s option did the trick!
<jcater> you probably want to modify your gnue.conf file with: 
<jcater> [forms]
<jcater> disableSplash = 1
<jcater> then you won't have to use the -s option all the time
<jcater> we are having some issues with timeouts on our splash screen
<jcater> it rears it's ugly head on slower machines
<jcater> I guess we either need to find a solution, or disable the splashscreen by default :(
<lawrence> it is a timer issue; 
<lawrence> i don't do any thing an it segv
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> the problem is, if the splashscreen tries to disappear
<jcater> before the main screen is completely drawn
<jcater> it segfaults
<jcater> we can increase the timer more
<jcater> but that's avoiding the problem, not fixing it :)
<lawrence> slow machine? 1.4 athalon with a gig of memory not fast enough?
<jcater> wow
<jcater> this is the first time we've seen this problem
<jcater> on any thing faster than a 266Mhz
<jcater> what OS?
<lawrence> FreeBSD 4.6.2
<jcater> (not that it should matter)
<lawrence> thanks now I can play again

<Arturas> Hello
btami_ (~btami@3e70d731.dialin.enternet.hu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<btami_> hi all
<btami_> Arturas you here?
Nick change: btami_ -> btami
<Arturas> hi Bajusz
<btami> hi
<Arturas> yes, i'm here
<btami> i have this in my sitecustomize.py :
<btami> import sys, locale
<btami> loc = locale.getdefaultlocale()
<btami> if loc[1]:
<btami>   sys.setdefaultencoding(loc[1])
<btami> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, '')
<btami> print 'Default encoding: %s' %sys.getdefaultencoding()
<btami> print 'Locale conventions: %s' %locale.localeconv()
<btami> what do you think ?
<btami> in this way no need to set different encodings
<Arturas> if i understand you correctly
<Arturas> you're offering final user to modify his/her sitecustomize.py
<Arturas> to enable GNUe work with his/her encoding?
<btami> no and yes :)
<btami> i imagine that setup rocess puts sitecustomize.py 
<btami> into some right place
<Arturas> one linux guru noticed, that forcing users to modify sutecustomize.py is no good for several reasons - the most simpliest case would be some other software that needs current sitecustomize and it can't work with other sitecustomize and GNUe, that can't work with current sitecustomize
<Arturas> it's good for us as developers
<Arturas> it's good for some users
<Arturas> but we can't enforce this
<Arturas> and we should be able to support encodings as well as possible with current sitecustomize.py
<btami> maybe we can offer this if there isn't any sitecustomize.py
<Arturas> [i _think_ (i don't know this for sure) that installing python installs sitecustomize.py]   yes, we can :)
<btami> in win32 and python 2.1 2.2 the file doesn't exist per default
<btami> and i think forcing enduser to make this file 
<btami> then write somethong into it
<btami> not a frendly thing
<btami> plus he have to know what is your encoding name
<Arturas> the idea is pretty good, but currently for me is enough not working setup-cvs.py for windows :) :) :)
<btami> ok :)
<btami> l8r

<marioct> I'm new on python, so I can't find the problem .

<Arturas> no
<marioct> so..... what can I do ?
<marioct> :)
<Arturas> if you're not in a big hurry, you can wait for a day or so
<Arturas> we'll find someone who did debs and he'll take a look at it
<nickr> one of the js made them
<nickr> complain to them
<nickr> I think
<Arturas> there was something on mailing list...
<Arturas> one moment
<marioct> thanks.
<Arturas> marioct: you have all the dependencies, don't you?
<nickr> I don't think that error would occur if there were missing dependencies
<Arturas> what would occur then??
<nickr> It'd say it can't import something like mxtime or whatever
<nickr> Or the package wouldn't install
<nickr> its having trouble importing something internal to the package
<marioct> yes
<marioct> I have all the dependencies.
<Arturas> i don't find it in my mailbox, but i seem to remember there was something about it... maybe i'm mistakening

<marioct> what is Error: No Forms Definition File Specified. when I execute gnue-forms ?
<Arturas> you have to put some form file

<psu> conversion table is IIRC

<revDeke> currently they are for postgres
<revDeke> BUT
<revDeke> i plan (or someone else could) convert them to use GNUe Schema Definition
<revDeke> in which case all dbs woudl be supported :)
<lawrence> i ran some demos but they complained about no data 
<lawrence> tables don't exist
<revDeke> what demo?
<lawrence> zipcode stuff went in
<revDeke> jcater: im thinking maybe we make gear files
<revDeke> and navigator files
<revDeke> and one of the launchers on the navigator runs the actual db create scripts?
<lawrence> oh I never got to navigator yet, thanks.
<jcater> revDeke: I'm adding a resetForeignKey, but do note that you are programming for specific UI features
<jcater> if using a combo that way
<psu> for the record, both the downloads/current and downloads/releases dirs

<psu> thanks to btami for all the hard work
<jcater> 0.4.0a?
<psu> well, release 0.4.0, package a

<siesel> hi all
<jcater> hi
<KeithJagrs> hi siesel
<siesel> jcater: btw. the new openoffice developer version should support docbook import+export
<jcater> siesel: not really
<jcater> they say that
<jcater> but that's what I'm using
<jcater> and it doesn't have it
<jcater> I think you need Java 1.4 installed
<jcater> plus a few other things
<siesel> yes, I tried it several times - even on WiNdOwS - but it didn't worked for me :(
<siesel> I thought you would probably have more luck ;)
<siesel> btw. what about the next release? will it be 0.4.1 (i.e. bugfixing) or a 0.5.0 ?
<jcater> my thinking: 
<jcater> if I get curses working well
<jcater> in short time
<jcater> 0.5.0
<jcater> if not, 0.4.1
<siesel> or even 0.6.0 looking at the speed you and jamest are commiting things ;)
<KeithJagrs> 0.5.0 ?? 0.6.0?
<KeithJagrs> it all depend on curses?
<jcater> ?
<jcater> 0.4.1 or 0.5.0
<jcater> curses and my developer's guide
<jcater> I don't want to go 0.5.0 without a good developer's guide finished
<jcater> well
<jcater> finished is a bad word
<jcater> usable :)
<siesel> btw. the developers guide is great. finally I know how to add timestamps, etc. :)

<revDeke> then when you release 0.5.0 and half the implementation is different
<revDeke> it makes for great luser torture :)
<siesel> that's the problem with documentation: you have to update it. :)
<lawrence> That is the problem with software not documentation. 
<nickr> they should add a feature to designer that makes spikes fly at the user's head

<revDeke> as my linux boxes dont run novel services
<jcater> as I have 4.0 under win98
<revDeke> 4.05
<revDeke> btw: have you PRINTED it
<revDeke> as it looks fine in the viewer
<revDeke> its not until you print it that it looks goofy
<jcater> using acrobat reader for linux
<jcater> I've printed it
<jcater> oh, well
<revDeke> not a huge deal
<jcater> I'm sure ps2pdf is handling something incorrectly
<revDeke> as long as its not wide spread im not losing sleep
<revDeke> and it views fine
<jcater> I can use Acrobat Distiller come release time
<jcater> OpenOffice 643 has an "Export to PDF" menu option
<revDeke> well i would be curious if you make a distiller copy
<revDeke> if the problem goes away
<jcater> but she segfaults every single time I try it
<jcater> so as soon as OO gets that working
<jcater> I'm sure it'll be irrelevant
<jcater> I don't have distiller at home
<jcater> so can't test at the moment
<revDeke> thats ok we wont use distiller

<jcater> are you gnome or kde (or neither?)
<jcater> I've heard good things about gedit (for gtk or gnome)
<lawrence> I have major problems with gnome locking X11 
<revDeke> i like gedit a bit
<lawrence> so now i use KDE
<revDeke> im sorry
<revDeke> flux or blackbox is best
<nickr> scripto bold!
<revDeke> rock
<revDeke> actually i would like to try blackbox more
<revDeke> or some other light variants
<revDeke> its weird as now my main computer uses only flux and im used to it and dont feel like im 'missing' things
<revDeke> so its really hard to justify kde or gnome anymore
<revDeke> but for the wife gnome is great (she didnt like kde for some reason)
<revDeke> mainly cause she used the foot first
<revDeke> thats what we call it at our house :)
<revDeke> its not gnome its the foot
<jcater> lawrence: have you tried kate?
<lawrence> gnome is cute
<revDeke> so is kate ;)
<jcater> it's a standard part of KDE 3+
<lawrence> I have kate loaded but have not tried it
<revDeke> jcater how did you get kde3 on debian?
Action: jcater thinks it was in 2.2.2 as well, but 3+ is even better
<revDeke> can you send me the steps in an email?
<revDeke> as i need kde3 to make my music db program work
<revDeke> and i dont want to compile from scratch
<jcater> I could tell you

ninja (rossg@home.golder.org) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> siesel: I hadn't finished the resetForeignKey stuff
<jcater> I just committed because I had to come home
<siesel> its the parameter stuff which made me changing stuff.
<jcater> ?
<siesel> i've made a form with two dropdowns. The user can choose a state in the first, and should choose a city in the next and will get displayed the zipcode in an style=label entry 
<siesel> the second dropdown is using a parameter in a condition to display just the cities from the state chosen in the first dropdown
<siesel> so I added a setParameter function. 
<jcater> hrm
<siesel> but that didn't work because of caching parameters values in the cparam class and 
<jcater> right
<siesel> because of the dbsig dbdriver replacing the staticCondidition by a preparsed string :(
<siesel> which is also the reason of passing a parameter in the command line is not working at the moment.
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I had intended on runtime parameters to be read only
Action: jcater is trying to think through your example
lawrence (~lawrence@bsd01.necessity.org) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<siesel> yes, thats (should runtime parameter be read only) was the thing I was not so shure about.
<jcater> I guess they don't have to be
<jcater> I suppose we can add a setParameter and get rid of the caching code
<siesel> other possibilities would be to have a 'populateForeignKey' or a 'add/change staticConditions'
<jcater> I doubt the caching code speeded things up much anyway
<siesel> So I will change the dbsig thing too.
<jcater> where's that at?
Action: jcater hadn't noticed it
<siesel> its in __conditiontoSQL  (_dbsig/DBdriver.py)
<siesel> the BAD line is: element._children[i] = self.__conditionToSQL(element._children[i])
<siesel> This will change the GObj tree.
<jcater> well, phooey
Action: jcater wonders what kind of performance hit a change like that will make
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I wonder....
<jcater> should we NOT modify the GObj tree in _dbsig
<jcater> but still create the static condition
<jcater> but add an invalidateCachedConditions() method
<siesel> it will only change the staticConditions, because the rest will allways be newly created
<jcater> ?
<siesel> the dbsig stuff is not REALLY caching anything, but just overwriting child nodes.
<siesel> f.e. 1. time:  and(eq(obj('state'),obj('NY')),gr(obj('sales'),obj('21'))))
<siesel> 2. time:  and("state = NY","sales>21")
<siesel> but its not important how it works now. its important how it should work.
<jcater> it recursively changes stuff until you are left with a single string
<jcater> so that it only has to do that once
<siesel> yes, but the only caching it is doing is to store these strings into the child nodes instead of the old GObjects
<jcater> in the end, there's only one node
<siesel> BUT the whole string should be stored at an other place and the child nodes should be left alone
<jcater> I said that earlier :)
<jcater> <jcater> I wonder....
<jcater> <jcater> should we NOT modify the GObj tree in _dbsig
<jcater> <jcater> but still create the static condition
<jcater> <jcater> but add an invalidateCachedConditions() method
<jcater> maybe not plainly enough
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> there's not a clean solution to this
<jcater> to have changable runtime parameters
<jcater> I guess there are a few cases where that would be desirable, though
<siesel> the other possibility would be to change the staticConditions 
<siesel> using a trigger.
Action: jcater isn't sure what you're calling staticConditions
<jcater> is this the string that's finally built from __conditionsToSQL?
<siesel> no, thats a link from GDataObject to the <condition> childs of a GDatasource
<jcater> ah
<siesel> it is always combined with the "dynamic condition" to build a resultset
<jcater> ok, now it's coming back to me :)
<jcater> so you are thinking we could add a setCondition(<GCondition tree>) method to GDataSource?
<jcater> or something like that
<siesel> that would be great.
<jcater> ok
<jcater> works for me
<siesel> its just a bit OVERKILL for just changing a parameter
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-163.wasp.net.au) left irc: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)
<siesel> I mean, I would like to have both possibilities.
<jcater> true
<jcater> *but*
<jcater> what you are describing is not the typical case
<jcater> err, typical use of a parameter
<jcater> although I'm not opposed to having a setParameter
<jcater> as long as we don't add much more overhead to datasources
<jcater> that's my biggest fear
<jcater> e.g., I have one report using GNUe Reports right now
<jcater> that's a master/detail report
<jcater> there's approx 1,800 records in the master datasource
<jcater> so that's 1,800 times the child datasource is run
Action: jcater is just describing his current GNUe Reports usage
<jcater> I have much more complex reports to do
<siesel> my actual patch to have parameter working is just to NOT cache the static part of the parameters

<jcater> ok
lawrence (~lawrence@bsd01.necessity.org) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> If reports is getting too slow we still can add caching, and probably in a better way :)
<jcater> so, the plans are to add a DataSource.setCondition() and a Form.setParameter() and remove parameter caching?
<jcater> we can see how that works
<jcater> I may be worried about nothing :)
<jcater> but you do understand my worry about reports, right?
<siesel> I fully understand.
<siesel> And I finally know why you add that caching line to parameters

<btami> hi all
<btami> jcater or jamest ?
<chillywilly> neither ;P
<btami> :(
<chillywilly> j/k
<btami> hi chilly
<chillywilly> howdy
<chillywilly> I dunno if they are "here" or not
<btami> i think i find a python bug
<chillywilly> well actually jcater might be around
<chillywilly> last he said something was 50 minutes ago or so
<btami> there was a ticket about reports run into unix_getpass on win2k/XP
<btami> jcater closed it before
<btami> but i'v just tried it again
<chillywilly> and?
<btami> and get the same error
<chillywilly> blah
<btami> i looked into getpass.py in python 
<chillywilly> and your patch is on the way? ;)
<btami> not yet :)
<btami> it tries to import termios
<btami> and if success, he thinks it is unix
Action: rdean is away: family fun time
<btami> but on XP import is ok
<btami> but unix_getpass not
<btami> so, some workaround is needed...
<chillywilly> yea, jcater needs to write portable code ;)
<btami> more portable :)
<chillywilly> getpass.py is from the python standard lib?
<btami> yes
<chillywilly> hmmm, guido says he added sindows support ;)
<chillywilly> # Authors: Piers Lauder (original)
<chillywilly> #          Guido van Rossum (Windows support and cleanup)
<chillywilly> hehe, that is a GREAT typo
<chillywilly> sindows
<chillywilly> lol
<btami> :)
<btami> so, getpass.py error is Guido's mistake
<chillywilly> maybe ;)
<btami> not maybe, fact!
<chillywilly> well I dunno
<chillywilly> it should call win_getpass
<chillywilly> and import msvcrt
<chillywilly> etc.
<btami> yes, but import termios doesn't fire ImportError: on XP
<btami> yust a DeprecationWarning
<btami> C:\Python22\lib\termios.py:7: DeprecationWarning: the TERMIOS module is deprecated; please use termios
<btami>   DeprecationWarning)
<btami> if i type: termios
<btami> <module 'termios' from 'C:\Python22\lib\termios.pyc'>
<chillywilly> weird
<btami> yes
<chillywilly> why does it complain that it is deprecated then tell you to use it again?
<chillywilly> that's stupid
<btami> don't know
<chillywilly> so then as soon as it is able to import it, it jumps to the else: getpass = unix_getpass?
<btami> yes
<chillywilly> but there is no unix_getpass right?
<btami> there is
<btami> but fails on XP
<chillywilly> oh
<btami> unix_getpass in getpass.py module
<btami> s/in/is in
<chillywilly> I know
<chillywilly> even on XP?
<btami> then it fails on line
<btami>     old = termios.tcgetattr(fd)     # a copy to save
<btami> on XP, yes
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> so it really doesn't support termios?
<chillywilly> it lies?
<chillywilly> ;)
<btami> yes :(
<chillywilly> doesn python 2.2 claim to support sindows XP?
<btami> maybe it's NOT Guido's fault
<btami> :)
<btami> i never seen
<btami> what OS's are supported
<chillywilly> did you jst runt he executable here: http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.2/Python-2.2.2.exe ?
<btami> yes
<chillywilly> well I would say that win XP has "issues" ;)
<btami> :)
<chillywilly> it lies abot termios ;)
<chillywilly> did you look to see if that function was in the termios.py file?
<btami> there isn't termios.py just a TERMIOS.py
<btami> the DeprecationWarning comes from him
<btami> """Backward-compatibility version of TERMIOS; export constants exported by
<btami> termios, and issue a deprecation warning.
<btami> """
<btami> import warnings
<btami> warnings.warn("the TERMIOS module is deprecated; please use termios",
<btami>               DeprecationWarning)
<btami> # Export the constants known to the termios module:
<btami> from termios import *
<btami> # and *only* the constants:
<btami> __all__ = [s for s in dir() if s[0] in "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"]
<btami> and thats all
<btami> i can't fallow :)
<chillywilly> ooooh
<btami> follow
<chillywilly> is this a stupid windws case sensitivity boo boo?
<btami> no, i don't think
<chillywilly> there's no termios.py ?
<btami> no
<btami> in lib directory
<chillywilly> try renaming TERMIOS.py and see if the import fails and if that makes it se win_getpass
<chillywilly> s/se/use/
<chillywilly> and the .pyc or .pyo
<btami> there is two files: TERMIOS.py and terrmios.pyc
<chillywilly> rename them once
<btami> but deleting termios.pyc, doesn't helps
<chillywilly> or move them ot of the way
<btami> i renamed TERMIOS.py to termios.py
<btami> same error
<chillywilly> no rename them to something totally different
<chillywilly> or just tac on a .save
<chillywilly> so they don't get imported at all
<chillywilly> cause I don't believe Win XP supports termios
<btami> good idea, but not too elegant as a workaround :)
<chillywilly> or at least it is broken
<chillywilly> try it anyway
<chillywilly> you can always fix it by chaning the names again
<btami> it works now (of course)
<chillywilly> uses win_getpass now?
<btami> but i don't think jcater's code will remove anything from python lib
<btami> yes!
<chillywilly> no it's not his fault
<chillywilly> perhaps the python packers screwed up or Win XP has broken termios support
<btami> maybe
<btami> my poor man's workaround was calling GRRun.py with command line parameters
<btami> uname, passw
<btami> but today i forgot this, and got the old error

<Mr_You> I wanna new Buell Lightning XB9S ;-)
Action: ninja likes the noise Buell's make
<ninja> distinctive
<ninja> just checked out the Buell wbesite - the XB9S looks pretty awesome
<derek> anyone have cd-rw working on linxu
<ninja> derek: yep
<Mr_You> those new frame designs look kick ass
<derek> does it take extra mojo?
<derek> or is it pretty simple?
<ninja> have you done the 'ide-scsi' dance?
<ninja> that's about as hard as it gets, iirc
Action: ninja realises that he didn't read the question right
<ninja> derek: sorry, i've done cd-r but not cd-rw
<ninja> quick question for the channel...
<ninja> i've been looking a little bit into gnue over the last few weks (hence my lurking)
<derek> i just need cd-r
<derek> i have not done the ide-scsi dance yet
<derek> thats what im worried about
<derek> what tool do you use to burn?
<derek> cdrecord?
<derek> well i suppose time to stop fussing and just put the drive in and start to sink :)
<derek> or swim
<ninja> i'm looking to use gnue for basic quoting/invoicing when i go self-emlpoyed later this week
Action: derek hunts down nickr he is always good to annoy with my stupid questions ;)
<ninja> derek: yep, cdrecord is good
<derek> ninja: it cant do that out of box
<derek> but it should be good at it
<derek> i think dcl will be PERFECT for that 
<ninja> have you compiled a kernel with an 'ide-scsi' module?
<derek> in about 2 releases
<derek> ah schiest
<derek> please dont tell me i have to compile a kernel to get cdr to work
<Mr_You> latest alpha version of gnucash is implementing invoicing features.
<ninja> i'm also looking to help develop gnue and if it's up to the job, deploy it for my customers
<derek> Mr_You: w/o a sql backend
<Mr_You> derek: yeah.. it should probably be pretty decent for a one man band deal.
<derek> ninja: dcl is all workorder/ticket based which is how most independent consultants work
<derek> it just needs stronger contact management and billing features
<Mr_You> I think they are working on that now.
<ninja> that's the kind of thing i can probably help with
<Mr_You> I'm wondering if an email trigger might be good for time keeping?
<ninja> basically, i'm leaving my current job at the end of the week and going to Thailand for six months iwth my laptop
<ninja> i'm hoping to just relax and unwind and get the beginnings of a business management system together, which i can use to run my own stuff, and to demonstrate to potential clients
<derek> cool
<Mr_You> guess I'll email siesel we've been missing each other
<ninja> derek: need any help with cd-r?
<ninja> so where can i find more info about this dcl then?

<ninja> derek: have you built your kernel with ide-scsi?
<ninja> the cdrecord program uses a SCSI API
<derek> ScottishPig: what distro?
<ScottishPig> Debian
<ninja> the ide-scsi module is required to make cdrecord think it is writing to a SCSI drive

<derek> they have me do about 100 things that when i talk to someone that knows what they are doing they say
<derek> dont do that do this (and it ends up being a 100 times easier) :)
<ninja> how is dcl part of gnue?
<derek> as the linux stuff generally is non distro specific so often has you do things the oldest most generic way
<ninja> looks pretty standalone to me
<derek> is part of gnue :)
<derek> currently mindshare
<ninja> jcater has a point - the HOWTO is how I learned to do it
<derek> and in cvs there are gnue forms that work with dcl
<ninja> ahh
<ninja> the dcl php code looks pretty well thought out
<ninja> compared to most of the PHP hacks I've come across
<derek> jcater: you be around to bounce questions off of for cdr
<derek> mainly do i really have to compile a kernel?
<jcater> probably
<jcater> no
<derek> or is there a debian kernel around i can use
<jcater> probably <-- /me being around
<jcater> no <-- debian kernels all support it
<derek> whew
<derek> ok powering down old box and inserting hardware bbiab
<jcater> you will need to go into modconf
<ninja> derek: as long as the kernel was built with ide-scsi
<jcater> and have ide-scsi loaded at startup
<jcater> btw, that's under kernel/drivers/scsi
<ninja> derek: you also need to add 'hdb=ide-scsi' kernel option to the kernel startup
<derek> im going to modconf now to set
<derek> then installing drive is that ok?
<derek> or must i install drive first?
<jcater> I also have sr_mod selected
<jcater> on that same menu
<jcater> so it must be related
<jcater> (as I don't have any other scsi stuff on this machine)
<jcater> you can do it now

<jcater> err
<jcater> well
Action: dneighbo isnt opposed to kde apps :)
<dneighbo> i need kde3 on this machine anyhow
<dneighbo> chillywilly: NOT FOR A DESKTOP 
<jcater> seeing as I only burn VideoCDs and Debian ISOs
<jcater> I use cdrdao
<jcater> but if jamest recommends something he gave to his lusers
<jcater> I'm sure it'll work for you
<dneighbo> fsck i meant to install as suid
<dneighbo> just a minute need to reconfig that
<dneighbo> so wifey and kids can burn cds
<chillywilly> dneighbo: that's like saying I'll se windows apps with wine

<chillywilly> so you equate copying digital information to the moral equivalent of attacking a ship?

<dneighbo> if it is this easy im impressed and will build a little faq

<jcater> dneighbo: I cut and pasted from the HOWTO

<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> yes but wading through howtos is painful
<chillywilly> it's that kind of mindset that bring us nice laws like the DMCA
<dneighbo> i am trying to compile debian specific howtos that are QUICK and DIRTY
<jcater> one comment before you get any further
<dneighbo> have ext2 to ext3, java plugin and flashplugin as more
<jcater> none of your cds are at /dev/hd?? any longer
<jcater> the DVD is at /dev/scd0

<jcater> the CD-R is at /dev/scd1
<jcater> you might want to create symlinks in /dev
<jcater> for /dev/cdrom /dev/dvd etc
<jcater> chillywilly: maybe so
<jcater> but it's also people ripping unauthorized copies that gets it started in the first place

<chillywilly> jcater: I have a paper copy now
<dneighbo> is there a gui tool out that is in debian sid ?
<jcater> dneighbo: most "GUI's" are actually shells around cdrecord

<chillywilly> and I also don't believe that copying an ebook is morally wrong if someone were to have the hard copy or not
<jcater> there's a difference between morality and legality :)
<chillywilly> sure, but I was talking abot morals as evil is not a legal term ;)
<chillywilly> afaik
<chillywilly> but I am saying it tongue-in-cheek as KDE is FS

<jcater> if you wanna call him that
<chillywilly> he's a putz

<jcater> he's a puppet
<jcater> I can deal with a putz president
<chillywilly> dneighbo: did I forget to mention: gtoaster?
<reinhard> today is a public holiday in austria btw
<dneighbo> gtoaster i have up
<dneighbo> but its not very intuitive
<dneighbo> i just want to copy one disk to another
<dneighbo> and i dont see something simple to do that
<reinhard> oct 26 1955 the last american soldier left austria after ww2
<chillywilly> reinhard: what holiday is that?
<reinhard> it
<reinhard> 's like our jul 4th :)
<reinhard> it's the day of our independence
<reinhard> and the day we remember how good it is to be a neutral country
Action: jcater wishes we were neutral
<chillywilly> independence from Germany?
<jcater> but, NO, we have to be the fscking self-appointed police
<reinhard> neither belonging to nato nor to warshaw pact (sp?)
<reinhard> chillywilly: independence from occupation
<chillywilly> occupation by whom?
<reinhard> chillywilly: germany is still occupied by the US officially (IIRC)
<reinhard> since ww2
<chillywilly> really?
<reinhard> at least it was for a _very_ long time
<reinhard> as well as eastern germany was from russia
<reinhard> s/from/by/

<dneighbo> im too dumb to get how the hell to use gtoaster
<dneighbo> its pretty and looks neat
<jcater> looks like it's something that might be useful sooner than later
<dneighbo> but there is no apparent clear way to actually do anything useful
<reinhard> at least it's a fact that after ww2 the USSR occupied several countries

<reinhard> they say it's because we have very good wine in austria
<reinhard> and when our politicans talked to russian politicans
<reinhard> they didn't talk too much but they gave them wine :)
<reinhard> enough of politics for today :)
<chillywilly> yes, it is a depressing subject ofr us lamericans
<chillywilly> er, for
<jcater> one really cool thing about owning a used book store now
<jcater> is it gives you a different perspective on history
<jcater> as we see some older books come through
<jcater> history books
<jcater> but stuff that the modern history books don't see as important
<jcater> as say WWII
<dneighbo> so is apt-get install konqueror enough?
<jcater> dneighbo: unless you need specialized stuff later on
<jcater> that gets most of kde
<dneighbo> ok cool
<chillywilly> sigh

<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> add that ;)
<dneighbo> chillywilly: you had your chance
<chillywilly> hey if you are too stpid then what can I say?
<dneighbo> and you never piped up on how to make gtoaster 'work'
<dneighbo> i installed it and fired it up
<chillywilly> I don't use it
<chillywilly> I use cdrecord
<dneighbo> if im too stupid i say try something for me
<chillywilly> :P
Action: dneighbo doesnt want to spend 4 hours learning how to burn a cd
<dneighbo> if i cant do it in 10 minutes the software is designed like crap
<dneighbo> i want my 7 year old to be able to burn cds
<dneighbo> in fact installing this thing appears to have been so easy (thanks jcater)
<dneighbo> that i spent more time trying to use gtoaster than i did installing the darn drive
<chillywilly> whatever
<chillywilly> xcdroast is better
<dneighbo> btw: your current attitude is exactly why people are flocking to kde and away from gnome :

<jcater> did the apt-get install konq grab a lot?
<dneighbo> yeah
<dneighbo> but apparently not enough
<jcater> did it grab arts?

Action: derek thinks konqueror probably isnt enough
Action: derek restarted gdm and still no dice
<jcater> hang on...
<jcater> apt-get install kdebase kdelibs
<jcater> does that grab anything?
<derek> oh hell yeah
<derek> like the world
Action: derek thinks that should likely do the trick :)
<derek> grabbed 31 new packages
<jcater> whoops
<derek> kdcop is one of them
<derek> and honestly i think thats what was missing
<jcater> I guess konqueror was enough to force my upgrade :)
<derek> as i saw dcop messages flying like nuts at startup of cdbake
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> dcop is really important in kde land
<derek> and kcontrol is likely the kcmshell stuff
<derek> kioslave likely could by why no see disks :)
<derek> etc etc etc
<jcater> although that tells me cdbakeoven debs are not properly depended
Action: derek agrees
<derek> HOWEVER
<derek> i did dpkg --install debpackage.deb
<derek> which i think ignores dependencies
<derek> BUT i needed not do that, i think its actually in the sources.list you gave me
<derek> as later i did apt-cache search and saw it and apt-get install tried to install but already newest (unless that .deb gets registered to apt-get once installed)
<jcater> yeah, it gets registered
Action: jcater learned that the hard way when doing some ltsp stuff :)
<jcater> I made some assumptions based on apt-cache search
<jcater> which weren't valid
<jcater> :(
<chillywilly> I can see again
<chillywilly> woooo
<derek> hmm xcdroast seemed decent but it doesnt work
<derek> looked like it saw the drives
<derek> and looked reasonable to use
<derek> but it tells me no data on cd when i have an audio cd in that bad boy
<chillywilly> I think most of the gui cd burner programs blow
<derek> grr i think the dvd drive must not work now or something
<derek> cdbake is now fixed i think and recognizes both drives
<jcater> why?
<derek> but it cant appear to find 'tracks' on the dvd
<derek> and niether could xcdroast
<derek> is there some other tool i can check to make sure that its not fried?
<jcater> I have to go pick up wife
<jcater> is there something  you use to listen to audio cds?
<derek> wtf
<derek> xmms
<derek> i run it
<derek> and go to /dev/scd0 and it shows the tracks
<derek> but if i try to play one it segfaults
<derek> grrr
Action: derek has the kind of luck where there is a bug
<derek> that dvd drives cant play audio tracks using ide-scsi
<derek> hmmm
<derek> different disk works
<derek> zoegirl must just be too mutilated already
<derek> trying to make legal backups as my kids are KILLING their cds
<jcater> ;)
<derek> cdbake still dont find squat though
<jcater> just like chillywilly was making a legal backup of his paper copy of LOTR, right?\
<jcater> :)
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I haven't used any of the above
<jcater> I don't even have a sound card
<derek> grrr xcdroast doesnt see it either
<jcater> does xmms?
<derek> yes
<chillywilly> jcater: foad
<derek> gtoaster shows the tracks
<derek> but i cant figure out how to use the darn thing
<chillywilly> pray ;)
<chillywilly> just like using gnue tools ;)
Action: chillywilly ducks
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 00:44:33)
<derek> cdbakeoven is crap
<derek> it segfaults and gives crap errors grr
<derek> xcdroast shows most promise
<derek> it just doesnt find the tracks
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> like I said I think most of the gui programs are crap, crazymike has tried them all just like you and he eventually gave p and used the command line tool
<derek> im darn close
<derek> i wouldnt mind
<derek> BUT
<derek> i really do want wife and kids to be able to burn and iam not going to make them use command line
Action: jcater doesn't think jamest was testing out CD-to-CD burning
<jcater> as that isn;t soemthing he'd be setting up for his users
<derek> jcater: likely thats the problem
<jcater> nor would I
<derek> as i think that DAO is not well supported under linux
<derek> im trying cdrdao
<jcater> it's not DAO
<jcater> it's what you're doing
<jcater> you aren't doing cd mastering
<jcater> which is what we were giving programs to do
<derek> im pretty sure what im doing requires DAO
Action: jcater uses dao all the time
<jcater> for mastering stuff
<jcater> it very well may
<derek> and that dumb cdbake trying to convert stuff
<derek> instead of just 'copy' stuff
<derek> or so it seemed
Action: jcater didn't realize you were just copying cds at first
Action: derek doesnt pretend to understand music file formats
<chillywilly> the only diff is if you do TAO it adds a pauise between each song
<chillywilly> DAO will give you the whole shebang with no pauses between
<chillywilly> TAO == track at once, DAO == disk at once
<jcater> did you select Audio CD Copy?

<derek> hey if gnucash and gnome have gwrap
<derek> does kapital and kde have kwrap ;)
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> what's gwrap?
--- Sun Oct 27 2002
<derek> guile wrap
<derek> a C guile wrapper iirc written by gnucash team for gnucash but other projects use it too (i think)
Action: derek cant get gtoaster to work for non direct cd stuff
<derek> it looked VERY promising in that i could drag and .ogg file and it woudl appear to conver to an audio file on the fly for me
<derek> but it locks up burning no matter what i do
<ajmitch> how irritating
<derek> i switched to precaching things and it actually locks there, so its not a 'burn' issue
<derek> is a gtoaster conversion issue
Action: ajmitch can burn at 4x!!
<derek> as i appear to be able to make a data cd of .ogg/.mp3 directly
<derek> jsut not letting gtoaster convert to cdaudio
<ajmitch> hmm
<derek> i might just steal their command line syntax
<derek> and try to do the conversion myself
<derek> and then burn the wav files to cd
<derek> and see if it works
<derek> luckly i have lots and lots of free media or i might be pissed by now :)
<derek> but cd 2 cd seems to go very nicely (knock on wood)
<derek> got most of daughters cds archived
<derek> so originals no longer have to take beatings

Action: jbailey is away: dinner
<Mr_You> anyone around?
<ajmitch> yup
<Mr_You> does trigger code get executed on clients and appserver or both?
<ajmitch> mostly clients, depends on the form
<ajmitch> not sure how well appserver does triggers at the moment, would have to ask siesel or reinhard
<Mr_You> ok, well siesel mentioned this:
<Mr_You> p<siesel> the important trigger/business logic/consitence checking etc. should
<Mr_You>          be done i appserver, in case of javascript AND python clients.
<ajmitch> right, so that'd be remote triggers in appserver
<ajmitch> there might be some stub code for calling that within the forms - i am not certain
<Mr_You> ok, well that solves a problem of javascript and python
<ajmitch> yup
<Mr_You> you had me worried :-P
<ajmitch> just requires a simple xml-rpc call, i guess
<ajmitch> hehe
<Mr_You> yeah
<ajmitch> as i said, it depends on the forms - most forms now have inline python triggers
<ajmitch> but hopefully they'll move away from that
<Mr_You> well, atleast there is some trigger flexibility with remote triggers
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> i think i'd prefer remote triggers
<Mr_You> it seems the best route for the javascript client will be XMLRPC only.
<Mr_You> you seen the latest tablet PCs?
<ajmitch> nope
<ajmitch> nice compact units?
<Mr_You> microsoft demoed some to some linux developers and they were cheering hehe ;-)
<ajmitch> hehe
<Mr_You> mainly cause its leading edge technology
<Mr_You> basicly its a PC that can be used with a pen in tablet mode and be docked with a keyboard for laptop/desktop mode
<jcater> that's going to be sooo damn much overhead
<jcater> having remote-only triggers
<jcater> can you imagine the communications
<jcater> between client and server
<jcater> for every single keystroke, etc
<ajmitch> ouch?
<Mr_You> I dunno.. lets test it out?  ;-)
<jcater> I'm not
<jcater> y'all can
<Mr_You> X has high overhead  but people still use it ;-)
<jcater> yunno
<jcater> all my workstations at my callcenter
<jcater> also aren't dependent on a single X server either
<Mr_You> yeah hardware is cheap enough you don't need to
<Mr_You> but admins still use remote X
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> you miss my point
<jcater> of a SINGLE point of failure
<jcater> I will never run such a setup at NCS
<jcater> I've had way too much experience
<jcater> with stuff like that failing 
<jcater> but to each his own :)
<Mr_You> so how do you propose high avaibility appserver?  ;-)
<jcater> why do you assume I'd ever use appserver?
<jcater> I think it's great people are wanting it and writing it
<Mr_You> how are you providing HA database service?
<jcater> but that doesn't translate into me ever using it
<jcater> you think appserver will provide that?
<jcater> appserver is yet another point of contact
<Mr_You> how are you providing HA database service?
Action: jcater uses Oracle with HA hardware
<jcater> and real-time backups
Action: jcater is never down
<Mr_You> ok
Action: jcater went the route of having middleware
<ajmitch> so eventually we'll have 2 classes of forms - those that are appserver-dependant, and those that are not
<jcater> and my HA went <poop>
<jcater> :)
<Mr_You> HA  is spensive
<jcater> ajmitch: I'm talking about my custom stuff
<ajmitch> jcater: yeah
<jcater> I'm not thrilled about GNUe requiring an appserver for all the accounting stuff
<Mr_You> it really just comes down to flexibility
<jcater> not thrilled at all
<jcater> but that's not my call
<jcater> Mr_You: I've been there, done that
<jcater> like I said, to each his own
<Mr_You> well I want business logic.
<Mr_You> done what?
<jcater> middleware
<Mr_You> you mean HA middleware software right?
<jcater> I mean application servers
<Mr_You> basicly a hack ;-)
<Mr_You> ahh well you just use triggers for business logic?
<jcater> "just" ?
<jcater> yeah, I use triggers
<Mr_You> well triggers is a broad description
<Mr_You> GNUe Triggers ;-)
<Mr_You> bottom line is HA is expensive until PostgreSQL has production quality replication.
<Mr_You> which I think is in the works
Action: jcater is curious as to how this deals with appserver, as appserver isn't exactly HA
<Mr_You> it doesn't, you just took the appserver conversation into single point of failure ;-)
<Mr_You> appserver could provide HA capabilities at some point
<Mr_You> more network traffic
<jcater> are you trying to convince me or yourself about application servers?
<Mr_You> nope
<Mr_You> I'm just making a point that HA is expensive and not normally available to small biz.
<jcater> my point is that, for a small business, you are adding yet one more layer that can, and at some point will, go wrong
Action: jcater works for a small biz
<jcater> it's a statistics game
<jcater> the more layers you add that can go down
<jcater> the more often you go down
<jcater> in my mind
<jcater> until you have multiple database servers
<jcater> something like an application server
<ajmitch> the more you get annoyed with the crap software you're using :)
<jcater> isn't gaining you anyhing
<jcater> but rather costing you
<Mr_You> you aren't suppose to go down with HA
<Mr_You> I understand your point
Action: jcater isn't discouraging anyone
<Mr_You> its a cost and risk vs benefit
<jcater> but there's a current trend toward middleware
<jcater> without looking at historical evidence
<jcater> and case studies
<jcater> for some, middleware makes sense
<jcater> but I see more times than not these days, "if it's not N-tier, how on earth am I supposed to use it"
<jcater> enterprises were successfully doing n-tier (and even 1-tier) long before n-tier
<jcater> but, I digress
<jcater> :)
<jcater> ...time for dinner
<Mr_You> you provide all your GNUe users with a single/shared database user account or it is "anonymous" or what?
jbailey (~jbailey@CPE014260028338.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<chillywilly> appserver should only have object/business rles in it not "triggers" as in ui events imho
<chillywilly> that's just stupid
<chillywilly> wtf is HA?
<ajmitch> high availability
<chillywilly> triggers for forms is not necessarily methods/triggers for the appserver
<chillywilly> as I agree with jcater you don't want frelling rcp calls for every little ui interaction
<chillywilly> ajmitch: thanks
<chillywilly> er, rpc
<chillywilly> then again how often does a form hit the db?
<chillywilly> not on every single trigger does it? I don't think it works that way...
