Nick change: btami_ -> btami
<KeithJagrs> btami: hi
<btami> have you got my e-mail
<btami> hi
<btami> psu: have you got my e-mail?
<btami> :)
<psu> btami: not yet. If it's what I think it is, it could easily take 
<psu> an hour to download
<btami> it's that
<psu> well, KeithJagrs will be pleased ;-)
<KeithJagrs> ????
<psu> KeithJagrs: I managed to "persuade"£ btami to do us a 
<psu> Win .exe without the debug window as well
<KeithJagrs> yeah!
<KeithJagrs> how did you manage btami?
<psu> but given that btami has to e-mail it to me 
<psu> and then I have to uplaod it
<psu> on dial-up, it may take a few hours ;-)
<btami> console=0 in *.conf files
<btami> oh, sorry 
<KeithJagrs> well, I've thinking about it.  Maybe its better to have the debugging console. Specially in this early stages of gnue tools.
<KeithJagrs> so you can point  out the bugs
<KeithJagrs> psu: you are on dial-up? why?
<btami> this was the original reason i made it that way
<psu> I think it depends. If, like you, you want to put it in front of end-users
<psu> KeithJagrs: my cable company have been saying broadband is "imminent" for 18 months
<KeithJagrs> yes. but until now I've been just playing with forms or designer.
<psu> I'm afraid the week I finally break down &get it from the phone company instead
<psu> will be the week they finally offer it ;-)
<KeithJagrs> psu: where are you located?
<psu> Great Britain
<KeithJagrs> hmmm
<KeithJagrs> what about cable?
<KeithJagrs> o sorry.. i read phone company
<psu> my cable company have been saying broadband is "imminent" for 18 months ;-)
<KeithJagrs> then what about ISDN 
<psu> British Telecom have a wonderful attitude to broadband
<KeithJagrs> or ADSL or something
<psu> You go on the waiting list, and when they get 400 people on your exchange wanting it 
<psu> they consider it ;-)
<KeithJagrs> ;)
<KeithJagrs> I have cable, thankfully
<jcater> <Phone Company Rep> Man, what are the odds of there being 400 people in this exchange with the same initials: PSU

<psu> Actually, I expect my exchange is set up already

<psu> within spitting distance
<psu> but phone co broadband is expensive 
<KeithJagrs> yeah
<psu> compared to cable
<jcater> btami: howdy
<btami> jcater: my "focus nightmare" and clicking on tabs issues are still alive
<psu> Of coure, phone broadband exists, which is a plus
<jcater> really?
<jcater> hrm
<psu> I just know that O'Toole's Rule will apply and the week I finally break down 
<psu> and ask the phone company to install 
<btami> i'm starting intro.gfd
<btami> then pgdn
<KeithJagrs> where in Great Britain, psu?
<psu> the next week the cable company will finally get their arse in gear
<btami> then type my name + enter

reinhard (~reinhard@M693P020.adsl.highway.telekom.at) joined #gnuenterprise.
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> ok possibly my last post didn't get through
<reinhard> so again:
<reinhard> hi psu
<reinhard> i have a few questions on the website
<KeithJagrs> hey 
<KeithJagrs> hey is there an organization chart for the GNUe project?
<psu> since when has joining #gnuenterprise been an "oops" ;-)
<reinhard> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/geas.php
<reinhard> seems to refer to old geasgeas
<reinhard> if it's not too much effort
<reinhard> i think it would be good to
<reinhard> a) rename the page to appserver.php and
<reinhard> b) take the text from appserver/README
<psu> KeithJagrs: bizarlly enough, I have the www.oxymoronlist.com site open as we speak ;-)
<reinhard> psu: lol
<psu> reinhard: it *should* refer to the new appserver - I will check 
<psu> I know the filename is wrong - same for /tools/gnurpc.php -> common.php
<KeithJagrs> heeh
<psu> no, the text is wrong too, isn't it?
<psu> I'll get that fixed
Action: psu will have to get the README text off the savannah web site as I don;t have
<psu> the code CVS checked at at the moment
<psu> My hard disc is full to bursting, so anything non-essential went 
<psu> (inc. frozen bubbles)
<KeithJagrs> I'd like to contribute to the gnue project. Not by coding, at first. I don't consider myself a programmer.
<nickr> Frozen Bubble IS essential
<psu> I need to re-partition and reduce the non-free partition on this PC
<KeithJagrs> I'd like to help in the definition of roadmap. I think it's essential
<psu> as I never use it any more
<psu> I agree. Biggest problem will be that we can't realistically put dates on 
<psu> as per mailing list
<psu> but 
<psu> we have cross-dependancies.
<psu> The one that has been most significant the last year has been 
<psu> we didn't really want to start on apps until we have a prototype app server
<KeithJagrs> I see
<psu> but this particular circle looks as if it is being squared 
<psu> I'm sure there will be others as we go 
<psu> e.g. Financials needs feature foo in Forms for feature bar
<psu> feature bar is in Financials 0.5, feature foo is in Forms 1.2
<KeithJagrs> yes. Maybe it is better to put efforts on tools first, then in packages
<psu> which originally have same release date targets, but one or other slips
<KeithJagrs> but foreseeing those needs
<psu> KeithJagrs: that's sort of what we've done, I guess
<KeithJagrs> well yes
<psu> the Tools are not pefect, but I think they belie their 0.x.0 or 0.0.x version numbers
<KeithJagrs> anyways
<psu> in terms of kick-ass functionality
Action: psu is learning fluent deke-speak ;-)
<KeithJagrs> hmm
<nickr> psu: you are good at this selling gnue thing
<KeithJagrs> so in terms of commercial apps, what would be some more accurate version numbers for the current releases? In your opinion..
<reinhard> psu: another point for appserver web page
<reinhard> there are two current documents (whitepaper and api doc)
<reinhard> IMHO it would make sense if the html version was online
<reinhard> (at least the html version that is) :)
<revDeke> if windows is on 2000 forms is at least at version 10.0
<KeithJagrs> heheeheeh
<revDeke> compared to other opensource (sic) stuff we are probably somewhere between 1.0 and 2.0
<revDeke> it all depends
<psu> reinhard: ok. Are these in CVS too? Or still in ~reinhard/ ?
<KeithJagrs> I mean, on the basis that version 1.0.0 is usually the one considered ready for production
<reinhard> they are in appserver/doc api whitepaper
<reinhard> you just have to do
<revDeke> apache, gtk and the likes were good about version numbering and so i think 0.4.0 is realistic if you use them as a baseline
<reinhard> make html
<reinhard> make ps
<reinhard> make pdf
<reinhard> etc.
<revDeke> if you use other projects claiming to be version 8.0 and such we are probably similar
<reinhard> revDeke: you refering to Exel 8.0 here?
<nickr> HP/UX Version 14
<reinhard> ;)
<psu> what is nola's version number ?
<reinhard> aehm i mean excel not exel
<reinhard> psu: last point
<revDeke> psu: dont know
<revDeke> i woudl label at a 0.2.0 right now (acclite)
<reinhard> i would like to see the "GNU Enterprise: Module Design Proposal" marked as "obsoleted"
<revDeke> and i expect it to ramp up VERY quickly
<reinhard> on http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/docs.php
<revDeke> as the low version number is simply because its not really tested
<revDeke> reinhard: i would not
<revDeke> i think its still pertinent
chillywilly (~danielb@mke-24-167-202-50.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> it needs updating but i plan to revive it very soon
<revDeke> as i plan on pumping out a lot of modules
<KeithJagrs> well
<revDeke> and i want something as my template... though i might replace it with an open office version
<KeithJagrs> what about roadmap, anyway?
<revDeke> i have been screaming roadmap for a bit
<revDeke> its not that simple though 
<revDeke> in due time
<chillywilly> reverend Deke?
<revDeke> yes
<chillywilly> hehe
<KeithJagrs> revDeke: cool
<revDeke> KeithJagrs: we have multiple things going on 
<KeithJagrs> good effort
<revDeke> so its hard to compile a road map
<revDeke> as things are interdependent
<chillywilly> well that's an excuse if I ever heard one ;
<chillywilly> ;)
<revDeke> so you need to do all roadmaps in a cohesive manner
<KeithJagrs> I think roadmap should be done on concensus. not one persons effort
<revDeke> yet thats huge task :)
Action: psu said that 
<revDeke> with lots of players
<psu> ;-)
<revDeke> i suspect someone will have to compile the TODOs of the tools and such
<revDeke> and make a draft roadmap
<revDeke> and solicit feedback
<chillywilly> blah, it's garbage night
<revDeke> and modify the feedback into the roadmaps, rinse and repeat a few times
<revDeke> and there is something go by
<chillywilly> I guess I should drag it out to the road
<KeithJagrs> revDeke: good idea
<revDeke> the other issue is getting a road map might not be too bad for the 'next' release but a good roadmap will include 2 to 3 releases out
<KeithJagrs> what about setting up a Wiki?
<revDeke> i dont care for wiki, but certainly folks can do so
<revDeke> i think wiki is good for user driven content that needs minimal controls
<revDeke> but official documentation, guides, roadmaps and such
<chillywilly> wiki good, deke baaad
<revDeke> that need tighter review and control are not good for wiki IMHO
<reinhard> psu: that's all
<reinhard> psu: if i can help you with the text (for appserver.php) or the docs please tell me
<chillywilly> hey hey reinhard
<nickr> most wikis these days allow you to have at least access control.
<reinhard> psu: not sure if there is a possibility that i could update the docs on the web page myself as often as i change them
<chillywilly> GGV has a local buffer overflow when reading corrupted
<chillywilly>  PS and PDF documents.
<reinhard> however it's bedtime today for me
<reinhard> night all
<psu> reinhard: we should have the web site in CVS real soon now
<psu> nite reinhard
<chillywilly> night reinhard
<KeithJagrs> nite reinhard
<psu> KeithJagrs: re. wiki, I refer to my post to the mailing list
<psu> we already have 10 channels of communication
<KeithJagrs> 10 channels?
Action: psu would support a wiki if it replaced some of those
<psu> rather than just became number 11

<nickr> PHPBB is excellent
<chillywilly> but we have IRC so this is our support system ;)

<KeithJagrs> well as the user base or contributors grow, a forum is better suited than a mailing list
<chillywilly> blah, I prefer the push method ;)
<KeithJagrs> chillywilly: ;)
<revDeke> webforums suck for developers
<revDeke> i have no problem people making what works best for them
<KeithJagrs> ok
<revDeke> but dont expect developers (those most capable of helping) to spread accross 15 different mediums
<nickr> mailing lists are great because they are easy to ignore
<nickr> it takes no effortr
<KeithJagrs> not for developers then. but for discussions on features an such.
<KeithJagrs> and roadmaps
<KeithJagrs> you have to ackowlede the advantages or forums for some uses
<KeithJagrs> they are easier to browse than a mailing lists archive
<KeithJagrs> err, the advantages OF forums
<jamest> we did forums, long long ago at peoples insistance
<jamest> (is that a word? :)
<jamest> anyway, we set them up and they got used exactly ZERO times
<chillywilly> I think so

<KeithJagrs> I mean:
<KeithJagrs> Lindows.com has fixed a date for the "General Release" of its operating system software, promising that Lindows 3.0 will be available from mid-November. 
<chillywilly> TNN and USA are the same network right?
<chillywilly> and they bought scifi channel?
<chillywilly> and killed Farscape :'(
<chillywilly> bastards
<KeithJagrs> scfi channel? don't have that one
<KeithJagrs> what is/was farscape about?
<chillywilly> man...it's only the best frelling scifi show ;)
<KeithJagrs> hmm
<chillywilly> John Crighton (sp?) an astronaut gets shot through a worm hole to find himself on a living ship ( a leviathon) with escaped prisoners
<chillywilly> er, alien escaped prisoners
<chillywilly> that's the jist but it's a little more invoved than that
<KeithJagrs> hmmm
<chillywilly> involved
<KeithJagrs> living ship?
<chillywilly> yep
<KeithJagrs> like HAL?
<chillywilly> a Leviathon named Moya
<KeithJagrs> what's a leviathon
<chillywilly> a biomechanical ship
<chillywilly> that is a sentient being
<chillywilly> it has a pilot that is "bonded" to the shipt
<KeithJagrs> kind of like 2001 space odissey
<chillywilly> they are a race of aliens whose sole purpose it to travel space
<chillywilly> pilots that is
<chillywilly> not really
<chillywilly> Farscape has many stry lines
<chillywilly> all the characters on Moya do
<chillywilly> it is really a cool story
<KeithJagrs> I see
<chillywilly> but they're not going to be able to finish it
<KeithJagrs> you sure?
<chillywilly> case they did not renew the contract for the 5th year
<KeithJagrs> hmmm
<KeithJagrs> is scifi a channel like discovery?
<chillywilly> http://www.scifi.com/farscape/
<chillywilly> no, it's scifi ;)
<chillywilly> http://www.savefarscape.com I think that should work too

<Yurik> re
<Mr_You> hi yurik
<esands> doesn't generate sql though.  I just managed to get pgdesigner compiled. Simple but looks useful
<Mr_You> never heard of pgdesigner
<esands> http://www.hardgeus.com/projects/pgdesigner/
<esands> Couples others that run on linux I discover as well:
<esands> http://www.alzabo.org/ (perl nightmare to install, needs mason)
<Mr_You> pretty cool
<Mr_You> I wonder if you could build that into GNUe.
<Mr_You> maybe one day ;-)
Yurik_ (~yrashk@as5300.kharkov.ukrtel.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Mr_You> maybe GNUe Designer could have "New->Form" and "New->Schema" or somethin.
Bill_H (~chamilto@ga-cmng-cuda2-c3b-64.cmngga.adelphia.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Yurik_> Mr_You: hi
<Mr_You> might have to mention it again.
<Mr_You> wb yurik
<esands> http://www.codebydesign.com/DataArchitect/ ($30, but lots of features)
<esands> I guess someone could pgdesigner is in c++
<Mr_You> hehe.. that picture in the corner is kinda funy
<esands> Problem is with SQL is that different DBs have different requirements 
<Mr_You> yeah, but you could possibly build it into the DB extraction routines.
<Mr_You> well, I guess it would only be useful for designer.
<Mr_You> unless you wanted to be able to create tables from a Form
<esands> True, I'm sure someone here is up to it. 8)
<esands> Definitely wouldn't want that from an admin pov.  
<Mr_You> whatcha mean?
<esands> Enough trouble keeping users safe as it is. 
<esands> Safe from doing something nasty to the system
<Mr_You> well.. to create/edit Forms it requires you have some sort of ability to build a database table.. as things get complicated a schema designer is a good addition to Form building.
<Mr_You> it would fit right in with Designer.
<Mr_You> right now I think it reads schemas
<esands> With that yes, but not from forms
<Mr_You> oh yeah I see ;-)
<esands> heh
<esands> What type of schemas does the designer read?
<Mr_You> what DBs?
<esands> pg
<Mr_You> actually I guess it just reads individual tables.
<esands> Yeah
<Mr_You> I believe the wizard will query your datasource (db table) and help build a form 
<Mr_You> so I mispoke.
Yurik (~yrashk@as5300.kharkov.ukrtel.net) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<esands> I guess in that sense, doesn't help you put together then schema though
<Mr_You> nah the schema would mean multiple tables.. 
<Mr_You> so now we have another wish list item ;-)
<chillywilly> sigh
<Mr_You> thanks to you ;-)  or if someoneelse has mentioned it I haven't heard it
<Mr_You> what up chill?
<chillywilly> there's multi-datasource in thw works already
<chillywilly> j00 must sbscribe to the commit list
Action: chillywilly works his mojo on Mr_You
<Mr_You> ok, well that has nothing to do with schema design ;-)
<Mr_You> or does it?
Nick change: Yurik_ -> Yurik
