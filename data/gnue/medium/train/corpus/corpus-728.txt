<btami> hi all
<btami> jcater or jamest ?
<chillywilly> neither ;P
<btami> :(
<chillywilly> j/k
<btami> hi chilly
<chillywilly> howdy
<chillywilly> I dunno if they are "here" or not
<btami> i think i find a python bug
<chillywilly> well actually jcater might be around
<chillywilly> last he said something was 50 minutes ago or so
<btami> there was a ticket about reports run into unix_getpass on win2k/XP
<btami> jcater closed it before
<btami> but i'v just tried it again
<chillywilly> and?
<btami> and get the same error
<chillywilly> blah
<btami> i looked into getpass.py in python 
<chillywilly> and your patch is on the way? ;)
<btami> not yet :)
<btami> it tries to import termios
<btami> and if success, he thinks it is unix
Action: rdean is away: family fun time
<btami> but on XP import is ok
<btami> but unix_getpass not
<btami> so, some workaround is needed...
<chillywilly> yea, jcater needs to write portable code ;)
<btami> more portable :)
<chillywilly> getpass.py is from the python standard lib?
<btami> yes
<chillywilly> hmmm, guido says he added sindows support ;)
<chillywilly> # Authors: Piers Lauder (original)
<chillywilly> #          Guido van Rossum (Windows support and cleanup)
<chillywilly> hehe, that is a GREAT typo
<chillywilly> sindows
<chillywilly> lol
<btami> :)
<btami> so, getpass.py error is Guido's mistake
<chillywilly> maybe ;)
<btami> not maybe, fact!
<chillywilly> well I dunno
<chillywilly> it should call win_getpass
<chillywilly> and import msvcrt
<chillywilly> etc.
<btami> yes, but import termios doesn't fire ImportError: on XP
<btami> yust a DeprecationWarning
<btami> C:\Python22\lib\termios.py:7: DeprecationWarning: the TERMIOS module is deprecated; please use termios
<btami>   DeprecationWarning)
<btami> if i type: termios
<btami> <module 'termios' from 'C:\Python22\lib\termios.pyc'>
<chillywilly> weird
<btami> yes
<chillywilly> why does it complain that it is deprecated then tell you to use it again?
<chillywilly> that's stupid
<btami> don't know
<chillywilly> so then as soon as it is able to import it, it jumps to the else: getpass = unix_getpass?
<btami> yes
<chillywilly> but there is no unix_getpass right?
<btami> there is
<btami> but fails on XP
<chillywilly> oh
<btami> unix_getpass in getpass.py module
<btami> s/in/is in
<chillywilly> I know
<chillywilly> even on XP?
<btami> then it fails on line
<btami>     old = termios.tcgetattr(fd)     # a copy to save
<btami> on XP, yes
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> so it really doesn't support termios?
<chillywilly> it lies?
<chillywilly> ;)
<btami> yes :(
<chillywilly> doesn python 2.2 claim to support sindows XP?
<btami> maybe it's NOT Guido's fault
<btami> :)
<btami> i never seen
<btami> what OS's are supported
<chillywilly> did you jst runt he executable here: http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.2/Python-2.2.2.exe ?
<btami> yes
<chillywilly> well I would say that win XP has "issues" ;)
<btami> :)
<chillywilly> it lies abot termios ;)
<chillywilly> did you look to see if that function was in the termios.py file?
<btami> there isn't termios.py just a TERMIOS.py
<btami> the DeprecationWarning comes from him
<btami> """Backward-compatibility version of TERMIOS; export constants exported by
<btami> termios, and issue a deprecation warning.
<btami> """
<btami> import warnings
<btami> warnings.warn("the TERMIOS module is deprecated; please use termios",
<btami>               DeprecationWarning)

<btami> from termios import *
<btami> # and *only* the constants:
<btami> __all__ = [s for s in dir() if s[0] in "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"]
<btami> and thats all
<btami> i can't fallow :)
<chillywilly> ooooh
<btami> follow
<chillywilly> is this a stupid windws case sensitivity boo boo?
<btami> no, i don't think
<chillywilly> there's no termios.py ?
<btami> no
<btami> in lib directory
<chillywilly> try renaming TERMIOS.py and see if the import fails and if that makes it se win_getpass
<chillywilly> s/se/use/
<chillywilly> and the .pyc or .pyo
<btami> there is two files: TERMIOS.py and terrmios.pyc
<chillywilly> rename them once
<btami> but deleting termios.pyc, doesn't helps
<chillywilly> or move them ot of the way
<btami> i renamed TERMIOS.py to termios.py
<btami> same error
<chillywilly> no rename them to something totally different
<chillywilly> or just tac on a .save
<chillywilly> so they don't get imported at all
<chillywilly> cause I don't believe Win XP supports termios
<btami> good idea, but not too elegant as a workaround :)
<chillywilly> or at least it is broken
<chillywilly> try it anyway
<chillywilly> you can always fix it by chaning the names again
<btami> it works now (of course)
<chillywilly> uses win_getpass now?
<btami> but i don't think jcater's code will remove anything from python lib
<btami> yes!
<chillywilly> no it's not his fault
<chillywilly> perhaps the python packers screwed up or Win XP has broken termios support
<btami> maybe
<btami> my poor man's workaround was calling GRRun.py with command line parameters
<btami> uname, passw
<btami> but today i forgot this, and got the old error

<Mr_You> I wanna new Buell Lightning XB9S ;-)
Action: ninja likes the noise Buell's make
<ninja> distinctive
<ninja> just checked out the Buell wbesite - the XB9S looks pretty awesome
<derek> anyone have cd-rw working on linxu
<ninja> derek: yep
<Mr_You> those new frame designs look kick ass
<derek> does it take extra mojo?
<derek> or is it pretty simple?
<ninja> have you done the 'ide-scsi' dance?
<ninja> that's about as hard as it gets, iirc
Action: ninja realises that he didn't read the question right
<ninja> derek: sorry, i've done cd-r but not cd-rw
<ninja> quick question for the channel...
<ninja> i've been looking a little bit into gnue over the last few weks (hence my lurking)
<derek> i just need cd-r
<derek> i have not done the ide-scsi dance yet
<derek> thats what im worried about
<derek> what tool do you use to burn?
<derek> cdrecord?
<derek> well i suppose time to stop fussing and just put the drive in and start to sink :)
<derek> or swim
<ninja> i'm looking to use gnue for basic quoting/invoicing when i go self-emlpoyed later this week
Action: derek hunts down nickr he is always good to annoy with my stupid questions ;)
<ninja> derek: yep, cdrecord is good
<derek> ninja: it cant do that out of box
<derek> but it should be good at it
<derek> i think dcl will be PERFECT for that 
<ninja> have you compiled a kernel with an 'ide-scsi' module?
<derek> in about 2 releases
<derek> ah schiest
<derek> please dont tell me i have to compile a kernel to get cdr to work
<Mr_You> latest alpha version of gnucash is implementing invoicing features.
<ninja> i'm also looking to help develop gnue and if it's up to the job, deploy it for my customers
<derek> Mr_You: w/o a sql backend
<Mr_You> derek: yeah.. it should probably be pretty decent for a one man band deal.
<derek> ninja: dcl is all workorder/ticket based which is how most independent consultants work
<derek> it just needs stronger contact management and billing features
<Mr_You> I think they are working on that now.
<ninja> that's the kind of thing i can probably help with
<Mr_You> I'm wondering if an email trigger might be good for time keeping?
<ninja> basically, i'm leaving my current job at the end of the week and going to Thailand for six months iwth my laptop
<ninja> i'm hoping to just relax and unwind and get the beginnings of a business management system together, which i can use to run my own stuff, and to demonstrate to potential clients
<derek> cool
<Mr_You> guess I'll email siesel we've been missing each other
<ninja> derek: need any help with cd-r?
<ninja> so where can i find more info about this dcl then?

<ninja> derek: have you built your kernel with ide-scsi?
<ninja> the cdrecord program uses a SCSI API
<derek> ScottishPig: what distro?
<ScottishPig> Debian
<ninja> the ide-scsi module is required to make cdrecord think it is writing to a SCSI drive

<derek> they have me do about 100 things that when i talk to someone that knows what they are doing they say
<derek> dont do that do this (and it ends up being a 100 times easier) :)
<ninja> how is dcl part of gnue?
<derek> as the linux stuff generally is non distro specific so often has you do things the oldest most generic way
<ninja> looks pretty standalone to me
<derek> is part of gnue :)
<derek> currently mindshare
<ninja> jcater has a point - the HOWTO is how I learned to do it
<derek> and in cvs there are gnue forms that work with dcl
<ninja> ahh
<ninja> the dcl php code looks pretty well thought out
<ninja> compared to most of the PHP hacks I've come across
<derek> jcater: you be around to bounce questions off of for cdr
<derek> mainly do i really have to compile a kernel?
<jcater> probably
<jcater> no
<derek> or is there a debian kernel around i can use
<jcater> probably <-- /me being around
<jcater> no <-- debian kernels all support it
<derek> whew
<derek> ok powering down old box and inserting hardware bbiab
<jcater> you will need to go into modconf
<ninja> derek: as long as the kernel was built with ide-scsi
<jcater> and have ide-scsi loaded at startup
<jcater> btw, that's under kernel/drivers/scsi
<ninja> derek: you also need to add 'hdb=ide-scsi' kernel option to the kernel startup
<derek> im going to modconf now to set
<derek> then installing drive is that ok?
<derek> or must i install drive first?
<jcater> I also have sr_mod selected
<jcater> on that same menu
<jcater> so it must be related
<jcater> (as I don't have any other scsi stuff on this machine)
<jcater> you can do it now

<jamest> under woody just loading it was enough
<jamest> for me anyway
<jcater> really?
<jamest> it'll set the first drive to /dev/scd0 IIRC
<jcater> I had to go thru these steps
<chillywilly> first you send $100 to chillywilly
<dneighbo> is that all one command?
<chillywilly> THEN
<chillywilly> you pray
<jcater> chillywilly: ah, so you are a televangalist
<jcater> or an irc-vangelist?
<jamest> after that cdrecord -scanbus found the device no problem
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> praaaise the Looord
<jamest> then I installed cdbackoven for kde 
<jamest> (as kde is the shit man)
<jamest> :P
<chillywilly> wash your mouth out jamest!
<jamest> that gave me drag and drop cd burning
<chillywilly> real men use the command line
<jamest> you have to pull the cdbakeoven .debs from the post to the kde3 on debian info page
<jamest> google search for kde3 debian
<jamest> i have to run
<jamest> l8r
<chillywilly> dneighbo: if you run kde I will hunt you down ;)
<jcater> and kiss him?
<jcater> for being so visionary?
<chillywilly> burn him at the stake of course

<dneighbo> jcater what do you use to burn?
<jcater> wee
<jcater> err
<jcater> well
Action: dneighbo isnt opposed to kde apps :)
<dneighbo> i need kde3 on this machine anyhow
<dneighbo> chillywilly: NOT FOR A DESKTOP 
<jcater> seeing as I only burn VideoCDs and Debian ISOs
<jcater> I use cdrdao
<jcater> but if jamest recommends something he gave to his lusers
<jcater> I'm sure it'll work for you
<dneighbo> fsck i meant to install as suid
<dneighbo> just a minute need to reconfig that
<dneighbo> so wifey and kids can burn cds
<chillywilly> dneighbo: that's like saying I'll se windows apps with wine
Action: dneighbo thinks thats why the drag and drop sounds nice
<chillywilly> you're still evil if you do ;)
Action: dneighbo has been called worse than 'evil'

<chillywilly> so you equate copying digital information to the moral equivalent of attacking a ship?
<jcater> so your device
<dneighbo> if it is this easy im impressed and will build a little faq

<jcater> is 0,1,0
<dneighbo> on my debian page for others
<jcater> dneighbo: I cut and pasted from the HOWTO
<jcater> that I told you to read
<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> yes but wading through howtos is painful
<chillywilly> it's that kind of mindset that bring us nice laws like the DMCA
<dneighbo> i am trying to compile debian specific howtos that are QUICK and DIRTY
<jcater> one comment before you get any further
<dneighbo> have ext2 to ext3, java plugin and flashplugin as more
<jcater> none of your cds are at /dev/hd?? any longer
<jcater> the DVD is at /dev/scd0

<jcater> the CD-R is at /dev/scd1
<jcater> you might want to create symlinks in /dev
<jcater> for /dev/cdrom /dev/dvd etc
<jcater> chillywilly: maybe so
<jcater> but it's also people ripping unauthorized copies that gets it started in the first place

<chillywilly> jcater: I have a paper copy now
<dneighbo> is there a gui tool out that is in debian sid ?
<jcater> dneighbo: most "GUI's" are actually shells around cdrecord

<chillywilly> and I also don't believe that copying an ebook is morally wrong if someone were to have the hard copy or not
<jcater> there's a difference between morality and legality :)
<chillywilly> sure, but I was talking abot morals as evil is not a legal term ;)
<chillywilly> afaik
<chillywilly> but I am saying it tongue-in-cheek as KDE is FS
<chillywilly> and I like giving dneighbo crap ;)

<jcater> if you wanna call him that
<chillywilly> he's a putz

<jcater> he's a puppet
<jcater> I can deal with a putz president
<chillywilly> dneighbo: did I forget to mention: gtoaster?
<reinhard> today is a public holiday in austria btw
<dneighbo> gtoaster i have up
<dneighbo> but its not very intuitive
<dneighbo> i just want to copy one disk to another
<dneighbo> and i dont see something simple to do that
<reinhard> oct 26 1955 the last american soldier left austria after ww2
<chillywilly> reinhard: what holiday is that?
<reinhard> it
<reinhard> 's like our jul 4th :)
<reinhard> it's the day of our independence
<reinhard> and the day we remember how good it is to be a neutral country
Action: jcater wishes we were neutral
<chillywilly> independence from Germany?
<jcater> but, NO, we have to be the fscking self-appointed police
<reinhard> neither belonging to nato nor to warshaw pact (sp?)
<reinhard> chillywilly: independence from occupation
<chillywilly> occupation by whom?
<reinhard> chillywilly: germany is still occupied by the US officially (IIRC)
<reinhard> since ww2
<chillywilly> really?
<reinhard> at least it was for a _very_ long time
<reinhard> as well as eastern germany was from russia

<dneighbo> im too dumb to get how the hell to use gtoaster
<dneighbo> its pretty and looks neat
<jcater> looks like it's something that might be useful sooner than later
<dneighbo> but there is no apparent clear way to actually do anything useful
<reinhard> at least it's a fact that after ww2 the USSR occupied several countries

<reinhard> they say it's because we have very good wine in austria
<reinhard> and when our politicans talked to russian politicans
<reinhard> they didn't talk too much but they gave them wine :)
<reinhard> enough of politics for today :)
<chillywilly> yes, it is a depressing subject ofr us lamericans
<chillywilly> er, for
<jcater> one really cool thing about owning a used book store now
<jcater> is it gives you a different perspective on history
<jcater> as we see some older books come through
<jcater> history books
<jcater> but stuff that the modern history books don't see as important
<jcater> as say WWII
<dneighbo> so is apt-get install konqueror enough?
<jcater> dneighbo: unless you need specialized stuff later on
<jcater> that gets most of kde
<dneighbo> ok cool
<chillywilly> sigh

<chillywilly> add that ;)
<dneighbo> chillywilly: you had your chance
<chillywilly> hey if you are too stpid then what can I say?
<dneighbo> and you never piped up on how to make gtoaster 'work'
<dneighbo> i installed it and fired it up
<chillywilly> I don't use it
<chillywilly> I use cdrecord
<dneighbo> if im too stupid i say try something for me
<chillywilly> :P
Action: dneighbo doesnt want to spend 4 hours learning how to burn a cd
<dneighbo> if i cant do it in 10 minutes the software is designed like crap
<dneighbo> i want my 7 year old to be able to burn cds
<dneighbo> in fact installing this thing appears to have been so easy (thanks jcater)
<dneighbo> that i spent more time trying to use gtoaster than i did installing the darn drive
<chillywilly> whatever
<chillywilly> xcdroast is better
<dneighbo> btw: your current attitude is exactly why people are flocking to kde and away from gnome :

<dneighbo> cdbakeove looks nice but it doesnt recognize my drives

<jcater> did the apt-get install konq grab a lot?
<dneighbo> yeah
<dneighbo> but apparently not enough
<jcater> did it grab arts?

<derek> grrr
<derek> kde doesnt show up in gdm
Action: derek thinks konqueror probably isnt enough
Action: derek restarted gdm and still no dice
<jcater> hang on...
<jcater> apt-get install kdebase kdelibs
<jcater> does that grab anything?
<derek> oh hell yeah
<derek> like the world
Action: derek thinks that should likely do the trick :)
<derek> grabbed 31 new packages
<jcater> whoops
<derek> kdcop is one of them
<derek> and honestly i think thats what was missing
<jcater> I guess konqueror was enough to force my upgrade :)
<derek> as i saw dcop messages flying like nuts at startup of cdbake
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> dcop is really important in kde land
<derek> and kcontrol is likely the kcmshell stuff
<derek> kioslave likely could by why no see disks :)
<derek> etc etc etc
<jcater> although that tells me cdbakeoven debs are not properly depended
Action: derek agrees
<derek> HOWEVER
<derek> i did dpkg --install debpackage.deb
<derek> which i think ignores dependencies
<derek> BUT i needed not do that, i think its actually in the sources.list you gave me
<derek> as later i did apt-cache search and saw it and apt-get install tried to install but already newest (unless that .deb gets registered to apt-get once installed)
<jcater> yeah, it gets registered
Action: jcater learned that the hard way when doing some ltsp stuff :)
<jcater> I made some assumptions based on apt-cache search
<jcater> which weren't valid
<jcater> :(
<chillywilly> I can see again
<chillywilly> woooo
<derek> hmm xcdroast seemed decent but it doesnt work
<derek> looked like it saw the drives
<derek> and looked reasonable to use
<derek> but it tells me no data on cd when i have an audio cd in that bad boy
<chillywilly> I think most of the gui cd burner programs blow
<derek> grr i think the dvd drive must not work now or something
<derek> cdbake is now fixed i think and recognizes both drives
<jcater> why?
<derek> but it cant appear to find 'tracks' on the dvd
<derek> and niether could xcdroast
<derek> is there some other tool i can check to make sure that its not fried?
<jcater> I have to go pick up wife
<jcater> is there something  you use to listen to audio cds?
<derek> wtf
<derek> xmms
<derek> i run it
<derek> and go to /dev/scd0 and it shows the tracks
<derek> but if i try to play one it segfaults
<derek> grrr
Action: derek has the kind of luck where there is a bug
<derek> that dvd drives cant play audio tracks using ide-scsi
<derek> hmmm
<derek> different disk works
<derek> zoegirl must just be too mutilated already
<derek> trying to make legal backups as my kids are KILLING their cds
<jcater> ;)
<derek> cdbake still dont find squat though
<jcater> just like chillywilly was making a legal backup of his paper copy of LOTR, right?\
<jcater> :)
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I haven't used any of the above
<jcater> I don't even have a sound card
<derek> grrr xcdroast doesnt see it either
<jcater> does xmms?
<derek> yes
<chillywilly> jcater: foad
<derek> gtoaster shows the tracks
<derek> but i cant figure out how to use the darn thing
<chillywilly> pray ;)
<chillywilly> just like using gnue tools ;)
Action: chillywilly ducks
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 00:44:33)
<derek> cdbakeoven is crap
<derek> it segfaults and gives crap errors grr
<derek> xcdroast shows most promise
<derek> it just doesnt find the tracks
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> like I said I think most of the gui programs are crap, crazymike has tried them all just like you and he eventually gave p and used the command line tool
<derek> im darn close
<derek> i wouldnt mind
<derek> BUT
<derek> i really do want wife and kids to be able to burn and iam not going to make them use command line
Action: jcater doesn't think jamest was testing out CD-to-CD burning
<jcater> as that isn;t soemthing he'd be setting up for his users
<derek> jcater: likely thats the problem
<jcater> nor would I
<derek> as i think that DAO is not well supported under linux
<derek> im trying cdrdao
<jcater> it's not DAO
<jcater> it's what you're doing
<jcater> you aren't doing cd mastering
<jcater> which is what we were giving programs to do
<derek> im pretty sure what im doing requires DAO
Action: jcater uses dao all the time
<jcater> for mastering stuff
<jcater> it very well may
<derek> and that dumb cdbake trying to convert stuff
<derek> instead of just 'copy' stuff
<derek> or so it seemed
Action: jcater didn't realize you were just copying cds at first
Action: derek doesnt pretend to understand music file formats
<chillywilly> the only diff is if you do TAO it adds a pauise between each song
<chillywilly> DAO will give you the whole shebang with no pauses between
<chillywilly> TAO == track at once, DAO == disk at once
<jcater> did you select Audio CD Copy?

<derek> hey if gnucash and gnome have gwrap
<derek> does kapital and kde have kwrap ;)
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> what's gwrap?
--- Sun Oct 27 2002
<derek> guile wrap
<derek> a C guile wrapper iirc written by gnucash team for gnucash but other projects use it too (i think)
Action: derek cant get gtoaster to work for non direct cd stuff
<derek> it looked VERY promising in that i could drag and .ogg file and it woudl appear to conver to an audio file on the fly for me
<derek> but it locks up burning no matter what i do
<ajmitch> how irritating
<derek> i switched to precaching things and it actually locks there, so its not a 'burn' issue
<derek> is a gtoaster conversion issue
Action: ajmitch can burn at 4x!!
<derek> as i appear to be able to make a data cd of .ogg/.mp3 directly
<derek> jsut not letting gtoaster convert to cdaudio
<ajmitch> hmm
<derek> i might just steal their command line syntax
<derek> and try to do the conversion myself
<derek> and then burn the wav files to cd
<derek> and see if it works
<derek> luckly i have lots and lots of free media or i might be pissed by now :)
<derek> but cd 2 cd seems to go very nicely (knock on wood)

Action: jbailey is away: dinner
<Mr_You> anyone around?
<ajmitch> yup
<Mr_You> does trigger code get executed on clients and appserver or both?
<ajmitch> mostly clients, depends on the form
<ajmitch> not sure how well appserver does triggers at the moment, would have to ask siesel or reinhard
<Mr_You> ok, well siesel mentioned this:
<Mr_You> p<siesel> the important trigger/business logic/consitence checking etc. should
<Mr_You>          be done i appserver, in case of javascript AND python clients.
<ajmitch> right, so that'd be remote triggers in appserver
<ajmitch> there might be some stub code for calling that within the forms - i am not certain
<Mr_You> ok, well that solves a problem of javascript and python
<ajmitch> yup
<Mr_You> you had me worried :-P
<ajmitch> just requires a simple xml-rpc call, i guess
<ajmitch> hehe
<Mr_You> yeah
<ajmitch> as i said, it depends on the forms - most forms now have inline python triggers
<ajmitch> but hopefully they'll move away from that
<Mr_You> well, atleast there is some trigger flexibility with remote triggers
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> i think i'd prefer remote triggers
<Mr_You> it seems the best route for the javascript client will be XMLRPC only.
<Mr_You> you seen the latest tablet PCs?
<ajmitch> nope
<ajmitch> nice compact units?
<Mr_You> microsoft demoed some to some linux developers and they were cheering hehe ;-)
<ajmitch> hehe
<Mr_You> mainly cause its leading edge technology
<Mr_You> basicly its a PC that can be used with a pen in tablet mode and be docked with a keyboard for laptop/desktop mode
<jcater> that's going to be sooo damn much overhead
<jcater> having remote-only triggers
<jcater> can you imagine the communications
<jcater> between client and server
<jcater> for every single keystroke, etc
<ajmitch> ouch?
<Mr_You> I dunno.. lets test it out?  ;-)
<jcater> I'm not
<jcater> y'all can
<Mr_You> X has high overhead  but people still use it ;-)
<jcater> yunno
<jcater> all my workstations at my callcenter
<jcater> also aren't dependent on a single X server either
<Mr_You> yeah hardware is cheap enough you don't need to
<Mr_You> but admins still use remote X
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> you miss my point
<jcater> of a SINGLE point of failure
<jcater> I will never run such a setup at NCS
<jcater> I've had way too much experience
<jcater> with stuff like that failing 
<jcater> but to each his own :)
<Mr_You> so how do you propose high avaibility appserver?  ;-)
<jcater> why do you assume I'd ever use appserver?
<jcater> I think it's great people are wanting it and writing it
<Mr_You> how are you providing HA database service?
<jcater> but that doesn't translate into me ever using it
<jcater> you think appserver will provide that?
<jcater> appserver is yet another point of contact
<Mr_You> how are you providing HA database service?
Action: jcater uses Oracle with HA hardware
<jcater> and real-time backups
Action: jcater is never down
<Mr_You> ok
Action: jcater went the route of having middleware
<ajmitch> so eventually we'll have 2 classes of forms - those that are appserver-dependant, and those that are not
<jcater> and my HA went <poop>
<jcater> :)
<Mr_You> HA  is spensive
<jcater> ajmitch: I'm talking about my custom stuff
<ajmitch> jcater: yeah
<jcater> I'm not thrilled about GNUe requiring an appserver for all the accounting stuff
<Mr_You> it really just comes down to flexibility
<jcater> not thrilled at all
<jcater> but that's not my call
<jcater> Mr_You: I've been there, done that
<jcater> like I said, to each his own
<Mr_You> well I want business logic.
<Mr_You> done what?
<jcater> middleware
<Mr_You> you mean HA middleware software right?
<jcater> I mean application servers
<Mr_You> basicly a hack ;-)
<Mr_You> ahh well you just use triggers for business logic?
<jcater> "just" ?
<jcater> yeah, I use triggers
<Mr_You> well triggers is a broad description
<Mr_You> GNUe Triggers ;-)
<Mr_You> bottom line is HA is expensive until PostgreSQL has production quality replication.
<Mr_You> which I think is in the works
Action: jcater is curious as to how this deals with appserver, as appserver isn't exactly HA
<Mr_You> it doesn't, you just took the appserver conversation into single point of failure ;-)
<Mr_You> appserver could provide HA capabilities at some point
<Mr_You> more network traffic
<jcater> are you trying to convince me or yourself about application servers?
<Mr_You> nope
<Mr_You> I'm just making a point that HA is expensive and not normally available to small biz.
<jcater> my point is that, for a small business, you are adding yet one more layer that can, and at some point will, go wrong
Action: jcater works for a small biz
<jcater> it's a statistics game
<jcater> the more layers you add that can go down
<jcater> the more often you go down
<jcater> in my mind
<jcater> until you have multiple database servers
<jcater> something like an application server
<ajmitch> the more you get annoyed with the crap software you're using :)
<jcater> isn't gaining you anyhing
<jcater> but rather costing you
<Mr_You> you aren't suppose to go down with HA
<Mr_You> I understand your point
Action: jcater isn't discouraging anyone
<Mr_You> its a cost and risk vs benefit
<jcater> but there's a current trend toward middleware
<jcater> without looking at historical evidence
<jcater> and case studies
<jcater> for some, middleware makes sense
<jcater> but I see more times than not these days, "if it's not N-tier, how on earth am I supposed to use it"
<jcater> enterprises were successfully doing n-tier (and even 1-tier) long before n-tier
<jcater> but, I digress
<jcater> :)
<jcater> ...time for dinner
<Mr_You> you provide all your GNUe users with a single/shared database user account or it is "anonymous" or what?

<chillywilly> appserver should only have object/business rles in it not "triggers" as in ui events imho
<chillywilly> that's just stupid
<chillywilly> wtf is HA?
<ajmitch> high availability
<chillywilly> triggers for forms is not necessarily methods/triggers for the appserver
<chillywilly> as I agree with jcater you don't want frelling rcp calls for every little ui interaction
<chillywilly> ajmitch: thanks
<chillywilly> er, rpc
<chillywilly> then again how often does a form hit the db?
<chillywilly> not on every single trigger does it? I don't think it works that way...
