<derek> hi psu, esands
<psu> hi derek
<ajmitch> hey esands, psu, derek
<ajmitch> & all my other adoring fans
<psu> hmm this is not good 
<ajmitch> :)
<psu> can't even open e-mail now as not enuf room for tmp file
<ajmitch> how annoying

<esands> LVM is useful in that situation.

<psu> I have now made room
<psu> (by un-dselecting some "uneeeded" packages)
<derek> ajmitch: i responded to it
<derek> hopefully they will join efforts of GBN for what they are wanting
<derek> btw: i find it hilarious that Tony states he will not allow dictatorship and that peopel tried to over take FD
<derek> but then he acts like a dictator dictating what people want to do with this new incarnation
<ajmitch> yup
<derek> and its like wait if its a true 'democracy' if they dont agree with him he is out
<ajmitch> quite typical :)
<derek> but he doesnt liek that idea
<ajmitch> everyone gotta play by his rules
<derek> i didnt bother to make that assertion as when i speak generally his pants come unglued
<ajmitch> he 'owns' the FD idea, so everyone must give him credit :)
<derek> so just pitching GBN will probably put him in an uncrontrollable tantrum
<ajmitch> so?
<ajmitch> i don't think many people support him anymore
<derek> obviously im not too worried :)
<derek> but certainly i stayed quiet on my true feelings as to not 'fan flames'
<ajmitch> hopefully GBN could get a bit more exposure from this
<derek> i.e. im trying to be a good boy
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> there was another list where we shared our true feelings about the situation
<derek> ajmitch: can i post your sources.list for gnomesword?
<ajmitch> umm
<ajmitch> to where?

<ajmitch> esands: nope
<derek> actually never mind
<derek> looks like they are upgrading debian to use never libsword even
<ajmitch> ah
<ajmitch> so is gnomesword recompiled?
<ajmitch> or does it need done?
<derek> um i would like newest versions :)
<derek> but would like to see them in debian
<ajmitch> oh great, kerberos flaw found
<derek> i think libsword is at 1.5
<derek> er 1.5.5 instead of 1.5.3

<jcater> lol
<jcater> two messages in a row asking about Oracle 9i support
<derek> oracle rocks
<derek> my question is people looking for ERP that love oracle, why not looking at compiere ;)
<jcater> honestly, that's a good question
<jcater> I don't know if you asked in jest or not
<jcater> but I'd be curious as to why
<jcater> uggh!
<jcater> flu, flu, go away
<jcater> come back another day
<derek> both
ninja (rossg@home.golder.org) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> i was kind of kidding but kind of serious
<derek> as even if i had oracle i would want gnue :)

<derek> pradhap: did you see my question
<pradhap> jcater: did you see my mail ??
<derek> about if you use and have oracle 9i have you seen compiere
<derek> an 'open source' ERP built on oracle 9i and java?
<derek> it isnt a framework like gnue but its packages are far more complete
Action: derek thinks long term you are better off with gnue (and we do work with oracle)
<derek> but am curious if you saw compiere or not
<derek> btw: jcater responded to your email
<jcater> pradhap: you will need DCOracle2
<jcater> from
<jcater> http://www.zope.org/Members/matt/dco2/DCOracle2-1.2.tgz
<derek> ===========
<derek> You will need to install DCOracle2 (a Python Oracle driver) on your
<derek> Debian
<derek> machine in order to access Oracle. This can be obtained from: 
<derek>   http://www.zope.org/Members/matt/dco2/DCOracle2-1.2.tgz
<derek> Untar this file and run "python setup.py".  Be sure your $ORACLE_HOME
<derek> variable is properly set.  Also, on my setup, I have needed: 
<derek>    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib
<derek> at some point in the past. I don't think this had to be set on my most
<derek> recent upgrade, though. 
<derek> This will, of course, require the Oracle OCI8 client libraries on the
<derek> Debian machine. 
<derek> =====================
<jcater> yes, what derek said :)
<derek> i think there is a sample connections.conf entry in the sample as well
<derek> if not jcater can surely provide you with one
<pradhap> fine ..
<derek> or the documentation (new guide) will have one
<jcater> oops, I cut and pasted that response from another email
wayneg (~merlinx@ppp1514.qld.padsl.internode.on.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> so ignore that "on the Debian machine"
<derek> yeah its 'debian' specific
<jcater> if you are not on debian
<jcater> it's not debian specific
<derek> but you gave url for package so its relevant
<jcater> it requires the Oracle OCI8 libraries on whatever platform
<jcater> FreeBSD, Debian, Windows, RedHat, etc
<pradhap> ok
<jcater> my connections.conf file looks like:
<jcater> [op]
<jcater> comment = NCS Production
<jcater> provider = oracle
<jcater> service = PROD.DBS.NCSMAGS.COM
<jcater> just fyi
<pradhap> fine ..
<jcater> where PROD.DBS.NCSMAGS.COM is from my tnsnames.ora file
<jcater> I hope this helps
<jcater> we did answer your question, right?
<pradhap> yes ..
<pradhap> i will try to setup... if any queries, i will be back :-) to disturb you guys ..
<pradhap> thanks for your support guys ...
<jcater> no problem
<jcater> that's why we're here
<pradhap> :D
<pradhap> my doubt was that in zope website, it was give DCOracle2 driver works with Oracle 8... so i thought it will not be compatible with Oracle 9i
<pradhap> that's were i stuck ..
<jcater> well
<jcater> I *think* they are referring to the OCI version
<nickr> ydou guys heard of WSDL?
<jcater> which I don't think changed from Oracle8 to Oracle9
<jcater> I'm actually still on Oracle8
<jcater> so I can't verify that
<jcater> I hope it works for you though
<pradhap> ok i will verify i will mail you ....
<derek> i have
<derek> nickr: wasnt it predecessor to SOAP or a piece of it
<derek> Web Services Definition Language or something?
<nickr> derek: From what I read its like a nameservice for SOAP
<derek> yes
<nickr> Like all the w3c xml standards its terribly verbose
<nickr> http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl
<derek> fwiw: the microsoft .net guy couldnt shut up about this
<derek> which tells me a lot about what it probably means :)
<derek> in a nut shell
<nickr> I think the *concepts* of SOAP and WSDL are useful
<derek> microsoft wants to be the networksolutions
<derek> of WSDL
<nickr> I'm not sure about this particular iteration
<derek> all your WSDL belongs to m$
<nickr> Oh its not a global nameservice
<nickr> its a way of asking a particular host what interfaces they impliment
<nickr> like uhh
<nickr> that thing thatns part of sunrpc
<derek> no im telling you i got 5 DAYS of .net immersion about 4 months ago
<derek> one can run local WSDL
<derek> and one can run a WSDL server
<derek> but mickeysoft wants to control it
<nickr> Well sure
<derek> i.e. say quicken talks to banks via webservices
<nickr> if they are retargeting themselves as service-based
<derek> m$ wants to be the one that holds the WSDL stuff for that
<derek> under prepice
<nickr> makes sense
<derek> bank dont trust microsoft
<derek> quicken dont trust bank
<nickr> Seems silly when its not a big deal to host it yourself
<derek> everyone (sic) trusts microsoft
<derek> re-examine that sentence
<derek> seems silly = microsoft
<nickr> heh.
<derek> seems silly that one would use a global login designed and maintained by the fellows who bring us the I love you and klez
<derek> but m$ still thinks passport is a good idea
<derek> ok going to work for real now
<nickr> I think the concept of passport is good, although a more distributed implimentation would be better
<nickr> er
<nickr> rather
<nickr> a distributed network of trust
<pradhap> bye guys

<jcater> can you try running with the -s option, and seeing if it still segfaults?

<jcater> you probably want to modify your gnue.conf file with: 
<jcater> [forms]
<jcater> disableSplash = 1
<jcater> then you won't have to use the -s option all the time
<jcater> we are having some issues with timeouts on our splash screen
<jcater> it rears it's ugly head on slower machines
<jcater> I guess we either need to find a solution, or disable the splashscreen by default :(
<lawrence> it is a timer issue; 
<lawrence> i don't do any thing an it segv
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> the problem is, if the splashscreen tries to disappear
<jcater> before the main screen is completely drawn
<jcater> it segfaults
<jcater> we can increase the timer more

<btami_> hi all
<btami_> Arturas you here?
Nick change: btami_ -> btami
<Arturas> hi Bajusz
<btami> hi
<Arturas> yes, i'm here
<btami> i have this in my sitecustomize.py :
<btami> import sys, locale
<btami> loc = locale.getdefaultlocale()
<btami> if loc[1]:
<btami>   sys.setdefaultencoding(loc[1])
<btami> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, '')
<btami> print 'Default encoding: %s' %sys.getdefaultencoding()
<btami> print 'Locale conventions: %s' %locale.localeconv()
<btami> what do you think ?
<btami> in this way no need to set different encodings
<Arturas> if i understand you correctly
<Arturas> you're offering final user to modify his/her sitecustomize.py
<Arturas> to enable GNUe work with his/her encoding?
<btami> no and yes :)
<btami> i imagine that setup rocess puts sitecustomize.py 
<btami> into some right place
<Arturas> one linux guru noticed, that forcing users to modify sutecustomize.py is no good for several reasons - the most simpliest case would be some other software that needs current sitecustomize and it can't work with other sitecustomize and GNUe, that can't work with current sitecustomize
<Arturas> it's good for us as developers
<Arturas> it's good for some users
<Arturas> but we can't enforce this
<Arturas> and we should be able to support encodings as well as possible with current sitecustomize.py
<btami> maybe we can offer this if there isn't any sitecustomize.py
<Arturas> [i _think_ (i don't know this for sure) that installing python installs sitecustomize.py]   yes, we can :)
<btami> in win32 and python 2.1 2.2 the file doesn't exist per default
<btami> and i think forcing enduser to make this file 
<btami> then write somethong into it
<btami> not a frendly thing
<btami> plus he have to know what is your encoding name
<Arturas> the idea is pretty good, but currently for me is enough not working setup-cvs.py for windows :) :) :)
<btami> ok :)

<Arturas> currently yes :/
<marioct> My python version is: Python 2.1.3
<Arturas> that shouldn't be a problem
<marioct> I'm new on python, so I can't find the problem .
<marioct> Do you know who made the debian packages ?
<Arturas> no
<marioct> so..... what can I do ?
<marioct> :)
<Arturas> if you're not in a big hurry, you can wait for a day or so
<Arturas> we'll find someone who did debs and he'll take a look at it
<nickr> one of the js made them
<nickr> complain to them
<nickr> I think
<Arturas> there was something on mailing list...
<Arturas> one moment
<marioct> thanks.
<Arturas> marioct: you have all the dependencies, don't you?
<nickr> I don't think that error would occur if there were missing dependencies
<Arturas> what would occur then??
<nickr> It'd say it can't import something like mxtime or whatever
<nickr> Or the package wouldn't install
<nickr> its having trouble importing something internal to the package
<marioct> yes
<marioct> I have all the dependencies.
<Arturas> i don't find it in my mailbox, but i seem to remember there was something about it... maybe i'm mistakening
<nickr> in this week's gnue kernel cousins they say who is responsable I think
<marioct> I'll see there.

<nickr> revDeke: rev1
<revDeke> bye marioct hopefully someone helped you
<nickr> revDeke: We just abused him until he agreed to leave quietly
<marioct> hello.
<marioct> I find the problem.
<marioct> I found the problem.
<revDeke> what was it?
<revDeke> so if someone else comes in with same issue we can answer for them
<marioct> A previous version installed in my mystem :)
<revDeke> jcater is one that made the debs by the way and the code from them is in cvs (iirc) in case issue comes up again
<revDeke> normally jcater is here and quick to respond, but he has the flu rather badly and is very busy at work
<revDeke> so he is kind of quiet today
<revDeke> we try to be helpful
<revDeke> to offset the fact that we are completely whacked
<marioct> ok, but the deb package was ok, my system was the problem.
<marioct> now I need another help.
<marioct> what is Error: No Forms Definition File Specified. when I execute gnue-forms ?
<Arturas> you have to put some form file
<Arturas> as a first parameter
<Arturas> like: gnue-forms form.gfd
<marioct> ok, and there is any form file with examples ?
lawrence (~lawrence@bsd01.necessity.org) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> yes
<Arturas> in cvs tree it is under forms/samples/simple/form.gfd

<revDeke> that is my favorite mexican dish
<jcater> ok, it was pizza then
<jcater> deep fried
<jcater> with mexican flavorings
<revDeke> you see they have deep fried twinkies now?
<jcater> yeah
<revDeke> and such at fairs and stuff
<jcater> haven't tried one yet, though
Action: revDeke is curious as to what they taste like
Action: jcater guesses it would taste like a twinkie, only fried
<psu> in Scotland, they have deep-fried Mars Bars
<psu> drochaid could vouch for this
<revDeke> not only do twinkies have an unlimited shelf life
Arturas (~arturas@fmgs-03.vtu.lt) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> they can survive being dipped in frying oil
<nickr> they are european mars bars though,
<nickr> not american ones
<psu> revDeke: didn't they used to say, after the Bomb drops
<revDeke> psu: yes the fair here had twinkies, mars, snickers etc etc all deep fried
<psu> all that will survicve willbe the roaches and the twinkies
<revDeke> psu: eat a box of twinkies and you will wish the bomb had dropped ;)
<psu> conversion table is IIRC
<psu> europe Mars == USA milky way
<psu> europe Milky Way == USA something else
<psu> USA Mars no equiv
<psu> and (until about 10 years ago)
<psu> europe Marathon == USA Snickers
<psu> but now we have been snickered too
Action: psu has no idea why anyone would be the least interested in this, but is merrily typing away anyway
Action: nickr snickers
<nickr> psu: you are rather educated in the candy arts
Action: psu wonders why the python books don;t use that as a dictionary example
<jcater> nickr: what else do you think gov't accountants do?
Action: psu is like a jedi, but w/candy bars, not light sabres
<psu> Actually, there was a Force bar once, IIRC
<nickr> you don't 'use' the force, you ingest it
Action: jcater is like a jelly roll, but w/a thicker exterior
<psu> I suppose really it should have been 1/2 milk 1/2 plain choc
<psu> then it could have had a light side and a dark side...

Nick change: potatochipsman -> cheetosman

Nick change: cheetosman -> psu
<revDeke> when you call yourself donutman i envision you with the stupid little hat and glasses of the real donutman and his lispy voice and the giant donut jumping around and well, its a disturbing vision :)
<jcater> what?
<jcater> you don't have a giant jumping donut?
<jcater> I thought everyone did
<revDeke> if you are donutman does that make chillywilly 'duncan'
<nickr> psu: do you declare the extra weight?
<revDeke> wtf
<revDeke> i was going to order you a donutman shirt
<revDeke> but they only make them in kids sizeds
<psu> nickr: like oscar, I have nothing to declare but my genius ;-)
<nickr> haugh
<revDeke> i will get you the puppet instead
<revDeke> http://www.donutman.net/puppets.htm
<nickr> revDeke: wtf, they should make them in lardass sizes too
<revDeke> actually TJ would probably like donut man
<jcater> revDeke: is donut man annoying as hell?
<jcater> if so, TJ will probably like him
<jcater> "Remember... Life without Jesus is like a donut"
<jcater> wtf?!?!?!?
<jcater> donuts are a GOOOOOD thing, man!
<jcater> so what conclusion should we draw from his statement?

<revDeke> :)
<revDeke> actually i think 0.3.0 broke it
<revDeke> 0.4.0 might have fixed it
<revDeke> btw: can i escalate a feature ?
<revDeke> at least 4 others have asked for and now i need for production application
Action: jcater checks his mailbox for donuts
<jcater> bbias
<jcater> hmmm
<revDeke> 1. the realtime updating of dropdown boxes
<jcater> no donuts
<revDeke>  /dcc donuts(dozen(2))
<revDeke> what i have is a case of product categories
<revDeke> that can have parents
<revDeke> the parents are in combo boxes
<revDeke> so if i add a new one
<revDeke> then add a second and want what i added as the first to be a parent, i have to shut the form down and restart it 
<revDeke> to get it to show in the dropdown
Action: revDeke hopes that is clear
<revDeke> i know we discussed in detail when someone else asked about it
Action: revDeke would be fine if i can do it via triggers
<lawrence> is there a gnue reference database used for demos?
<revDeke> most of the samples have sql create scripts
<revDeke> to create teh database to run the demos
<revDeke> currently they are for postgres
<revDeke> BUT
<revDeke> i plan (or someone else could) convert them to use GNUe Schema Definition
<revDeke> in which case all dbs woudl be supported :)
<lawrence> i ran some demos but they complained about no data 
<lawrence> tables don't exist
<revDeke> what demo?
<lawrence> zipcode stuff went in
<revDeke> jcater: im thinking maybe we make gear files
<revDeke> and navigator files
<revDeke> and one of the launchers on the navigator runs the actual db create scripts?
<lawrence> oh I never got to navigator yet, thanks.
<jcater> revDeke: I'm adding a resetForeignKey, but do note that you are programming for specific UI features
<jcater> if using a combo that way
<psu> for the record, both the downloads/current and downloads/releases dirs

<jcater> 0.4.0a?

<KeithJagrs> lawrence: are wanting?
<jcater> they are wanting a little TLC

<lawrence> The docs on the web site sell gnue very well

<siesel> hi all
<jcater> hi
<KeithJagrs> hi siesel
<siesel> jcater: btw. the new openoffice developer version should support docbook import+export
<jcater> siesel: not really
<jcater> they say that
<jcater> but that's what I'm using
<jcater> and it doesn't have it
<jcater> I think you need Java 1.4 installed
<jcater> plus a few other things
<siesel> yes, I tried it several times - even on WiNdOwS - but it didn't worked for me :(
<siesel> I thought you would probably have more luck ;)
<siesel> btw. what about the next release? will it be 0.4.1 (i.e. bugfixing) or a 0.5.0 ?
<jcater> my thinking: 
<jcater> if I get curses working well
<jcater> in short time
<jcater> 0.5.0
<jcater> if not, 0.4.1
<siesel> or even 0.6.0 looking at the speed you and jamest are commiting things ;)
<KeithJagrs> 0.5.0 ?? 0.6.0?
<KeithJagrs> it all depend on curses?
<jcater> ?
<jcater> 0.4.1 or 0.5.0
<jcater> curses and my developer's guide
<jcater> I don't want to go 0.5.0 without a good developer's guide finished
<jcater> well
<jcater> finished is a bad word

<revDeke> then when you release 0.5.0 and half the implementation is different
<revDeke> it makes for great luser torture :)
<siesel> that's the problem with documentation: you have to update it. :)

<revDeke> its not until you print it that it looks goofy

<jcater> I've printed it
<jcater> oh, well
<revDeke> not a huge deal
<jcater> I'm sure ps2pdf is handling something incorrectly
<revDeke> as long as its not wide spread im not losing sleep
<revDeke> and it views fine
<jcater> I can use Acrobat Distiller come release time
<jcater> OpenOffice 643 has an "Export to PDF" menu option
<revDeke> well i would be curious if you make a distiller copy
<revDeke> if the problem goes away
<jcater> but she segfaults every single time I try it
<jcater> so as soon as OO gets that working
<jcater> I'm sure it'll be irrelevant
<jcater> I don't have distiller at home

<revDeke> thats ok we wont use distiller

<lawrence> emacs with etags works was the best I found so far
<lawrence> boa crashes
<jcater> kate has good syntax highlighting
<jcater> are you gnome or kde (or neither?)
<jcater> I've heard good things about gedit (for gtk or gnome)
<lawrence> I have major problems with gnome locking X11 
<revDeke> i like gedit a bit
<lawrence> so now i use KDE
<revDeke> im sorry
<revDeke> flux or blackbox is best
<nickr> scripto bold!
<revDeke> rock
<revDeke> actually i would like to try blackbox more
<revDeke> or some other light variants
<revDeke> its weird as now my main computer uses only flux and im used to it and dont feel like im 'missing' things
<revDeke> so its really hard to justify kde or gnome anymore
<revDeke> but for the wife gnome is great (she didnt like kde for some reason)
<revDeke> mainly cause she used the foot first
<revDeke> thats what we call it at our house :)
<revDeke> its not gnome its the foot
<jcater> lawrence: have you tried kate?
<lawrence> gnome is cute
<revDeke> so is kate ;)
<jcater> it's a standard part of KDE 3+
<lawrence> I have kate loaded but have not tried it
<revDeke> jcater how did you get kde3 on debian?
Action: jcater thinks it was in 2.2.2 as well, but 3+ is even better
<revDeke> can you send me the steps in an email?
<revDeke> as i need kde3 to make my music db program work
<revDeke> and i dont want to compile from scratch
<jcater> I could tell you
<jcater> but then I'd have to kill you
<revDeke> does that cost extra?
<lawrence> i ran kde compile and down load over night
<jcater> deb http://ftp.du.se/pub/mirrors/kde/stable/3.0.4/Debian/sid/ ./
<jcater> apt-get install konqueror
<revDeke> rock will have to try tomorrow or late tonight
<revDeke> bbl

<siesel> jcater: I've tried to build a testcase for that resetForeignKey() statement, but there are some issues, which need to change a bit of code in common 
<siesel> do you have 5 mins?

<jcater> siesel: I hadn't finished the resetForeignKey stuff
<jcater> I just committed because I had to come home
<siesel> its the parameter stuff which made me changing stuff.
<jcater> ?
<siesel> i've made a form with two dropdowns. The user can choose a state in the first, and should choose a city in the next and will get displayed the zipcode in an style=label entry 
<siesel> the second dropdown is using a parameter in a condition to display just the cities from the state chosen in the first dropdown
<siesel> so I added a setParameter function. 
<jcater> hrm
<siesel> but that didn't work because of caching parameters values in the cparam class and 
<jcater> right
<siesel> because of the dbsig dbdriver replacing the staticCondidition by a preparsed string :(
<siesel> which is also the reason of passing a parameter in the command line is not working at the moment.
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I had intended on runtime parameters to be read only
Action: jcater is trying to think through your example
lawrence (~lawrence@bsd01.necessity.org) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<siesel> yes, thats (should runtime parameter be read only) was the thing I was not so shure about.
<jcater> I guess they don't have to be
<jcater> I suppose we can add a setParameter and get rid of the caching code
<siesel> other possibilities would be to have a 'populateForeignKey' or a 'add/change staticConditions'
<jcater> I doubt the caching code speeded things up much anyway
<siesel> So I will change the dbsig thing too.
<jcater> where's that at?
Action: jcater hadn't noticed it
<siesel> its in __conditiontoSQL  (_dbsig/DBdriver.py)
<siesel> the BAD line is: element._children[i] = self.__conditionToSQL(element._children[i])
<siesel> This will change the GObj tree.
<jcater> well, phooey
Action: jcater wonders what kind of performance hit a change like that will make
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I wonder....
<jcater> should we NOT modify the GObj tree in _dbsig
<jcater> but still create the static condition
<jcater> but add an invalidateCachedConditions() method
<siesel> it will only change the staticConditions, because the rest will allways be newly created
<jcater> ?
<siesel> the dbsig stuff is not REALLY caching anything, but just overwriting child nodes.
<siesel> f.e. 1. time:  and(eq(obj('state'),obj('NY')),gr(obj('sales'),obj('21'))))
<siesel> 2. time:  and("state = NY","sales>21")
<siesel> but its not important how it works now. its important how it should work.
<jcater> it recursively changes stuff until you are left with a single string
<jcater> so that it only has to do that once
<siesel> yes, but the only caching it is doing is to store these strings into the child nodes instead of the old GObjects
<jcater> in the end, there's only one node
<siesel> BUT the whole string should be stored at an other place and the child nodes should be left alone
<jcater> I said that earlier :)
<jcater> <jcater> I wonder....
<jcater> <jcater> should we NOT modify the GObj tree in _dbsig
<jcater> <jcater> but still create the static condition
<jcater> <jcater> but add an invalidateCachedConditions() method
<jcater> maybe not plainly enough
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> there's not a clean solution to this
<jcater> to have changable runtime parameters
<jcater> I guess there are a few cases where that would be desirable, though
<siesel> the other possibility would be to change the staticConditions 
<siesel> using a trigger.
Action: jcater isn't sure what you're calling staticConditions
<jcater> is this the string that's finally built from __conditionsToSQL?
<siesel> no, thats a link from GDataObject to the <condition> childs of a GDatasource
<jcater> ah
<siesel> it is always combined with the "dynamic condition" to build a resultset
<jcater> ok, now it's coming back to me :)
<jcater> so you are thinking we could add a setCondition(<GCondition tree>) method to GDataSource?
<jcater> or something like that
<siesel> that would be great.
<jcater> ok
<jcater> works for me
<siesel> its just a bit OVERKILL for just changing a parameter
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-163.wasp.net.au) left irc: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)
<siesel> I mean, I would like to have both possibilities.
<jcater> true
<jcater> *but*
<jcater> what you are describing is not the typical case
<jcater> err, typical use of a parameter
<jcater> although I'm not opposed to having a setParameter
<jcater> as long as we don't add much more overhead to datasources
<jcater> that's my biggest fear
<jcater> e.g., I have one report using GNUe Reports right now
<jcater> that's a master/detail report
<jcater> there's approx 1,800 records in the master datasource
<jcater> so that's 1,800 times the child datasource is run
Action: jcater is just describing his current GNUe Reports usage
<jcater> I have much more complex reports to do
<siesel> my actual patch to have parameter working is just to NOT cache the static part of the parameters

<jcater> ok
lawrence (~lawrence@bsd01.necessity.org) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> If reports is getting too slow we still can add caching, and probably in a better way :)
<jcater> so, the plans are to add a DataSource.setCondition() and a Form.setParameter() and remove parameter caching?
<jcater> we can see how that works
<jcater> I may be worried about nothing :)
<jcater> but you do understand my worry about reports, right?
<siesel> I fully understand.
<siesel> And I finally know why you add that caching line to parameters
