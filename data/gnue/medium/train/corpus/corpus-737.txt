<derek> guile wrap
<derek> a C guile wrapper iirc written by gnucash team for gnucash but other projects use it too (i think)
Action: derek cant get gtoaster to work for non direct cd stuff
<derek> it looked VERY promising in that i could drag and .ogg file and it woudl appear to conver to an audio file on the fly for me
<derek> but it locks up burning no matter what i do
<ajmitch> how irritating
<derek> i switched to precaching things and it actually locks there, so its not a 'burn' issue
<derek> is a gtoaster conversion issue
Action: ajmitch can burn at 4x!!
<derek> as i appear to be able to make a data cd of .ogg/.mp3 directly
<derek> jsut not letting gtoaster convert to cdaudio
<ajmitch> hmm
<derek> i might just steal their command line syntax
<derek> and try to do the conversion myself
<derek> and then burn the wav files to cd
<derek> and see if it works
<derek> luckly i have lots and lots of free media or i might be pissed by now :)
<derek> but cd 2 cd seems to go very nicely (knock on wood)
<derek> got most of daughters cds archived
<derek> so originals no longer have to take beatings
Action: derek wishes dvds were easy to archive
Action: ajmitch has a slow drive
<ajmitch> someone pass me some caffiene, please

<chillywilly> with my cable connection
<jcater> I use it here at home
<psu> sounds good
<jcater> provides firewall, nat, dhcp

Action: jbailey is away: dinner
<Mr_You> anyone around?
<ajmitch> yup
<Mr_You> does trigger code get executed on clients and appserver or both?
<ajmitch> mostly clients, depends on the form
<ajmitch> not sure how well appserver does triggers at the moment, would have to ask siesel or reinhard
<Mr_You> ok, well siesel mentioned this:
<Mr_You> p<siesel> the important trigger/business logic/consitence checking etc. should
<Mr_You>          be done i appserver, in case of javascript AND python clients.
<ajmitch> right, so that'd be remote triggers in appserver
<ajmitch> there might be some stub code for calling that within the forms - i am not certain
<Mr_You> ok, well that solves a problem of javascript and python
<ajmitch> yup
<Mr_You> you had me worried :-P
<ajmitch> just requires a simple xml-rpc call, i guess
<ajmitch> hehe
<Mr_You> yeah
<ajmitch> as i said, it depends on the forms - most forms now have inline python triggers
<ajmitch> but hopefully they'll move away from that
<Mr_You> well, atleast there is some trigger flexibility with remote triggers
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> i think i'd prefer remote triggers
<Mr_You> it seems the best route for the javascript client will be XMLRPC only.
<Mr_You> you seen the latest tablet PCs?
<ajmitch> nope
<ajmitch> nice compact units?
<Mr_You> microsoft demoed some to some linux developers and they were cheering hehe ;-)
<ajmitch> hehe
<Mr_You> mainly cause its leading edge technology
<Mr_You> basicly its a PC that can be used with a pen in tablet mode and be docked with a keyboard for laptop/desktop mode
<jcater> that's going to be sooo damn much overhead
<jcater> having remote-only triggers
<jcater> can you imagine the communications
<jcater> between client and server
<jcater> for every single keystroke, etc
<ajmitch> ouch?
<Mr_You> I dunno.. lets test it out?  ;-)
<jcater> I'm not
<jcater> y'all can
<Mr_You> X has high overhead  but people still use it ;-)
<jcater> yunno
<jcater> all my workstations at my callcenter
<jcater> also aren't dependent on a single X server either
<Mr_You> yeah hardware is cheap enough you don't need to
<Mr_You> but admins still use remote X
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> you miss my point
<jcater> of a SINGLE point of failure
<jcater> I will never run such a setup at NCS
<jcater> I've had way too much experience
<jcater> with stuff like that failing 
<jcater> but to each his own :)
<Mr_You> so how do you propose high avaibility appserver?  ;-)
<jcater> why do you assume I'd ever use appserver?
<jcater> I think it's great people are wanting it and writing it
<Mr_You> how are you providing HA database service?
<jcater> but that doesn't translate into me ever using it
<jcater> you think appserver will provide that?
<jcater> appserver is yet another point of contact
<Mr_You> how are you providing HA database service?
Action: jcater uses Oracle with HA hardware
<jcater> and real-time backups
Action: jcater is never down
<Mr_You> ok
Action: jcater went the route of having middleware
<ajmitch> so eventually we'll have 2 classes of forms - those that are appserver-dependant, and those that are not
<jcater> and my HA went <poop>
<jcater> :)
<Mr_You> HA  is spensive
<jcater> ajmitch: I'm talking about my custom stuff
<ajmitch> jcater: yeah
<jcater> I'm not thrilled about GNUe requiring an appserver for all the accounting stuff
<Mr_You> it really just comes down to flexibility
<jcater> not thrilled at all
<jcater> but that's not my call
<jcater> Mr_You: I've been there, done that
<jcater> like I said, to each his own
<Mr_You> well I want business logic.
<Mr_You> done what?
<jcater> middleware
<Mr_You> you mean HA middleware software right?
<jcater> I mean application servers
<Mr_You> basicly a hack ;-)
<Mr_You> ahh well you just use triggers for business logic?
<jcater> "just" ?
<jcater> yeah, I use triggers
<Mr_You> well triggers is a broad description
<Mr_You> GNUe Triggers ;-)
<Mr_You> bottom line is HA is expensive until PostgreSQL has production quality replication.
<Mr_You> which I think is in the works
Action: jcater is curious as to how this deals with appserver, as appserver isn't exactly HA
<Mr_You> it doesn't, you just took the appserver conversation into single point of failure ;-)
<Mr_You> appserver could provide HA capabilities at some point
<Mr_You> more network traffic
<jcater> are you trying to convince me or yourself about application servers?
<Mr_You> nope
<Mr_You> I'm just making a point that HA is expensive and not normally available to small biz.
<jcater> my point is that, for a small business, you are adding yet one more layer that can, and at some point will, go wrong
Action: jcater works for a small biz
<jcater> it's a statistics game
<jcater> the more layers you add that can go down
<jcater> the more often you go down
<jcater> in my mind
<jcater> until you have multiple database servers
<jcater> something like an application server
<ajmitch> the more you get annoyed with the crap software you're using :)
<jcater> isn't gaining you anyhing
<jcater> but rather costing you
<Mr_You> you aren't suppose to go down with HA
<Mr_You> I understand your point
Action: jcater isn't discouraging anyone
<Mr_You> its a cost and risk vs benefit
<jcater> but there's a current trend toward middleware
<jcater> without looking at historical evidence
<jcater> and case studies
<jcater> for some, middleware makes sense
<jcater> but I see more times than not these days, "if it's not N-tier, how on earth am I supposed to use it"
<jcater> enterprises were successfully doing n-tier (and even 1-tier) long before n-tier
<jcater> but, I digress
<jcater> :)
<jcater> ...time for dinner
<Mr_You> you provide all your GNUe users with a single/shared database user account or it is "anonymous" or what?
jbailey (~jbailey@CPE014260028338.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<chillywilly> appserver should only have object/business rles in it not "triggers" as in ui events imho
<chillywilly> that's just stupid
<chillywilly> wtf is HA?
<ajmitch> high availability
<chillywilly> triggers for forms is not necessarily methods/triggers for the appserver
<chillywilly> as I agree with jcater you don't want frelling rcp calls for every little ui interaction
<chillywilly> ajmitch: thanks
<chillywilly> er, rpc
<chillywilly> then again how often does a form hit the db?
<chillywilly> not on every single trigger does it? I don't think it works that way...
