<johannesV> if we have a master-/detail-datasource. and there's a block bound to both sources. now jumping to a given master-record moves the record-pointer of both, the master and it's first detail-record. but it also fires the focus-triggers on the master record. shouldn't that also fire the focus-triggers for the detail-record/block ?
<johannesV> and if not (because the trigger is only fired for the current block of the form), why doesn't we fire the same focus triggers for 'normal' record-movement, but only on jumping to specific records ?

<reinhard> any ghostscript wizards here?
*** sacha has quit IRC
<reinhard> after upgrading to etch ghostscript refuses to work with truetype fonts
<reinhard> and I thought I ask in the world's #1 debian support channel ;-)
<jamest> lol
<jamest> after an endorsement like I hope someone has an answer, i know I dont
<jamest> like that
*** CirrusImage has joined #gnuenterprise
<johannesV> ha, jamest's here ...
<johannesV> :)
<johannesV> jamest, do you know why for what we do have that block-level focus-triggers ?
<johannesV> s/why for/for/
<jamest> iirc they provide a higher level trigger than per entry level
<jamest> so you could define a trigger that validates that fields x,y,z match a specific combo of values
<jamest> and block navigation if they did now
<jamest> now
<jamest> er, not
<jamest> iow, they fire on any focus change in that block
<reinhard> jamest: so this trigger should also be called when the focus stays in the block and you navigate to next record?
<jamest> that was how I recall it was supposed to work
<reinhard> (as a side note, I would not consider it a good idea to limit focus navigation in such a way)
<reinhard> but ok, that answers the question
<jamest> it was matching a feature in Oracle SQL*Forms
<jamest> IIRC
<jamest> as how sql forms did something
<jamest> again, iirc
<jamest> if you tried to switch focus from an entry
<jamest> entry -> pre-focus out fires
<jamest> form -> pre focus out fires
<jamest> er, damn
<jamest> entry -> pre-focus out fires
<jamest> block -> pre-focus out fires
<jamest> form -> pre focus out fires
<jamest> form -> pre-focus in fires
<jamest> block -> etc
<jamest> entgry -> etc
<jamest> though I'd suggest we verify that with jcater as I haven't had access to SQL*forms since the mid 90s
<reinhard> but block triggers would only fire if focus is moved from block a to block b, right?
<jamest> that's not how I remember it
<jamest> they fire for anything in them
<jamest> but seeing as how I couldn't tell you what I ate for dinner on friday
<reinhard> lol
<jamest> i have reason to doubt I recall the behaviour of SQL*forms from back when Oracle 6 was new

<jcater> yeah
<jcater> that's a good recap
<johannesV_> ok, haven't noticed that i've been disconnected
<johannesV_> jamest, thanks for the explanation  ...
<reinhard> regarding pep8
<reinhard> I think if we really all would adhere to it, we (johannes and me) would follow it, too
<jcater> I'm forcing myself to use it internally
<reinhard> so please just say if we are going that way or not
<reinhard> bbl
<jcater> I vote for yes
<jcater> jamest: ?
<jcater> this is (somewhat) unrelated... but I notice common's technote recommends adding an svn propset:keywords Id to all .py files
<jcater> is this worth adding at the svn hook level?
<jcater> any new .py files added to svn get the property set automatically?
<jamest> isn't it already that way?
<jcater> no
<jcater> it's not working, if so
<jamest> odd
<jamest> maybe that was internally
<jamest> i swore that was a repository level config option I set somewhere recently
*** derek has quit IRC
<jamest> i'm ok with pep8 and with making exceptions if needed
<jcater> fwiw, I switched designer from _() to u_()
<jcater> runs fine for me
<jcater> but buyer beware
<jamest> so would we do pure pep8?
<jamest> i'm ok with whatever
<reinhard> I'd say then we'd do a soft move to pep8
<reinhard> i.e. use it for all new code
<reinhard> and reformat accordingly to pep8 as we change code
<reinhard> but not actively break things
<reinhard> or just reformat for the sake of reformatting
<reinhard> ok?
<jamest> sure
<jamest> and would we try to use pylint as well?
<jcater> "reformat for the sake of reformatting" --> but if we're already in that code, then reformat if we have time?
<reinhard> jcater: right
<reinhard> I mean
<jcater> makes sense to me
<reinhard> as johannesV_ goes through gf* anyway, he would reformat
<reinhard> but I wouldn't for example just reformat all datasources code again
<reinhard> until there will be the next batch of changes there anyway
<jamest> sounds good to be
<jamest> me
<jcater> sounds good to be you?
<jamest> well, sure
<jcater>  /msg reinhard ... he sure if full of himself
<jcater> *is
<jamest> all the user requests, lack of time, male pattern baldness setting in
<jamest> who wouldn't want that

<reinhard> btw
<reinhard> can anybody answer the questions on gnue@gnu.org and gnue-dev@gnu.org?
<reinhard> seems like there's somebody having issues with designer under windows
<jcater> I responded
<jcater> looks like he has provider=kinterbasdb in his connections.conf
<jcater> I think he meant provider=interbase
<reinhard> doh
<reinhard> I could have seen that, too
<kilo> erm and if gnue@gnu.org works then why dont commit mails work?
<jcater> I was just noticing that
