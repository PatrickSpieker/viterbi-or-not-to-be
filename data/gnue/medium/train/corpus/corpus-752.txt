<SachaS> hi derek
<derek> hi SachaS
<SachaS> http://www.ebxml.org/ebxmlpodcasts.htm
<SachaS> another project almost closed :)
<SachaS> derek: how is life? must be late for you.
<derek> busy for most part
<derek> its like midnight here
<SachaS> i looked at asterisk. i remember you and your company started to integrate voip into your ruby apps ... would be interesting to see what you guys are up to ;)
<derek> we have click to dial integrated in our applications
<derek> we also have full CDR (call detail records)
<derek> working
<derek> with associations to contacts
<SachaS> now i am a bit too far away to come over and have look :(
<SachaS> but sounds very interesting.
<derek> we are doing some other fun stuff with asterisk
<derek> i think we will be making it a more aggressive line of business to our company
<derek> we currently have 5 external asterisk installs and then 3 internal (with cross country interoperability)
<derek> along with most of our developers running asterisk at home
<derek> we might be doing a 50 phone install next month which would be interesting
<SachaS> sweet!
<derek> coolest thing i have seen to date (and we used ruby to do it)
<derek> was i called into an extension and left a message at a prompt
<derek> then ran a report (which resulted in phone numbers)
<derek> we then had every phone number from the report called and played the message
<derek> we dialed out and called about 250 people with a 1 minute message in about 40 minutes
<derek> using no copper lines :)
<derek> in hindsight i think we could have done it about 20 minutes, but we were throttling it to six out bound calls at one time in a 10 second stager
<derek> expect our "phone tree" features to be live to our users very very soon now :)
<SachaS> nice
<derek> just remember that asterisk can hurt your head ( http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=191235340&size=m )
<SachaS> hehe
<SachaS> outsch
<SachaS> alian family
<SachaS> alien family
<derek> hopefully by weekend will have parallel installed (and more memory installed) so that i can have ubuntu up and working
<derek> then might be able to play with gnue more
<SachaS> the gnue activerecord interface is still outstanding ;)
* SachaS goes back to work
<derek> i think a lot of what rails does gnue was doing first :)
* derek too

<reinhard> good morning
*** btami has joined #gnuenterprise
<johannesV> hey btami ...
<johannesV> i've fixed a bug in the wx26-uidriver of the released version ...
<johannesV> is it possible for you to create a new win-installer-package ?
<johannesV> the new tar.gz-file is available via downloads (on the web-site)
<johannesV> it is called gnue-forms-0.5.14a

<btami> johannesV: just uploaded to http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~btami
<btami> the latest released runtime doesn't contains wx26, so i think it's better to place in my home only
<johannesV> why not ?
<johannesV> i mean, i thought the runtime is already suited with wx26 ... ?
<btami> no, that was a special edition for reinhard
<btami> it's in the prerelease dir
<btami> the latest released designer was not wx26 ready
*** derek has joined #gnuenterprise
<derek> jcater: do you know if grub supports raid?
<reinhard> btami: gnue-forms 0.5.14 (without a) had the wx26 uidriver there as well
<btami> yep
<reinhard> just the wx26 ui wasn't usable with "official" gnue-runtime
<btami> i'v talked about runtime
<reinhard> the same holds for 0.5.14a
<btami> yep
<reinhard> so if we had 0.5.14 in downloads, I see no striking reason to not have 0.5.14a there
<btami> ok
<reinhard> (but still, if you feel it shouldn't, I can happily live with your home directory)
<btami> i will move it to downloads
<reinhard> thanks
<btami> btw, the new box layout is cool, what do you want to be enhance before new release?
<reinhard> johannesV still sees some stability problems
<reinhard> and he is currently working on the new grid widget
<reinhard> and we are cleaning up the general GF* code, which still takes some time
<reinhard> brb
*** reinhard has quit IRC
<btami> thx
*** reinhard has joined #gnuenterprise
<reinhard> off for today
*** reinhard has quit IRC
<btami> johannesV: no *.zip for "a" in current
<btami> and *.dmg
<jcater> derek: yeah, I believe so
<derek> yeah it does
<derek> problem is lvm doesnt work much
<derek> unless you have a non lvm boot partition
<derek> we found another solution
<jcater> well, you have to use initrd
<jcater> but, yeah, not fun
<jcater> what other solution?
