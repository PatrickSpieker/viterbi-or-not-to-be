<derek> i added the GDebug.printMesg() statements
<derek> but the TODO: already existed ;)
<derek> too much code to wade through to fix properly tonight
<Vee2d2> =)
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> did you commit it to cvs?
<chillywilly> python is so beautiful
<chillywilly>    $Product->{"Accessories_aref"} = &getAccessories("productKey" => $productKey); # Many to many self referential

<Vee2d2> you're enjoying your tour de perl?
<chillywilly> erm...kinda but python is better ;)
<chillywilly> perl likes to fail silently
<chillywilly> python will throw exceptions at you
<chillywilly> cause if I mistype a variable name (which of course I do all the time) perl will just simply chug along like everything is gravy
<Vee2d2> that depends I think
<chillywilly> depends on what?
<chillywilly> try to access a non-existant variable of some python object and see what happens ;)
<Vee2d2> add a -W to your perl arguments.. eg: #!/usr/bin/perl -W 
<Vee2d2> should give you warnings
<chillywilly> doesn't help witha  cgi
<chillywilly> nor does it ever tell my anything useful
<chillywilly> I require()d a file that was non-existent and all I ever got was empty output
<chillywilly> python would throw ImportError
<Vee2d2> *shrug* I'm far from a perl monk.. I know just enough to be dangerous.. =)

<deprogram> reinhard: how much is actually being done to the appserver? it seems like everyone is working on a 2-tier arrangement
<jamest> that's not quite true
<jamest> us 2 tier losers have less of a live than the appserver people
<jamest> s/live/life
<jamest> and the goal is that forms/reports/designer just work w/ 3 tier
<jbailey> I think about appserver alot.
<jbailey> Does that count?
<jamest> that's why the appserver interface is just another datasource in gnue
<jamest> jbailey: um, no
<jamest> if things we think about alot counted, i'd have been arrested by now
<deprogram> lol
<jbailey> Hmm, good point.
<deprogram> well... i have a massive legacy application that needs to be reworked into a modern architecture
<deprogram> i'd like to put as much as possible into a middle tier
<jamest> I don't know what deployment looks like for appserver
<reinhard> deprogram: appserver unfortunately has much less progress than i would want it to have
<jamest> one thing that would help though is having someone like you using it
<deprogram> reinhard: so it seems - i'd be happy to work on it
<jamest> I know forms/reports/common are driven by jcater and my needs
<jamest> and sometimes even a user request
<reinhard> one thing that would help though is somebody that kicks my ass on a daily basis
<jamest> but we try to avoid that
<jamest> reinhard: I'd offer but it's a hell of a commute
<reinhard> :)
<jamest> deprogram: if you were to work on appserver that would be great
<reinhard> deprogram: yes what jamest said
<jamest> we're always looking for help
<reinhard> very great
<deprogram> well, it would be. i have to get more familiar w. python
<jamest> it's simple, just dont read gnue code :)
<jamest> well, some of it
<deprogram> :> it seems pretty transparent
<jamest> i've been told that some of it is too hard on python newbs
<jbailey> deprogram: We call that 'whitespace'
<deprogram> ooo. i like whitespace (i was a graphic designer)
<jamest> before you got too deep we'd need copyright assignment
<jamest> all of us have signed a copyright disclaimer assigning copyright to the FSF
<deprogram> i s'pose
<deprogram> oic
<jamest> it's our way of insuring no one can take their ball and go home later
<deprogram> certainly
<jbailey> jamest: And passing the buck legally to someone else.
<jamest> oh yeah
<deprogram> makes sense. it may be difficult to persuade my boss that he needs to pay me to hack open src
<jamest> it'd be much harder to sue the fsf than say jcater
<jbailey> deprogram: It's usually less hard than you think.
<jamest> of course you wouldn't get much sueing any of us :)
<deprogram> otoh, if i write a closed package he will be faced with maintaining it after i quit and move to amsterdam
<jbailey> deprogram: The trick is to do a serious cost-benefit analysis.  If, in 2 weeks of solid hacking you can get X, and there's no assets, it's usually worth it.
<deprogram> which i will if bush gets re-elected
<jbailey> Most employers hate acquiring assets - then they have to write them down.
<jbailey> A serious database app can be $10k easy.
<deprogram> we've been throwing time (and clients money) trying to get a broken proprietary product to work
<deprogram> i would say quite a bit more than $10k

<psu> hi all
<Vee2d2> howdy psu
<deprogram> greetings psu
<psu> heh
Action: psu is looking at the website
<psu> we currently have the downloads just on the www.gnuenterprise.org version of the site
<psu> I guess we really ought to have them on the www.gnu.org/software/gnue/ site as well
<psu> or
<psu> even go the whole hog and put them in ftp://ftp.gnu.org//gnu/gnue 
<psu> only problem is that I can't find any documentation on how to do the latter 
<psu> aha
<psu> found it 
<psu> https://savannah.gnu.org/faq/?group_id=11&question=How_do_I_add_files_in_the_download_area.txt
<psu> but doesn't seem to load to ftp.gnu.org, just savannah
Action: psu is not sure about just putting the downloads on www.gnu.org the same way as they are on www.gnuenterprise.org
<psu> for three reasons:
<psu> a_ non-standard wrt www.gnu.org
<psu> b_ uses probably more space on www.gnu.org than we should really be using
<psu> c_ anyone who wants to check out the web CVS (e.g. for a spelling mistake) 
<psu> ends up d/l every previous version as part of the web CVS download
<jamest> I don't thing it should be on www.gnu.org like our site
<jamest> we should use ftp.gnu.org
<psu> jamest: I agree
<psu> main issue is that we would need to get an account(s) on ftp.gnu.org for upload
<psu> not sure how big a deal that is
<psu> It would be seamless to end user, as we can still have d/l pages that work as moment 
<psu> with file lists 
<psu> all prettily formatted
<psu> but the URLs would just be ftp:// rather than http://
<jamest> i think my account on gnu machines gives me access to ftp.gnu.org
<jamest> i'll have to look into it
<psu> jamest == elite ;-)
<jamest> lol
<jamest> i wish
<chillywilly> ello
<jamest> hi
<chillywilly> ajmitch has gnu.org ftp access
<chillywilly> don't you have access jamest ?
<psu> Actually, ftp.gnu.org would only really work for the official releases
<chillywilly> dude this guy is a joke
<chillywilly> first he goes on a rant insulting ppl now he's beggint he GSL developers to switch to LGPL
<psu> I can  imagine "issues" with trying to get jcater's hourly snapshots auto-ftped
<chillywilly> oh then he instults them again at the end
<psu> on both sides
<jamest> only releases go on ftp.gnu.org
<psu> chillywilly: just tell him diplomacy is the art of saying "nice doggy" while you reach for the monkey wrench...
<jamest> they have a seperate setup for alpha code
Action: jamest doesn't recall the details
<psu> jamest: true
<psu> I think the best thing to do at the moment
<chillywilly> psu: well a good metaphor for his conduct would be bashing them with the monkey wrench over and over then saying "nice doggy"
<psu> is to make the downloads still come from www.gnuenterprise.org for everything 
<psu> but for me to fix that irritaiting <$ tabs () > bug on both sites
<psu> chillywilly: heh
<psu> a) "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"

<psu__> but which works ;-)
<jcater> that I'm not sure of
Action: psu__ wonders if the code that allows Forms to access a gfd from an URL might help
<chillywilly> problem is http is not a shell
<chillywilly> ;)
<psu__> chillywilly: you got that right 
<psu__> might be 'interesting' if it was
<chillywilly> well it is a shell with very limited commands
<chillywilly> GET, POST, PUT
<chillywilly> you can pass lots of params
<jcater> well
<jcater> that's not true
<jcater> if it's an IIS server
<jcater> you could get lots of functionality out of it
Action: chillywilly was talking about HTTO
<chillywilly> HTTP
Action: psu__ wonders if I can wrestle around with the urllib library to get what I want

psu (psu@public1-wear2-3-cust49.midd.broadband.ntl.com) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<chillywilly> glob calls os.listdir() that would have to be replaced with a GET of some sorts
<chillywilly> I think you could use urllib to make a GET request then use fnmatch()

<psu__> nope
<psu__> that's mini-me ;-)

<jcater> re IIS getting 0wnzed all the time
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> ah ;)
<jcater> but I got called away before the punchline
<chillywilly> the dir would have to be browsable and you'd have to strip the uri stuff off, AFAICT
<psu> chillywilly: yep. Almost easier to drop down to shell and use wget
<psu> ;-/
<chillywilly> erm, I don't thin you have to strip anything off nm
<chillywilly> anyway, fnmatch is the key
<chillywilly> you just need the list of the filename strings
<psu> chillywilly: yes
<chillywilly> you should just write a web shell ;)
<chillywilly> I wanna do psu% ls http://www.gnu.org
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> j/k
<psu> I was planning something I could do this afternoon, really ;-))
<chillywilly> one could argue your web browser is a web shell
<chillywilly> ;)
<psu> one could argue your text editor is a web shell... if you use emacs
<chillywilly> heheh
<psu> also your spreadsheet, lisp interpreter and 
<jcater> one could argue your webserver is a shell
<jcater> with the right rootkit
<chillywilly> emacs rocks
<psu> GNUe Designer substitute
<chillywilly> jcater: HEH
<chillywilly> jcater: and appropriate webserver softwrae form a certain convicted monopolist makes that argument ever so true
<psu> speaking of web security
<psu> how paraniod are we about ash
<jcater> ?
<psu> i.e. do i need to program defensively against attacks by people who have CVS access
<jcater> no
<psu> or can we assume they are good guys
<psu> ?
<jcater> well
Action: jcater isn't sure what you're thinking of :)
<psu> It's the old php trick of passing "../../../passwd" as a parameter
<psu> but the only way you can do this is by CVS access anyway
<psu> I guess the one line of code to strip out any /s is worth it
<jcater> *** New prereleases (-pre8) uploaded
<psu> yay
<jcater> I think these fix derek/revDeke's bugs
<psu> s/bugs/current bugs
<psu> fixing all of revDeke's bugs is beyond anyone
<psu> ;-)
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I've never seen anyone have as many issues

<psu> we make up for in quality ;-)

<deprogram> jcater: even *with* the correct exploit, IIS is useless
<jcater> true dat
<deprogram> can anyone confirm that apache/unix is massively more responsive on any given hardware?
<deprogram> IIS's threading model may be great on the benchmarks, but single-page load times seem much greater
Action: psu guesses this isn;t really the place to look for IIS expertise ;-)
<deprogram> doesn't seem like it :>

<deprogram> duh!!!
<deprogram> goddam command prompt!
Action: deprogram curses
<deprogram> sorry about that
Action: jcater committed a fix for that a few minutes ago
<jcater> have you updated cvs>?
<deprogram> yeah, worked great
<deprogram> i'm so used to simply selecting in a terminal, and having it put in the clipboard
<deprogram> windows command prompt doesn't do that tho, nooo...

<jcater> what platform are you running this on?

<jcater> it's just SOOOO much fun!
<btami> appserver it's running now on win32 again
<btami> s/it's/is
<deprogram> jcater: win2k sp3
<btami> but a little confusing that it gets rpctype from gnue.conf, not from connection.conf
Action: lupo better learns a little bit and then goes to sleep
<deprogram> mxDateTime is installed

<siesel> btami: which rpctype are you using on win2k?
<siesel> Is it necessary to change the default?
<btami> just pw_xmlrpc works
<btami> no, it's ok
<siesel> good.
<deprogram> hmmm. so now i get:
<deprogram> DB001: [C:\Python22\Lib\site-packages\gnue\common\datasources\GConnections:365] Using gnue.common.datasources.drivers.mysql as base driver for mysql

<jcater> egads
<btami> siesel: i'v converted the appservertest.gfd to 0.5, but how can i login into appserver?
<jcater> deprogram: can you update cvs (or grab new common prerelease) and see if the MySQL error still persists?

bajusz (~btami@dial-5-72.emitel.hu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<bajusz> siesel: i'v used samples/testcases/appserver/appservertest.gfd
<siesel> you should try appserver/samples/appservertest.gfd
<siesel> but you have to "repopulate" your database with appserver/samples/setup-pgsql...
<bajusz> i can't see any difference, just address_ addad to table/field names
<siesel> there is an gnue_id in the db tables now
<bajusz> ah

<jbailey> reinhard: Mm.  I figured out my mistake.  I turned 4 pm into 14h00 in my head and then did the math.
<reinhard> jbailey: yes, why on earth didn't they make the time system decimal!
<jbailey> Or just give up on the stupid use of timezones.
<jbailey> Then we'd all just memorise the times instead and be done with it.
<reinhard> jbailey: i had no problem talking in gmt
<reinhard> that's just an hour away from me :)
<reinhard> well two hours actually as we already have dst
<jbailey> It's only irritating in that it will change in a week for me.
