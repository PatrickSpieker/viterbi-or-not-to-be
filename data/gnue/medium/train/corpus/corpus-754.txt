<derek> i added the GDebug.printMesg() statements
<derek> but the TODO: already existed ;)
<derek> too much code to wade through to fix properly tonight
<Vee2d2> =)
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> did you commit it to cvs?
<chillywilly> python is so beautiful
<chillywilly>    $Product->{"Accessories_aref"} = &getAccessories("productKey" => $productKey); # Many to many self referential

<Vee2d2> you're enjoying your tour de perl?
<chillywilly> erm...kinda but python is better ;)
<chillywilly> perl likes to fail silently
<chillywilly> python will throw exceptions at you
<chillywilly> cause if I mistype a variable name (which of course I do all the time) perl will just simply chug along like everything is gravy
<Vee2d2> that depends I think
<chillywilly> depends on what?
<chillywilly> try to access a non-existant variable of some python object and see what happens ;)
<Vee2d2> add a -W to your perl arguments.. eg: #!/usr/bin/perl -W 
<Vee2d2> should give you warnings
<chillywilly> doesn't help witha  cgi
<chillywilly> nor does it ever tell my anything useful
<chillywilly> I require()d a file that was non-existent and all I ever got was empty output
<chillywilly> python would throw ImportError
<Vee2d2> *shrug* I'm far from a perl monk.. I know just enough to be dangerous.. =)

<deprogram> reinhard: how much is actually being done to the appserver? it seems like everyone is working on a 2-tier arrangement
<jamest> that's not quite true
<jamest> us 2 tier losers have less of a live than the appserver people
<jamest> s/live/life
<jamest> and the goal is that forms/reports/designer just work w/ 3 tier
<jbailey> I think about appserver alot.
<jbailey> Does that count?
<jamest> that's why the appserver interface is just another datasource in gnue
<jamest> jbailey: um, no
<jamest> if things we think about alot counted, i'd have been arrested by now
<deprogram> lol
<jbailey> Hmm, good point.
<deprogram> well... i have a massive legacy application that needs to be reworked into a modern architecture
<deprogram> i'd like to put as much as possible into a middle tier
<jamest> I don't know what deployment looks like for appserver
<reinhard> deprogram: appserver unfortunately has much less progress than i would want it to have
<jamest> one thing that would help though is having someone like you using it
<deprogram> reinhard: so it seems - i'd be happy to work on it
<jamest> I know forms/reports/common are driven by jcater and my needs
<jamest> and sometimes even a user request
<reinhard> one thing that would help though is somebody that kicks my ass on a daily basis
<jamest> but we try to avoid that
<jamest> reinhard: I'd offer but it's a hell of a commute
<reinhard> :)
<jamest> deprogram: if you were to work on appserver that would be great
<reinhard> deprogram: yes what jamest said
<jamest> we're always looking for help
<reinhard> very great
<deprogram> well, it would be. i have to get more familiar w. python
<jamest> it's simple, just dont read gnue code :)
<jamest> well, some of it
<deprogram> :> it seems pretty transparent
<jamest> i've been told that some of it is too hard on python newbs
<jbailey> deprogram: We call that 'whitespace'
<deprogram> ooo. i like whitespace (i was a graphic designer)
<jamest> before you got too deep we'd need copyright assignment
<jamest> all of us have signed a copyright disclaimer assigning copyright to the FSF
<deprogram> i s'pose
<deprogram> oic
<jamest> it's our way of insuring no one can take their ball and go home later
<deprogram> certainly
<jbailey> jamest: And passing the buck legally to someone else.
<jamest> oh yeah
<deprogram> makes sense. it may be difficult to persuade my boss that he needs to pay me to hack open src
<jamest> it'd be much harder to sue the fsf than say jcater
<jbailey> deprogram: It's usually less hard than you think.
<jamest> of course you wouldn't get much sueing any of us :)
<deprogram> otoh, if i write a closed package he will be faced with maintaining it after i quit and move to amsterdam
<jbailey> deprogram: The trick is to do a serious cost-benefit analysis.  If, in 2 weeks of solid hacking you can get X, and there's no assets, it's usually worth it.
<deprogram> which i will if bush gets re-elected
<jbailey> Most employers hate acquiring assets - then they have to write them down.
<jbailey> A serious database app can be $10k easy.
<deprogram> we've been throwing time (and clients money) trying to get a broken proprietary product to work
<deprogram> i would say quite a bit more than $10k

<psu> hi all
<Vee2d2> howdy psu
<deprogram> greetings psu
<psu> heh
Action: psu is looking at the website
<psu> we currently have the downloads just on the www.gnuenterprise.org version of the site
<psu> I guess we really ought to have them on the www.gnu.org/software/gnue/ site as well
<psu> or
<psu> even go the whole hog and put them in ftp://ftp.gnu.org//gnu/gnue 
<psu> only problem is that I can't find any documentation on how to do the latter 
<psu> aha
<psu> found it 
<psu> https://savannah.gnu.org/faq/?group_id=11&question=How_do_I_add_files_in_the_download_area.txt
<psu> but doesn't seem to load to ftp.gnu.org, just savannah
Action: psu is not sure about just putting the downloads on www.gnu.org the same way as they are on www.gnuenterprise.org
<psu> for three reasons:
<psu> a_ non-standard wrt www.gnu.org
<psu> b_ uses probably more space on www.gnu.org than we should really be using
<psu> c_ anyone who wants to check out the web CVS (e.g. for a spelling mistake) 
<psu> ends up d/l every previous version as part of the web CVS download
<jamest> I don't thing it should be on www.gnu.org like our site
<jamest> we should use ftp.gnu.org
<psu> jamest: I agree
<psu> main issue is that we would need to get an account(s) on ftp.gnu.org for upload
<psu> not sure how big a deal that is
<psu> It would be seamless to end user, as we can still have d/l pages that work as moment 
<psu> with file lists 
<psu> all prettily formatted
<psu> but the URLs would just be ftp:// rather than http://
<jamest> i think my account on gnu machines gives me access to ftp.gnu.org
<jamest> i'll have to look into it
<psu> jamest == elite ;-)
<jamest> lol
<jamest> i wish
<chillywilly> ello
<jamest> hi
<chillywilly> ajmitch has gnu.org ftp access
<chillywilly> don't you have access jamest ?
<psu> Actually, ftp.gnu.org would only really work for the official releases
<chillywilly> dude this guy is a joke
<chillywilly> first he goes on a rant insulting ppl now he's beggint he GSL developers to switch to LGPL
<psu> I can  imagine "issues" with trying to get jcater's hourly snapshots auto-ftped
<chillywilly> oh then he instults them again at the end
<psu> on both sides
<jamest> only releases go on ftp.gnu.org
<psu> chillywilly: just tell him diplomacy is the art of saying "nice doggy" while you reach for the monkey wrench...
<jamest> they have a seperate setup for alpha code
Action: jamest doesn't recall the details
<psu> jamest: true
<psu> I think the best thing to do at the moment
<chillywilly> psu: well a good metaphor for his conduct would be bashing them with the monkey wrench over and over then saying "nice doggy"
<psu> is to make the downloads still come from www.gnuenterprise.org for everything 
<psu> but for me to fix that irritaiting <$ tabs () > bug on both sites
<psu> chillywilly: heh
<psu> a) "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"

<psu__> but which works ;-)
<jcater> that I'm not sure of
Action: psu__ wonders if the code that allows Forms to access a gfd from an URL might help
<chillywilly> problem is http is not a shell
<chillywilly> ;)
<psu__> chillywilly: you got that right 
<psu__> might be 'interesting' if it was
<chillywilly> well it is a shell with very limited commands
<chillywilly> GET, POST, PUT
<chillywilly> you can pass lots of params
<jcater> well
<jcater> that's not true
<jcater> if it's an IIS server
<jcater> you could get lots of functionality out of it
Action: chillywilly was talking about HTTO
<chillywilly> HTTP
Action: psu__ wonders if I can wrestle around with the urllib library to get what I want

psu (psu@public1-wear2-3-cust49.midd.broadband.ntl.com) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<chillywilly> glob calls os.listdir() that would have to be replaced with a GET of some sorts
<chillywilly> I think you could use urllib to make a GET request then use fnmatch()

<psu__> nope
<psu__> that's mini-me ;-)

<jcater> re IIS getting 0wnzed all the time
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> ah ;)
<jcater> but I got called away before the punchline
<chillywilly> the dir would have to be browsable and you'd have to strip the uri stuff off, AFAICT
<psu> chillywilly: yep. Almost easier to drop down to shell and use wget
<psu> ;-/
<chillywilly> erm, I don't thin you have to strip anything off nm
<chillywilly> anyway, fnmatch is the key
<chillywilly> you just need the list of the filename strings
<psu> chillywilly: yes
<chillywilly> you should just write a web shell ;)
<chillywilly> I wanna do psu% ls http://www.gnu.org
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> j/k
<psu> I was planning something I could do this afternoon, really ;-))
<chillywilly> one could argue your web browser is a web shell
<chillywilly> ;)
<psu> one could argue your text editor is a web shell... if you use emacs
<chillywilly> heheh
<psu> also your spreadsheet, lisp interpreter and 
<jcater> one could argue your webserver is a shell
<jcater> with the right rootkit
<chillywilly> emacs rocks
<psu> GNUe Designer substitute
<chillywilly> jcater: HEH
<chillywilly> jcater: and appropriate webserver softwrae form a certain convicted monopolist makes that argument ever so true
<psu> speaking of web security
<psu> how paraniod are we about ash
<jcater> ?
<psu> i.e. do i need to program defensively against attacks by people who have CVS access
<jcater> no
<psu> or can we assume they are good guys
<psu> ?
<jcater> well
Action: jcater isn't sure what you're thinking of :)
<psu> It's the old php trick of passing "../../../passwd" as a parameter
<psu> but the only way you can do this is by CVS access anyway
<psu> I guess the one line of code to strip out any /s is worth it
<jcater> *** New prereleases (-pre8) uploaded
<psu> yay
<jcater> I think these fix derek/revDeke's bugs
<psu> s/bugs/current bugs
<psu> fixing all of revDeke's bugs is beyond anyone
<psu> ;-)
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I've never seen anyone have as many issues

<psu> we make up for in quality ;-)

<deprogram> jcater: even *with* the correct exploit, IIS is useless
<jcater> true dat
<deprogram> can anyone confirm that apache/unix is massively more responsive on any given hardware?
<deprogram> IIS's threading model may be great on the benchmarks, but single-page load times seem much greater
Action: psu guesses this isn;t really the place to look for IIS expertise ;-)
<deprogram> doesn't seem like it :>

<derek> jamest: seriously i found two or three bugs in testing and it looks from commit messages jcater patched those
<derek> if you can hold off and have time tonight
<derek> i can give them a good pounding this evening
<derek> if btami has pre's for windows i can test those at work today
<jamest> we're not ready to release just yet anyway
Action: derek would test right now but i agreed to take kids to school

<jamest> i've got to test against woody
<derek> yeah gotta test your woody ;)
<jamest> read wx2.2

<derek> Version 0.4.99
<derek> GNUe Common Version 0.4.99
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue-sb/item/forms$ 
<derek> read 0.4.99-pre9
<derek> etc
<jamest> ?
<derek> *** NOTES TO JCATER ***
<derek> bug 1: commit enabled bug.  This appears to be fixed, the only possible problem would be that if you had something with only one value.
<derek> that is the 'commit' doesnt enable until you exit a field on the new record (which is way better than it not enabling until you exit the record itself)
<derek> i consider it fixed, but wanted that side note
<derek> bug 2: foreign key populating all lookups is _not_ fixed
<derek> instead of it populating with the value being committed on commit, it now populates with the previous record on commit
<derek> *** END NOTES TO JCATER ***
<derek> oh that is with pre9
<derek> jamest: im saying the version numbers from the tools should spit out more valid version numbers
<derek> so that we can tell if we ask, whether someone is using cvs, a pre-release or a stable version
<derek> currently cvs and pre1 - pre9 all have version of 0.4.99
<derek> and when you start having 4 or 5 copies of the framework installed it can be helpful to verify that you are running the version you think you are running ;)
<jamest> that's not easy to do though
<jamest> that .99 is automatically generated
<jamest> internally the value is set to 0.5.0 but the release flag isn't set
<jamest> so it sets itself to 0.4.99
<jamest> 0.5.1 will be 0.5.0.99
<jamest> the .99 simply tells you that you are running prerelease code
<jamest> to make it make it then setup.py would have to edit specific .py files
<jamest> s/make it make it/make it do that/
<derek> ah
<derek> well i think it might be worth considering
<derek> certainly not mandatory
Action: derek has to run to take kiddies to school can someone tell jcater to read backlog re pre9 testing (unless jamest wants to jump on that foreign key bug and suprise jcater with a fix) ;)

<reinhard> hi
<siesel> reinhard: how are you?
<reinhard> working too much
<reinhard> but apart from that, fine, thanks :)
<siesel> :)
<siesel> are you ok with releaseing appserver 0.0.3?
<reinhard> i think it's time to do that
<reinhard> we haven't had a release for a long time
<siesel> yep. and its important to have a release which works with the newest "gnue-Common"
<reinhard> yes
<siesel> btw. should we have documentation for the api of the language interface?
<reinhard> yes, maybe as a part of a "guide to writing applications with appserver"
<siesel> I've updated the jsclient to use the new appserver api, and I'm thinking about building the language interface for javascript 
<reinhard> i guess that's fixing your own need, right?
<siesel> its allready working. I just think about moving to a language interface like API, to provide an appserver language interface in another programming language.
<reinhard> ok

<youssef> are all tools under GPL ?
<dimas> yes
<youssef> do you need translators ?
<dimas> sure
<youssef> are you Spanish ?
<dimas> i'm russian, sorry :)
<youssef> no problem
<youssef> I can translate into French and Spanish
<youssef> What tools do you use for translations ?
<youssef> ping
<dimas> there was someone who was interested to provide spanish translation
<youssef> thanks for the information
<dimas> i have no gnue code on the machine i'm at to check
<dimas> youssef: i've never heard about specific tools to translate
<youssef> no I mean, what format do you use, SGML, po, etc
<dimas> po i think
Action: youssef is reading the FAQ
<youssef> could you explain me quicly what GNUe is ?
<dimas> set of tools for rapid development business application
<youssef> GNUe= list of software to create business software ?

<youssef> re Dimas
<dimas> thanks
<youssef> you are welcome
<dimas> what i have not answered for you?
<youssef> in fact, I do not understand very well what GNUe is, and if there are other GPL program that perform the same thing, however, I am interested in the project (translation)
<youssef> I would like to translate one or two pages if I have time
<dimas> it is easy to understand with standart samples when you get gnue installed
<youssef> is there a debian package available ?
<dimas> they were for previous release
<youssef> I assume, that GNUe do not use memory translation :-(
<dimas> it would be better to ask later when someone get awake
<youssef> ok
<youssef> sorry for annoying you
<dimas> today there would be better to try 0.5.0 code from prerelease or cvs
<dimas> even if no debian packages available
<dimas> not annoying, i'm just never used debian packages
Action: youssef do not understand why there are no free memory translation, since they are very helpful and easy to program
Action: youssef is looking for someone that can program a memory translation
<youssef> python would be great
<dimas> all gnue is python
<youssef> I do not know if they plan to make a memory translation, I think it is useful for companies
<reinhard> sorry
<reinhard> what is a memory translation?
<youssef> it is very easy
<youssef> it is a file/program
<youssef> it stores "translation pairs" ie a sentence in language A and a sentence in language B 
<youssef> if 
<reinhard> not sure if i understand the differnce to .po file translation

<youssef> re
<youssef> did I answer you before the crach ?
<reinhard> <youssef> it stores "translation pairs" ie a sentence in language A and a sentence in language B 
<reinhard> <youssef> if 
<reinhard> is the last i saw
<youssef> when you are translation and if a Sentence is already in the memory translation, then it suggests you the translation, ifnot
<youssef> it stores your translation 
<reinhard> ah
<reinhard> so it helps the translator
<reinhard> not the author of the program
<reinhard> i see
<reinhard> that was my misunderstanding
<reinhard> it is a method of writing the translation
<youssef> yes
<reinhard> not a method of writing a multi-language application
<reinhard> ok
<youssef> very helpful, profesional translators use it often
<reinhard> thanks :)
<youssef> unhopefully, all memory translations are for Windows and Word and cost a lot and are of course not free standard
<youssef> what do you think about it ?

<jbailey> jamest: Quick question for you - I've got an RC bug on gnue-designer that's apparently helping hold up some migrations to testing.
<jbailey> jamest: I had been wiating for 0.5.0
<jbailey> jamest: Should I just upload the current snapshot?
<jamest> RC bug?
<jamest> what is it?
<jamest> is it fixed in 0.5.0?
<jbailey> It's a packaging bug.
<jbailey> So it's fixed in whatever.
<jbailey> I had just been avoiding uploading.
<jamest> ah
<jamest> i'd hold out for the real 0.5.0
<jbailey> (the QA time annoys me)
<jbailey> Will it be in the next couple of days do you think?
<jamest> I'm 99% certain it'll be this weekend
<jamest> yesterday I beat the shit out of designer
<jbailey> Nice!
<jamest> and wrote a make-gfdes-yer-bitch-howto.txt
<jamest> and submitted it to jcater
<jamest> then we spent last night fixing it up
<jamest> there is one bug in there I'd like to see cleaned up
<jamest> and docs need updated
<jamest> then we should be good to go
<jbailey> Nice!
<jamest> <hint>
<jamest> unless some other testers find issues we've overlooked *cough*gnue-sb*cough*
<jamest> </hint>
<jbailey> Is -sb done for 0.5.0 yet?
<jbailey> I thought that he hadn't ported it yet.
<jamest> they ported it
<jbailey> Luvly.
<jamest> i was hoping we'd see a stable win32 ui dirver in there too
<jamest> but we won't hold up release on that
<jamest> it's been too long
<jbailey> yeah.  I wouldn't hold it up for anything other than regressions.
<jamest> i'm really happy with 0.5.0
<jamest> i was worried about stability
<jamest> but i think we're at or above 0.4.x

<lupo> aren't you the one who does .debs?
<jamest> jbailey is our deb doer
<jbailey> =)
<lupo> have you thought about creating an APT repository on gnuenterprise.org
<jcater> we have one
<jamest> i did one
<jcater> for woody releases
<jamest> sorta
<jamest> i'm not sure it's still used is it?
<jcater> I thought so
<jcater> maybe I'm on crack though
<jamest> i wouldn't mind it being there
<jamest> but I thought the new .deb setup wouldn't work on woody
<jcater> I swore we backported jbailey's debs to woody
<jcater> oh, yeah
<jcater> we had to stop
<jcater> because he switched to some deb_helper or something?
Action: jcater thwaps jbailey
<jamest> yip

Action: jamest thwaps jcater too
<jcater> but we do have an apt repository
<jcater> it just may not be the latest :)

<jbailey> I'm just apathetic.
<jamest> ?

<jbailey> Trout.

Action: jbailey flopps around.
<jamest> ah, ok
<jbailey> Hmm.  My next upload will have me use wxpython2.4
<jbailey> That's not in woody
<jbailey> jamest: Do you think 0.6 will be out by summer?
<jamest> while woody .debs would be nice
<jamest> i'm not going to push for them
<jbailey> I'd guess whatever's in the archive in july or august will probably be in sarge.
<jamest> too hard
<jamest> the 0.6.0 series is cleanup only
<jbailey> That seems to be waht the roadmap says.
<jbailey> But I wasn't sure if you were going to dive right into that or start branching out into the apps.
<jamest> i'm hoping others will help with the apps
<jamest> like derek and gnue-sb
<jamest> which would allow the cleanpu to proceed
<jamest> if not then I dunno
<jamest> in either case I think 0.5.x features will be fairly far along at that point
<jbailey> Cool.
<jbailey> It's just a thought in terms of planning, though.  We haven't even begun to freeze yet, so it's hard to say.  But the goal is yearly release cycles.
<jamest> you still think you'll have any time for the html dirver?
<jamest> man, debian may just pace us

<icltlfatppl> Is anyone giving training classes on GNU Enterprise?

<jamest> of

<jamest> i'm not picking on you this time
<chillywilly> but it's not about quantity but quality isnit it? ;)
<jamest> true that
<icltlfatppl> I ask because I have been giving bayonne training classes for a while to my customers, and I am going to be renting office space with a guy who gives debian training classes.
<icltlfatppl> We are thinking of doing more training to supplement our measly incomes.
<icltlfatppl> Looking for people who train on similar applications.
<jamest> ah
<icltlfatppl> I thought derek might be an ideal candidate, since I have seen him give lots of demos, but he's not in the bay area.  Anyone from NorCal?
<jamest> not that I know of
<jamest> but I can't be certain
