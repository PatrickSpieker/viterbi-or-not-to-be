<reinhard> hi
<siesel> reinhard: how are you?
<reinhard> working too much
<reinhard> but apart from that, fine, thanks :)
<siesel> :)
<siesel> are you ok with releaseing appserver 0.0.3?
<reinhard> i think it's time to do that
<reinhard> we haven't had a release for a long time
<siesel> yep. and its important to have a release which works with the newest "gnue-Common"
<reinhard> yes
<siesel> btw. should we have documentation for the api of the language interface?
<reinhard> yes, maybe as a part of a "guide to writing applications with appserver"
<siesel> I've updated the jsclient to use the new appserver api, and I'm thinking about building the language interface for javascript 
<reinhard> i guess that's fixing your own need, right?
<siesel> its allready working. I just think about moving to a language interface like API, to provide an appserver language interface in another programming language.
<reinhard> ok

<dimas> hello youssef
<youssef> are all tools under GPL ?
<dimas> yes
<youssef> do you need translators ?
<dimas> sure
<youssef> are you Spanish ?
<dimas> i'm russian, sorry :)
<youssef> no problem
<youssef> I can translate into French and Spanish
<youssef> What tools do you use for translations ?
<youssef> ping
<dimas> there was someone who was interested to provide spanish translation
<youssef> thanks for the information
<dimas> i have no gnue code on the machine i'm at to check
<dimas> youssef: i've never heard about specific tools to translate
<youssef> no I mean, what format do you use, SGML, po, etc
<dimas> po i think
Action: youssef is reading the FAQ
<youssef> could you explain me quicly what GNUe is ?
<dimas> set of tools for rapid development business application
<youssef> GNUe= list of software to create business software ?

<youssef> re Dimas
<dimas> thanks
<youssef> you are welcome
<dimas> what i have not answered for you?
<youssef> in fact, I do not understand very well what GNUe is, and if there are other GPL program that perform the same thing, however, I am interested in the project (translation)
<youssef> I would like to translate one or two pages if I have time
<dimas> it is easy to understand with standart samples when you get gnue installed
<youssef> is there a debian package available ?
<dimas> they were for previous release
<youssef> I assume, that GNUe do not use memory translation :-(
<dimas> it would be better to ask later when someone get awake
<youssef> ok
<youssef> sorry for annoying you
<dimas> today there would be better to try 0.5.0 code from prerelease or cvs
<dimas> even if no debian packages available
<dimas> not annoying, i'm just never used debian packages
Action: youssef do not understand why there are no free memory translation, since they are very helpful and easy to program
Action: youssef is looking for someone that can program a memory translation
<youssef> python would be great
<dimas> all gnue is python
<youssef> I do not know if they plan to make a memory translation, I think it is useful for companies
<reinhard> sorry
<reinhard> what is a memory translation?
<youssef> it is very easy
<youssef> it is a file/program
<youssef> it stores "translation pairs" ie a sentence in language A and a sentence in language B 
<youssef> if 
<reinhard> not sure if i understand the differnce to .po file translation

<youssef> re
<youssef> did I answer you before the crach ?
<reinhard> <youssef> it stores "translation pairs" ie a sentence in language A and a sentence in language B 
<reinhard> <youssef> if 
<reinhard> is the last i saw
<youssef> when you are translation and if a Sentence is already in the memory translation, then it suggests you the translation, ifnot
<youssef> it stores your translation 
<reinhard> ah
<reinhard> so it helps the translator
<reinhard> not the author of the program
<reinhard> i see
<reinhard> that was my misunderstanding
<reinhard> it is a method of writing the translation
<youssef> yes
<reinhard> not a method of writing a multi-language application
<reinhard> ok
<youssef> very helpful, profesional translators use it often
<reinhard> thanks :)
<youssef> unhopefully, all memory translations are for Windows and Word and cost a lot and are of course not free standard
<youssef> what do you think about it ?

<youssef> cool
<youssef> memory translation, cut the text into sentences (ie after all points)

<youssef> oh
<youssef> I am also installing poedit
<dimas> format of the gfd file has changed 
<youssef> gfd ?

<youssef> no one is interested in my question on #python :-(

<youssef> just finishing of installing gnue
<youssef> how can I run it ?
<youssef> I mean how can I lauch GNUe
<dimas> not sure how it is with release version under debian

<havoc> heh
<jbailey> jamest: Quick question for you - I've got an RC bug on gnue-designer that's apparently helping hold up some migrations to testing.
<jbailey> jamest: I had been wiating for 0.5.0
<jbailey> jamest: Should I just upload the current snapshot?
<jamest> RC bug?
<jamest> what is it?
<jamest> is it fixed in 0.5.0?
<jbailey> It's a packaging bug.
<jbailey> So it's fixed in whatever.
<jbailey> I had just been avoiding uploading.
<jamest> ah
<jamest> i'd hold out for the real 0.5.0
<jbailey> (the QA time annoys me)
<jbailey> Will it be in the next couple of days do you think?
<jamest> I'm 99% certain it'll be this weekend
<jamest> yesterday I beat the shit out of designer
<jbailey> Nice!
<jamest> and wrote a make-gfdes-yer-bitch-howto.txt
<jamest> and submitted it to jcater
<jamest> then we spent last night fixing it up
<jamest> there is one bug in there I'd like to see cleaned up
<jamest> and docs need updated
<jamest> then we should be good to go
<jbailey> Nice!
<jamest> <hint>
<jamest> unless some other testers find issues we've overlooked *cough*gnue-sb*cough*
<jamest> </hint>
<jbailey> Is -sb done for 0.5.0 yet?
<jbailey> I thought that he hadn't ported it yet.
<jamest> they ported it
<jbailey> Luvly.
<jamest> i was hoping we'd see a stable win32 ui dirver in there too
<jamest> but we won't hold up release on that
<jamest> it's been too long
<jbailey> yeah.  I wouldn't hold it up for anything other than regressions.
<jamest> i'm really happy with 0.5.0
<jamest> i was worried about stability
<jamest> but i think we're at or above 0.4.x

<jbailey> lupo!
<lupo> aren't you the one who does .debs?
<jamest> jbailey is our deb doer
<jbailey> =)
<lupo> have you thought about creating an APT repository on gnuenterprise.org
<jcater> we have one
<jamest> i did one
<jcater> for woody releases
<jamest> sorta
<jamest> i'm not sure it's still used is it?
<jcater> I thought so
<jcater> maybe I'm on crack though
<jamest> i wouldn't mind it being there
<jamest> but I thought the new .deb setup wouldn't work on woody
<jcater> I swore we backported jbailey's debs to woody
<jcater> oh, yeah
<jcater> we had to stop
<jcater> because he switched to some deb_helper or something?
Action: jcater thwaps jbailey
<jamest> yip
Action: jamest thwaps jbailey
Action: jamest thwaps jcater too
<jcater> but we do have an apt repository
<jcater> it just may not be the latest :)
<jbailey> Hmm.
<jbailey> I could probably maintain that woody repository easily enough.
<jbailey> I'm just apathetic.
<jamest> ?
<jamest> a pathetic what?
<jbailey> Mmm
<jbailey> Trout.
<jbailey> I'm a pathetic trout
Action: jbailey flopps around.
<jamest> ah, ok
<jbailey> Hmm.  My next upload will have me use wxpython2.4
<jbailey> That's not in woody
<jbailey> jamest: Do you think 0.6 will be out by summer?
<jamest> while woody .debs would be nice
<jamest> i'm not going to push for them
<jbailey> I'd guess whatever's in the archive in july or august will probably be in sarge.
<jamest> too hard
<jamest> the 0.6.0 series is cleanup only
<jbailey> That seems to be waht the roadmap says.
<jbailey> But I wasn't sure if you were going to dive right into that or start branching out into the apps.
<jamest> i'm hoping others will help with the apps
<jamest> like derek and gnue-sb
<jamest> which would allow the cleanpu to proceed
<jamest> if not then I dunno
<jamest> in either case I think 0.5.x features will be fairly far along at that point
<jbailey> Cool.
<jbailey> It's just a thought in terms of planning, though.  We haven't even begun to freeze yet, so it's hard to say.  But the goal is yearly release cycles.
<jamest> you still think you'll have any time for the html dirver?
<jamest> man, debian may just pace us
<derek> long day out today
<derek> will test tonight
<jamest> NO!
