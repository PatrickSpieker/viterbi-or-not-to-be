<chillywilly> kaching? is that like keeping the bay close so you can execute diaper changes faster?
<chillywilly> you don't have to go out to main memory in order to remember where the baby is or where the diaper chaning stuff is?

<lupo> huhu
<reinhard> hey lupo
<lupo> hi reinhard
<siesel> hi lupo
<lupo> hey, the two appserver guys are here! :) hi siesel :)
<lupo> but i need a forms guy
<siesel> *sniff* 
<lupo> i have a question on forms which is too tricky for me
<lupo> it's so silly that even I don't understand it :)
<siesel> what is it?
<lupo> master / detail forms
<lupo> i have a list of customers and a list of countries
<lupo> there is a customer.country_id and a countries.id which are linked
<lupo> in the customer form, the country shall be choosable with a dropdown menu
<lupo> i was not able to get it working
<lupo> though it is supposed to be strikingly simple
<siesel> you just want to choose on country  and store its id into  customer.country_id ?
<siesel>  /on/one/
<lupo> yep
<siesel> then you don't need master detail. you just need to define the countries datasource,
<siesel> and create a dropdown entry with ??? (I don't remember),
<siesel> but you can take gnue/common/utils/connection.gfd as an example.
<siesel> its: <field name="provE" field="provider" fk_description="descr"
<siesel>              fk_key="provider" fk_source="dtsDrpProvider"/>
<lupo> mom, i'll try this :)
<lupo> what is fk_description ?
<siesel> fk_description is the part which is shown to the user (i.e. in your case country name)
<lupo> thank you very much. now it works :)
<lupo> i'm so stupid :)

<derek> ok
<derek> <derek> should i bother testing pre10
<derek> <derek> or you all starting to bundle a release tonight?
<derek> was my question
<derek> and so the answer is "dont bother testing pre10"
<jamest_> feel free to test it
<jamest_> just expect the release in halfway soon
<derek> good news is likely i will have time tonight to test 0.5.0 official release
<jamest_> appserver people here?
<jamest_> is it ready to release yet?
<derek> no appsesrver people
<derek> consider it released
<derek> and they will have to have a x.x.X if aint ready yet ;)
Action: derek runs off
Action: derek is away: prayer
