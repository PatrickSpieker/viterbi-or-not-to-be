<siesel> dneigbo: you here?
<siesel> I saw that 'data' and 'database schema' is split into two sql files in acclite. 
<siesel> and the GNUe Schema Definition file has no way to put some base data into it.
<siesel> (quite ok for a SCHEMA definition ;) )
<siesel> but data should be stored in an XML representation too. 
<siesel> for ease of use I would like to put schema and data into ONE file. any objections, ideas?
dneighbo_ (~dneighbo@tmp-200253.flinthills.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> hi dneighbo_, can you read the backlog?
<dneighbo_> um in a second
Action: drochaid raises a hand tentatively to object ...
fil_c (~username@public1-cosh3-3-cust12.cosh.broadband.ntl.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<dneighbo_> siesel you still here
<dneighbo_> Remosi: backlog
<dneighbo_> grr re :
<dneighbo_> acclite split was from NOLA
<dneighbo_> definitely we need to have the 'data' statements as part of our schema spec
<dneighbo_> its just a matter of definining and making xslt xsl for it
<dneighbo_> about putting together or separating
<dneighbo_> i like to work in sizeable chunks so i like them separate
<dneighbo_> im one of these wierdos that would actually like every table or grouping of tables to be own file (but i know im in the minority there)
<dneighbo_> im open to debate though
<dneighbo_> btw: jcater has added in designer ability to make our 'xml schema' off existing databases
<dneighbo_> so if you have a postgres database
<dneighbo_> you can from designer run a tool that will create a 'gnue xml schema' :)
<siesel> I think puting every table into a seperate file is ok, if there is ONE comand to create a whole table, or if there is one gsd file which includes the other ones :)
<dneighbo_> siesel well xml/xslt supports includes
<siesel>  /a whole table/a whole table set/
<dneighbo_> so way i figured it was you would do granular (to what level i have no consensus)
<dneighbo_> then you make a 'initial install' xml file
<jcater> let's back up a second
<jcater> I see xslt as a means to an end
<jcater> not the end itself
<jcater> in the not-so-distant future
<jcater> GNUe-COmmon's dbdrivers will accept a schema tree
<dneighbo_> that simply includes the whole enchalada (sp)
<jcater> and each driver will be able to create the schema natively
<dneighbo_> thats fine
Action: dneighbo_ sees it similar way
<jcater> so I'm just saying, let's not say "sure, we can do that as xslt supports xxxxxxx"
<jcater> btw, I like sizable chinks too
<jcater> s/chinks/chunks/
<dneighbo_> in fact for designer and some other things i almost would like to have it go off the schema opposed to the db
<siesel> jcater, dneighbo: does the way xslt includes files differ from the GParser way?
Action: jcater knows nothing about xslt includes :(
Action: dneighbo_ notices that visual studio .NET has gone that route and it made for some trick features in their 'designer' stuff
<dneighbo_> but thats another discussion
<dneighbo_> siesel : i cant answer that
<dneighbo_> i specifically called out xslt can do 'x' because currently we are using xslt
<dneighbo_> i assume when we go to internally doing it, that its not a huge issue
<dneighbo_> in that we have control so we can make it do includes :)
<dneighbo_> jcater : i see this functionality as being important also for integrator as well as designer :)
<dneighbo_> btw: xslt iirc does include as
<dneighbo_> <xsl:include href = uri />
<dneighbo_> so very simplistic
<dneighbo_> though technically its not on teh stylesheet side but on the source side where they include would happen which would follow normal xml include rules (iirc)
<siesel> back to that xml format for data: I think it, 1. should be outside of that <schema> tag 2. possibly could look like...
<siesel> <data>
<siesel>   <tabledata name="basic_persons" tablename="person">
<siesel>         </row>
<siesel>   </tabledata>
<siesel> oops, I don't know why, but most of the stuff was send to nickserv :(
<siesel> <data><tabledata name="basic_persons" tablename="person">
<siesel> <row>
<siesel> <value>Peter Miller</value>
<siesel> <value>GNUe street</value>
<siesel> <value>9393</value>
<siesel> <value>GNU town</value>
<siesel> </row>
<siesel>  </tabledata></data>
<siesel> (that would be simple initialisation without fieldnames. There should be a mode for initialisation with fieldnames too.)
<jcater> no
<jcater> not outside of schema tag
<jcater> but outside of tables tag
<jcater> GParser depends on there being a single enclosing tag around an entire file
<jcater> (i.e., the "root" element)
<jcater> so you'd have
<jcater> <schema>
<jcater>   <tables>
<jcater>     ....
<jcater>   </tables>
<jcater>   <data>
<jcater>     ....
<jcater>   </data>
<jcater> </schema>
<jcater> at least, this is what I was imagining
<siesel> Just asking, if we do it that way, is <schema> still the right name for the root tag?
Action: jcater thinks so
<jcater> as to me required datasets are still part of a schema definition
<siesel> ok, but, because I want to use GSD as a dump format for the appserver, would you object to put "non-required" datasets into it?
<dneighbo_> jcater: i agree keeping in schema root
<dneighbo_> im not sure i follow
<jcater> dump format?
<siesel> like pg_dump writes the contents of a db into one file. a appserver_dump would create a ?.GSD? file.
<jcater> I see no problem with that
<jcater> most tools like that include an option to dump only schema or schema + data anyway
<dneighbo_> works for me
<siesel> great. now to the details, is <data><tabledata name="basic_persons" tablename="person"><row>...</row><row>...</row>tabledata><data> ok?
<jcater> works for me
<siesel> ok, last question before modifing xslt's: do we need type's for <value> definitions?
<siesel> I would like <value>Peter<value><value>22.4.1999<value>. 
jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> and would make <value field="Name" type="string">Peter<value><value field="date_of_birth" type="date">22.4.1999<value> optional?
<siesel> ok, I will provide appserver/samples/sample.gfd as an example
<siesel> dneighbo: how can I select a value between two tags <tag>my_value</tag> using xslt?

<jcater> do a dpkg-reconfigure postgresql
<dneighbo> i do a dpkg-reconfigure and now it makes SOME sense
<dneighbo> i recall it asking me if i wanted to upgrade my version of postgres(which is odd as i didnt have one) unless some dependency installed 6.5
<dneighbo> as this is FRESH install of woody
<dneighbo> i chose (y) and ran out door
<dneighbo> it appears that the binary to do the conversion is missing
<dneighbo> so now i choose N
<dneighbo> and its says everything goes smooth but it doesnt
<dneighbo> sigh crappy packaging i assume
<dneighbo> which is so odd as i have yet to have issues really with postgres on debian
<dneighbo> doing an upgrade
<dneighbo> nothing to upgrade sigh
<ariel_> dneighbo: check postgresql.conf
<ariel_> in data directory
<ariel_> in <prefix>
<ariel_> mine is /var/lib/pgsql
<dneighbo> postgresql has found a pre-existing database, and believes that it will be
<dneighbo> able to update it automatically to the new version.  There is some risk to
<dneighbo> your data in this.  If you have not got an up-to-date backup of
<dneighbo> /var/lib/postgres/data, you should say no at this point.
<dneighbo> In the course of the update, your existing /var/lib/postgres/data
<dneighbo> will be moved to a parallel directory and a new directory created in
<dneighbo> its place.  The saved dump of your existing database will then be loaded
<dneighbo> into the new database.  If you have a lot of data, this may take a
<dneighbo> considerable time; if your database is sufficiently large, it may fail
<dneighbo> for lack of disk space.
<dneighbo> The backup of /var/lib/postgres/data will be on the same filesystem;
<dneighbo> the dump file will be in /usr/lib/postgresql/dumpall/.
<dneighbo> Do you want me to continue with the automatic update? [y/N] y
<dneighbo> The upgrade will now be done; the time taken will depend on the
<dneighbo> size of your database(s).
<dneighbo> There are no binaries for dumping database format 7.2
<ariel_> check the tcpip_socket variable 
<dneighbo> Sorry; the automatic database upgrade failed.
<dneighbo> latitude:/home/dneighbo# 
<chillywilly> it just uses pg_dump
<ariel_> this must be true for pg  server to accept connections via tcp/ip
<chillywilly> tcp/ip is turned ON by default IIRC
<ariel_> not sure
<dneighbo> all that is fine

<dneighbo> sigh that WAS the problem
Action: dneighbo has never had lo not start before
<chillywilly> shouod be setup in your interfaces file
<chillywilly> then when the networking inti script runs it should come up at least
<chillywilly> init
<dneighbo> its a long story
<chillywilly> you can also setup 'interfaces' file to use dhcp
<chillywilly> for the ethx interface
Action: chillywilly 's server does this
<siesel> dneigbo: what didn't you like
<chillywilly> hey dneighbo what does { } do in XSLT?
<chillywilly> I was told you are da xsl masta
<dneighbo> i dont have my xsl bible
<chillywilly> darn
<dneighbo> i remember briefly about it but not enough
<chillywilly> what book is that?
<dneighbo> um fact that you were doing 
<chillywilly> what is you "xsl bible"?
<dneighbo> <row>data</row> or something
<dneighbo> where i think it should be
<dneighbo> <row>
<dneighbo>   <field name="foo">data</field>
<dneighbo>   <field name="bar">data</field>
<dneighbo> </row>
<dneighbo> or the like
<dneighbo> later you then seemed to reference something like this even including a datatype
^chewie (~chad@cyan.ima.umn.edu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> but i wasnt sure
<jcater> sorry
<jcater> I was away
<dneighbo> im fixed up now
<jcater> did you do the dpkg-reconfigure?
<dneighbo> i think
<dneighbo> yeah lo wasnt up
<jcater> as I imagine it had to do with a failed dump
<jcater> ah
<dneighbo> was problem, but still the package has an issue
Action: jcater had hell upgrading to 7.2
<dneighbo> as it SHOULD NOT try to upgrade when there is no postgres :)
<dneighbo> i.e. a fresh install and apt-get install postgresql
<dneighbo> should say we found a database want to upgrade it
<dneighbo> er shouldnt
<chillywilly> <div id="{@name}" style="display: none;">
<chillywilly> so you have no idea what the { } do?
<dneighbo> btw: im trying to get desktop tools more eval'd
<siesel> dneighbo: at the moment I have a <row> <value>one</value><value>two</value></row>
<dneighbo> i tried pharmacy, lincvs and gcvs (sigh they all have issues) short of cvs co readonly with pserver :(
<chillywilly> @attrib gives you the value of an attribute right?
<dneighbo> chillywilly: i believe that is correct
<siesel> do I understand you right, that you want fieldnames in?
<dneighbo> also tried tora and sqlsomething and they both suck
<siesel> <xsl:value-of select="@attribute"/>
<jcater> desktop tools?
<chillywilly> siesel: are you well versed in XSL?
<siesel> cw: in the W3C docs they say {@attribute} should work the same way, but it didn't worked for me.
<chillywilly> oh?
<chillywilly> hmmph
<siesel> cw: I just changed the pgsql.xslt files. i.e. I'm a XSLT rookie
<chillywilly> k
<chillywilly> I was ist reading them for some practice ;)
<chillywilly> just
<chillywilly> see how well I could remember this tutorial I read...of course my memory sucks
<siesel> possibly you should upgrade another 16kbytes ;)
<chillywilly> heh, yea
<chillywilly> I want to be able to download stuff into my head like in the matrix
<chillywilly> that would rock
<siesel> dneighbo: just to ask again, do you want fieldsnames to be required? i.e. don't have a <value>j</value> but an <field name="bla">j</field> or an <value field="bla">j<value>?
<siesel> IHMO there are many pro's and con's for requiring fieldnames, so what do you think
Action: jcater personally thinks the pro's outweigh any and all cons
<jcater> but that's just mho
<siesel> ok, so <field name="bla">j</field> would be the choice right? Its just 10-20 bytes more per row per column.
StyXman (~mdione@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) left irc: "ircII EPIC4-1.1.5 -- Are we there yet?"
<siesel> ok, I will first commit my version and change it to the field way tomorow, or sometimes not beeing so tired

<dneighbo> siesel: can we not change things till we are all in agreement
<dneighbo> i think jcater had input
<dneighbo> mainly im concerned as im wanting to do stuff with acclite and it dependent on some of this stuff and designer
<dneighbo> so i dont want it broken for long periods of time :)
<dneighbo> i like the value field="bla"
<dneighbo> but i havent thought really hard on ti
<dneighbo> it
<siesel> I wont commit something breaking designer (I hope so)
<siesel> that <value field stuff is in cvs now, and it should not interfere with designer capabilitys to create .gsd out of databases
<dneighbo> well you cant break xsd to postgres either :)
<dneighbo> or rather it would be preferred to not be broken long :)
Action: ariel_ is away: zzz...
<dneighbo> grr i hate savannah at times
<siesel> btw. gsd to postgres was broken till today, because it doesn't accept that global schema tag.

<dneighbo> jcater: by desktop i meant GUI applications
<dneighbo> i.e. if one were afraid of command line how would they use CVS and Postgres and the likes
<dneighbo> its and interesting experience actually looking at the gui tools (as they are rather pitiful) :(
<dneighbo> hmmm synaptic (apt-get gui) looks pretty decent though
<jcater> uggh
<jcater>  /me understands gui postgres tools
<jcater> but not cvs
<jcater> unless it were integrated into an IDE suite
<dneighbo> ?
<dneighbo> no im an evangelist remember
<dneighbo> im trying to see what linux looks like for someone scared of the command line (not necessary a gnue person)
<dneighbo> so am trying to find gui ways to do anything i do from a command line (just to see the experience)
<dneighbo> i see our designer eventaully supporting postgres gui and cvs gui (cvs functionality)
<dneighbo> but in no high order of magnitude
<dneighbo> i.e. im not looking at existing gui tools for that purpose
Action: dneighbo is away: church and things

<ajmitch> yo jcater
Action: ajmitch is just starting designer to see how far along schema stuff is :)
<jcater> not very
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> will put together a db manually then
<jcater> well
<jcater> is the db already in postgres or such?
<jcater> or are you starting from scratch?
<ajmitch> starting from scratch
<ajmitch> will only be a few tables
<jcater> ah
<jcater> then the current designer is of no use to you
<jcater> :(
<ajmitch> no, it is, i'm building froms as well :)
