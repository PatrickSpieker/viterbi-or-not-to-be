<siesel> hi ariel_
<ariel_> hi
<ariel_> siesel: do you want that i put the trigger stuff in the digrams or is it a temporary hack 
<ariel_> that will eventually disappear?
<siesel> I think that GTrigger will stay, its likely to change a bit. (like much of the rest of appserver) 
<siesel> The only thing which is really a hack is, a) the way triggers are called, and the way methods are implemented (methods are using triggers at the moment)
<ariel_> that's ok, for i need only the signature of a method and not the implementation.
<siesel> Arturas: I fount out that a wxFONTENCODING_UTF8 exists in the source code of wxwindows. I just don't know if wxpython support it. (the only place to find it in documentation is: http://biolpc22.york.ac.uk/wx/docs/html/wx/wx159.htm#wxfont .

<jbailey> good 'nug

<chillywilly> nah
<chillywilly> gett he XFS netinst CD
<chillywilly> get the
<chillywilly> er, iso that is
<chillywilly> 30MB in size with the newer installer and XFS file system support
<chillywilly> 2.4.x kernel
<ajmitch> why would he want to use xfs?
<stbain> yah, what if I'm an ext3 freak
<jbailey> Especially with Reiser is the Path To Rightness. =)
<ajmitch> on a production box? :)
<jbailey> Sure.  I know lots of people using Reiser on mail servers and what not.
<jbailey> It minimizes craziness.
<jbailey> At least compare to xfs, reiser made it into the kernel. =)
<chillywilly> http://people.debian.org/~blade/XFS-Install/download/bootbf2.4-xfs.iso
<ajmitch> xfs has it's own vfs layer, right? :)
<chillywilly> xfs rocks, I don't care if it is in the kernel or not
<rdean> my observation on xfs vs. ReiserFS is that XFS will occasionally gobble up CPU cycles (journaling activity?) and lead to lack of UI responsiveness...
<rdean> ReiserFS doesn't appear prone to that (my experiences are that when I install ReiserFS, the UI is less prone to fits of unresponsiveness)
<jbailey> My observation is that yelling "XFS Sucks" in a channel with chillywilly in it tends to get him going. =)
<rdean> OTOH, if you've got a server, XFS rules
<chillywilly> my ui is nice and snappy, but I alos have a little extra help with that in the preemption patch
<ajmitch> jbailey: yes, that's true ;)
<chillywilly> heh, yea I also find this sooo truuuuue.....not!
Action: ajmitch uses ext3 on all partitions but one
<jbailey> ajmitch: The one with vfat? =)
Action: rdean tried ext3 and didn't like what it did to my system
<jbailey> or is it the swap partition?
<ajmitch> the reiserfs /opt :)
<ajmitch> ah yeah, i have a 500MB swap partition also
<jbailey> I use ext3 because it took awhile to get angie out of the habit of hitting the reset button when the system froze.
<chillywilly> reiser might be a bit better...you can probably find  nice netinst iso containing all 3 of those journaling file systems
<jbailey> And I'm too lazy to reformat.
Action: rdean is too lazy to do an upgrade
<ajmitch> that was the main reason for me using ext3
Action: rdean wipes and reinstalls
<stbain> wow... the debian website sux0rs
<jbailey> When Debian's installer supports reiserfs (it might now, but who the heck ever reinstalls debian? *g*) I'll probably setup my boxes with it.
<stbain> that XFS netinst image is coming down at a whopping 4.6K/s

Action: rdean doesn't have enough production "data" built up in Linux yet to warrant saving...easier to wipe and reinstall.  The benefit was that I've been able to try all the filesystems (even tried JFS, but that was when it was still buggy (don't know if that's still true or not)

<stbain> iso image 1
<stbain> for some reason its pulling some non-us stuff
<stbain> is that normal?

<dneighbo> mdean: is that really you?
<jbailey> --> mdean (~mdean@mkc-65-28-72-183.kc.rr.com) has joined #gnuenterprise
<jbailey> <ajmitch> mdean!
<jbailey> <ajmitch> is it truly you?
<jbailey> That's funny!
<chillywilly> stbain: yea, that's just software that was hindered byt he US encryption laws...I don't think it is really relevant anymore (the law that is)
<ajmitch> hehe
<stbain> ok
<stbain> jigdo a good option? that netinst download was taking forever
<chillywilly> jigdo will give you a big ass iso image
<jbailey> Isn't there a netinst jigdo option?
<stbain> and save me some download time later once I start the install?
<chillywilly> possibly...
<chillywilly> yea
<dneighbo> jbailey: im going to post your debs
<jbailey> Ah, I take it they're good enough then?
<dneighbo> honestly i havent tested yet :)
<dneighbo> i think perhaps i should no
<jbailey> Yeah, probably.
<dneighbo> btw: let me point you to two bugs submitted on the old ones to see if you addressed in yours
<jbailey> Sure.
<dneighbo> http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=574322&group_id=1424&atid=101424
<dneighbo> http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=574321&group_id=1424&atid=101424
<jbailey> Those bugs don't apply because I don't automatically setup the database. =)
<dneighbo> ok
<jbailey> I want feedback first whether the basic setup is right before I start coding in extra stuff like that.
<dneighbo> guess mike isnt really here
Action: dneighbo goes to test that deb
<ajmitch> dneighbo: he was before
<jbailey> Can you email me any feedback?  I'm headed home pretty soon.
<dneighbo> jbailey: 
<dneighbo> latitude:/home/dneighbo/downloads# dpkg --install dcl_20020705-pre1_all.deb 
<dneighbo> Selecting previously deselected package dcl.
<dneighbo> (Reading database ... 49970 files and directories currently installed.)
<dneighbo> Unpacking dcl (from dcl_20020705-pre1_all.deb) ...
<dneighbo> dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of dcl:
<dneighbo>  dcl depends on wwwconfig-common (>= 0.0.4-1); however:
<dneighbo>   Package wwwconfig-common is not installed.
<dneighbo> dpkg: error processing dcl (--install):
<dneighbo>  dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
<dneighbo> Errors were encountered while processing:
<dneighbo>  dcl
<dneighbo> latitude:/home/dneighbo/downloads# 
<ajmitch> that's why you use apt-get to install :)
<dneighbo> shouldn't it try to download this depend
<dneighbo> ok so its becasue using dpkg
<ajmitch> yeah
<jbailey> Yeah.  I thought of removing that dep, but I'll use it when I start putting in the automatic-virutal-host-creation stuff.
<ajmitch> jbailey: so does your deb setup the database?
<jbailey> no, not at all.
<jbailey> There's a whole lot of work I'll have to do with debconf to do that right.
<ajmitch> alright
<ajmitch> then i won't complain about it not doing so :)
<jbailey> If derek says that this is 'good enough' then I'll upload it to Debian.
<jbailey> and slowly add features and such.
<ajmitch> ok then
ToyMan (~stuq@c5300-1-ip178.albany.thebiz.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<dneighbo> um where is the config file
<dneighbo> its looking good right now, but i cant find the config file
<dneighbo> i got db installed and such
<jbailey>  /etc/dcl/
<dneighbo> found 
<dneighbo> deb seems to work for me get it in sid :)
<dneighbo> we should work on it configuring the db
<dneighbo> i.e.
<dneighbo> dcl
<dneighbo> dcl-pgsql
<jbailey> The debconf page will give you the choice of what database (with some sanity checks, like needing the libraries installed)

Action: dneighbo runs before mdean beats me for bastardizing his child
<jbailey> Was that english?
<ajmitch> heh
<dneighbo> no not english
<dneighbo> deke speak
<stbain> is there one of those i18n po things for easily using both English and Deke into the same project?
