<siesel> hi ariel_
<ariel_> hi
<ariel_> siesel: do you want that i put the trigger stuff in the digrams or is it a temporary hack 
<ariel_> that will eventually disappear?
<siesel> I think that GTrigger will stay, its likely to change a bit. (like much of the rest of appserver) 
<siesel> The only thing which is really a hack is, a) the way triggers are called, and the way methods are implemented (methods are using triggers at the moment)
<ariel_> that's ok, for i need only the signature of a method and not the implementation.
<siesel> Arturas: I fount out that a wxFONTENCODING_UTF8 exists in the source code of wxwindows. I just don't know if wxpython support it. (the only place to find it in documentation is: http://biolpc22.york.ac.uk/wx/docs/html/wx/wx159.htm#wxfont .

<jbailey> good 'nug

<chillywilly> nah
<chillywilly> gett he XFS netinst CD
<chillywilly> get the
<chillywilly> er, iso that is
<chillywilly> 30MB in size with the newer installer and XFS file system support
<chillywilly> 2.4.x kernel
<ajmitch> why would he want to use xfs?
<stbain> yah, what if I'm an ext3 freak
<jbailey> Especially with Reiser is the Path To Rightness. =)
<ajmitch> on a production box? :)
<jbailey> Sure.  I know lots of people using Reiser on mail servers and what not.
<jbailey> It minimizes craziness.
<jbailey> At least compare to xfs, reiser made it into the kernel. =)
<chillywilly> http://people.debian.org/~blade/XFS-Install/download/bootbf2.4-xfs.iso
<ajmitch> xfs has it's own vfs layer, right? :)
<chillywilly> xfs rocks, I don't care if it is in the kernel or not
<rdean> my observation on xfs vs. ReiserFS is that XFS will occasionally gobble up CPU cycles (journaling activity?) and lead to lack of UI responsiveness...
<rdean> ReiserFS doesn't appear prone to that (my experiences are that when I install ReiserFS, the UI is less prone to fits of unresponsiveness)
<jbailey> My observation is that yelling "XFS Sucks" in a channel with chillywilly in it tends to get him going. =)
<rdean> OTOH, if you've got a server, XFS rules
<chillywilly> my ui is nice and snappy, but I alos have a little extra help with that in the preemption patch
<ajmitch> jbailey: yes, that's true ;)
<chillywilly> heh, yea I also find this sooo truuuuue.....not!
Action: ajmitch uses ext3 on all partitions but one
<jbailey> ajmitch: The one with vfat? =)
Action: rdean tried ext3 and didn't like what it did to my system
<jbailey> or is it the swap partition?
<ajmitch> the reiserfs /opt :)
<ajmitch> ah yeah, i have a 500MB swap partition also
<jbailey> I use ext3 because it took awhile to get angie out of the habit of hitting the reset button when the system froze.
<chillywilly> reiser might be a bit better...you can probably find  nice netinst iso containing all 3 of those journaling file systems
<jbailey> And I'm too lazy to reformat.
Action: rdean is too lazy to do an upgrade
<ajmitch> that was the main reason for me using ext3
Action: rdean wipes and reinstalls
<stbain> wow... the debian website sux0rs
<jbailey> When Debian's installer supports reiserfs (it might now, but who the heck ever reinstalls debian? *g*) I'll probably setup my boxes with it.
<stbain> that XFS netinst image is coming down at a whopping 4.6K/s

Action: rdean doesn't have enough production "data" built up in Linux yet to warrant saving...easier to wipe and reinstall.  The benefit was that I've been able to try all the filesystems (even tried JFS, but that was when it was still buggy (don't know if that's still true or not)

<stbain> I'm trying a jigdo woody image
<stbain> iso image 1
<stbain> for some reason its pulling some non-us stuff
<stbain> is that normal?

<jbailey> --> mdean (~mdean@mkc-65-28-72-183.kc.rr.com) has joined #gnuenterprise
<jbailey> <ajmitch> mdean!
<jbailey> <ajmitch> is it truly you?
<jbailey> That's funny!
<chillywilly> stbain: yea, that's just software that was hindered byt he US encryption laws...I don't think it is really relevant anymore (the law that is)
<ajmitch> hehe
<stbain> ok
<stbain> jigdo a good option? that netinst download was taking forever
<chillywilly> jigdo will give you a big ass iso image
<jbailey> Isn't there a netinst jigdo option?
<stbain> and save me some download time later once I start the install?
<chillywilly> possibly...
<chillywilly> yea
<dneighbo> jbailey: im going to post your debs
<jbailey> Ah, I take it they're good enough then?
<dneighbo> honestly i havent tested yet :)
<dneighbo> i think perhaps i should no
<jbailey> Yeah, probably.
<dneighbo> btw: let me point you to two bugs submitted on the old ones to see if you addressed in yours
<jbailey> Sure.
<dneighbo> http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=574322&group_id=1424&atid=101424
<dneighbo> http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=574321&group_id=1424&atid=101424
<jbailey> Those bugs don't apply because I don't automatically setup the database. =)
<dneighbo> ok
<jbailey> I want feedback first whether the basic setup is right before I start coding in extra stuff like that.
<dneighbo> guess mike isnt really here
Action: dneighbo goes to test that deb
<ajmitch> dneighbo: he was before
<jbailey> Can you email me any feedback?  I'm headed home pretty soon.
<dneighbo> jbailey: 
<dneighbo> latitude:/home/dneighbo/downloads# dpkg --install dcl_20020705-pre1_all.deb 
<dneighbo> Selecting previously deselected package dcl.
<dneighbo> (Reading database ... 49970 files and directories currently installed.)
<dneighbo> Unpacking dcl (from dcl_20020705-pre1_all.deb) ...
<dneighbo> dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of dcl:
<dneighbo>  dcl depends on wwwconfig-common (>= 0.0.4-1); however:
<dneighbo>   Package wwwconfig-common is not installed.
<dneighbo> dpkg: error processing dcl (--install):
<dneighbo>  dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
<dneighbo> Errors were encountered while processing:
<dneighbo>  dcl
<dneighbo> latitude:/home/dneighbo/downloads# 
<ajmitch> that's why you use apt-get to install :)
<dneighbo> shouldn't it try to download this depend
<dneighbo> ok so its becasue using dpkg
<ajmitch> yeah
<jbailey> Yeah.  I thought of removing that dep, but I'll use it when I start putting in the automatic-virutal-host-creation stuff.
<ajmitch> jbailey: so does your deb setup the database?
<jbailey> no, not at all.
<jbailey> There's a whole lot of work I'll have to do with debconf to do that right.
<ajmitch> alright
<ajmitch> then i won't complain about it not doing so :)
<jbailey> If derek says that this is 'good enough' then I'll upload it to Debian.
<jbailey> and slowly add features and such.
<ajmitch> ok then
ToyMan (~stuq@c5300-1-ip178.albany.thebiz.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<dneighbo> um where is the config file
<dneighbo> its looking good right now, but i cant find the config file
<dneighbo> i got db installed and such
<jbailey>  /etc/dcl/
<dneighbo> found 
<dneighbo> deb seems to work for me get it in sid :)
<dneighbo> we should work on it configuring the db
<dneighbo> i.e.
<dneighbo> dcl
<dneighbo> dcl-pgsql
<jbailey> The debconf page will give you the choice of what database (with some sanity checks, like needing the libraries installed)

<ajmitch> hi jcater
<jcater> hi
<ajmitch> hmm designer doesn't start
<jcater> grrr
Action: ajmitch does cvs up
<ajmitch> i could have caught a cvs copy between commits
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> what's the error
<jcater> maybe I forgot to cvs add a file
<jcater> as it comes up here
<ajmitch> DB000:     GDebug.printMesg(2,"%s.%s doesn't appear to be a valid wizard" % (package.__name, base))

<ajmitch> but you've committed since then
<jcater> oh, yeah
<jcater> that's old
<ajmitch> master/detail wizard died on me yesterday, i'll see if it does today
<ajmitch> i've got to figure out that stuff too
<ajmitch> eg i have a customer table, a cnotes table, & a notes table here
<ajmitch> where cnotes has id from the other two tables (associative entity)
<jcater> shared notes?
<ajmitch> something like that i think
Action: ajmitch didn't do the db :)
<ajmitch> appears to have worked today
<ajmitch> (the wizard, on another pair of tables)
jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)

<ajmitch> designer is turning out quite well, you're doing a good job :)
<jcater> just wait
<jcater> in a week or so, you will see some major improvements
<ajmitch> excellent
Action: jcater is using designer for a big project at the moment
<ajmitch> ah
<jcater> so I'm having to deal with all it's oddities
<jcater> and if I have to deal with an oddity more than two or three times, 
<ajmitch> navigator doesn't currently get forms from the current dir, does it?
<jcater> I get p*ssed off
<ajmitch> understandable
<jcater> no
<ajmitch> ok, am wondering if i should let it do that
<jcater> but since I'm the main designer coder, if I get p'd off, then I end up fixing it :)
<ajmitch> it seems like each UI driver in navigator has form loading code
<jcater> yeah
Action: jcater wouldn't really recommend anything but the UIwxpython right now
<jcater> the others need to be subclassed from it
<ajmitch> it's what i'm using
<ajmitch> hmm, how to do master-detail when there's a many-many relationship?
<jcater> egads
<jcater> are you trying to make me think or something?
<jcater> :)
<ajmitch> my apologies, it must be late there :)
<ajmitch> then again, it's friday night here
Action: jcater has spent last 6 hrs filling a moving truck
<ajmitch> ugh
<jcater> yip
<jcater> that describes how I feel
<ajmitch> now i have to try & figure out labels from cryptic field names
<ajmitch> hmm, from a describe statement:
<ajmitch> | status   | enum('open','posted','printed','emailed') |
<jcater> um
<jcater> yuck
<ajmitch> will have to limit combo box to those, i guess :)
Action: ajmitch is building forms from a very simple web-based accounting system
<jcater> which one?
<ajmitch> custom one written by boss which only he uses :)
<jcater> lol
<ajmitch> this is mainly just a way for me to learn forms & designer
<ajmitch> oh dear, now this is a screwup
<ajmitch> customer.id is numbered starting at 10000, invoice.cid is numbered from 0, the php code must mangle that before a query
<ajmitch> how ugly
<ajmitch> perhaps not
Action: ajmitch takes a blunt object to the database

<siesel> morning
<siesel> psu: thanks for you great work
Action: siesel is reading KC GNUe #37 
<psu> thanks
<psu> not sure how many name checks I gave you this time ;-)
<psu> ajmitch got several
<jcater> psu: as always, thanks for doing the GNUe KC
<jcater> I'd like to make one coment re: 5. Security release of DCL
<jcater> s/coment/comment
Action: jcater thinks that statements like dneighbo's should be qualified
<psu> i did wonder about that
<jcater> i.e., "It is HIGHLY suggested that you update." --> "..if you run DCL on an untrusted network"
<jcater> as I hate scare tactics like that
Action: jcater imagines we are one of the only ppl running a "public" dcl instance
<jcater> s/only/few
<psu> I assume the exploits discovered are theoretical rather than actual?
Action: ajmitch was just on phone
<jcater> yes
<ajmitch> hi siesel
<ajmitch> psu: yeah, i do tend to talk a bit on irc :)
<jcater> but it's just like that NOLA notice last week
Action: ajmitch needs to code more, talk less
<jcater> if you are running on an untrusted network, then the package has issues
<ajmitch> yes
<jcater> but of course the question then has to be raised, why are you running it on an untrusted network??
<jcater> but that's just my $0.02
<ajmitch> stupidity? :)
<jcater> oh, also
<jcater> well, you know
<jcater> I don't mean to sound elitist or anything
<jcater> but, seriously
<jcater> the first question my accounting ppl at work always ask is
<jcater> can anyone access their systems
<jcater> and we are a small company
<jcater> if someone's installing an accounting package for someone
<jcater> and makes it publicly accessible
<jcater> well, they better either be a well-intentioned family member
<jcater> or fired one
<jcater> ok, I'll stop ranting
<jcater> about security
<jcater> I would like to make one comment regarding CVS designer
<jcater> (that maybe psu could put in the next KC)
<jcater> The cvs version of designer is undergoing some needed restructuring... if cvs is broken and you are relying on cvs designer to get your work done, then you might want to tag your gnue/designer module as the 0.3.x branch
<psu> duly noted
<jcater> That branch is only for bug-fixes
<jcater> the outcome will be worth the frustration.
<jcater> thanks
Action: jcater took great care not to get any typos in that statement :)
Action: ajmitch will probably still play with cvs designer, but keep an old copy around :)
<jcater> that would be advisable
Action: jcater tries not to break designer when he commits
<jcater> but sometimes they slip by me
<ajmitch> i'll try & catch bugs
<ajmitch> and staple them to the wall until you've fixed them
Action: siesel likes searching typos ;)
<jcater> lol

<jamest> um
<StyXman> hi jcater 
<jamest> i'm so out of the loop
<jamest> i wouldn't know
<StyXman> oh, ack, I'll ping jcater 
<jamest> jcater?
<StyXman> hey, jcater, do you know about scrollbars?
<StyXman> there's a rumor here that they're working...
<jcater> somewhat
<jamest> I thought you were loafing around this weekend and wouldn't be back till monday.
<jcater> they were introduced many decades ago
<jcater> as a graphical element for "modern" guis
<jcater> oh, our scrollbars
<jcater> I haven't touched them
<jamest> introduced is a really crappy word
<jcater> jamest: I am loafing around :)
<jamest> i added a <tag> and code to create the widget
<jamest> and that is all
<jamest> i thought someone else worked on making them do something
Action: jcater too
<StyXman> ah, so they had not changed
<jcater> but don't recall any details
<jcater> I don't use them
<jamest> someone was doing something somewhere
<jcater> so wouldn't know
<StyXman> I have some ideas, wanna hear them?
<jamest> I have 0 time right now, my mail system is partially fried, !@#!@# sysadmin is changing the system over live this morning
<jcater> I'm not really here today
<StyXman> :)
<StyXman> ok, I'll hack it here, and when it's done, we'll talk about it.
<jamest> sorry man
<jamest> someone needs to come up with a way to hook one's brain to several bodies
<jamest> as I swear I'll never do everything in life I want to do
<Arturas> i have found that in common/src/FormatMasks we have at least 3 files (DateMask.py, NumberMask.py, TextMask.py) that each of them defines things like monthNames, weekdayNames over and over - wouldn't it be simplier to define all them once in BaseMask.py?
<jcater> Arturas: I would stay out of those files
<jcater> as you are wasting your time
<StyXman> jcater: is that a threat? :)
<jcater> NumberMask and TextMask aren't even implemented
<jcater> so the code you see there is
<jcater> a cut and paste from DateMask

<StyXman> say I want to make scrollbars have some functionality. should I implement it @ uidriver level, or @ gfobject (in fact, gfscrollbar)?
Action: Arturas sometimes hates those differences in time.... a whole day.... :/
<Arturas> jcater: thanks :)
Action: jcater would imagine gfscrollbar, with any wx-specific stuff in uidriver
<StyXman> are events and triggers the same? I'm a little confused...
<jamest> there should already be a gfscrollbar file IIRC
<StyXman> jamest: yes, it is, but is a litlle... uh, spartan :)
<StyXman> I mean, I see code like this in a form's trigger:
<StyXman>       self._object.dispatchEvent(GFEvent('requestCOMMIT'))
<StyXman> and things like this in GF files:
<StyXman>     self._triggerFunctions={'allowedValues':{'function':self.allowedValues,},
<StyXman> are they 'connected'?
<jamest> events == events internal to forms - 
<jamest>   button clicks, requests for next record, etc, etc
<jamest> triggers == chunks of code that are attached to certain "trigger events" that are specified in the gfd, grd, etc files
<jamest>   pre-commit, pre-update, etc, etc
<StyXman> aha, but how are events handled by gfobjects? hacking the dispatchEvent function?
<jamest> objects registers with other objects to listen to events
<jamest> via a registerListener functoin IIRC
<jamest> trigger events are hard coded into the program
<StyXman> no, I need new 'events' on gfscrollbar...
<StyXman> (I think)
<jamest> so that a internal requestNEXTRECORD event would make the form attempt to switch to the next record
<StyXman> like 'scrollUp' event, which should do something..
<jamest> part of that switching logic fires triggers like pre-focusout, pre-focusin, etc, etc
<jamest> oooo
<jamest> there is a dictionary of events in the objects that listen for them
<jamest> you can look at either GFForm or GFInstance for example 
Action: jamest can't recall off top of head which file has them
<jamest> you create a entry that maps an event to a specifc handler function
<jamest> and that's it
<jamest> i have to run for a bit

ge (~george@207.245.39.226) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> as far as i understand 'strftime' function gives date\time string formatted  according to locale settings
<Arturas> but do i need localized SQL queries for database?
<Arturas> i guess it shouldn't be there
<Arturas> function 'strptime' should be used
<Arturas> (if no one says anything against, i'll correct it and commit into cvs in about an hour)
<ge> hi, i am touching gnu enterprise since yesterday. but i don't how to build up the application. could any guru tell me more?

<Arturas> ge: Geas: i'm afraid i don't know this
<ge> geas is an app. server
<ge> i think it is neccessary if i want to run in 3-tier infrastructure
<ge> how can use the financial package, any thread?
<ge> actually, i can't find the pachage for download
<jamest> hi george
<ge> hi jamest
<jamest> the financial package doesn't exist yet

<jamest> ge: no user ready packages have been released
<jamest> the tools are getting most the focus at this time
<jamest> a lot of planning has been done on packages for the old GEAS
<StyXman> so, how do I bind a function to a event? thru a eventHandler?
<jamest> and I think someone was looking at making the new app server work with them, if it doesn't do so all ready
<jamest> StyXman: in GFInstance.py
<jamest>     # Incoming events
<jamest>     self.registerEventListeners( {
<jamest>                            # Datasource trigger events
<jamest> is example of binding GFInstance functions to events
<StyXman> so, if I want gfsb to have events, I just write the functions that handle the events and then register them to listen to the new events? events are global?
<jamest> events are only passed to objects that request to listen to events
<jamest> so not really global
<StyXman> yeah, but I mean 'global' in the sense that anyone can listen to certain event...
<StyXman> or I'm misunderstandin what events are for. I what the UIsb to call the GFsb's 'event' handler...
<jcater> so UI* doesn't have to know about GF* internals, and vice versa
<StyXman> jcater: uh?
<jcater> yes?
<StyXman> I don't parse your comment...
<jcater> err

jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<StyXman> say, which is the difference between calling self._eventHandler and dispatchEvent?
<jamest> you wnat to use dispatchEvent
<jamest> 99.9% of the time
<jamest> that sends the event to the objects that have registered to listen to it
<StyXman> but most of the examples use the other one...
<StyXman> aha, but the other does not?
<jamest> huh?
<StyXman> calling eventHandler...
<jamest> sigh, maybe someone changed something
<jamest> IIRC _eventHandler was a dictionary right?
Action: jamest doesn't have time to dig into code
<StyXman> jamest: wx/uidriver.py:710
<StyXman> there's the wxbuttons event handler...
<StyXman> it calls eventhandler

Action: jcater is back (gone 01:32:47)

<jamest> I'm pretty sure you'd want to use dispatchEvent to send the actual events

<dneighbo> i.e. say i have 5 products
<dneighbo> myfoo, yourfoo, ourfoo, thefoo, somefoo

<jbailey> symlink them.
Action: chillywilly troutslaps dneighbo *hard*
<dneighbo> it is used by myfoo and yourfoo
<jbailey> Or use a library.
<dneighbo> ok thats what i was thinking
jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jbailey> a library is better.
<dneighbo> well gut reaction was code right
<jbailey> Since that's the Right Thing in all cases.
<dneighbo> and make it a library silly
<jbailey> but a symlink works.
<dneighbo> but say this is legacy
<dneighbo> how do you symlink in cvs?
<dneighbo> i.e. how does that work
<dneighbo> is it a file system symlink on the repository side
<dneighbo> or is a cvs symlink
<jbailey> you haave to go into the repository and symlink in the filesystem
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> then if someone cheecks out foo.c from myfoo
<dneighbo> and commits it
<dneighbo> the other 4 projects repositories auto get updated?
<dneighbo> if they are symlinked
<dneighbo> and then one of them can do the same?
<jbailey> yes
<ajmitch> sounds ugly
<jbailey> it is
<jbailey> it's certainly the wrong thing.
<jbailey> But it works, and people like it. =)
<dneighbo> well lots of people have done bad design
<dneighbo> so im sure this fellow isnt the first to have to address the problem :)
<chillywilly> say you are *hypothetically* doing an xml markup of an object description language
<chillywilly> and you wanted tp specify operation parameters
<chillywilly> what would yo do
<dneighbo> that would be dumb who would do that
<chillywilly> ths way: parameter name="element" mode="in" type="Object"/>
<chillywilly> er, <parameter
<chillywilly> or
<chillywilly> <paramater mode="in" type="Object">element</parameter>

<Chipaca> chillywilly: I dunno what 'parameter' is, but I'd probably have it more entity-oriented (less attributes)
<Chipaca> chillywilly: but i dunno what parameter is, so I'm probably off base
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> it is a paramter to an operation call of an object
<Chipaca> perlhead here says he's getting russian fonts instead of iso8859-1 in gnue, why can that be?
<chillywilly> <operation name="insert_element" result="void">
<chillywilly>   <parameters>
<chillywilly>     <parameter name="element" mode="in" type="Object"/>
<ajmitch> Chipaca: maybe arturas' latest changes to forms
<chillywilly>     <!-- Perhaps parameters should be in this format?
<chillywilly>     <paramater mode="in" type="Object">element</parameter>
<chillywilly>     -->
<chillywilly>   </paramaters>
<chillywilly> </operation>
<chillywilly> or, void insert_element(in Object element);
<chillywilly> so Chipaca you would make them tags with content like:
<chillywilly> <operation>
<chillywilly>   <name>insert_element</name>
<chillywilly> ...
<chillywilly> less attributes...
<Chipaca> yes, my xml tends to be more like that

<ajmitch> hey siesl
<ajmitch> how's phpforms coming along?
<siesel> hi ajmitch
<ajmitch> it's been decided that appserver probably isn't necessary for the accounting app i'm helping with, since it's for small businesses
<ajmitch> a web forms client may be tho :)
<siesel> I hope to bring phpforms to a stable state soon, but there are too many small problems, and I don't have a good debugger :(
<ajmitch> ok
<siesel> and after using python I don't like PHP anymore ;)
Action: ajmitch would really prefer a python implementation, like madlocke's webware client :)
<ajmitch> i'd imagine handling python triggers in php would have been fun
<siesel> this is the reason for using phpforms with appserver, so triggers can be moved into appserver

<sledge_> thx
<sledge_> i just found a bug in pgsql.xsl in gnue cvs
<siesel> oh, which bug?
<sledge_> all scripts make a match="/", pgsql.xsl has match="/schema"
<sledge_> which is wrong when you try it with dcl.xml
<sledge_> i removed it and it worked
<sledge_> all others worked before
<siesel> yes, because pgsql.xsl is the only one which supports the new GNUe schema file format ( *.GSD )
<sledge_> so it is a new feature that the others haven't, not a bug?
<siesel> yep. and pgsql.xsl is the only one which can create insert statemenets out of the <data> part of an .GSD
<sledge_> ah
<sledge_> great
<siesel> i think i should remove dcl.xml or convert it to dcl.gsd
<sledge_> is gsd already defined / is there doc?
<siesel> there is DTD in designer/src/schema
<siesel> and you can create it with designer
<sledge_> ok
<sledge_> but i can safely assume that the old format can simply be converted to the new one by wrapping everything in <schema>?
<siesel> yes
<sledge_> wtf is a constraint?
<sledge_> (sorry for the stupid question)
<siesel> constrains = NOT NULL, UNIQUE, ...

<dneighbo> chillywilly: you here? oh cvs master
<chillywilly> yes I am here
<dneighbo> can you answer this
<dneighbo> After importing a project into the CVS repository, the CVS directory in my 
<dneighbo> working directory was not created.  The work directory was in my home 
<dneighbo> directory.
<dneighbo> Is there a permissions issue where the CVS server cannot write to my home 
<dneighbo> directory?
<dneighbo> According to Webmin, the box does not have a cvs user (not a user that uses 
<dneighbo> cvs but a user for the cvs server).  Does it need one?
<chillywilly> I thought you just need to setup 'writers' file
<chillywilly> in the CVSROOT module
<chillywilly> you have to remove the original source tree ans then check it out according to the docs
<chillywilly> or mv it out of the way if you are paranoid ;)
<chillywilly> ah but you do want to have proper perms on the repository
<chillywilly> I think I have a cvs group
<chillywilly> for my personal repository
<chillywilly> perms are owner=root, group=cvs dirs are chmod 775 files are chmod 664

<chillywilly> lemme know if this helps
<dneighbo> will do its for a lug person here
<chillywilly> i.e, it won't create the CVS dir until you check it out...which requires pulling a fresh copy

<ajmitch> hi dneighbo
<chillywilly> ello derek
<dneighbo> anyone know if there is an open office channel?
<dneighbo> or is anyone running an open office not from debian packaging?
<dneighbo> as there is missing feature from star office i cant live w/o 
<ajmitch> i've got OO.o here
Action: chillywilly installed form tar ball
<dneighbo> and i could have sworn it existed in OO 1.0
<chillywilly> from
<ajmitch> what is it?
<dneighbo> can one you open up impress (power point)
<dneighbo> and create a new slide show create two slides
<ajmitch> yeah, give me 15min for it to open
<dneighbo> and then go to
<dneighbo> Slide Show
<chillywilly> ajmitch: hehe
<dneighbo> and tell me if you have a 'custom slideshow' as an option under that menu?
<dneighbo> it used to be there and the DOCUMENTATION says it should be there
<dneighbo> but it aint there :(
<dneighbo> i will drop the debs and go to binaries if i can verify the binaries have it
<ajmitch> still waiting for splash screen to go away & app to appear
<dneighbo> darn you running that on a palm or what?
<dneighbo> even my p233 64mb is quicker than that
<dneighbo> have you considered trying fluxbox?
<dneighbo> for desktop? it will improve the speed of your applications considerably (or at least it did for me)
<ajmitch> compiling
<ajmitch> that functionality does exist here
<ajmitch> my computer is not much faster than a p233 :)
<ajmitch> as in, i can create a custom slideshow
<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> did you get it with debian packages?
<dneighbo> or from openoffice tar ball
<dneighbo> er binary
<ajmitch> binary tarball
<dneighbo> im downloading the openoffice binary from the site
<dneighbo> ok cool (me was having minor panic)
<dneighbo> as that feature ROCKS for church worship :)
<dneighbo> i can have one powerpoint file that has all the songs
<dneighbo> then just select the ones for a particular service as a custom show
<ajmitch> have been asked to deb-package GNUe tools, so will try & do that as i fugre out how
<ajmitch> excelltn
<dneighbo> the old power point people were like NO WAY (as i guess office powerpoint doesnt do this)
Action: ajmitch must need new keyboard - typing sucks
<dneighbo> so they would number every slide to every song and maintain a db of them
<dneighbo> then write down the numbers for a song set on paper
<ajmitch> ah, this way is much better?
<dneighbo> and use the 'go to' slide feature
<dneighbo> i.e. key in the number of the slide
<ajmitch> that way sucks :)
<dneighbo> why do you think im freaking that the deb packages dont have custom slide show :)
<dneighbo> sigh my connection is getting slower
<dneighbo> took almost 2 minutes for open office to download this time :(
Action: dneighbo forgets we have some dial up folks here, i shouldnt be saying that
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> there is a branch for 0.3.0, right?
<dneighbo> yes
Action: ajmitch wonders what to number cvs packages as
<dneighbo> im the maintainer of that, but havent done anything with it :)
<ajmitch> 0.3.0.$DATE ?
<dneighbo> please do package 0.3.0
<dneighbo> as 0.3.0
<ajmitch> ah ok, will just take 0.3.0
<dneighbo> then if you its easy we can do a -cvs (no?)
<dneighbo> and update it regularly
<ajmitch> yes, that's what i'd do
<ajmitch> where regularly == nightly cron build if possible :)
<ajmitch> don't think i can simply do that with python packages
jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<ajmitch> will need to touch up documentation on branch to reflect new binary names :)
<dneighbo> ajmitch: certainly we could do that if the debian packaging can support it
<ajmitch> will try, need to fuind out how to package distutils stuff (nickr said some of it wasn't nice)

<chillywilly> what dialup folks?
<dneighbo> in a product that IMHO is better than MS office :)
<ajmitch> dneighbo: it's not an EULA tho :)
<dneighbo> ajmitch: true dat
<dneighbo> i mean so nice to see this wehre the EULA normally is
<ajmitch> yeah, is much better
<ajmitch> you can click 'accept' with a clear conscience :)
<ajmitch> hmm, need to get up at 5:30am again
<dneighbo> ajmitch: its bad for your health to rise that early
<dneighbo> early to bed early to wise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise
<ajmitch> dneighbo: i know, but there's another dotgnu meet on
<dneighbo> is well a wives tale (i.e. only a wife would think of it)
<ajmitch> hehe
<dneighbo> hey i think this openoffice is broken
<dneighbo> it cant be good
<dneighbo> it doesnt want me to rebbot
<dneighbo> oh crap i forgot
<chillywilly> reboot?
<dneighbo> GNU\Linux is winning BIG time
<dneighbo> i was at softball
<dneighbo> lets say the guys on our team cant spell computer much less literate with one
<chillywilly> you play softball?
<dneighbo> one of the guys gets a call from his girlfriend
<dneighbo> and he asks one of the other guys, do you know if linux is any good
<ajmitch> hmm, my uptime isn't too bad here for my main desktop box
<dneighbo> im like (did you say linux?) (this is not type of guy i would expect to know what windows is, much less linux)
<dneighbo> he said yeah, you know what it is
<dneighbo> i said yeah
<dneighbo> he said is it good
<dneighbo> i said, yeah it kicks crap out of windows
<dneighbo> then i had to go to bat
<dneighbo> came back and asked him why he wanted to know
--- Sun Jul 14 2002
<chillywilly> struck out eh? ;)
<dneighbo> he said his wife/girlfriend was at the store shopping for computer
<chillywilly> (that's why you came back so fast ;) )
<dneighbo> and they had a celeron machine for 299.99 and it had linux
<ajmitch> v. nice
<dneighbo> and they didnt know if it was any good, but he thought she was gonna buy it
<dneighbo> chillywilly: no i hit into fielders choice that scored run
<chillywilly> cool, preinstalled with it?
<chillywilly> dneighbo: sure you did ;)
<dneighbo> and then stayed on base until third out (dont strike out in slow pitch) but i dont claim to be worth a crap
<dneighbo> chillywilly: i assume pre installed
<dneighbo> i didnt ask him
<dneighbo> but i would presume its Lindows on a Walmart pc
<chillywilly> ah
<dneighbo> as only place else i have seen them is at Fry's and i dont think that they shop there
<dneighbo> as stated this is not a 'computer guru' type guy
<chillywilly> do you know that they run everything as root on Lindows?
<ajmitch> i thought the walmart ones were online-only?
<dneighbo> but thats why i say 'we are winning'
<ajmitch> and walmart also agreed to pre-load mandrake
<dneighbo> chillywilly: i didnt get into all that
<dneighbo> im not good friends with the guy
Action: ajmitch would take mandrake over lindows any day :)
<chillywilly> just saying...it is so much like windows ;)
<dneighbo> he comes with one of the guys that goes to our church (its church league)
<chillywilly> yea
<dneighbo> i figure i tell him, let me get you some customer support action and go over there with a woody disk :)
<chillywilly> crazymike plays the church and work league
Action: chillywilly doesn't play softball
<dneighbo> i wont play on the other league (they are too cut throat)
<dneighbo> all the other guys play like 3 nights a week
<chillywilly> well between the 2 teams that he plays on they have a total of 1 win
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> e was pissed when they won because he told me he wanted to either be really good or suck really bad
<chillywilly> s/e/he/
<chillywilly> btw, it si very cool that they are bringin gnu/linux to the masses ;)
<chillywilly> s/si/is/
<dneighbo> crap the other one has same problem
<dneighbo> BUT i realized the file i have is readonly
<dneighbo> i wonder if thats why
<chillywilly> heh
<ajmitch> chillywilly: they're bringing the linux but hiding the gnu, if ya know what i mean
<chillywilly> yea, well...you get them using it then we can edumacate them about GNU :)
<dneighbo> bah crap
<chillywilly> it's hard to relate to the home user why Free Software is important sometimes
<dneighbo> thats what it was i think
<dneighbo> im going back to the debian
<dneighbo> to try
Action: dneighbo slaps himself
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> where'd you get the deb from?
<dneighbo> the magic deb dwarf
<chillywilly> cool
<ajmitch> chillywilly: lindows is a sizable proprietary chunk hiding the free internals
<ajmitch> although the desktop is kde afaik
Action: ajmitch considers whether to get an MCSE
<chillywilly> no!
<chillywilly> resist!
<ajmitch> cannot resist the allure of big $$
<dneighbo> ajmitch: new zealand really that low on fire wood you would have to do that?
<dneighbo> gack
<chillywilly> lies and deceit are the way of the dark side
<Remosi> ajmitch: CCNE?
<Remosi> RHCE?
<ajmitch> Remosi: now that would be worth something, the CCNE
<dneighbo> its 22:30 at ists still 100 degrees out side and like 30% humidity
<chillywilly> yick
<ajmitch> have heard that it's an actual qualification, unlike MCSE
<Remosi> yes
<ajmitch> dunno much about RHCE
<Remosi> people respect CCNE's
<Remosi> RHCE's mean you know how RH works
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> and i'm a debian person :)
<ajmitch> RH isn't too bad tho
<Remosi> and MSCE means that you know how to load minesweeper, and your certification will expire after 2 years at which point you may no longer be able to find minesweeper :)
<Remosi> agreed
<Remosi> the most annoying thing about rh boxen is how to upgrade them?
<ajmitch> rm -rf 
<dneighbo> deb ftp://ftp.vpn-junkies.de/openoffice testing main contrib
<Remosi> well yes
<dneighbo> chillywilly: thats where openoffice is
<chillywilly> k
<dneighbo> you can s/testing/unstable
<dneighbo> and it will work too if you are on sid
<chillywilly> german eh?
Action: Remosi has to install mysql
<Remosi> bletch
<dneighbo> yeah but they have all the i10n english stuff packaged
<dneighbo> just not the dictionary :(
<dneighbo> only german/austrian dictionaries
<ajmitch> mysql, now that's a fun db
<dneighbo> Remosi: that is punishable by flogging in Gilbert
<dneighbo> at least if you are near me
Action: ajmitch has mysql installed & running
<Remosi> dneighbo: I usually abuse people who install mysql horribly
<dneighbo> ajmitch: God forgives even the most horrible of sinners
<Remosi> problem is that I'm experimenting with some software that although it has postgres support, the postgres support isn't in debian 
<ajmitch> dneighbo: mysql is ok for toy databases
<ajmitch> eg, nothing fancy required, a simple db backend to a website
<dneighbo> roflmao 
<dneighbo> this is best error message i have seen in some time
<dneighbo> ==========
<dneighbo> dneighbo@latitude:~$ openoffice 
<dneighbo> I'm confused because I can't find OpenOffice's user files.
<dneighbo> Your ~/.sversionrc file tells they should be under /home/dneighbo/OpenOffice.org1.0,
<dneighbo> but they are not. Please fix the situation manually.
<dneighbo> You may want to edit ~/.sversionrc to indicate where is OO
<dneighbo> installed, or remove it if you did remove your installation

<chillywilly> heheh

<dneighbo> "you're a bad one mister grinch"
Action: dneighbo hugs his deb and his custom slide show
<dneighbo> and then goes to tend to laundry before mrs. masta comes home and thumps the snot out of me
<ajmitch> lol
<chillywilly> you are now reduced to laundry slave ;)
<chillywilly> your masta status is in limbo
Action: dneighbo returns
<dneighbo> ajmitch: re 'ok for toy databases'
<dneighbo> soon very soon jbailey will show his true debian diety status
<dneighbo> and you will just apt-get install db-bliss
<dneighbo> and SAP-DB will be on your debian machine ;)
<ajmitch> *cough*
<ajmitch> why would i want to infect my box with that? :)
<chillywilly> I thought SAP was the enemy? ;)
<chillywilly> er, one of them anyway
<Remosi> can anyone tell me why (At least in the KC) it was agreed to use "mm/dd/yy"?
<Remosi> for internal date formats?
Action: chillywilly is not guilty on all counts of internal date format
<ajmitch> Remosi: probably because of the unhealthy american influence
<Remosi> yeah
<Remosi> well, it's not y2k compliant, it's ambigious compared to the european format of dd/mm/yyyy, and it doesn't sort properly :)
<Remosi> yyyy-mm-dd seems to be a much more logical system to use
<ajmitch> yes
<Remosi> theres even a ISO standard about it
Action: ajmitch certainly prefers it
<ajmitch> makes sorting in a list much simpler
<Remosi> well, if american's persist to use their silly systems we'll have to buy a few plane tickets and go and beat them around the head with a large, wet, and slightly smelly trout.
<dneighbo> um cause americans are the best
<Remosi> http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html
<Remosi> dneighbo: uh, sure :P
<dneighbo> and we dont want your puking metric system or messed up concept of date formatting
<ajmitch> the trout will no doubt be a bit smelly after that plane trip
<dneighbo> you can even take your stinking celsius too
Action: Remosi goes and prepares the fish
<dneighbo> btw im completely kidding
<dneighbo> only the french would use that as a reason ;)
<dneighbo> i mean after the dateline was stolen from them, who would blame them for their ire
<ajmitch> heh
<Remosi> true :)
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> notes form our LUG meeting...
<chillywilly> *********
<chillywilly> Help Desk
<chillywilly> *********
<chillywilly> Josh has girl problems.  We're not sure MLUG is really the proper
<chillywilly> forum for solving this problem.  However, if someone has suggestions, 
<chillywilly> he's open to them.
<Remosi> rofl
<Remosi> sounds like one of our local lug's discussions
<chillywilly> hehe, :)
<Remosi> however "Josh" may, or may not, have been participating in the discussion ;)
<chillywilly> how's this for am example:
<chillywilly> / Exception declarations                                                                                                  exception WhoSaidYouCouldStopCoding{string code_slave_name; };      
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> / Exception declarations
<chillywilly> exception WhoSaidYouCouldStopCoding{string code_slave_name; };
<chillywilly> this is going into my "kitchen sink" odl file
<chillywilly> :)
<Remosi> heh
<Remosi> cw, did you hear about my amazing .so->idl idea?
<chillywilly> nope
<Remosi> dang
<Remosi> you know how nm can tell you all the symbols in a .so (or .o for that matter) right?
<chillywilly> yes
<Remosi> and how "stabs" can tell you the type of a symbol if it was compiled with -g, or, alternatively, c++filt will tell you if it was compiled using gcc, right? :)
<chillywilly> never used that before
<Remosi> nm ~/irc/gnuworld/src/msg_W.o | c++filt
<Remosi> grab your favourite c++ .o, .so, or executable and tryt hat ;)
<chillywilly> is c++filt apt-gettable?
Action: ajmitch doesn't knoew where it is :)
<chillywilly> I don't see it either
<Remosi> it's in binutils
<Remosi> apt-get install binutils ?
<chillywilly> doh
<chillywilly> I have it installed
<Remosi> dpkg -S c++filt
<Remosi> binutils: /usr/bin/c++filt
<Remosi> binutils: /usr/share/man/man1/c++filt.1.gz
<Remosi> (you have a box without binutils?!)
<Remosi> :)
<chillywilly> nope, I have c++filt
<ajmitch> ah no, i see what i did
Action: ajmitch tried c++-filt for some reason
<Remosi> ajmitch: doh!
Action: chillywilly tries the command on libccgnu2
<Remosi> givin that type information you should be able to write an idl file (for gnurpc for instance)
<chillywilly> that shows every symbol right?
Action: ajmitch imagines it *could* be done
<Remosi> right
<Remosi> nm lists all symbols
<Remosi> eg: nm /lib/ld-linux.so.2
<Remosi> c++filt takes a mangled symbol and demangles it
<chillywilly> yea, yea...I knwo just saying why would I want to expose every symbol....er, or you saying expose all "functions"
<Remosi> eg:
<Remosi> echo 00000000 W validSubscript__CQ28gnuworld11xParametersRCUi | c++filt
<Remosi> produces:
<Remosi> 00000000 W gnuworld::xParameters::validSubscript(unsigned int const &) const
<Remosi> you need to of course figure out which symbols are actually defined in the .so/.a/.o that you're linking
<Remosi> but it could be a really easy way to automatically load, say, openssl into python
<Remosi> you could take the openssl.so file generate some idl for it, then use gnurpc to use openssl as if it was a python module
<Remosi> without having to spend ages defining all the normal glue logic
<Remosi> if you did it right python could catch the import function and do all of that automatically
<Remosi> so you could have a .so (eg openssl.so) and then just go "import openssl" in python and have it do all the work for you ;)
<ajmitch> also may open up licensing holes :)
<Remosi> well true
<Remosi> but so does allowing multiple .c files in a gcc invocation :)
<Remosi> anyway
<Remosi> I've gotta go have dinner
<Remosi> BBL
Action: Remosi has to go read up on stabs :)
<chillywilly> I want to know how gnurpc loads the .so?
<chillywilly> s/?//
<ajmitch> bbl
<dneighbo> hgmmm search features in open office presentor are MUCH improved
<dneighbo> im impressed
<dneighbo> one thing thats always nice about this channel with aj here is taht we can tell if the world will still be here tomorrow ;)
<chillywilly> this is fun

<drochaid> hey siesel
<siesel> hi drochaid :)
<siesel> seems that is has been quite silent here during the last hours
<drochaid> I only got in 5 mins before you
<drochaid> no one welcomed me </sniff>
<siesel> oh, drochaid, I feel with you <a tear is falling down>
<siesel> btw. do you know something about accounting?
<reinhard> hey
<reinhard> hello drochaid
<reinhard> and welcome
Action: reinhard hugs drochaid
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> allo reinhard :)
<reinhard> :)
<siesel> hi reinhard
<drochaid> siesel: I know very very little about accounting .. I tend to leave that to my bro [a chartered accountant and auditor ;)]
<reinhard> siesel: you have questions about accounting?
<reinhard> i might be able to help
<siesel> yes, especialy about the differences between german and american accounting.
<reinhard> uh
<reinhard> oh
<reinhard> i'm happy that i've learned the basic differences between austrian and german accounting :)
<siesel> lol
<reinhard> from what i understand american accounting serves a different purpose
Action: drochaid uses Scots Business law when it comes to accounting
<reinhard> read: austrian/german accounting is done mainly to satisfy the tax authority
<reinhard> and to calculate the taxes to pay
<siesel> A friend told me that I should write my master thesis about the difference between chinese (quite similar to american) and german accounting
<reinhard> us american accounting seems to me to replace what we have in german "controlling" or "kostenrechnung" as well
<reinhard> i.e. it serves as a source of information for the management and/or the investors
<siesel> i.e. american accounting is just a kind of GuV ?
<reinhard> don't think that
<siesel> GuV = Gewinn & Verlust Rechnung ( don't know the english equivalence)
<reinhard> i would believe us accounting does _more_ than german accounting
<reinhard> sometimes i also get the feeling that us accounting doesn't have the strict concept of systematic account numbers
<siesel> hmmm, I thought german accounting would allready be kind of too much (especial for lasy students who have to understand it ;) )
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> night all
<siesel> but if you say they have _more_, what is it us accounting has more?
<reinhard> siesel: probably dneighbo is the one here knowing most about accounting
<reinhard> the are more detailed
<reinhard> (at least that is my understanding)
<reinhard> they do "kostenstellen" and "kostenarten" and "kostentrДger" etc. all in accounting
<siesel> ok, I will ask dneighbo, 
<reinhard> although i could misunderstand that
Action: reinhard goes to sleep

<chillywilly> anyone know how to change the font in emacs?

<nickr> the console one has identical functionality ot the X one
<chillywilly> so?
<chillywilly> the console one doesn't paste as nicely
<chillywilly> dude the key bindings int he gui one are b0rked :(
<chillywilly> M-v doesn't do a page up and M-> or M-< doesn't jump to the beginning or end of the buffer
<nickr> does for me
<nickr> your meta key is horked
<chillywilly> probably a meta key binding problem

<chillywilly> er, wait
<chillywilly> te window manager config stuff?....I know I set the meta key properly in there somewhere...at least I though

<chillywilly> nickr: do you know how to fix it?
<nickr> the meta thing is X keymap related
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> ok
<nickr> has nothing to do with Gnome
<chillywilly> now I remember
<chillywilly> some shitty xkeymap...something program
<chillywilly> you know the name?

<chillywilly> since he works for said county
<nickr> chillywilly: has nothing to do with what toolkit emacs uses
<nickr> chillywilly: regardless of toolkit, programs get certain events from the X server
<chillywilly> yes, I was going to say that but I didn't bother
<ajmitch> nickr: you get anywhere with deb packaging? i've been asked to package them in the next few days
<nickr> ajmitch: no, I didn,t get anywhere tangible because whenever we taled about it I was told that setup.py can't be made to do that and it was dropped
<ajmitch> nickr: how useful, i guess you have a standing hatred for distutils now? :)
<nickr> booja
<nickr> so basically you'll have to let it install in its fgake root, then move everything into place
<nickr> which I found annoying but I guess its acceptable if you're into it
<ajmitch> ugly as hell
<ajmitch> oh yeah, i'm right into S-M ;)

<ajmitch> hi dneighbo
<dneighbo> hi
<dneighbo> playing with more gui tools, im pretty impressed with the progress, shame i dont really find value in them for most things
<dneighbo> but its good to know when evangelizing
<ajmitch> great
<dneighbo> jbailey: you really here
<jbailey> dneighbo: Maybe. =)
<dneighbo> btw: woody is really solid (many kudos) if only they would release it
<jbailey> What'cha need?
<dneighbo> wondering how SAP-DB was going
<dneighbo> and whether dcl made it in to sid or not
<dneighbo> i.e. just being a pain :)
<ajmitch> dneighbo: i'm getting complaints about the install instructions & stuff with gnue forms, etc :)
<jbailey> sap-db was untouched this weekend.  It's all on my work machine.
<jbailey> I haven't seen the ACCEPTED message for dcl yet, but I did see the NEW notification, so I know it was received.
<jbailey> I except sap-db to be in a reasonable first-snapshot state by next weekend.
<dneighbo> ajmitch: complaints from where on what
<dneighbo> jbailey: yummy
<jbailey> So, basically with sapdb-client, sapdb-server, and maybe a sapdb-docs packages
<dneighbo> well you know where to find a tester :)
<jbailey> dneighbo: I'm kvitching again. =)
<ajmitch> dneighbo: not allowed to say where, he didn't give much detail ;)
<dneighbo> i can test on woody and sid for you
<dneighbo> jbailey: as stated before if one must make makefiles for the debs certainly do so
<jbailey> dneighbo: Cool.  It'll all be targetted at sid.
<jbailey> dneighbo: It would be nice to have a clean 'make install' target.  Right now I'm copying files by hand into the right place, so I worry that I'll miss things in upgrades.
<ajmitch> talked to nickr about making gnue debs, could require a certain love of s-m
Action: ajmitch wonders why each component is in it's own dir for downloads
<jbailey> dneighbo: Perhaps once Andrew finishes the GNUe debs, I can work from that example to still build you your cross-platform installer.
<dneighbo> jbailey: i think we plan to make that python and part of gnue-common
<dneighbo> an installer that is
<dneighbo> eventually we will have to mimic something like apt for our actual packages(applications) not tools
<jbailey> Ah okay.  I was thinking with that installed I had showed you before on sourceforge.
<jbailey> It looked like it would do a nice job (and was already written)
<jbailey> Whatever works best for you, obviously. =)
<dneighbo> i dont remember the other
<dneighbo> best to ask jamest
<dneighbo> as i think he pretty much has the internals done for a xplatform installer
<dneighbo> i.e. to make the linux installer like the windows one (visual and such) for those silly enough to not use debian :)
<jbailey> Ah, cool.
<jbailey> *lol*
<jbailey> BTW, remember you can also use alien to generate rpms. =)
<dneighbo> that would be very cool
<dneighbo> i no longer have a red hat or windows system to test things :)
<jbailey> No windows system.  Nice!
Action: dneighbo is 100% debianite now
<dneighbo> no windows for about 6 months now
<dneighbo> no red hat as of last weekend
<dneighbo> now im hooked on my laptop again :)
<jbailey> I still have windows for the games.
<dneighbo> with new kernel, shiny new journaling file system and a brand spanking new grub loader
<dneighbo> yummy
<dneighbo> i plan on using win4lin for some things
<dneighbo> mainly kids games
<dneighbo> i have railroad tycoon 2, civ CTP and some other linux games from loki that keep me fairly entertained in limited game time i do have
Action: ajmitch doesn't play many games
<ajmitch> have been windows free for about 3 years
<ajmitch> only been hooked on debian for 18 months tho
<chillywilly> dneighbo: did you see the article about the plug and Marcopia county?
<chillywilly> on LT
<dneighbo> which one
<chillywilly> one sec...
<dneighbo> its been on source forge
<dneighbo> and slashdot (more than once)
<chillywilly> maybe it was newsforge that I saw it on
<dneighbo> the newsforge one was ok

<dneighbo> and could EASILY be disputed, but politically it would be wrong for me to do so

Action: ajmitch dislikes uppercase names in tarballs
<chillywilly> speaking of which
<chillywilly> our buddy Goran is thinking about naming his band "satellite down"
<chillywilly> what do you guys think?
<dneighbo> um what ever floats their boat :)
<chillywilly> crazymike has live recordings of The Gufs (Goran's "former" band) and Goran's new stuff at http://crazymike.dyndns.org
<chillywilly> you need the xmms-shn plugin though (trying to switch him to flac - http://flac.sourceforge.net)
<chillywilly> it doesn't believe in lossy compression for audio ;)
<ajmitch> hmm, how to package gnue-common with it's myriad deps? ;)
<chillywilly> s/it/he/,  :o
Action: chillywilly is sneezing and his nose is running this means sleep is definitely needed
<ajmitch> designer will be fairly simple compared to common
<dneighbo> what is flac
<dneighbo> shn is a lossless format
<chillywilly> we also put up ths board - http://goran.kicks-ass.org...I am running apache as a virtual server answering that previous url and the board one
<chillywilly> flac is Free Software
<chillywilly> shorten is not
<chillywilly> ;)
<dneighbo> shn is the format all the tape traders use
<dneighbo> its basically a compressed wav
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> I know
<dneighbo> cuts wav in half without lossing any quality
<chillywilly> so does flac
<chillywilly> I hear it gets better compression
Action: dneighbo still think that losing quality is ok (human ear is only so good) to preserve space
<chillywilly> hehe, ;)
<dneighbo> also its little known fact but the ogg vorbis spec states that you can do lossless compression/encoding in .ogg
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> I'll have to let mikey know
<chillywilly> btw, we are setting up somehting to stream Goran's music on WOPN ;)
<dneighbo> i.e. master sources should be highest quality possible but unless you are doing studio work or professional work the quality of bitrates by .mp3(sic) are functional (better than FM radio)
<chillywilly> dneighbo: WOPN is in dire need of good tunes that are freely available
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> they seem to play a LOT of techno crap
<chillywilly> or whatever they can broadcast for free
<chillywilly> (megman remixes and goofy shit like that)
<dneighbo> These two general mechanisms are particularly well suited to coupling due to the structure of Vorbis encoding, as we'll explore below, and using both we can implement both totally lossless stereo image coupling [bit-for-bit decode-identical to uncoupled modes], as well as various lossy models that seek to eliminate inaudible or unimportant aspects of the stereo image in order to enhance bitrate.

<chillywilly> uhuh
<chillywilly> thanks
gnuebot (eggdrop@mail.libertydistribution.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> same document
<dneighbo> under stereo models
<dneighbo> Using polar mapping and/or channel interleaving, it's possible to couple Vorbis channels losslessly, that is, construct a stereo coupling encoding that both saves space but also decodes bit-identically to dual stereo. OggEnc 1.0 and later uses this mode in all high-bitrate encoding.
<dneighbo> Overall, this stereo mode is overkill; however, it offers a safe alternative to users concerned about the slightest possible degredation to the stereo image or archival quality audio.

<chillywilly> lol

<chillywilly> er, fight club

<nickr> Its based on a lot of true things, which is the scary part

<chillywilly> the scary thing is how he gets so many followers who he leads like sheep, imho
<chillywilly> this reminded me of hitler or something like that
<chillywilly> people really are this desparate to "belong" to something
<chillywilly> I dunno that movie had some really deep philosphical overtones
<nickr> I think his motives were essentially good, though
<chillywilly> it was pretty cool
<nickr> if not his methods
<chillywilly> I should watch it again
<nickr> yea
<nickr> its much better thes second time
<nickr> cause you see tyler very early on many times
<ajmitch> ok
<chillywilly> tell you the truth at first viewing, until the little twist came in, I wasn't really diggin it all that much
<nickr> Heh.
<nickr> I dug it even the first viewing
<ajmitch> nickr: got any hints on how i should do gnue-common? ;)
<chillywilly> well tyler was just a jag and seemed to be picking on eddy norton too much for my tastes...but I'm a softie
<nickr> ajmitch: well it'll involve several chickens.
<ajmitch> nickr: ooh, sounds fun
<chillywilly> and the removing of their heads
<chillywilly> the slatterning of chicken blood
<chillywilly> and voodoo curses
<chillywilly> rituals even
<nickr> ajmitch: lets see, theres a certain argument that you pass to setup.py that'll make a directory the 'fake /'
<nickr> ajmitch: so do that with a temp directory, then move all the files in there to their right spots
<ajmitch> nickr: yup, caught that, i'm just wondering about all the db dirvers
<nickr> oh
<nickr> iirc they aren't 'required' at build time
<chillywilly> nickr: btw, how's life treating you?
<nickr> if thats the case, make them recommended, and let it pick them up automatically
<nickr> chillywilly: pretty good
Action: ajmitch could try for record package counts & split each into a separate package :)
<nickr> ajmitch: yea, I'd recommend against that
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> go for it man!
<nickr> ajmitch: because its all runtime, not compile time, I thikn
<ajmitch> nickr: it'd be a pain to have a package with a single .py file in it :)
<ajmitch> certainly
