<siesel> hi ariel_
<ariel_> hi
<ariel_> siesel: do you want that i put the trigger stuff in the digrams or is it a temporary hack 
<ariel_> that will eventually disappear?
<siesel> I think that GTrigger will stay, its likely to change a bit. (like much of the rest of appserver) 
<siesel> The only thing which is really a hack is, a) the way triggers are called, and the way methods are implemented (methods are using triggers at the moment)
<ariel_> that's ok, for i need only the signature of a method and not the implementation.
<siesel> Arturas: I fount out that a wxFONTENCODING_UTF8 exists in the source code of wxwindows. I just don't know if wxpython support it. (the only place to find it in documentation is: http://biolpc22.york.ac.uk/wx/docs/html/wx/wx159.htm#wxfont .

<jbailey> good 'nug

<chillywilly> nah
<chillywilly> gett he XFS netinst CD
<chillywilly> get the
<chillywilly> er, iso that is
<chillywilly> 30MB in size with the newer installer and XFS file system support
<chillywilly> 2.4.x kernel
<ajmitch> why would he want to use xfs?
<stbain> yah, what if I'm an ext3 freak
<jbailey> Especially with Reiser is the Path To Rightness. =)
<ajmitch> on a production box? :)
<jbailey> Sure.  I know lots of people using Reiser on mail servers and what not.
<jbailey> It minimizes craziness.
<jbailey> At least compare to xfs, reiser made it into the kernel. =)
<chillywilly> http://people.debian.org/~blade/XFS-Install/download/bootbf2.4-xfs.iso
<ajmitch> xfs has it's own vfs layer, right? :)
<chillywilly> xfs rocks, I don't care if it is in the kernel or not
<rdean> my observation on xfs vs. ReiserFS is that XFS will occasionally gobble up CPU cycles (journaling activity?) and lead to lack of UI responsiveness...
<rdean> ReiserFS doesn't appear prone to that (my experiences are that when I install ReiserFS, the UI is less prone to fits of unresponsiveness)
<jbailey> My observation is that yelling "XFS Sucks" in a channel with chillywilly in it tends to get him going. =)
<rdean> OTOH, if you've got a server, XFS rules
<chillywilly> my ui is nice and snappy, but I alos have a little extra help with that in the preemption patch
<ajmitch> jbailey: yes, that's true ;)
<chillywilly> heh, yea I also find this sooo truuuuue.....not!
Action: ajmitch uses ext3 on all partitions but one
<jbailey> ajmitch: The one with vfat? =)
Action: rdean tried ext3 and didn't like what it did to my system
<jbailey> or is it the swap partition?
<ajmitch> the reiserfs /opt :)
<ajmitch> ah yeah, i have a 500MB swap partition also
<jbailey> I use ext3 because it took awhile to get angie out of the habit of hitting the reset button when the system froze.
<chillywilly> reiser might be a bit better...you can probably find  nice netinst iso containing all 3 of those journaling file systems
<jbailey> And I'm too lazy to reformat.
Action: rdean is too lazy to do an upgrade
<ajmitch> that was the main reason for me using ext3
Action: rdean wipes and reinstalls
<stbain> wow... the debian website sux0rs
<jbailey> When Debian's installer supports reiserfs (it might now, but who the heck ever reinstalls debian? *g*) I'll probably setup my boxes with it.
<stbain> that XFS netinst image is coming down at a whopping 4.6K/s

Action: rdean doesn't have enough production "data" built up in Linux yet to warrant saving...easier to wipe and reinstall.  The benefit was that I've been able to try all the filesystems (even tried JFS, but that was when it was still buggy (don't know if that's still true or not)

<stbain> I'm trying a jigdo woody image
<stbain> iso image 1
<stbain> for some reason its pulling some non-us stuff
<stbain> is that normal?

<jbailey> --> mdean (~mdean@mkc-65-28-72-183.kc.rr.com) has joined #gnuenterprise
<jbailey> <ajmitch> mdean!
<jbailey> <ajmitch> is it truly you?
<jbailey> That's funny!
<chillywilly> stbain: yea, that's just software that was hindered byt he US encryption laws...I don't think it is really relevant anymore (the law that is)
<ajmitch> hehe
<stbain> ok
<stbain> jigdo a good option? that netinst download was taking forever
<chillywilly> jigdo will give you a big ass iso image
<jbailey> Isn't there a netinst jigdo option?
<stbain> and save me some download time later once I start the install?
<chillywilly> possibly...
<chillywilly> yea
<dneighbo> jbailey: im going to post your debs
<jbailey> Ah, I take it they're good enough then?
<dneighbo> honestly i havent tested yet :)
<dneighbo> i think perhaps i should no
<jbailey> Yeah, probably.
<dneighbo> btw: let me point you to two bugs submitted on the old ones to see if you addressed in yours
<jbailey> Sure.
<dneighbo> http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=574322&group_id=1424&atid=101424
<dneighbo> http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=574321&group_id=1424&atid=101424
<jbailey> Those bugs don't apply because I don't automatically setup the database. =)
<dneighbo> ok
<jbailey> I want feedback first whether the basic setup is right before I start coding in extra stuff like that.
<dneighbo> guess mike isnt really here
Action: dneighbo goes to test that deb
<ajmitch> dneighbo: he was before
<jbailey> Can you email me any feedback?  I'm headed home pretty soon.
<dneighbo> jbailey: 
<dneighbo> latitude:/home/dneighbo/downloads# dpkg --install dcl_20020705-pre1_all.deb 
<dneighbo> Selecting previously deselected package dcl.
<dneighbo> (Reading database ... 49970 files and directories currently installed.)
<dneighbo> Unpacking dcl (from dcl_20020705-pre1_all.deb) ...
<dneighbo> dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of dcl:
<dneighbo>  dcl depends on wwwconfig-common (>= 0.0.4-1); however:
<dneighbo>   Package wwwconfig-common is not installed.
<dneighbo> dpkg: error processing dcl (--install):
<dneighbo>  dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
<dneighbo> Errors were encountered while processing:
<dneighbo>  dcl
<dneighbo> latitude:/home/dneighbo/downloads# 
<ajmitch> that's why you use apt-get to install :)
<dneighbo> shouldn't it try to download this depend
<dneighbo> ok so its becasue using dpkg
<ajmitch> yeah
<jbailey> Yeah.  I thought of removing that dep, but I'll use it when I start putting in the automatic-virutal-host-creation stuff.
<ajmitch> jbailey: so does your deb setup the database?
<jbailey> no, not at all.
<jbailey> There's a whole lot of work I'll have to do with debconf to do that right.
<ajmitch> alright
<ajmitch> then i won't complain about it not doing so :)
<jbailey> If derek says that this is 'good enough' then I'll upload it to Debian.
<jbailey> and slowly add features and such.
<ajmitch> ok then
ToyMan (~stuq@c5300-1-ip178.albany.thebiz.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<dneighbo> um where is the config file
<dneighbo> its looking good right now, but i cant find the config file
<dneighbo> i got db installed and such
<jbailey>  /etc/dcl/
<dneighbo> found 
<dneighbo> deb seems to work for me get it in sid :)
<dneighbo> we should work on it configuring the db
<dneighbo> i.e.
<dneighbo> dcl
<dneighbo> dcl-pgsql
<jbailey> The debconf page will give you the choice of what database (with some sanity checks, like needing the libraries installed)

<ajmitch> hi jcater
<jcater> hi
<ajmitch> hmm designer doesn't start
<jcater> grrr
Action: ajmitch does cvs up
<ajmitch> i could have caught a cvs copy between commits
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> what's the error
<jcater> maybe I forgot to cvs add a file
<jcater> as it comes up here
<ajmitch> DB000:     GDebug.printMesg(2,"%s.%s doesn't appear to be a valid wizard" % (package.__name, base))

<ajmitch> but you've committed since then
<jcater> oh, yeah
<jcater> that's old
<ajmitch> master/detail wizard died on me yesterday, i'll see if it does today
<ajmitch> i've got to figure out that stuff too
<ajmitch> eg i have a customer table, a cnotes table, & a notes table here
<ajmitch> where cnotes has id from the other two tables (associative entity)
<jcater> shared notes?
<ajmitch> something like that i think
Action: ajmitch didn't do the db :)
<ajmitch> appears to have worked today
<ajmitch> (the wizard, on another pair of tables)
jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)

<ajmitch> designer is turning out quite well, you're doing a good job :)
<jcater> just wait
<jcater> in a week or so, you will see some major improvements
<ajmitch> excellent
Action: jcater is using designer for a big project at the moment
<ajmitch> ah
<jcater> so I'm having to deal with all it's oddities
<jcater> and if I have to deal with an oddity more than two or three times, 
<ajmitch> navigator doesn't currently get forms from the current dir, does it?
<jcater> I get p*ssed off
<ajmitch> understandable
<jcater> no
<ajmitch> ok, am wondering if i should let it do that
<jcater> but since I'm the main designer coder, if I get p'd off, then I end up fixing it :)
<ajmitch> it seems like each UI driver in navigator has form loading code
<jcater> yeah
Action: jcater wouldn't really recommend anything but the UIwxpython right now
<jcater> the others need to be subclassed from it
<ajmitch> it's what i'm using
<ajmitch> hmm, how to do master-detail when there's a many-many relationship?
<jcater> egads
<jcater> are you trying to make me think or something?
<jcater> :)
<ajmitch> my apologies, it must be late there :)
<ajmitch> then again, it's friday night here
Action: jcater has spent last 6 hrs filling a moving truck
<ajmitch> ugh
<jcater> yip
<jcater> that describes how I feel
<ajmitch> now i have to try & figure out labels from cryptic field names
<ajmitch> hmm, from a describe statement:
<ajmitch> | status   | enum('open','posted','printed','emailed') |
<jcater> um
<jcater> yuck
<ajmitch> will have to limit combo box to those, i guess :)
Action: ajmitch is building forms from a very simple web-based accounting system
<jcater> which one?
<ajmitch> custom one written by boss which only he uses :)
<jcater> lol
<ajmitch> this is mainly just a way for me to learn forms & designer
<ajmitch> oh dear, now this is a screwup
<ajmitch> customer.id is numbered starting at 10000, invoice.cid is numbered from 0, the php code must mangle that before a query
<ajmitch> how ugly
<ajmitch> perhaps not
Action: ajmitch takes a blunt object to the database

<siesel> morning
<siesel> psu: thanks for you great work
Action: siesel is reading KC GNUe #37 
<psu> thanks
<psu> not sure how many name checks I gave you this time ;-)
<psu> ajmitch got several
<jcater> psu: as always, thanks for doing the GNUe KC
<jcater> I'd like to make one coment re: 5. Security release of DCL
<jcater> s/coment/comment
Action: jcater thinks that statements like dneighbo's should be qualified
<psu> i did wonder about that
<jcater> i.e., "It is HIGHLY suggested that you update." --> "..if you run DCL on an untrusted network"
<jcater> as I hate scare tactics like that
Action: jcater imagines we are one of the only ppl running a "public" dcl instance
<jcater> s/only/few
<psu> I assume the exploits discovered are theoretical rather than actual?
Action: ajmitch was just on phone
<jcater> yes
<ajmitch> hi siesel
<ajmitch> psu: yeah, i do tend to talk a bit on irc :)
<jcater> but it's just like that NOLA notice last week
Action: ajmitch needs to code more, talk less
<jcater> if you are running on an untrusted network, then the package has issues
<ajmitch> yes
<jcater> but of course the question then has to be raised, why are you running it on an untrusted network??
<jcater> but that's just my $0.02
<ajmitch> stupidity? :)
<jcater> oh, also
<jcater> well, you know
<jcater> I don't mean to sound elitist or anything
<jcater> but, seriously
<jcater> the first question my accounting ppl at work always ask is
<jcater> can anyone access their systems
<jcater> and we are a small company
<jcater> if someone's installing an accounting package for someone
<jcater> and makes it publicly accessible
<jcater> well, they better either be a well-intentioned family member
<jcater> or fired one
<jcater> ok, I'll stop ranting
<jcater> about security
<jcater> I would like to make one comment regarding CVS designer
<jcater> (that maybe psu could put in the next KC)
<jcater> The cvs version of designer is undergoing some needed restructuring... if cvs is broken and you are relying on cvs designer to get your work done, then you might want to tag your gnue/designer module as the 0.3.x branch
<psu> duly noted
<jcater> That branch is only for bug-fixes
<jcater> the outcome will be worth the frustration.
<jcater> thanks
Action: jcater took great care not to get any typos in that statement :)
Action: ajmitch will probably still play with cvs designer, but keep an old copy around :)
<jcater> that would be advisable
Action: jcater tries not to break designer when he commits
<jcater> but sometimes they slip by me
<ajmitch> i'll try & catch bugs
<ajmitch> and staple them to the wall until you've fixed them
Action: siesel likes searching typos ;)
<jcater> lol

<jamest> um
<StyXman> hi jcater 
<jamest> i'm so out of the loop
<jamest> i wouldn't know
<StyXman> oh, ack, I'll ping jcater 
<jamest> jcater?
<StyXman> hey, jcater, do you know about scrollbars?
<StyXman> there's a rumor here that they're working...
<jcater> somewhat
<jamest> I thought you were loafing around this weekend and wouldn't be back till monday.
<jcater> they were introduced many decades ago
<jcater> as a graphical element for "modern" guis
<jcater> oh, our scrollbars
<jcater> I haven't touched them
<jamest> introduced is a really crappy word
<jcater> jamest: I am loafing around :)
<jamest> i added a <tag> and code to create the widget
<jamest> and that is all
<jamest> i thought someone else worked on making them do something
Action: jcater too
<StyXman> ah, so they had not changed
<jcater> but don't recall any details
<jcater> I don't use them
<jamest> someone was doing something somewhere
<jcater> so wouldn't know
<StyXman> I have some ideas, wanna hear them?
<jamest> I have 0 time right now, my mail system is partially fried, !@#!@# sysadmin is changing the system over live this morning
<jcater> I'm not really here today
<StyXman> :)
<StyXman> ok, I'll hack it here, and when it's done, we'll talk about it.
<jamest> sorry man
<jamest> someone needs to come up with a way to hook one's brain to several bodies
<jamest> as I swear I'll never do everything in life I want to do
<Arturas> i have found that in common/src/FormatMasks we have at least 3 files (DateMask.py, NumberMask.py, TextMask.py) that each of them defines things like monthNames, weekdayNames over and over - wouldn't it be simplier to define all them once in BaseMask.py?
<jcater> Arturas: I would stay out of those files
<jcater> as you are wasting your time
<StyXman> jcater: is that a threat? :)
<jcater> NumberMask and TextMask aren't even implemented
<jcater> so the code you see there is
<jcater> a cut and paste from DateMask

<StyXman> say I want to make scrollbars have some functionality. should I implement it @ uidriver level, or @ gfobject (in fact, gfscrollbar)?
Action: Arturas sometimes hates those differences in time.... a whole day.... :/
<Arturas> jcater: thanks :)
Action: jcater would imagine gfscrollbar, with any wx-specific stuff in uidriver
<StyXman> are events and triggers the same? I'm a little confused...
<jamest> there should already be a gfscrollbar file IIRC
<StyXman> jamest: yes, it is, but is a litlle... uh, spartan :)
<StyXman> I mean, I see code like this in a form's trigger:
<StyXman>       self._object.dispatchEvent(GFEvent('requestCOMMIT'))
<StyXman> and things like this in GF files:
<StyXman>     self._triggerFunctions={'allowedValues':{'function':self.allowedValues,},
<StyXman> are they 'connected'?
<jamest> events == events internal to forms - 
<jamest>   button clicks, requests for next record, etc, etc
<jamest> triggers == chunks of code that are attached to certain "trigger events" that are specified in the gfd, grd, etc files
<jamest>   pre-commit, pre-update, etc, etc
<StyXman> aha, but how are events handled by gfobjects? hacking the dispatchEvent function?
<jamest> objects registers with other objects to listen to events
<jamest> via a registerListener functoin IIRC
<jamest> trigger events are hard coded into the program
<StyXman> no, I need new 'events' on gfscrollbar...
<StyXman> (I think)
<jamest> so that a internal requestNEXTRECORD event would make the form attempt to switch to the next record
<StyXman> like 'scrollUp' event, which should do something..
<jamest> part of that switching logic fires triggers like pre-focusout, pre-focusin, etc, etc
<jamest> oooo
<jamest> there is a dictionary of events in the objects that listen for them
<jamest> you can look at either GFForm or GFInstance for example 
Action: jamest can't recall off top of head which file has them
<jamest> you create a entry that maps an event to a specifc handler function
<jamest> and that's it
<jamest> i have to run for a bit

ge (~george@207.245.39.226) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> as far as i understand 'strftime' function gives date\time string formatted  according to locale settings
<Arturas> but do i need localized SQL queries for database?
<Arturas> i guess it shouldn't be there
<Arturas> function 'strptime' should be used
<Arturas> (if no one says anything against, i'll correct it and commit into cvs in about an hour)
<ge> hi, i am touching gnu enterprise since yesterday. but i don't how to build up the application. could any guru tell me more?

<Arturas> ge: Geas: i'm afraid i don't know this
<ge> geas is an app. server
<ge> i think it is neccessary if i want to run in 3-tier infrastructure
<ge> how can use the financial package, any thread?
<ge> actually, i can't find the pachage for download
<jamest> hi george
<ge> hi jamest
<jamest> the financial package doesn't exist yet

<jamest> ge: no user ready packages have been released
<jamest> the tools are getting most the focus at this time
<jamest> a lot of planning has been done on packages for the old GEAS
<StyXman> so, how do I bind a function to a event? thru a eventHandler?
<jamest> and I think someone was looking at making the new app server work with them, if it doesn't do so all ready
<jamest> StyXman: in GFInstance.py
<jamest>     # Incoming events
<jamest>     self.registerEventListeners( {
<jamest>                            # Datasource trigger events
<jamest> is example of binding GFInstance functions to events
<StyXman> so, if I want gfsb to have events, I just write the functions that handle the events and then register them to listen to the new events? events are global?
<jamest> events are only passed to objects that request to listen to events
<jamest> so not really global
<StyXman> yeah, but I mean 'global' in the sense that anyone can listen to certain event...
<StyXman> or I'm misunderstandin what events are for. I what the UIsb to call the GFsb's 'event' handler...
<jcater> so UI* doesn't have to know about GF* internals, and vice versa
<StyXman> jcater: uh?
<jcater> yes?
<StyXman> I don't parse your comment...
<jcater> err

jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<StyXman> say, which is the difference between calling self._eventHandler and dispatchEvent?
<jamest> you wnat to use dispatchEvent
<jamest> 99.9% of the time
<jamest> that sends the event to the objects that have registered to listen to it
<StyXman> but most of the examples use the other one...
<StyXman> aha, but the other does not?
<jamest> huh?
<StyXman> calling eventHandler...
<jamest> sigh, maybe someone changed something
<jamest> IIRC _eventHandler was a dictionary right?
Action: jamest doesn't have time to dig into code
<StyXman> jamest: wx/uidriver.py:710
<StyXman> there's the wxbuttons event handler...
<StyXman> it calls eventhandler

Action: jcater is back (gone 01:32:47)

<jamest> I'm pretty sure you'd want to use dispatchEvent to send the actual events

<dneighbo> i.e. say i have 5 products
<dneighbo> myfoo, yourfoo, ourfoo, thefoo, somefoo

<jbailey> symlink them.
Action: chillywilly troutslaps dneighbo *hard*
<dneighbo> it is used by myfoo and yourfoo
<jbailey> Or use a library.
<dneighbo> ok thats what i was thinking
jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jbailey> a library is better.
<dneighbo> well gut reaction was code right
<jbailey> Since that's the Right Thing in all cases.
<dneighbo> and make it a library silly
<jbailey> but a symlink works.
<dneighbo> but say this is legacy
<dneighbo> how do you symlink in cvs?
<dneighbo> i.e. how does that work
<dneighbo> is it a file system symlink on the repository side
<dneighbo> or is a cvs symlink
<jbailey> you haave to go into the repository and symlink in the filesystem
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> then if someone cheecks out foo.c from myfoo
<dneighbo> and commits it
<dneighbo> the other 4 projects repositories auto get updated?
<dneighbo> if they are symlinked
<dneighbo> and then one of them can do the same?
<jbailey> yes
<ajmitch> sounds ugly
<jbailey> it is
<jbailey> it's certainly the wrong thing.
<jbailey> But it works, and people like it. =)
<dneighbo> well lots of people have done bad design
<dneighbo> so im sure this fellow isnt the first to have to address the problem :)
<chillywilly> say you are *hypothetically* doing an xml markup of an object description language
<chillywilly> and you wanted tp specify operation parameters
<chillywilly> what would yo do
<dneighbo> that would be dumb who would do that
<chillywilly> ths way: parameter name="element" mode="in" type="Object"/>
<chillywilly> er, <parameter
<chillywilly> or
<chillywilly> <paramater mode="in" type="Object">element</parameter>

<Chipaca> chillywilly: I dunno what 'parameter' is, but I'd probably have it more entity-oriented (less attributes)
<Chipaca> chillywilly: but i dunno what parameter is, so I'm probably off base
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> it is a paramter to an operation call of an object
<Chipaca> perlhead here says he's getting russian fonts instead of iso8859-1 in gnue, why can that be?
<chillywilly> <operation name="insert_element" result="void">
<chillywilly>   <parameters>
<chillywilly>     <parameter name="element" mode="in" type="Object"/>
<ajmitch> Chipaca: maybe arturas' latest changes to forms
<chillywilly>     <!-- Perhaps parameters should be in this format?
<chillywilly>     <paramater mode="in" type="Object">element</parameter>
<chillywilly>     -->
<chillywilly>   </paramaters>
<chillywilly> </operation>
<chillywilly> or, void insert_element(in Object element);
<chillywilly> so Chipaca you would make them tags with content like:
<chillywilly> <operation>
<chillywilly>   <name>insert_element</name>
<chillywilly> ...
<chillywilly> less attributes...
<Chipaca> yes, my xml tends to be more like that

<ajmitch> hey siesl
<ajmitch> how's phpforms coming along?
<siesel> hi ajmitch
<ajmitch> it's been decided that appserver probably isn't necessary for the accounting app i'm helping with, since it's for small businesses
<ajmitch> a web forms client may be tho :)
<siesel> I hope to bring phpforms to a stable state soon, but there are too many small problems, and I don't have a good debugger :(
<ajmitch> ok
<siesel> and after using python I don't like PHP anymore ;)
Action: ajmitch would really prefer a python implementation, like madlocke's webware client :)
<ajmitch> i'd imagine handling python triggers in php would have been fun
<siesel> this is the reason for using phpforms with appserver, so triggers can be moved into appserver

<sledge_> thx
<sledge_> i just found a bug in pgsql.xsl in gnue cvs
<siesel> oh, which bug?
<sledge_> all scripts make a match="/", pgsql.xsl has match="/schema"
<sledge_> which is wrong when you try it with dcl.xml
<sledge_> i removed it and it worked
<sledge_> all others worked before
<siesel> yes, because pgsql.xsl is the only one which supports the new GNUe schema file format ( *.GSD )
<sledge_> so it is a new feature that the others haven't, not a bug?
<siesel> yep. and pgsql.xsl is the only one which can create insert statemenets out of the <data> part of an .GSD
<sledge_> ah
<sledge_> great
<siesel> i think i should remove dcl.xml or convert it to dcl.gsd
<sledge_> is gsd already defined / is there doc?
<siesel> there is DTD in designer/src/schema
<siesel> and you can create it with designer
<sledge_> ok
<sledge_> but i can safely assume that the old format can simply be converted to the new one by wrapping everything in <schema>?
<siesel> yes
<sledge_> wtf is a constraint?
<sledge_> (sorry for the stupid question)
<siesel> constrains = NOT NULL, UNIQUE, ...

<dneighbo> chillywilly: you here? oh cvs master
<chillywilly> yes I am here
<dneighbo> can you answer this
<dneighbo> After importing a project into the CVS repository, the CVS directory in my 
<dneighbo> working directory was not created.  The work directory was in my home 
<dneighbo> directory.
<dneighbo> Is there a permissions issue where the CVS server cannot write to my home 
<dneighbo> directory?
<dneighbo> According to Webmin, the box does not have a cvs user (not a user that uses 
<dneighbo> cvs but a user for the cvs server).  Does it need one?
<chillywilly> I thought you just need to setup 'writers' file
<chillywilly> in the CVSROOT module
<chillywilly> you have to remove the original source tree ans then check it out according to the docs
<chillywilly> or mv it out of the way if you are paranoid ;)
<chillywilly> ah but you do want to have proper perms on the repository
<chillywilly> I think I have a cvs group
<chillywilly> for my personal repository
<chillywilly> perms are owner=root, group=cvs dirs are chmod 775 files are chmod 664

<chillywilly> lemme know if this helps
<dneighbo> will do its for a lug person here
<chillywilly> i.e, it won't create the CVS dir until you check it out...which requires pulling a fresh copy

<ajmitch> hi dneighbo
<chillywilly> ello derek
<dneighbo> anyone know if there is an open office channel?
<dneighbo> or is anyone running an open office not from debian packaging?
<dneighbo> as there is missing feature from star office i cant live w/o 
<ajmitch> i've got OO.o here
Action: chillywilly installed form tar ball
<dneighbo> and i could have sworn it existed in OO 1.0
<chillywilly> from
<ajmitch> what is it?
<dneighbo> can one you open up impress (power point)
<dneighbo> and create a new slide show create two slides
<ajmitch> yeah, give me 15min for it to open
<dneighbo> and then go to
<dneighbo> Slide Show
<chillywilly> ajmitch: hehe
<dneighbo> and tell me if you have a 'custom slideshow' as an option under that menu?
<dneighbo> it used to be there and the DOCUMENTATION says it should be there
<dneighbo> but it aint there :(
<dneighbo> i will drop the debs and go to binaries if i can verify the binaries have it
<ajmitch> still waiting for splash screen to go away & app to appear
<dneighbo> darn you running that on a palm or what?
<dneighbo> even my p233 64mb is quicker than that
<dneighbo> have you considered trying fluxbox?
<dneighbo> for desktop? it will improve the speed of your applications considerably (or at least it did for me)
<ajmitch> compiling
<ajmitch> that functionality does exist here
<ajmitch> my computer is not much faster than a p233 :)
<ajmitch> as in, i can create a custom slideshow
<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> did you get it with debian packages?
<dneighbo> or from openoffice tar ball
<dneighbo> er binary
<ajmitch> binary tarball
<dneighbo> im downloading the openoffice binary from the site
<dneighbo> ok cool (me was having minor panic)
<dneighbo> as that feature ROCKS for church worship :)
<dneighbo> i can have one powerpoint file that has all the songs
<dneighbo> then just select the ones for a particular service as a custom show
<ajmitch> have been asked to deb-package GNUe tools, so will try & do that as i fugre out how
<ajmitch> excelltn
<dneighbo> the old power point people were like NO WAY (as i guess office powerpoint doesnt do this)
Action: ajmitch must need new keyboard - typing sucks
<dneighbo> so they would number every slide to every song and maintain a db of them
<dneighbo> then write down the numbers for a song set on paper
<ajmitch> ah, this way is much better?
<dneighbo> and use the 'go to' slide feature
<dneighbo> i.e. key in the number of the slide
<ajmitch> that way sucks :)
<dneighbo> why do you think im freaking that the deb packages dont have custom slide show :)
<dneighbo> sigh my connection is getting slower
<dneighbo> took almost 2 minutes for open office to download this time :(
Action: dneighbo forgets we have some dial up folks here, i shouldnt be saying that
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> there is a branch for 0.3.0, right?
<dneighbo> yes
Action: ajmitch wonders what to number cvs packages as
<dneighbo> im the maintainer of that, but havent done anything with it :)
<ajmitch> 0.3.0.$DATE ?
<dneighbo> please do package 0.3.0
<dneighbo> as 0.3.0
<ajmitch> ah ok, will just take 0.3.0
<dneighbo> then if you its easy we can do a -cvs (no?)
<dneighbo> and update it regularly
<ajmitch> yes, that's what i'd do
<ajmitch> where regularly == nightly cron build if possible :)
<ajmitch> don't think i can simply do that with python packages
jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<ajmitch> will need to touch up documentation on branch to reflect new binary names :)
<dneighbo> ajmitch: certainly we could do that if the debian packaging can support it
<ajmitch> will try, need to fuind out how to package distutils stuff (nickr said some of it wasn't nice)

<dneighbo> its so beautiful to see this as the EULA
<chillywilly> what dialup folks?
<dneighbo> in a product that IMHO is better than MS office :)
<ajmitch> dneighbo: it's not an EULA tho :)
<dneighbo> ajmitch: true dat
<dneighbo> i mean so nice to see this wehre the EULA normally is
<ajmitch> yeah, is much better
<ajmitch> you can click 'accept' with a clear conscience :)
<ajmitch> hmm, need to get up at 5:30am again
<dneighbo> ajmitch: its bad for your health to rise that early
<dneighbo> early to bed early to wise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise
<ajmitch> dneighbo: i know, but there's another dotgnu meet on
<dneighbo> is well a wives tale (i.e. only a wife would think of it)
<ajmitch> hehe
<dneighbo> hey i think this openoffice is broken
<dneighbo> it cant be good
<dneighbo> it doesnt want me to rebbot
<dneighbo> oh crap i forgot
<chillywilly> reboot?
<dneighbo> GNU\Linux is winning BIG time
<dneighbo> i was at softball
<dneighbo> lets say the guys on our team cant spell computer much less literate with one
<chillywilly> you play softball?
<dneighbo> one of the guys gets a call from his girlfriend
<dneighbo> and he asks one of the other guys, do you know if linux is any good
<ajmitch> hmm, my uptime isn't too bad here for my main desktop box
<dneighbo> im like (did you say linux?) (this is not type of guy i would expect to know what windows is, much less linux)
<dneighbo> he said yeah, you know what it is
<dneighbo> i said yeah
<dneighbo> he said is it good
<dneighbo> i said, yeah it kicks crap out of windows
<dneighbo> then i had to go to bat
<dneighbo> came back and asked him why he wanted to know
