<ajmitch> hi

<siesel> hi
<ajmitch> hey siesl
<ajmitch> how's phpforms coming along?
<siesel> hi ajmitch
<ajmitch> it's been decided that appserver probably isn't necessary for the accounting app i'm helping with, since it's for small businesses
<ajmitch> a web forms client may be tho :)
<siesel> I hope to bring phpforms to a stable state soon, but there are too many small problems, and I don't have a good debugger :(
<ajmitch> ok
<siesel> and after using python I don't like PHP anymore ;)
Action: ajmitch would really prefer a python implementation, like madlocke's webware client :)
<ajmitch> i'd imagine handling python triggers in php would have been fun
<siesel> this is the reason for using phpforms with appserver, so triggers can be moved into appserver
<ajmitch> yes, understandable
Action: ajmitch is currently learning forms

<sledge_> hi
<sledge_> anyone of you familiar with xml2sql?
<ajmitch> not i, sledge_
<ajmitch> perhaps siesel :)
<ajmitch> hi, btw
<sledge_> do we have a list of other free ERP projects?
<siesel> sledge: xml2sql: yes
<siesel> you should have a look in appserver/samples/Makefile
<sledge_> thx
<sledge_> i just found a bug in pgsql.xsl in gnue cvs
<siesel> oh, which bug?
<sledge_> all scripts make a match="/", pgsql.xsl has match="/schema"
<sledge_> which is wrong when you try it with dcl.xml
<sledge_> i removed it and it worked
<sledge_> all others worked before
<siesel> yes, because pgsql.xsl is the only one which supports the new GNUe schema file format ( *.GSD )
<sledge_> so it is a new feature that the others haven't, not a bug?
<siesel> yep. and pgsql.xsl is the only one which can create insert statemenets out of the <data> part of an .GSD
<sledge_> ah
<sledge_> great
<siesel> i think i should remove dcl.xml or convert it to dcl.gsd
<sledge_> is gsd already defined / is there doc?
<siesel> there is DTD in designer/src/schema
<siesel> and you can create it with designer
<sledge_> ok
<sledge_> but i can safely assume that the old format can simply be converted to the new one by wrapping everything in <schema>?
<siesel> yes
<sledge_> wtf is a constraint?
<sledge_> (sorry for the stupid question)
<siesel> constrains = NOT NULL, UNIQUE, ...
<sledge_> ah, okay
<siesel> a foreign key is an constrain too. (also I don't know how to write a constraint in the .GSD format :(
jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<sledge_> doesn't matter
<sledge_> i just want to look a bit through :)
Action: ajmitch wonders how to use the FK properties of a form widget :)
<sledge_> siesel: perhaps you have use for it :)
Action: ajmitch ought to print out the techref.lyx & userguide.lyx for forms
<sledge_> does techref.lyx contain information on gsd?
<siesel> ajmitch: you can use fk_... to fill a dropdown entry.
<siesel> sledge_: no, but if you want the ultimate information you should ask derek, because he has written it (if I'm right informed ) :)
<ajmitch> siesel: that's *exactly* what i want
<sledge_> okay

<dneighbo> chillywilly: you here? oh cvs master
<chillywilly> yes I am here
<dneighbo> can you answer this
<dneighbo> After importing a project into the CVS repository, the CVS directory in my 
<dneighbo> working directory was not created.  The work directory was in my home 
<dneighbo> directory.
<dneighbo> Is there a permissions issue where the CVS server cannot write to my home 
<dneighbo> directory?
<dneighbo> According to Webmin, the box does not have a cvs user (not a user that uses 
<dneighbo> cvs but a user for the cvs server).  Does it need one?
<chillywilly> I thought you just need to setup 'writers' file
<chillywilly> in the CVSROOT module
<chillywilly> you have to remove the original source tree ans then check it out according to the docs
<chillywilly> or mv it out of the way if you are paranoid ;)
<chillywilly> ah but you do want to have proper perms on the repository
<chillywilly> I think I have a cvs group
<chillywilly> for my personal repository
<chillywilly> perms are owner=root, group=cvs dirs are chmod 775 files are chmod 664

<chillywilly> lemme know if this helps

<chillywilly> i.e, it won't create the CVS dir until you check it out...which requires pulling a fresh copy

<ajmitch> hi dneighbo
<chillywilly> ello derek
<dneighbo> anyone know if there is an open office channel?
<dneighbo> or is anyone running an open office not from debian packaging?
<dneighbo> as there is missing feature from star office i cant live w/o 
<ajmitch> i've got OO.o here
Action: chillywilly installed form tar ball
<dneighbo> and i could have sworn it existed in OO 1.0
<chillywilly> from
<ajmitch> what is it?
<dneighbo> can one you open up impress (power point)
<dneighbo> and create a new slide show create two slides
<ajmitch> yeah, give me 15min for it to open
<dneighbo> and then go to
<dneighbo> Slide Show
<chillywilly> ajmitch: hehe
<dneighbo> and tell me if you have a 'custom slideshow' as an option under that menu?
<dneighbo> it used to be there and the DOCUMENTATION says it should be there
<dneighbo> but it aint there :(
<dneighbo> i will drop the debs and go to binaries if i can verify the binaries have it
<ajmitch> still waiting for splash screen to go away & app to appear
<dneighbo> darn you running that on a palm or what?
<dneighbo> even my p233 64mb is quicker than that
<dneighbo> have you considered trying fluxbox?
<dneighbo> for desktop? it will improve the speed of your applications considerably (or at least it did for me)
<ajmitch> compiling
<ajmitch> that functionality does exist here
<ajmitch> my computer is not much faster than a p233 :)
<ajmitch> as in, i can create a custom slideshow
<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> did you get it with debian packages?
<dneighbo> or from openoffice tar ball
<dneighbo> er binary
<ajmitch> binary tarball
<dneighbo> im downloading the openoffice binary from the site
<dneighbo> ok cool (me was having minor panic)
<dneighbo> as that feature ROCKS for church worship :)
<dneighbo> i can have one powerpoint file that has all the songs
<dneighbo> then just select the ones for a particular service as a custom show
<ajmitch> have been asked to deb-package GNUe tools, so will try & do that as i fugre out how
<ajmitch> excelltn
<dneighbo> the old power point people were like NO WAY (as i guess office powerpoint doesnt do this)
Action: ajmitch must need new keyboard - typing sucks
<dneighbo> so they would number every slide to every song and maintain a db of them
<dneighbo> then write down the numbers for a song set on paper
<ajmitch> ah, this way is much better?
<dneighbo> and use the 'go to' slide feature
<dneighbo> i.e. key in the number of the slide
<ajmitch> that way sucks :)
<dneighbo> why do you think im freaking that the deb packages dont have custom slide show :)
<dneighbo> sigh my connection is getting slower
<dneighbo> took almost 2 minutes for open office to download this time :(
Action: dneighbo forgets we have some dial up folks here, i shouldnt be saying that
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> there is a branch for 0.3.0, right?
<dneighbo> yes
Action: ajmitch wonders what to number cvs packages as
<dneighbo> im the maintainer of that, but havent done anything with it :)
<ajmitch> 0.3.0.$DATE ?
<dneighbo> please do package 0.3.0
<dneighbo> as 0.3.0
<ajmitch> ah ok, will just take 0.3.0
<dneighbo> then if you its easy we can do a -cvs (no?)
<dneighbo> and update it regularly
<ajmitch> yes, that's what i'd do
<ajmitch> where regularly == nightly cron build if possible :)
<ajmitch> don't think i can simply do that with python packages
jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<ajmitch> will need to touch up documentation on branch to reflect new binary names :)
<dneighbo> ajmitch: certainly we could do that if the debian packaging can support it
<ajmitch> will try, need to fuind out how to package distutils stuff (nickr said some of it wasn't nice)

<ajmitch> dneighbo: it's not an EULA tho :)
<dneighbo> ajmitch: true dat
<dneighbo> i mean so nice to see this wehre the EULA normally is
<ajmitch> yeah, is much better
<ajmitch> you can click 'accept' with a clear conscience :)
<ajmitch> hmm, need to get up at 5:30am again
<dneighbo> ajmitch: its bad for your health to rise that early
<dneighbo> early to bed early to wise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise
<ajmitch> dneighbo: i know, but there's another dotgnu meet on
<dneighbo> is well a wives tale (i.e. only a wife would think of it)
<ajmitch> hehe
<dneighbo> hey i think this openoffice is broken
<dneighbo> it cant be good
<dneighbo> it doesnt want me to rebbot
<dneighbo> oh crap i forgot
<chillywilly> reboot?
<dneighbo> GNU\Linux is winning BIG time
<dneighbo> i was at softball
<dneighbo> lets say the guys on our team cant spell computer much less literate with one
<chillywilly> you play softball?
<dneighbo> one of the guys gets a call from his girlfriend
<dneighbo> and he asks one of the other guys, do you know if linux is any good
<ajmitch> hmm, my uptime isn't too bad here for my main desktop box
<dneighbo> im like (did you say linux?) (this is not type of guy i would expect to know what windows is, much less linux)
<dneighbo> he said yeah, you know what it is
<dneighbo> i said yeah
<dneighbo> he said is it good
<dneighbo> i said, yeah it kicks crap out of windows
<dneighbo> then i had to go to bat
<dneighbo> came back and asked him why he wanted to know
--- Sun Jul 14 2002
<chillywilly> struck out eh? ;)
<dneighbo> he said his wife/girlfriend was at the store shopping for computer
<chillywilly> (that's why you came back so fast ;) )
<dneighbo> and they had a celeron machine for 299.99 and it had linux
<ajmitch> v. nice
<dneighbo> and they didnt know if it was any good, but he thought she was gonna buy it
<dneighbo> chillywilly: no i hit into fielders choice that scored run
<chillywilly> cool, preinstalled with it?
<chillywilly> dneighbo: sure you did ;)
<dneighbo> and then stayed on base until third out (dont strike out in slow pitch) but i dont claim to be worth a crap
<dneighbo> chillywilly: i assume pre installed
<dneighbo> i didnt ask him
<dneighbo> but i would presume its Lindows on a Walmart pc
<chillywilly> ah
<dneighbo> as only place else i have seen them is at Fry's and i dont think that they shop there
<dneighbo> as stated this is not a 'computer guru' type guy
<chillywilly> do you know that they run everything as root on Lindows?
<ajmitch> i thought the walmart ones were online-only?
<dneighbo> but thats why i say 'we are winning'
<ajmitch> and walmart also agreed to pre-load mandrake
<dneighbo> chillywilly: i didnt get into all that
<dneighbo> im not good friends with the guy
Action: ajmitch would take mandrake over lindows any day :)
<chillywilly> just saying...it is so much like windows ;)
<dneighbo> he comes with one of the guys that goes to our church (its church league)
<chillywilly> yea
<dneighbo> i figure i tell him, let me get you some customer support action and go over there with a woody disk :)
<chillywilly> crazymike plays the church and work league
Action: chillywilly doesn't play softball
<dneighbo> i wont play on the other league (they are too cut throat)
<dneighbo> all the other guys play like 3 nights a week
<chillywilly> well between the 2 teams that he plays on they have a total of 1 win
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> e was pissed when they won because he told me he wanted to either be really good or suck really bad
<chillywilly> s/e/he/
<chillywilly> btw, it si very cool that they are bringin gnu/linux to the masses ;)
<chillywilly> s/si/is/
<dneighbo> crap the other one has same problem
<dneighbo> BUT i realized the file i have is readonly
<dneighbo> i wonder if thats why
<chillywilly> heh
<ajmitch> chillywilly: they're bringing the linux but hiding the gnu, if ya know what i mean
<chillywilly> yea, well...you get them using it then we can edumacate them about GNU :)
<dneighbo> bah crap
<chillywilly> it's hard to relate to the home user why Free Software is important sometimes
<dneighbo> thats what it was i think
<dneighbo> im going back to the debian
<dneighbo> to try
Action: dneighbo slaps himself
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> where'd you get the deb from?
<dneighbo> the magic deb dwarf
<chillywilly> cool
<ajmitch> chillywilly: lindows is a sizable proprietary chunk hiding the free internals
<ajmitch> although the desktop is kde afaik
Action: ajmitch considers whether to get an MCSE
<chillywilly> no!
<chillywilly> resist!
<ajmitch> cannot resist the allure of big $$
<dneighbo> ajmitch: new zealand really that low on fire wood you would have to do that?
<dneighbo> gack
<chillywilly> lies and deceit are the way of the dark side
<Remosi> ajmitch: CCNE?
<Remosi> RHCE?
<ajmitch> Remosi: now that would be worth something, the CCNE
<dneighbo> its 22:30 at ists still 100 degrees out side and like 30% humidity
<chillywilly> yick
<ajmitch> have heard that it's an actual qualification, unlike MCSE
<Remosi> yes
<ajmitch> dunno much about RHCE
<Remosi> people respect CCNE's
<Remosi> RHCE's mean you know how RH works
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> and i'm a debian person :)
<ajmitch> RH isn't too bad tho
<Remosi> and MSCE means that you know how to load minesweeper, and your certification will expire after 2 years at which point you may no longer be able to find minesweeper :)
<Remosi> agreed
<Remosi> the most annoying thing about rh boxen is how to upgrade them?
<ajmitch> rm -rf 
<dneighbo> deb ftp://ftp.vpn-junkies.de/openoffice testing main contrib
<Remosi> well yes
<dneighbo> chillywilly: thats where openoffice is
<chillywilly> k
<dneighbo> you can s/testing/unstable
<dneighbo> and it will work too if you are on sid
<chillywilly> german eh?
Action: Remosi has to install mysql
<Remosi> bletch
<dneighbo> yeah but they have all the i10n english stuff packaged
<dneighbo> just not the dictionary :(
<dneighbo> only german/austrian dictionaries
<ajmitch> mysql, now that's a fun db
<dneighbo> Remosi: that is punishable by flogging in Gilbert
<dneighbo> at least if you are near me
Action: ajmitch has mysql installed & running
<Remosi> dneighbo: I usually abuse people who install mysql horribly
<dneighbo> ajmitch: God forgives even the most horrible of sinners
<Remosi> problem is that I'm experimenting with some software that although it has postgres support, the postgres support isn't in debian 
<ajmitch> dneighbo: mysql is ok for toy databases
<ajmitch> eg, nothing fancy required, a simple db backend to a website

<ajmitch> *cough*
<ajmitch> why would i want to infect my box with that? :)
<chillywilly> I thought SAP was the enemy? ;)
<chillywilly> er, one of them anyway
<Remosi> can anyone tell me why (At least in the KC) it was agreed to use "mm/dd/yy"?
<Remosi> for internal date formats?
Action: chillywilly is not guilty on all counts of internal date format
<ajmitch> Remosi: probably because of the unhealthy american influence
<Remosi> yeah
<Remosi> well, it's not y2k compliant, it's ambigious compared to the european format of dd/mm/yyyy, and it doesn't sort properly :)
<Remosi> yyyy-mm-dd seems to be a much more logical system to use
<ajmitch> yes
<Remosi> theres even a ISO standard about it
Action: ajmitch certainly prefers it
<ajmitch> makes sorting in a list much simpler
<Remosi> well, if american's persist to use their silly systems we'll have to buy a few plane tickets and go and beat them around the head with a large, wet, and slightly smelly trout.
<dneighbo> um cause americans are the best
<Remosi> http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html
<Remosi> dneighbo: uh, sure :P
<dneighbo> and we dont want your puking metric system or messed up concept of date formatting
<ajmitch> the trout will no doubt be a bit smelly after that plane trip
<dneighbo> you can even take your stinking celsius too
Action: Remosi goes and prepares the fish
<dneighbo> btw im completely kidding
<dneighbo> only the french would use that as a reason ;)
<dneighbo> i mean after the dateline was stolen from them, who would blame them for their ire
<ajmitch> heh
<Remosi> true :)
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> notes form our LUG meeting...
<chillywilly> *********
<chillywilly> Help Desk
<chillywilly> *********
<chillywilly> Josh has girl problems.  We're not sure MLUG is really the proper
<chillywilly> forum for solving this problem.  However, if someone has suggestions, 
<chillywilly> he's open to them.
<Remosi> rofl
<Remosi> sounds like one of our local lug's discussions
<chillywilly> hehe, :)
<Remosi> however "Josh" may, or may not, have been participating in the discussion ;)
<chillywilly> how's this for am example:
<chillywilly> / Exception declarations                                                                                                  exception WhoSaidYouCouldStopCoding{string code_slave_name; };      
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> / Exception declarations
<chillywilly> exception WhoSaidYouCouldStopCoding{string code_slave_name; };
<chillywilly> this is going into my "kitchen sink" odl file
<chillywilly> :)
<Remosi> heh
<Remosi> cw, did you hear about my amazing .so->idl idea?
<chillywilly> nope
<Remosi> dang
<Remosi> you know how nm can tell you all the symbols in a .so (or .o for that matter) right?
<chillywilly> yes
<Remosi> and how "stabs" can tell you the type of a symbol if it was compiled with -g, or, alternatively, c++filt will tell you if it was compiled using gcc, right? :)
<chillywilly> never used that before
<Remosi> nm ~/irc/gnuworld/src/msg_W.o | c++filt
<Remosi> grab your favourite c++ .o, .so, or executable and tryt hat ;)
<chillywilly> is c++filt apt-gettable?
Action: ajmitch doesn't knoew where it is :)
<chillywilly> I don't see it either
<Remosi> it's in binutils
<Remosi> apt-get install binutils ?
<chillywilly> doh
<chillywilly> I have it installed
<Remosi> dpkg -S c++filt
<Remosi> binutils: /usr/bin/c++filt
<Remosi> binutils: /usr/share/man/man1/c++filt.1.gz
<Remosi> (you have a box without binutils?!)
<Remosi> :)
<chillywilly> nope, I have c++filt
<ajmitch> ah no, i see what i did
Action: ajmitch tried c++-filt for some reason
<Remosi> ajmitch: doh!
Action: chillywilly tries the command on libccgnu2
<Remosi> givin that type information you should be able to write an idl file (for gnurpc for instance)
<chillywilly> that shows every symbol right?
Action: ajmitch imagines it *could* be done
<Remosi> right
<Remosi> nm lists all symbols
<Remosi> eg: nm /lib/ld-linux.so.2
<Remosi> c++filt takes a mangled symbol and demangles it
<chillywilly> yea, yea...I knwo just saying why would I want to expose every symbol....er, or you saying expose all "functions"
<Remosi> eg:
<Remosi> echo 00000000 W validSubscript__CQ28gnuworld11xParametersRCUi | c++filt
<Remosi> produces:
<Remosi> 00000000 W gnuworld::xParameters::validSubscript(unsigned int const &) const
<Remosi> you need to of course figure out which symbols are actually defined in the .so/.a/.o that you're linking
<Remosi> but it could be a really easy way to automatically load, say, openssl into python
<Remosi> you could take the openssl.so file generate some idl for it, then use gnurpc to use openssl as if it was a python module
<Remosi> without having to spend ages defining all the normal glue logic
<Remosi> if you did it right python could catch the import function and do all of that automatically
<Remosi> so you could have a .so (eg openssl.so) and then just go "import openssl" in python and have it do all the work for you ;)
<ajmitch> also may open up licensing holes :)
<Remosi> well true
<Remosi> but so does allowing multiple .c files in a gcc invocation :)
<Remosi> anyway
<Remosi> I've gotta go have dinner
<Remosi> BBL
Action: Remosi has to go read up on stabs :)
<chillywilly> I want to know how gnurpc loads the .so?
<chillywilly> s/?//

<drochaid> hey siesel
<siesel> hi drochaid :)
<siesel> seems that is has been quite silent here during the last hours
<drochaid> I only got in 5 mins before you
<drochaid> no one welcomed me </sniff>
<siesel> oh, drochaid, I feel with you <a tear is falling down>
<siesel> btw. do you know something about accounting?
<reinhard> hey
<reinhard> hello drochaid
<reinhard> and welcome
Action: reinhard hugs drochaid
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> allo reinhard :)
<reinhard> :)
<siesel> hi reinhard
<drochaid> siesel: I know very very little about accounting .. I tend to leave that to my bro [a chartered accountant and auditor ;)]
<reinhard> siesel: you have questions about accounting?
<reinhard> i might be able to help
<siesel> yes, especialy about the differences between german and american accounting.
<reinhard> uh
<reinhard> oh
<reinhard> i'm happy that i've learned the basic differences between austrian and german accounting :)
<siesel> lol
<reinhard> from what i understand american accounting serves a different purpose
Action: drochaid uses Scots Business law when it comes to accounting
<reinhard> read: austrian/german accounting is done mainly to satisfy the tax authority
<reinhard> and to calculate the taxes to pay
<siesel> A friend told me that I should write my master thesis about the difference between chinese (quite similar to american) and german accounting
<reinhard> us american accounting seems to me to replace what we have in german "controlling" or "kostenrechnung" as well
<reinhard> i.e. it serves as a source of information for the management and/or the investors
<siesel> i.e. american accounting is just a kind of GuV ?
<reinhard> don't think that
<siesel> GuV = Gewinn & Verlust Rechnung ( don't know the english equivalence)
<reinhard> i would believe us accounting does _more_ than german accounting
<reinhard> sometimes i also get the feeling that us accounting doesn't have the strict concept of systematic account numbers
<siesel> hmmm, I thought german accounting would allready be kind of too much (especial for lasy students who have to understand it ;) )
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> night all
<siesel> but if you say they have _more_, what is it us accounting has more?
<reinhard> siesel: probably dneighbo is the one here knowing most about accounting
<reinhard> the are more detailed
<reinhard> (at least that is my understanding)
<reinhard> they do "kostenstellen" and "kostenarten" and "kostenträger" etc. all in accounting
<siesel> ok, I will ask dneighbo, 
<reinhard> although i could misunderstand that
Action: reinhard goes to sleep

<chillywilly> the console one doesn't paste as nicely
<chillywilly> dude the key bindings int he gui one are b0rked :(
<chillywilly> M-v doesn't do a page up and M-> or M-< doesn't jump to the beginning or end of the buffer
<nickr> does for me
<nickr> your meta key is horked

<chillywilly> er, wait
<chillywilly> te window manager config stuff?....I know I set the meta key properly in there somewhere...at least I though

<chillywilly> nickr: do you know how to fix it?
<nickr> the meta thing is X keymap related
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> ok
<nickr> has nothing to do with Gnome
<chillywilly> now I remember
<chillywilly> some shitty xkeymap...something program

<chillywilly> since he works for said county
<nickr> chillywilly: has nothing to do with what toolkit emacs uses
<nickr> chillywilly: regardless of toolkit, programs get certain events from the X server
<chillywilly> yes, I was going to say that but I didn't bother
<ajmitch> nickr: you get anywhere with deb packaging? i've been asked to package them in the next few days
<nickr> ajmitch: no, I didn,t get anywhere tangible because whenever we taled about it I was told that setup.py can't be made to do that and it was dropped
<ajmitch> nickr: how useful, i guess you have a standing hatred for distutils now? :)
<nickr> booja
<nickr> so basically you'll have to let it install in its fgake root, then move everything into place
<nickr> which I found annoying but I guess its acceptable if you're into it
<ajmitch> ugly as hell
<ajmitch> oh yeah, i'm right into S-M ;)

<ajmitch> hi dneighbo
<dneighbo> hi
<dneighbo> playing with more gui tools, im pretty impressed with the progress, shame i dont really find value in them for most things
<dneighbo> but its good to know when evangelizing
<ajmitch> great
<dneighbo> jbailey: you really here
<jbailey> dneighbo: Maybe. =)
<dneighbo> btw: woody is really solid (many kudos) if only they would release it
<jbailey> What'cha need?
<dneighbo> wondering how SAP-DB was going
<dneighbo> and whether dcl made it in to sid or not
<dneighbo> i.e. just being a pain :)
<ajmitch> dneighbo: i'm getting complaints about the install instructions & stuff with gnue forms, etc :)
<jbailey> sap-db was untouched this weekend.  It's all on my work machine.
<jbailey> I haven't seen the ACCEPTED message for dcl yet, but I did see the NEW notification, so I know it was received.
<jbailey> I except sap-db to be in a reasonable first-snapshot state by next weekend.
<dneighbo> ajmitch: complaints from where on what
<dneighbo> jbailey: yummy
<jbailey> So, basically with sapdb-client, sapdb-server, and maybe a sapdb-docs packages
<dneighbo> well you know where to find a tester :)
<jbailey> dneighbo: I'm kvitching again. =)
<ajmitch> dneighbo: not allowed to say where, he didn't give much detail ;)
<dneighbo> i can test on woody and sid for you
<dneighbo> jbailey: as stated before if one must make makefiles for the debs certainly do so
<jbailey> dneighbo: Cool.  It'll all be targetted at sid.
<jbailey> dneighbo: It would be nice to have a clean 'make install' target.  Right now I'm copying files by hand into the right place, so I worry that I'll miss things in upgrades.
<ajmitch> talked to nickr about making gnue debs, could require a certain love of s-m
Action: ajmitch wonders why each component is in it's own dir for downloads
<jbailey> dneighbo: Perhaps once Andrew finishes the GNUe debs, I can work from that example to still build you your cross-platform installer.
<dneighbo> jbailey: i think we plan to make that python and part of gnue-common
<dneighbo> an installer that is
<dneighbo> eventually we will have to mimic something like apt for our actual packages(applications) not tools
<jbailey> Ah okay.  I was thinking with that installed I had showed you before on sourceforge.
<jbailey> It looked like it would do a nice job (and was already written)
<jbailey> Whatever works best for you, obviously. =)
<dneighbo> i dont remember the other
<dneighbo> best to ask jamest
<dneighbo> as i think he pretty much has the internals done for a xplatform installer
<dneighbo> i.e. to make the linux installer like the windows one (visual and such) for those silly enough to not use debian :)
<jbailey> Ah, cool.
<jbailey> *lol*
<jbailey> BTW, remember you can also use alien to generate rpms. =)
<dneighbo> that would be very cool
<dneighbo> i no longer have a red hat or windows system to test things :)
<jbailey> No windows system.  Nice!
Action: dneighbo is 100% debianite now
<dneighbo> no windows for about 6 months now
<dneighbo> no red hat as of last weekend
<dneighbo> now im hooked on my laptop again :)
<jbailey> I still have windows for the games.
<dneighbo> with new kernel, shiny new journaling file system and a brand spanking new grub loader
<dneighbo> yummy
<dneighbo> i plan on using win4lin for some things
<dneighbo> mainly kids games
<dneighbo> i have railroad tycoon 2, civ CTP and some other linux games from loki that keep me fairly entertained in limited game time i do have
Action: ajmitch doesn't play many games
<ajmitch> have been windows free for about 3 years
<ajmitch> only been hooked on debian for 18 months tho
<chillywilly> dneighbo: did you see the article about the plug and Marcopia county?

<dneighbo> which one
<chillywilly> one sec...
<dneighbo> its been on source forge
<dneighbo> and slashdot (more than once)
<chillywilly> maybe it was newsforge that I saw it on
<dneighbo> the newsforge one was ok

<chillywilly> our buddy Goran is thinking about naming his band "satellite down"
<chillywilly> what do you guys think?
<dneighbo> um what ever floats their boat :)
<chillywilly> crazymike has live recordings of The Gufs (Goran's "former" band) and Goran's new stuff at http://crazymike.dyndns.org
<chillywilly> you need the xmms-shn plugin though (trying to switch him to flac - http://flac.sourceforge.net)
<chillywilly> it doesn't believe in lossy compression for audio ;)
<ajmitch> hmm, how to package gnue-common with it's myriad deps? ;)
<chillywilly> s/it/he/,  :o
Action: chillywilly is sneezing and his nose is running this means sleep is definitely needed
<ajmitch> designer will be fairly simple compared to common
<dneighbo> what is flac
<dneighbo> shn is a lossless format
<chillywilly> we also put up ths board - http://goran.kicks-ass.org...I am running apache as a virtual server answering that previous url and the board one
<chillywilly> flac is Free Software
<chillywilly> shorten is not
<chillywilly> ;)
<dneighbo> shn is the format all the tape traders use
<dneighbo> its basically a compressed wav
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> I know
<dneighbo> cuts wav in half without lossing any quality
<chillywilly> so does flac
<chillywilly> I hear it gets better compression
Action: dneighbo still think that losing quality is ok (human ear is only so good) to preserve space
<chillywilly> hehe, ;)
<dneighbo> also its little known fact but the ogg vorbis spec states that you can do lossless compression/encoding in .ogg
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> I'll have to let mikey know
<chillywilly> btw, we are setting up somehting to stream Goran's music on WOPN ;)
<dneighbo> i.e. master sources should be highest quality possible but unless you are doing studio work or professional work the quality of bitrates by .mp3(sic) are functional (better than FM radio)
<chillywilly> dneighbo: WOPN is in dire need of good tunes that are freely available
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> they seem to play a LOT of techno crap

<chillywilly> (megman remixes and goofy shit like that)
<dneighbo> These two general mechanisms are particularly well suited to coupling due to the structure of Vorbis encoding, as we'll explore below, and using both we can implement both totally lossless stereo image coupling [bit-for-bit decode-identical to uncoupled modes], as well as various lossy models that seek to eliminate inaudible or unimportant aspects of the stereo image in order to enhance bitrate.

<chillywilly> uhuh
<chillywilly> thanks
gnuebot (eggdrop@mail.libertydistribution.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> same document
<dneighbo> under stereo models
<dneighbo> Using polar mapping and/or channel interleaving, it's possible to couple Vorbis channels losslessly, that is, construct a stereo coupling encoding that both saves space but also decodes bit-identically to dual stereo. OggEnc 1.0 and later uses this mode in all high-bitrate encoding.
<dneighbo> Overall, this stereo mode is overkill; however, it offers a safe alternative to users concerned about the slightest possible degredation to the stereo image or archival quality audio.

<chillywilly> lol
<dneighbo> i like how they add the last paragraph about OVERKILL
<chillywilly> people like mike and all the tapers
<dneighbo> but safe alternative for the stereo freaks
<chillywilly> :)
<dneighbo> btw: i have a cubemate that is hardcore tape trader 
<dneighbo> that is way into shn
<chillywilly> kewl
<chillywilly> and mike is my "partner"
<chillywilly> we work as a team
<chillywilly> the tapers are *everywhere*
<nickr> heterosexual life partner
<dneighbo> bbs 'dead zone'
<chillywilly> nickr: indeed ;)
<chillywilly> dneighbo: that series is cool
<nickr> Monk is quite excellent, I have to say.
<chillywilly> don't laugh but I just saw fght club for the first time the other day
<chillywilly> that is a wacked movie
<chillywilly> er, fight club
Action: chillywilly doesn't see may movies
<nickr> Its based on a lot of true things, which is the scary part
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> the scary thing is how he gets so many followers who he leads like sheep, imho
<chillywilly> this reminded me of hitler or something like that
<chillywilly> people really are this desparate to "belong" to something
<chillywilly> I dunno that movie had some really deep philosphical overtones
<nickr> I think his motives were essentially good, though
<chillywilly> it was pretty cool
<nickr> if not his methods
<chillywilly> I should watch it again
<nickr> yea
<nickr> its much better thes second time
<nickr> cause you see tyler very early on many times
<ajmitch> ok
<chillywilly> tell you the truth at first viewing, until the little twist came in, I wasn't really diggin it all that much
<nickr> Heh.
<nickr> I dug it even the first viewing
<ajmitch> nickr: got any hints on how i should do gnue-common? ;)
<chillywilly> well tyler was just a jag and seemed to be picking on eddy norton too much for my tastes...but I'm a softie
<nickr> ajmitch: well it'll involve several chickens.
<ajmitch> nickr: ooh, sounds fun
<chillywilly> and the removing of their heads
<chillywilly> the slatterning of chicken blood
<chillywilly> and voodoo curses
<chillywilly> rituals even
<nickr> ajmitch: lets see, theres a certain argument that you pass to setup.py that'll make a directory the 'fake /'
<nickr> ajmitch: so do that with a temp directory, then move all the files in there to their right spots
<ajmitch> nickr: yup, caught that, i'm just wondering about all the db dirvers
<nickr> oh
<nickr> iirc they aren't 'required' at build time
<chillywilly> nickr: btw, how's life treating you?
<nickr> if thats the case, make them recommended, and let it pick them up automatically
<nickr> chillywilly: pretty good
Action: ajmitch could try for record package counts & split each into a separate package :)
<nickr> ajmitch: yea, I'd recommend against that
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> go for it man!
<nickr> ajmitch: because its all runtime, not compile time, I thikn
<ajmitch> nickr: it'd be a pain to have a package with a single .py file in it :)
<ajmitch> certainly
<nickr> should I drop 180$ on headphones?
<chillywilly> yea, live a little
