<ajmitch> hi

<siesel> hi
<ajmitch> hey siesl
<ajmitch> how's phpforms coming along?
<siesel> hi ajmitch
<ajmitch> it's been decided that appserver probably isn't necessary for the accounting app i'm helping with, since it's for small businesses
<ajmitch> a web forms client may be tho :)
<siesel> I hope to bring phpforms to a stable state soon, but there are too many small problems, and I don't have a good debugger :(
<ajmitch> ok
<siesel> and after using python I don't like PHP anymore ;)
Action: ajmitch would really prefer a python implementation, like madlocke's webware client :)
<ajmitch> i'd imagine handling python triggers in php would have been fun
<siesel> this is the reason for using phpforms with appserver, so triggers can be moved into appserver
<ajmitch> yes, understandable
Action: ajmitch is currently learning forms

<sledge_> hi
<sledge_> anyone of you familiar with xml2sql?
<ajmitch> not i, sledge_
<ajmitch> perhaps siesel :)
<ajmitch> hi, btw
<sledge_> do we have a list of other free ERP projects?
<siesel> sledge: xml2sql: yes
<siesel> you should have a look in appserver/samples/Makefile
<sledge_> thx
<sledge_> i just found a bug in pgsql.xsl in gnue cvs
<siesel> oh, which bug?
<sledge_> all scripts make a match="/", pgsql.xsl has match="/schema"
<sledge_> which is wrong when you try it with dcl.xml
<sledge_> i removed it and it worked
<sledge_> all others worked before
<siesel> yes, because pgsql.xsl is the only one which supports the new GNUe schema file format ( *.GSD )
<sledge_> so it is a new feature that the others haven't, not a bug?
<siesel> yep. and pgsql.xsl is the only one which can create insert statemenets out of the <data> part of an .GSD
<sledge_> ah
<sledge_> great
<siesel> i think i should remove dcl.xml or convert it to dcl.gsd
<sledge_> is gsd already defined / is there doc?
<siesel> there is DTD in designer/src/schema
<siesel> and you can create it with designer
<sledge_> ok
<sledge_> but i can safely assume that the old format can simply be converted to the new one by wrapping everything in <schema>?
<siesel> yes
<sledge_> wtf is a constraint?
<sledge_> (sorry for the stupid question)
<siesel> constrains = NOT NULL, UNIQUE, ...
<sledge_> ah, okay
<siesel> a foreign key is an constrain too. (also I don't know how to write a constraint in the .GSD format :(
jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<sledge_> doesn't matter
<sledge_> i just want to look a bit through :)
Action: ajmitch wonders how to use the FK properties of a form widget :)
<sledge_> siesel: perhaps you have use for it :)
Action: ajmitch ought to print out the techref.lyx & userguide.lyx for forms
<sledge_> does techref.lyx contain information on gsd?
<siesel> ajmitch: you can use fk_... to fill a dropdown entry.
<siesel> sledge_: no, but if you want the ultimate information you should ask derek, because he has written it (if I'm right informed ) :)
<ajmitch> siesel: that's *exactly* what i want
<sledge_> okay

<dneighbo> chillywilly: you here? oh cvs master
<chillywilly> yes I am here
<dneighbo> can you answer this
<dneighbo> After importing a project into the CVS repository, the CVS directory in my 
<dneighbo> working directory was not created.  The work directory was in my home 
<dneighbo> directory.
<dneighbo> Is there a permissions issue where the CVS server cannot write to my home 
<dneighbo> directory?
<dneighbo> According to Webmin, the box does not have a cvs user (not a user that uses 
<dneighbo> cvs but a user for the cvs server).  Does it need one?
<chillywilly> I thought you just need to setup 'writers' file
<chillywilly> in the CVSROOT module
<chillywilly> you have to remove the original source tree ans then check it out according to the docs
<chillywilly> or mv it out of the way if you are paranoid ;)
<chillywilly> ah but you do want to have proper perms on the repository
<chillywilly> I think I have a cvs group
<chillywilly> for my personal repository
<chillywilly> perms are owner=root, group=cvs dirs are chmod 775 files are chmod 664

<chillywilly> lemme know if this helps
<dneighbo> will do its for a lug person here
<chillywilly> i.e, it won't create the CVS dir until you check it out...which requires pulling a fresh copy

<ajmitch> hi dneighbo
<chillywilly> ello derek
<dneighbo> anyone know if there is an open office channel?
<dneighbo> or is anyone running an open office not from debian packaging?
<dneighbo> as there is missing feature from star office i cant live w/o 
<ajmitch> i've got OO.o here
Action: chillywilly installed form tar ball
<dneighbo> and i could have sworn it existed in OO 1.0
<chillywilly> from
<ajmitch> what is it?
<dneighbo> can one you open up impress (power point)
<dneighbo> and create a new slide show create two slides
<ajmitch> yeah, give me 15min for it to open
<dneighbo> and then go to
<dneighbo> Slide Show
<chillywilly> ajmitch: hehe
<dneighbo> and tell me if you have a 'custom slideshow' as an option under that menu?
<dneighbo> it used to be there and the DOCUMENTATION says it should be there
<dneighbo> but it aint there :(
<dneighbo> i will drop the debs and go to binaries if i can verify the binaries have it
<ajmitch> still waiting for splash screen to go away & app to appear
<dneighbo> darn you running that on a palm or what?
<dneighbo> even my p233 64mb is quicker than that
<dneighbo> have you considered trying fluxbox?
<dneighbo> for desktop? it will improve the speed of your applications considerably (or at least it did for me)
<ajmitch> compiling
<ajmitch> that functionality does exist here
<ajmitch> my computer is not much faster than a p233 :)
<ajmitch> as in, i can create a custom slideshow
<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> did you get it with debian packages?
<dneighbo> or from openoffice tar ball
<dneighbo> er binary
<ajmitch> binary tarball
<dneighbo> im downloading the openoffice binary from the site
<dneighbo> ok cool (me was having minor panic)
<dneighbo> as that feature ROCKS for church worship :)
<dneighbo> i can have one powerpoint file that has all the songs
<dneighbo> then just select the ones for a particular service as a custom show
<ajmitch> have been asked to deb-package GNUe tools, so will try & do that as i fugre out how
<ajmitch> excelltn
<dneighbo> the old power point people were like NO WAY (as i guess office powerpoint doesnt do this)
Action: ajmitch must need new keyboard - typing sucks
<dneighbo> so they would number every slide to every song and maintain a db of them
<dneighbo> then write down the numbers for a song set on paper
<ajmitch> ah, this way is much better?
<dneighbo> and use the 'go to' slide feature
<dneighbo> i.e. key in the number of the slide
<ajmitch> that way sucks :)
<dneighbo> why do you think im freaking that the deb packages dont have custom slide show :)
<dneighbo> sigh my connection is getting slower
<dneighbo> took almost 2 minutes for open office to download this time :(
Action: dneighbo forgets we have some dial up folks here, i shouldnt be saying that
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> there is a branch for 0.3.0, right?
<dneighbo> yes
Action: ajmitch wonders what to number cvs packages as
<dneighbo> im the maintainer of that, but havent done anything with it :)
<ajmitch> 0.3.0.$DATE ?
<dneighbo> please do package 0.3.0
<dneighbo> as 0.3.0
<ajmitch> ah ok, will just take 0.3.0
<dneighbo> then if you its easy we can do a -cvs (no?)
<dneighbo> and update it regularly
<ajmitch> yes, that's what i'd do
<ajmitch> where regularly == nightly cron build if possible :)
<ajmitch> don't think i can simply do that with python packages
jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<ajmitch> will need to touch up documentation on branch to reflect new binary names :)
<dneighbo> ajmitch: certainly we could do that if the debian packaging can support it
<ajmitch> will try, need to fuind out how to package distutils stuff (nickr said some of it wasn't nice)

<ajmitch> dneighbo: it's not an EULA tho :)
<dneighbo> ajmitch: true dat
<dneighbo> i mean so nice to see this wehre the EULA normally is
<ajmitch> yeah, is much better
<ajmitch> you can click 'accept' with a clear conscience :)
<ajmitch> hmm, need to get up at 5:30am again
<dneighbo> ajmitch: its bad for your health to rise that early
<dneighbo> early to bed early to wise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise
<ajmitch> dneighbo: i know, but there's another dotgnu meet on
<dneighbo> is well a wives tale (i.e. only a wife would think of it)
<ajmitch> hehe
<dneighbo> hey i think this openoffice is broken
<dneighbo> it cant be good
<dneighbo> it doesnt want me to rebbot
<dneighbo> oh crap i forgot
<chillywilly> reboot?
<dneighbo> GNU\Linux is winning BIG time
<dneighbo> i was at softball
<dneighbo> lets say the guys on our team cant spell computer much less literate with one
<chillywilly> you play softball?
<dneighbo> one of the guys gets a call from his girlfriend
<dneighbo> and he asks one of the other guys, do you know if linux is any good
<ajmitch> hmm, my uptime isn't too bad here for my main desktop box
<dneighbo> im like (did you say linux?) (this is not type of guy i would expect to know what windows is, much less linux)
<dneighbo> he said yeah, you know what it is
<dneighbo> i said yeah
<dneighbo> he said is it good
<dneighbo> i said, yeah it kicks crap out of windows
<dneighbo> then i had to go to bat
<dneighbo> came back and asked him why he wanted to know
