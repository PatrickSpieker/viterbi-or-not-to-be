<chillywilly> struck out eh? ;)
<dneighbo> he said his wife/girlfriend was at the store shopping for computer
<chillywilly> (that's why you came back so fast ;) )
<dneighbo> and they had a celeron machine for 299.99 and it had linux
<ajmitch> v. nice
<dneighbo> and they didnt know if it was any good, but he thought she was gonna buy it
<dneighbo> chillywilly: no i hit into fielders choice that scored run
<chillywilly> cool, preinstalled with it?
<chillywilly> dneighbo: sure you did ;)
<dneighbo> and then stayed on base until third out (dont strike out in slow pitch) but i dont claim to be worth a crap
<dneighbo> chillywilly: i assume pre installed
<dneighbo> i didnt ask him
<dneighbo> but i would presume its Lindows on a Walmart pc
<chillywilly> ah
<dneighbo> as only place else i have seen them is at Fry's and i dont think that they shop there
<dneighbo> as stated this is not a 'computer guru' type guy
<chillywilly> do you know that they run everything as root on Lindows?
<ajmitch> i thought the walmart ones were online-only?
<dneighbo> but thats why i say 'we are winning'
<ajmitch> and walmart also agreed to pre-load mandrake
<dneighbo> chillywilly: i didnt get into all that
<dneighbo> im not good friends with the guy
Action: ajmitch would take mandrake over lindows any day :)
<chillywilly> just saying...it is so much like windows ;)
<dneighbo> he comes with one of the guys that goes to our church (its church league)
<chillywilly> yea
<dneighbo> i figure i tell him, let me get you some customer support action and go over there with a woody disk :)
<chillywilly> crazymike plays the church and work league
Action: chillywilly doesn't play softball
<dneighbo> i wont play on the other league (they are too cut throat)
<dneighbo> all the other guys play like 3 nights a week
<chillywilly> well between the 2 teams that he plays on they have a total of 1 win
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> e was pissed when they won because he told me he wanted to either be really good or suck really bad
<chillywilly> s/e/he/
<chillywilly> btw, it si very cool that they are bringin gnu/linux to the masses ;)
<chillywilly> s/si/is/
<dneighbo> crap the other one has same problem
<dneighbo> BUT i realized the file i have is readonly
<dneighbo> i wonder if thats why
<chillywilly> heh
<ajmitch> chillywilly: they're bringing the linux but hiding the gnu, if ya know what i mean
<chillywilly> yea, well...you get them using it then we can edumacate them about GNU :)
<dneighbo> bah crap
<chillywilly> it's hard to relate to the home user why Free Software is important sometimes
<dneighbo> thats what it was i think
<dneighbo> im going back to the debian
<dneighbo> to try
Action: dneighbo slaps himself
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> where'd you get the deb from?
<dneighbo> the magic deb dwarf
<chillywilly> cool
<ajmitch> chillywilly: lindows is a sizable proprietary chunk hiding the free internals
<ajmitch> although the desktop is kde afaik
Action: ajmitch considers whether to get an MCSE
<chillywilly> no!
<chillywilly> resist!
<ajmitch> cannot resist the allure of big $$
<dneighbo> ajmitch: new zealand really that low on fire wood you would have to do that?
<dneighbo> gack
<chillywilly> lies and deceit are the way of the dark side
<Remosi> ajmitch: CCNE?
<Remosi> RHCE?
<ajmitch> Remosi: now that would be worth something, the CCNE
<dneighbo> its 22:30 at ists still 100 degrees out side and like 30% humidity
<chillywilly> yick
<ajmitch> have heard that it's an actual qualification, unlike MCSE
<Remosi> yes
<ajmitch> dunno much about RHCE
<Remosi> people respect CCNE's
<Remosi> RHCE's mean you know how RH works
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> and i'm a debian person :)
<ajmitch> RH isn't too bad tho
<Remosi> and MSCE means that you know how to load minesweeper, and your certification will expire after 2 years at which point you may no longer be able to find minesweeper :)
<Remosi> agreed
<Remosi> the most annoying thing about rh boxen is how to upgrade them?
<ajmitch> rm -rf 
<dneighbo> deb ftp://ftp.vpn-junkies.de/openoffice testing main contrib
<Remosi> well yes
<dneighbo> chillywilly: thats where openoffice is
<chillywilly> k
<dneighbo> you can s/testing/unstable
<dneighbo> and it will work too if you are on sid
<chillywilly> german eh?
Action: Remosi has to install mysql
<Remosi> bletch
<dneighbo> yeah but they have all the i10n english stuff packaged
<dneighbo> just not the dictionary :(
<dneighbo> only german/austrian dictionaries
<ajmitch> mysql, now that's a fun db
<dneighbo> Remosi: that is punishable by flogging in Gilbert
<dneighbo> at least if you are near me
Action: ajmitch has mysql installed & running
<Remosi> dneighbo: I usually abuse people who install mysql horribly
<dneighbo> ajmitch: God forgives even the most horrible of sinners
<Remosi> problem is that I'm experimenting with some software that although it has postgres support, the postgres support isn't in debian 
<ajmitch> dneighbo: mysql is ok for toy databases
<ajmitch> eg, nothing fancy required, a simple db backend to a website
<dneighbo> roflmao 
<dneighbo> this is best error message i have seen in some time
<dneighbo> ==========
<dneighbo> dneighbo@latitude:~$ openoffice 
<dneighbo> I'm confused because I can't find OpenOffice's user files.
<dneighbo> Your ~/.sversionrc file tells they should be under /home/dneighbo/OpenOffice.org1.0,
<dneighbo> but they are not. Please fix the situation manually.
<dneighbo> You may want to edit ~/.sversionrc to indicate where is OO
<dneighbo> installed, or remove it if you did remove your installation
<dneighbo> directory manually (you bad one).
<dneighbo> dneighbo@latitude:~$ rm ~/.sversionrc 
<dneighbo> ==========
<dneighbo> (you bad one) rofl
<ajmitch> haha
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> bad bad masta
Action: dneighbo couldnt stop laughing as it made me think of ...
<dneighbo> "you're a bad one mister grinch"
Action: dneighbo hugs his deb and his custom slide show
<dneighbo> and then goes to tend to laundry before mrs. masta comes home and thumps the snot out of me
<ajmitch> lol
<chillywilly> you are now reduced to laundry slave ;)
<chillywilly> your masta status is in limbo
Action: dneighbo returns
<dneighbo> ajmitch: re 'ok for toy databases'
<dneighbo> soon very soon jbailey will show his true debian diety status
<dneighbo> and you will just apt-get install db-bliss
<dneighbo> and SAP-DB will be on your debian machine ;)
<ajmitch> *cough*
<ajmitch> why would i want to infect my box with that? :)
<chillywilly> I thought SAP was the enemy? ;)
<chillywilly> er, one of them anyway
<Remosi> can anyone tell me why (At least in the KC) it was agreed to use "mm/dd/yy"?
<Remosi> for internal date formats?
Action: chillywilly is not guilty on all counts of internal date format
<ajmitch> Remosi: probably because of the unhealthy american influence
<Remosi> yeah
<Remosi> well, it's not y2k compliant, it's ambigious compared to the european format of dd/mm/yyyy, and it doesn't sort properly :)
<Remosi> yyyy-mm-dd seems to be a much more logical system to use
<ajmitch> yes
<Remosi> theres even a ISO standard about it
Action: ajmitch certainly prefers it
<ajmitch> makes sorting in a list much simpler
<Remosi> well, if american's persist to use their silly systems we'll have to buy a few plane tickets and go and beat them around the head with a large, wet, and slightly smelly trout.
<dneighbo> um cause americans are the best
<Remosi> http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html
<Remosi> dneighbo: uh, sure :P
<dneighbo> and we dont want your puking metric system or messed up concept of date formatting
<ajmitch> the trout will no doubt be a bit smelly after that plane trip
<dneighbo> you can even take your stinking celsius too
Action: Remosi goes and prepares the fish
<dneighbo> btw im completely kidding
<dneighbo> only the french would use that as a reason ;)
<dneighbo> i mean after the dateline was stolen from them, who would blame them for their ire
<ajmitch> heh
<Remosi> true :)
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> notes form our LUG meeting...
<chillywilly> *********
<chillywilly> Help Desk
<chillywilly> *********
<chillywilly> Josh has girl problems.  We're not sure MLUG is really the proper
<chillywilly> forum for solving this problem.  However, if someone has suggestions, 
<chillywilly> he's open to them.
<Remosi> rofl
<Remosi> sounds like one of our local lug's discussions
<chillywilly> hehe, :)
<Remosi> however "Josh" may, or may not, have been participating in the discussion ;)
<chillywilly> how's this for am example:
<chillywilly> / Exception declarations                                                                                                  exception WhoSaidYouCouldStopCoding{string code_slave_name; };      
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> / Exception declarations
<chillywilly> exception WhoSaidYouCouldStopCoding{string code_slave_name; };
<chillywilly> this is going into my "kitchen sink" odl file
<chillywilly> :)
<Remosi> heh
<Remosi> cw, did you hear about my amazing .so->idl idea?
<chillywilly> nope
<Remosi> dang
<Remosi> you know how nm can tell you all the symbols in a .so (or .o for that matter) right?
<chillywilly> yes
<Remosi> and how "stabs" can tell you the type of a symbol if it was compiled with -g, or, alternatively, c++filt will tell you if it was compiled using gcc, right? :)
<chillywilly> never used that before
<Remosi> nm ~/irc/gnuworld/src/msg_W.o | c++filt
<Remosi> grab your favourite c++ .o, .so, or executable and tryt hat ;)
<chillywilly> is c++filt apt-gettable?
Action: ajmitch doesn't knoew where it is :)
<chillywilly> I don't see it either
<Remosi> it's in binutils
<Remosi> apt-get install binutils ?
<chillywilly> doh
<chillywilly> I have it installed
<Remosi> dpkg -S c++filt
<Remosi> binutils: /usr/bin/c++filt
<Remosi> binutils: /usr/share/man/man1/c++filt.1.gz
<Remosi> (you have a box without binutils?!)
<Remosi> :)
<chillywilly> nope, I have c++filt
<ajmitch> ah no, i see what i did
Action: ajmitch tried c++-filt for some reason
<Remosi> ajmitch: doh!
Action: chillywilly tries the command on libccgnu2
<Remosi> givin that type information you should be able to write an idl file (for gnurpc for instance)
<chillywilly> that shows every symbol right?
Action: ajmitch imagines it *could* be done
<Remosi> right
<Remosi> nm lists all symbols
<Remosi> eg: nm /lib/ld-linux.so.2
<Remosi> c++filt takes a mangled symbol and demangles it
<chillywilly> yea, yea...I knwo just saying why would I want to expose every symbol....er, or you saying expose all "functions"
<Remosi> eg:
<Remosi> echo 00000000 W validSubscript__CQ28gnuworld11xParametersRCUi | c++filt
<Remosi> produces:
<Remosi> 00000000 W gnuworld::xParameters::validSubscript(unsigned int const &) const
<Remosi> you need to of course figure out which symbols are actually defined in the .so/.a/.o that you're linking
<Remosi> but it could be a really easy way to automatically load, say, openssl into python
<Remosi> you could take the openssl.so file generate some idl for it, then use gnurpc to use openssl as if it was a python module
<Remosi> without having to spend ages defining all the normal glue logic
<Remosi> if you did it right python could catch the import function and do all of that automatically
<Remosi> so you could have a .so (eg openssl.so) and then just go "import openssl" in python and have it do all the work for you ;)
<ajmitch> also may open up licensing holes :)
<Remosi> well true
<Remosi> but so does allowing multiple .c files in a gcc invocation :)
<Remosi> anyway
<Remosi> I've gotta go have dinner
<Remosi> BBL
Action: Remosi has to go read up on stabs :)
<chillywilly> I want to know how gnurpc loads the .so?
<chillywilly> s/?//
<ajmitch> bbl

<siesel> hi drochaid :)
<siesel> seems that is has been quite silent here during the last hours
<drochaid> I only got in 5 mins before you
<drochaid> no one welcomed me </sniff>
<siesel> oh, drochaid, I feel with you <a tear is falling down>
<siesel> btw. do you know something about accounting?
<reinhard> hey
<reinhard> hello drochaid
<reinhard> and welcome
Action: reinhard hugs drochaid
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> allo reinhard :)
<reinhard> :)
<siesel> hi reinhard
<drochaid> siesel: I know very very little about accounting .. I tend to leave that to my bro [a chartered accountant and auditor ;)]
<reinhard> siesel: you have questions about accounting?
<reinhard> i might be able to help
<siesel> yes, especialy about the differences between german and american accounting.
<reinhard> uh
<reinhard> oh
<reinhard> i'm happy that i've learned the basic differences between austrian and german accounting :)
<siesel> lol
<reinhard> from what i understand american accounting serves a different purpose
Action: drochaid uses Scots Business law when it comes to accounting
<reinhard> read: austrian/german accounting is done mainly to satisfy the tax authority
<reinhard> and to calculate the taxes to pay
<siesel> A friend told me that I should write my master thesis about the difference between chinese (quite similar to american) and german accounting
<reinhard> us american accounting seems to me to replace what we have in german "controlling" or "kostenrechnung" as well
<reinhard> i.e. it serves as a source of information for the management and/or the investors
<siesel> i.e. american accounting is just a kind of GuV ?
<reinhard> don't think that
<siesel> GuV = Gewinn & Verlust Rechnung ( don't know the english equivalence)
<reinhard> i would believe us accounting does _more_ than german accounting
<reinhard> sometimes i also get the feeling that us accounting doesn't have the strict concept of systematic account numbers
<siesel> hmmm, I thought german accounting would allready be kind of too much (especial for lasy students who have to understand it ;) )
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> night all
<siesel> but if you say they have _more_, what is it us accounting has more?
<reinhard> siesel: probably dneighbo is the one here knowing most about accounting
<reinhard> the are more detailed
<reinhard> (at least that is my understanding)
<reinhard> they do "kostenstellen" and "kostenarten" and "kostenträger" etc. all in accounting
<siesel> ok, I will ask dneighbo, 
<reinhard> although i could misunderstand that

<chillywilly> te window manager config stuff?....I know I set the meta key properly in there somewhere...at least I though

<nickr> the meta thing is X keymap related
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> ok

<ajmitch> nickr: how useful, i guess you have a standing hatred for distutils now? :)
<nickr> booja
<nickr> so basically you'll have to let it install in its fgake root, then move everything into place
<nickr> which I found annoying but I guess its acceptable if you're into it
<ajmitch> ugly as hell
<ajmitch> oh yeah, i'm right into S-M ;)
<nickr> but if you need any help, I'd be glad to *help* ;)
Action: ajmitch anticipates long hours of pain
<nickr> hehe
<nickr> its not so bad, I'm just a perfectionist
<ajmitch> alright
<ajmitch> i'll probably get you & jbailey to sponsor them :)

<ajmitch> hi dneighbo
<dneighbo> hi
<dneighbo> playing with more gui tools, im pretty impressed with the progress, shame i dont really find value in them for most things
<dneighbo> but its good to know when evangelizing
<ajmitch> great
<dneighbo> jbailey: you really here
<jbailey> dneighbo: Maybe. =)
<dneighbo> btw: woody is really solid (many kudos) if only they would release it
<jbailey> What'cha need?
<dneighbo> wondering how SAP-DB was going
<dneighbo> and whether dcl made it in to sid or not
<dneighbo> i.e. just being a pain :)
<ajmitch> dneighbo: i'm getting complaints about the install instructions & stuff with gnue forms, etc :)
<jbailey> sap-db was untouched this weekend.  It's all on my work machine.
<jbailey> I haven't seen the ACCEPTED message for dcl yet, but I did see the NEW notification, so I know it was received.
<jbailey> I except sap-db to be in a reasonable first-snapshot state by next weekend.
<dneighbo> ajmitch: complaints from where on what
<dneighbo> jbailey: yummy
<jbailey> So, basically with sapdb-client, sapdb-server, and maybe a sapdb-docs packages
<dneighbo> well you know where to find a tester :)
<jbailey> dneighbo: I'm kvitching again. =)
<ajmitch> dneighbo: not allowed to say where, he didn't give much detail ;)
<dneighbo> i can test on woody and sid for you
<dneighbo> jbailey: as stated before if one must make makefiles for the debs certainly do so
<jbailey> dneighbo: Cool.  It'll all be targetted at sid.
<jbailey> dneighbo: It would be nice to have a clean 'make install' target.  Right now I'm copying files by hand into the right place, so I worry that I'll miss things in upgrades.
<ajmitch> talked to nickr about making gnue debs, could require a certain love of s-m
Action: ajmitch wonders why each component is in it's own dir for downloads
<jbailey> dneighbo: Perhaps once Andrew finishes the GNUe debs, I can work from that example to still build you your cross-platform installer.
<dneighbo> jbailey: i think we plan to make that python and part of gnue-common
<dneighbo> an installer that is
<dneighbo> eventually we will have to mimic something like apt for our actual packages(applications) not tools
<jbailey> Ah okay.  I was thinking with that installed I had showed you before on sourceforge.
<jbailey> It looked like it would do a nice job (and was already written)
<jbailey> Whatever works best for you, obviously. =)
<dneighbo> i dont remember the other
<dneighbo> best to ask jamest
<dneighbo> as i think he pretty much has the internals done for a xplatform installer
<dneighbo> i.e. to make the linux installer like the windows one (visual and such) for those silly enough to not use debian :)
<jbailey> Ah, cool.
<jbailey> *lol*
<jbailey> BTW, remember you can also use alien to generate rpms. =)
<dneighbo> that would be very cool
<dneighbo> i no longer have a red hat or windows system to test things :)
<jbailey> No windows system.  Nice!
Action: dneighbo is 100% debianite now
<dneighbo> no windows for about 6 months now
<dneighbo> no red hat as of last weekend
<dneighbo> now im hooked on my laptop again :)
<jbailey> I still have windows for the games.
<dneighbo> with new kernel, shiny new journaling file system and a brand spanking new grub loader
<dneighbo> yummy
<dneighbo> i plan on using win4lin for some things
<dneighbo> mainly kids games
<dneighbo> i have railroad tycoon 2, civ CTP and some other linux games from loki that keep me fairly entertained in limited game time i do have
Action: ajmitch doesn't play many games
<ajmitch> have been windows free for about 3 years
<ajmitch> only been hooked on debian for 18 months tho
<chillywilly> dneighbo: did you see the article about the plug and Marcopia county?
<chillywilly> on LT
<dneighbo> which one
<chillywilly> one sec...
<dneighbo> its been on source forge
<dneighbo> and slashdot (more than once)
<chillywilly> maybe it was newsforge that I saw it on
<dneighbo> the newsforge one was ok
<dneighbo> the comments were bs
<dneighbo> and could EASILY be disputed, but politically it would be wrong for me to do so

<chillywilly> satellite
Action: ajmitch dislikes uppercase names in tarballs
<chillywilly> speaking of which
<chillywilly> our buddy Goran is thinking about naming his band "satellite down"
<chillywilly> what do you guys think?
<dneighbo> um what ever floats their boat :)
<chillywilly> crazymike has live recordings of The Gufs (Goran's "former" band) and Goran's new stuff at http://crazymike.dyndns.org
<chillywilly> you need the xmms-shn plugin though (trying to switch him to flac - http://flac.sourceforge.net)
<chillywilly> it doesn't believe in lossy compression for audio ;)
<ajmitch> hmm, how to package gnue-common with it's myriad deps? ;)
<chillywilly> s/it/he/,  :o
Action: chillywilly is sneezing and his nose is running this means sleep is definitely needed
<ajmitch> designer will be fairly simple compared to common
<dneighbo> what is flac
<dneighbo> shn is a lossless format
<chillywilly> we also put up ths board - http://goran.kicks-ass.org...I am running apache as a virtual server answering that previous url and the board one
<chillywilly> flac is Free Software
<chillywilly> shorten is not
<chillywilly> ;)
<dneighbo> shn is the format all the tape traders use
<dneighbo> its basically a compressed wav
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> I know
<dneighbo> cuts wav in half without lossing any quality
<chillywilly> so does flac
<chillywilly> I hear it gets better compression
Action: dneighbo still think that losing quality is ok (human ear is only so good) to preserve space
<chillywilly> hehe, ;)
<dneighbo> also its little known fact but the ogg vorbis spec states that you can do lossless compression/encoding in .ogg
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> I'll have to let mikey know
<chillywilly> btw, we are setting up somehting to stream Goran's music on WOPN ;)
<dneighbo> i.e. master sources should be highest quality possible but unless you are doing studio work or professional work the quality of bitrates by .mp3(sic) are functional (better than FM radio)
<chillywilly> dneighbo: WOPN is in dire need of good tunes that are freely available
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> they seem to play a LOT of techno crap
<chillywilly> or whatever they can broadcast for free
<chillywilly> (megman remixes and goofy shit like that)
<dneighbo> These two general mechanisms are particularly well suited to coupling due to the structure of Vorbis encoding, as we'll explore below, and using both we can implement both totally lossless stereo image coupling [bit-for-bit decode-identical to uncoupled modes], as well as various lossy models that seek to eliminate inaudible or unimportant aspects of the stereo image in order to enhance bitrate. 
<chillywilly> megaman
<dneighbo> from

<chillywilly> uhuh
<chillywilly> thanks
gnuebot (eggdrop@mail.libertydistribution.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> same document
<dneighbo> under stereo models
<dneighbo> Using polar mapping and/or channel interleaving, it's possible to couple Vorbis channels losslessly, that is, construct a stereo coupling encoding that both saves space but also decodes bit-identically to dual stereo. OggEnc 1.0 and later uses this mode in all high-bitrate encoding.
<dneighbo> Overall, this stereo mode is overkill; however, it offers a safe alternative to users concerned about the slightest possible degredation to the stereo image or archival quality audio.
#gnuenterprise: mode change '+o gnuebot' by ChanServ!ChanServ@services.
<chillywilly> lol
<dneighbo> i like how they add the last paragraph about OVERKILL
<chillywilly> people like mike and all the tapers
<dneighbo> but safe alternative for the stereo freaks
<chillywilly> :)
<dneighbo> btw: i have a cubemate that is hardcore tape trader

<nickr> Monk is quite excellent, I have to say.
<chillywilly> don't laugh but I just saw fght club for the first time the other day
<chillywilly> that is a wacked movie
<chillywilly> er, fight club
Action: chillywilly doesn't see may movies
<nickr> Its based on a lot of true things, which is the scary part
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> the scary thing is how he gets so many followers who he leads like sheep, imho
<chillywilly> this reminded me of hitler or something like that
<chillywilly> people really are this desparate to "belong" to something
<chillywilly> I dunno that movie had some really deep philosphical overtones
<nickr> I think his motives were essentially good, though
<chillywilly> it was pretty cool
<nickr> if not his methods
<chillywilly> I should watch it again
<nickr> yea
<nickr> its much better thes second time
<nickr> cause you see tyler very early on many times
<ajmitch> ok
<chillywilly> tell you the truth at first viewing, until the little twist came in, I wasn't really diggin it all that much
<nickr> Heh.
<nickr> I dug it even the first viewing
<ajmitch> nickr: got any hints on how i should do gnue-common? ;)
<chillywilly> well tyler was just a jag and seemed to be picking on eddy norton too much for my tastes...but I'm a softie
<nickr> ajmitch: well it'll involve several chickens.
<ajmitch> nickr: ooh, sounds fun
<chillywilly> and the removing of their heads
<chillywilly> the slatterning of chicken blood
<chillywilly> and voodoo curses
<chillywilly> rituals even
<nickr> ajmitch: lets see, theres a certain argument that you pass to setup.py that'll make a directory the 'fake /'
<nickr> ajmitch: so do that with a temp directory, then move all the files in there to their right spots
<ajmitch> nickr: yup, caught that, i'm just wondering about all the db dirvers
<nickr> oh
<nickr> iirc they aren't 'required' at build time
<chillywilly> nickr: btw, how's life treating you?
<nickr> if thats the case, make them recommended, and let it pick them up automatically
<nickr> chillywilly: pretty good
Action: ajmitch could try for record package counts & split each into a separate package :)
<nickr> ajmitch: yea, I'd recommend against that
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> go for it man!
<nickr> ajmitch: because its all runtime, not compile time, I thikn
<ajmitch> nickr: it'd be a pain to have a package with a single .py file in it :)
<ajmitch> certainly
<nickr> should I drop 180$ on headphones?
<chillywilly> yea, live a little

<ajmitch> hi Remosi
<Remosi> aj!

<ajmitch> don't look at dneighbo & mdean like that :)
<Remosi> heh
<ajmitch> how's it working?
<Remosi> so so
<Remosi> needs some hand hacking at the moment
<Remosi> and I'm only doing c<->c and no RPC inbetween
<Remosi> but proof-of-concept is functional :)
<ajmitch> yep
<chillywilly> is this the loading .so via rpc idea?
<chillywilly> Remosi: I'm not sure I unstood how that is supposed to work
<chillywilly> perhaps you can email me at chillywilly@gnuenterprise.org as I need to got o bed now
<chillywilly> night all

<dneighbo> Remosi: why scowl at us?
<dneighbo> we fixed the problem
<Remosi> Well thats true :)
<Remosi> better than most :)
<dneighbo> we even provided debs so its easier for people to fix the problem :)
<Remosi> no insult intended :)
<dneighbo> you have homepage for bugtraq?
<Remosi> http://www.securityfocus.com/ IIRC
<dneighbo> cool i was there but not seeing link
<dneighbo> i found link now
<dneighbo> btw: in some ways dcl isnt even on real 'version' numbers so releasing it to bugtraq seems kind of odd
<Remosi> yeah
<Remosi> oh well
<Remosi> I guess they used it
<dneighbo> but there are people using it in production so its understandable i guess
<Remosi> http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/282193/2002-07-12/2002-07-18/0
<Remosi> thats the posting
<dneighbo> yeah Ulf sent it to me
<dneighbo> he was actually really great to work with
<dneighbo> provided samples of how to exploit
<Remosi> php is a b'stard of a thing to get secure
<Remosi> yeah
<dneighbo> and gave us a month before releasing publicly so we could fix
<Remosi> Yeah, those kinds of people are really nice
<Remosi> it's the people that post bugs to bugtraq first
<dneighbo> w/o totally leaving our users in the hole
<Remosi> that are irritating
<dneighbo> well for once i was on other side of fence
<Remosi> although, better than the ones that just expoit them and don't tell you at all :)
<dneighbo> it was a catch 22
<dneighbo> i wanted to notify all dcl users immediately
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> to do so 'overly' publicly would be remiss as no patch was available
<Remosi> you have to patch the hole first :)

<dneighbo> i just didnt specifically say what they were
<dneighbo> until i had committed the fix for each one
<Remosi> yeah, I saw you guys mention it on here
<dneighbo> then bundled when all were done and did full blow release
<dneighbo> to freshmeat, all announce lists and such and ulf gave us like a week after release to let the users patch
<dneighbo> which i think was fair
<Remosi> thats very nice in fact
<ajmitch> yes, you'd be happy that he was the one to handle it :)

<reinhard> morning
<dneighbo> you know what synaptic is pretty cool
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> it has an ugly interface
<nickr> its NeXTish
<nickr> I like it.
<nickr> but Its annoying to USE
<dneighbo> i wasnt complaining about the 'visuals'
<dneighbo> as much as some of the layout and such isnt highly intuitive
<dneighbo> for say someone that Lindows or Lycoris is targeting
<dneighbo> i like it as it uses raw debian names for things and such
<dneighbo> but it would be cool to see a very 'stupid user' interface
<dneighbo> with categories of software
<dneighbo> and little pretty icon pictures
<dneighbo> and good descriptions and the likes
<dneighbo> if you have it already its in your 'installed bucket'
<dneighbo> and an update will show if new version is avaiable and you check if you want to upgrade or not
<dneighbo> and new packages you check if you want
<dneighbo> dont get me wrong its a good start
<dneighbo> but i think most people that it would be useful for probably would be as well off with command line
<dneighbo> and | grep :)
<dneighbo> hmmm wow long time no listen to my playlist (seems like weeks)
<dneighbo> and some suicidal tendencies comes on
<dneighbo> i remember listening to this once upon a time and people were like who the heck is that?
<dneighbo> and thought i was nuts
<nickr> you don't have to grep aynmore, you can use multiple keywords with apt-cache search
<dneighbo> then at one point mike muir actually achieved some success
<dneighbo> nickr: i generally use dpkg --list |grep mybliss
<nickr> ah.
<dneighbo> though slowly i have started using apt-cache more and more
<dneighbo> why is it any time i 'upgrade' within 10 seconds of doing so i have the need to apt-get something
<dneighbo> and end up twiddling thumbs until the upgrade is done :)

<Arturas> Hi jamest :)
<jcater> Arturas: I just don't understand what's going on
<jcater> I'll need to look at the code in context of the file
<ra3vat> jcater: datetime is represented in long format and in localized form is not accepted by db backend
<jcater>  sure
<ra3vat> Arturas: am i right?
<jcater> that's the purpose of _dateTimeFOrmat
<jcater> that string needs to be changed from the "localisation" code to whatever explicit format is needed
<jcater> besides
<jcater> you shouldn't be making postgres-specific changes in _dbsig
<jcater> or you'll break all the other drivers
<Arturas> mhm
<Arturas> it was a problem in SQL query like "...WHERE month='May'..." works fine
<Arturas> but "...WHERE month='Geguþë'..." breaks everything
<Arturas> that's why localised query is bad
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I get that
<jcater> I understand the problem
<jcater> I just don't agree with the solution
<jcater> that was the purpose of _dateTimeFormat
<jcater> (or whatever it is called)
<jcater> right now that is producing localized dates
<jcater> and it shouldn't
<jcater> which means it should be changes
<jcater> s/changes/changed
<Arturas> mm
<Arturas> i changed it so that now it gives fixed 'YEAR-MONTH-DAY HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND' format
<Arturas> not the localised one
Action: Arturas does not understand something here
<jcater> why the string.split code then?
<Arturas> that's another story :)
<Arturas> postgress can't handle date\time format '2002-12-31 23:59:59,99'
<Arturas> so i cut away last 3 chars
<Arturas> but i chose wrong file :(
Action: jcater then thinks the _dateTimeFormat is wrong then
<Arturas> rrrrrrrrrrrrrr
<Arturas> postgress database date\time format is with ....,99 
<Arturas> it holds date\time with ...,99
<Arturas> but it does now accept such format in queries :/
<Arturas> but it does not accept such format in queries :/
<jcater> ok
<jcater> so are you saying the ,99 is required when updating or inserting
<jcater> but must be omitted in WHERE clauses?
<Arturas> the ,99 is not required in queries at all, but postgress adds them to data type 'date\time'. If i add ,99 somewhere in query, i get an error about typecasting
<Arturas> when form reads data from database, it reads all ,99
<Arturas> and when update/delete query is formulated, it has '... ,99..... ,99...' and it does not work
<Arturas> i guess i chose a wrong file for this change
<Arturas> and buggy decission
<Arturas> :/

<perlhead> Hi all! Any pointer on where forms gets its fonts?
<perlhead> Just installed PAPO. Everything looks good, but the font is hideously large.
<perlhead> And the encoding is not ISO-8859-1, which sucks too.
yogurt2unge (~charlie@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ra3vat> perlhead: there are a few font parameters in gnue.conf
<perlhead> ra3vat: yep, but they only let you choose whether you want monospaced fonts.
<perlhead> There's even a comment in the gnue.conf:
<perlhead> # Normally, default font style and size is used, according to the active theme
<perlhead> But it doesn't mention which "theme" we're talking about. It sure doesn't use my gtk theme's settings...
<ra3vat> perlhead: but at least size you can change there :) 
<ra3vat> <perlhead> Just installed PAPO. Everything looks good, but the font is hideously large.
<ra3vat> :)
<perlhead> Not really: "# Font size if fixedWidthFont = 1 (ignored otherwise)"
<perlhead> It doesn't work if fixedWidthFont == 0
<ra3vat> may be monospaced is best for now, do not know about theme 
<ra3vat> other encodings should work also
jcater (~jason@65.105.10.202) joined #gnuenterprise.
<perlhead> The default is proportional... I guess that indicates that it works.
<perlhead> jcater: Hi! you're the forms man here, right?
<perlhead> Having some trouble with my fonts...
<perlhead> Just installed PAPO. Everything looks good, but the font is hideously large.
<perlhead> And the encoding is not ISO-8859-1, which sucks too.
<jcater> PAPO's encoding is not ISO-8859-1
<jcater> ?
<jcater> btw, you probably wanna change pointSize=10 (or so) in your gnue.conf
<jcater> somehow the default was increased and got passed us the last release
<perlhead> It's not ISO-8859-1???
<jcater> I am not too familiar with PAPO
<jcater> but it is written specifically for Argentina iirc
<jcater> and I'm not sure what encoding they used
<jcater> btw, the ISO-8859-1 line was a question :)
<jcater> i.e., PAPO's encoding is not ISO-8859-1?
<perlhead> yogurt2unge is sitting next to me, he tells me it's ISO-8859-1
<perlhead> gnue.conf says pointSize is for fixed with only...
<jcater> um
Action: jcater didn't know forms worked properly w/o fixed width fonts
<jcater> I haven't tested it that way
<perlhead> It worked for the size. The comments in gnue.conf are misleading:
<perlhead> # The next 2 options are only used by the wxPython clients
<perlhead> # Normally, default font style and size is used, according to the active theme
<perlhead> # Set this to 1 if you want fixed width fonts
<perlhead> #fixedWidthFont = 1
<perlhead> Gives the impression that the default is fixedWidthFont=0
<jcater> true
Action: jcater will change that
<ra3vat> jcater: if i have multitabbed form and i do query on one tab (data looks great) then go to another tab, run query there, data looks great also on that tab but cleared on the first one
<ra3vat> how to change that?
<jcater> not sure
<perlhead> jcater: great.
<perlhead> jcater: As to the encoding: the form I'm executing begins with "<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>"
<jcater> so, what's the issue?
<perlhead> Weird thing is, it yogurt2unge's machine it works fine, but not in mine.
<perlhead> I get ciryllic characters instead of accented ones.
<ra3vat> perlhead: how it behave on yours?
<perlhead> I suspect it's because forms is picking a font with the wrong encoding... but I can't find out which.
<perlhead> Wait ! idea striking! Let me check...
<ra3vat> jcater: not sure - was it for me? it should not work that way or what?

<ariel_> jcater: i generated a gnue-schema.dtd and found some bugs.
fil_c (~username@public1-cosh3-3-cust12.cosh.broadband.ntl.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<ariel_> 1) the nice boxes around the comments are not recognized by nsglms ( and other parsers i think)
<ariel_> 2) an entity that must be further referenced must be defined as <!ENTITY % foo "bar"> and not <!ENTITY foo "bar">
<ariel_> 3) %true and %false are declared AFTER %boolean.
<jcater> ok
Action: jcater was wondering about #2
<jcater> as the sample dtd's I was learning from didn't have them
<jcater> but other ones I saw later did have them
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> wrt #1, how do you do comments in dtd's ?
<jcater> will <!-- --> not work?
<jcater> err
<jcater> I just committed fixes to #2 and #3
<jcater> but am still not sure about #1
<ra3vat> jcater: can you answer my question i've asked above?
<jcater> ra3vat: I'm not sure
<ra3vat> not sure what?
<ra3vat> is it expected behavior?
<ra3vat> where some mistakes unproper (settings) may exist? in my .gfd?
<jcater> I'm not sure if pages can be queried separately
<ra3vat> ok
<ra3vat> but if i hit f8,f9 on first tab(block), so getting all data why other datasources not queried with the same pattern (to get all data)? 
<ra3vat> or i should provide filter for each block before query would be raised?
<ariel_> try to generate gnue_schema.dtd
<ariel_> then open in emacs foo.xml
<ariel_> that contains only:
<ariel_> <? xml version 1.0 ?>
<ariel_> <!DOCTYPE schema SYSTEM "/foo/bar/gnue-schema.dtd">
<ariel_> <schema></schema>
<ariel_> then when xml-mode tries to parse the dtd complaints about the errors.
<ariel_> if you fix them by hand it parses it well
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> so I have to install emacs?
<jcater> grr
<ariel_> jcater: i'm also not sure on #1 but it seems me that is desturbing also sabcmd
<ariel_> i created a schema for a simple table that has the !DOCTYPE row
<ariel_> then when i run sabcmd with pgsql.xsl to get a .sql batch file it complaints about nested comments
<ariel_> may be changhing all the minuses with pluses will work.
<ariel_> let me check..
<ariel_> with all pluses it works
<ariel_> jcater: i don't think that you have to install emacs
<ariel_> altougth it is not a bad idea
<dneighbo> ra3vat i brought up same issue i think
<dneighbo> about pages being separate query wise
<dneighbo> i think jcater/jamest were 'split' on how to approach
<dneighbo> as some tiems you want the query to span pages other times you dont
<ariel_> the point is: until we have a working designer for schemas
<dneighbo> my particular sampel was i had like 5 table maint forms
<dneighbo> i was going to make into one form with 5 tabs
<dneighbo> and it caused grief :)
<jcater> well, yeah
<jcater> because you are trying to do 5 forms within one form
<ariel_> the best way to write xml documents is using emacs.
<dneighbo> what are we fussing trying to make a dtd for again?
<ariel_> and if you want from emacs all the nice features like inserting the elements semi-automatically
siesel (jan@dial-213-168-72-116.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.

<jamest> hi
<dneighbo> ToyMan: you still around?
<dneighbo> anyone here have manufacturing experience?
<dneighbo> yogurt2unge ?
<jcater> well
<jcater> I've manufactured excuses over the last year or so
<jcater> to keep working on GNUe
<dneighbo> rofl
<jcater> does that count?
<dneighbo> im just trying to think for first time in a while :)
<dneighbo> im seeing manufacturers that distribute/wholesale/retail as being an 'odd' animal
<dneighbo> but one that is more and more common with mom and pops and the internet
<dneighbo> ToyMan: is an example of that :)
<dneighbo> what im seeing packages lacking is they can do one or the other but not both
<dneighbo> i.e. you can get ok cheaper manufacturing packages but they dont do any retail or more importanting shipping stuff
<dneighbo> or you can get a quickbooks/peachtree for cheap that does retail ok but wont let you manage the manufacturing side
<dneighbo> i see the 'inventory problem' and the 'shipping problem' as the two areas where gnue can kick arse fast
<dneighbo> what im wondering is should inventory be separate tables for manufacturing and distribution
<ToyMan> yes, something that hooked into my ecomm package and played nice would be excellent
<dneighbo> i.e. have inventory tables for the the 'components' you use to manufacture
<dneighbo> and inventory tables for the 'products' you sell
<ToyMan> don't see the need for that
<dneighbo> or distribute
<dneighbo> ToyMan: im thinking out loud and hoping to get insight from you :)
<ToyMan> inv is inv
<dneighbo> in the quick talks i have had with others
<dneighbo> they seem to think its all the same
<ToyMan> dosn't matter whether dist or manuf.
<dneighbo> as you are stating here
<ToyMan> afaics
<ToyMan> yes, agreed
<dneighbo> but for me im seeing some disconnect
<dneighbo> im thinking you have inventory that use to 'build'
<ToyMan> we have fields in the inv table for designer (royalty)
<ToyMan> or supplier
<dneighbo> then you have an 'allocation' table 
<ToyMan> we use a BOM table for that
<dneighbo> that says you need xyz components to make product A
<ToyMan> very simple structure
<dneighbo> and so one feeds the other
<ToyMan> highly self referential
<dneighbo> so that if someone says i need 10 of A
<dneighbo> you select 10 of A
<dneighbo> and it will auto remove necessary components
<dneighbo> currently im hearing none of the packages others are evaluating do this and it drives them mad
<ToyMan> yes, that's what the inv/bom tables do in my app
<dneighbo> as they have to go manually take xyz off inventory
<ToyMan> no, *any* package that has a bom will do that
<ToyMan> it's just implemented badly, usually
<dneighbo> then build A
<dneighbo> then remove A
<dneighbo> i think i might see the light as to it being all one structure
<dneighbo> its just a matter of the 'allocation' table
<dneighbo> that says what things in inventory are needed to make product A
<ToyMan> allocation = bom?
<dneighbo> as i suppose its quite likely
<ToyMan> yes, bom is the standard term, i believe
<dneighbo> product A might be made of component x y and z
<ToyMan> Bill of Materials
<dneighbo> but product D
<dneighbo> might be product A plus component j
<dneighbo> sure Bill of Materials
<dneighbo> im dummy to the lingo so definitely 'educate' me :)
<ToyMan> dneighbo: my program is a 'hack', but we got the inventory thing down cold for small manuf.
<dneighbo> and i think what im calling allocation is what you are calling the bom
<dneighbo> i like that
<ToyMan> is there any way you can open the talbles i sent you?
<dneighbo> Dude you need GNUe, its the BOM!
<ToyMan> heh
<dneighbo> i could vnc and look
<ToyMan> if you open the bom, check it out..
<ToyMan> it's *very* simple structure
<ToyMan> i'll open it up for you
<ToyMan> just 3 fields, Assmemb, Part, Qty
<ToyMan> you can handle *any* situation with that
<ToyMan> an Assemb. can also be a Part
<dneighbo> just sec
<ToyMan> so that way you build up sub-assem
<ToyMan> ok, i've got a simple list bom query up
<ToyMan> and a typical bom structure for a product
<ToyMan> feel free to click around..
<ToyMan> I've got to go demolish a shed up at the new factory..
<ToyMan> the bom analysis is a little weird in the display
<ToyMan> lists components mult. times
<ToyMan> just the limitations of using Access there..
<ToyMan> but, it's basically a tree structure
<ToyMan> with the finished product on the left
<ToyMan> and branching to subassem and finally raw materials all the way on the right
<ToyMan> ok, gotta go, bbiaw

Action: dneighbo_ isnt sure
<dneighbo_> i think if we restructured our current cvs cvs would work
<dneighbo_> also i found some killer new cvs features
<dneighbo_> where you can 'notify' someone if you are working on a set of files
<dneighbo_> and such
<jcater> dneighbo_: no, not really
<jcater> just observing other solutions

<dneighbo_> its not perfect but its interesting

<dkdk> its stupid
<dkdk> and not made by scientific spirit
<dneighbo> come on, accounting is FUN

<dneighbo> accoutning is easy
<dneighbo> its a debit or a credit

<ajmitch> enron had some creativity
<dkdk> wtf would time be cut ?
<dkdk> in an enterprise, where operations are continuous
<dneighbo> ?
<dneighbo> time be cut?
<dkdk> yes
<dkdk> accounting cuts time
<dneighbo> accouting cuts time?
<dneighbo> hmm this is news to me
