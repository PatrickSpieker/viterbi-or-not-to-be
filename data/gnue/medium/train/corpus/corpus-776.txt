<ajmitch> hi Remosi
<Remosi> aj!
Action: Remosi been experimenting with my idea
<ajmitch> don't look at dneighbo & mdean like that :)
<Remosi> heh
<ajmitch> how's it working?
<Remosi> so so
<Remosi> needs some hand hacking at the moment
<Remosi> and I'm only doing c<->c and no RPC inbetween
<Remosi> but proof-of-concept is functional :)
<ajmitch> yep
<chillywilly> is this the loading .so via rpc idea?
<chillywilly> Remosi: I'm not sure I unstood how that is supposed to work
<chillywilly> perhaps you can email me at chillywilly@gnuenterprise.org as I need to got o bed now

<dneighbo> Remosi: why scowl at us?
<dneighbo> we fixed the problem
<Remosi> Well thats true :)
<Remosi> better than most :)
<dneighbo> we even provided debs so its easier for people to fix the problem :)
<Remosi> no insult intended :)
<dneighbo> you have homepage for bugtraq?
<Remosi> http://www.securityfocus.com/ IIRC
<dneighbo> cool i was there but not seeing link
<dneighbo> i found link now
<dneighbo> btw: in some ways dcl isnt even on real 'version' numbers so releasing it to bugtraq seems kind of odd
<Remosi> yeah
<Remosi> oh well
<Remosi> I guess they used it
<dneighbo> but there are people using it in production so its understandable i guess
<Remosi> http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/282193/2002-07-12/2002-07-18/0
<Remosi> thats the posting
<dneighbo> yeah Ulf sent it to me
<dneighbo> he was actually really great to work with
<dneighbo> provided samples of how to exploit
<Remosi> php is a b'stard of a thing to get secure
<Remosi> yeah
<dneighbo> and gave us a month before releasing publicly so we could fix
<Remosi> Yeah, those kinds of people are really nice
<Remosi> it's the people that post bugs to bugtraq first
<dneighbo> w/o totally leaving our users in the hole
<Remosi> that are irritating
<dneighbo> well for once i was on other side of fence
<Remosi> although, better than the ones that just expoit them and don't tell you at all :)
<dneighbo> it was a catch 22
<dneighbo> i wanted to notify all dcl users immediately
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> to do so 'overly' publicly would be remiss as no patch was available
<Remosi> you have to patch the hole first :)

<dneighbo> i just didnt specifically say what they were
<dneighbo> until i had committed the fix for each one
<Remosi> yeah, I saw you guys mention it on here
<dneighbo> then bundled when all were done and did full blow release
<dneighbo> to freshmeat, all announce lists and such and ulf gave us like a week after release to let the users patch
<dneighbo> which i think was fair
<Remosi> thats very nice in fact

<reinhard> morning
<dneighbo> you know what synaptic is pretty cool
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> it has an ugly interface
<nickr> its NeXTish
<nickr> I like it.
<nickr> but Its annoying to USE
<dneighbo> i wasnt complaining about the 'visuals'
<dneighbo> as much as some of the layout and such isnt highly intuitive
<dneighbo> for say someone that Lindows or Lycoris is targeting
<dneighbo> i like it as it uses raw debian names for things and such
<dneighbo> but it would be cool to see a very 'stupid user' interface
<dneighbo> with categories of software
<dneighbo> and little pretty icon pictures
<dneighbo> and good descriptions and the likes
<dneighbo> if you have it already its in your 'installed bucket'
<dneighbo> and an update will show if new version is avaiable and you check if you want to upgrade or not
<dneighbo> and new packages you check if you want
<dneighbo> dont get me wrong its a good start
<dneighbo> but i think most people that it would be useful for probably would be as well off with command line
<dneighbo> and | grep :)
<dneighbo> hmmm wow long time no listen to my playlist (seems like weeks)
<dneighbo> and some suicidal tendencies comes on
<dneighbo> i remember listening to this once upon a time and people were like who the heck is that?
<dneighbo> and thought i was nuts
<nickr> you don't have to grep aynmore, you can use multiple keywords with apt-cache search
<dneighbo> then at one point mike muir actually achieved some success
<dneighbo> nickr: i generally use dpkg --list |grep mybliss
<nickr> ah.
<dneighbo> though slowly i have started using apt-cache more and more
<dneighbo> why is it any time i 'upgrade' within 10 seconds of doing so i have the need to apt-get something
<dneighbo> and end up twiddling thumbs until the upgrade is done :)

<Arturas> Hi jamest :)
<jcater> Arturas: I just don't understand what's going on
<jcater> I'll need to look at the code in context of the file
<ra3vat> jcater: datetime is represented in long format and in localized form is not accepted by db backend
<jcater>  sure
<ra3vat> Arturas: am i right?
<jcater> that's the purpose of _dateTimeFOrmat
<jcater> that string needs to be changed from the "localisation" code to whatever explicit format is needed
<jcater> besides
<jcater> you shouldn't be making postgres-specific changes in _dbsig
<jcater> or you'll break all the other drivers
<Arturas> mhm
<Arturas> it was a problem in SQL query like "...WHERE month='May'..." works fine
<Arturas> but "...WHERE month='Geguþë'..." breaks everything
<Arturas> that's why localised query is bad
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I get that
<jcater> I understand the problem
<jcater> I just don't agree with the solution
<jcater> that was the purpose of _dateTimeFormat
<jcater> (or whatever it is called)
<jcater> right now that is producing localized dates
<jcater> and it shouldn't
<jcater> which means it should be changes
<jcater> s/changes/changed
<Arturas> mm
<Arturas> i changed it so that now it gives fixed 'YEAR-MONTH-DAY HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND' format
<Arturas> not the localised one
Action: Arturas does not understand something here
<jcater> why the string.split code then?
<Arturas> that's another story :)
<Arturas> postgress can't handle date\time format '2002-12-31 23:59:59,99'
<Arturas> so i cut away last 3 chars
<Arturas> but i chose wrong file :(
Action: jcater then thinks the _dateTimeFormat is wrong then
<Arturas> rrrrrrrrrrrrrr
<Arturas> postgress database date\time format is with ....,99 
<Arturas> it holds date\time with ...,99
<Arturas> but it does now accept such format in queries :/
<Arturas> but it does not accept such format in queries :/
<jcater> ok
<jcater> so are you saying the ,99 is required when updating or inserting
<jcater> but must be omitted in WHERE clauses?
<Arturas> the ,99 is not required in queries at all, but postgress adds them to data type 'date\time'. If i add ,99 somewhere in query, i get an error about typecasting
<Arturas> when form reads data from database, it reads all ,99
<Arturas> and when update/delete query is formulated, it has '... ,99..... ,99...' and it does not work
<Arturas> i guess i chose a wrong file for this change
<Arturas> and buggy decission
<Arturas> :/

<perlhead> Hi all! Any pointer on where forms gets its fonts?
<perlhead> Just installed PAPO. Everything looks good, but the font is hideously large.
<perlhead> And the encoding is not ISO-8859-1, which sucks too.
yogurt2unge (~charlie@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ra3vat> perlhead: there are a few font parameters in gnue.conf
<perlhead> ra3vat: yep, but they only let you choose whether you want monospaced fonts.
<perlhead> There's even a comment in the gnue.conf:
<perlhead> # Normally, default font style and size is used, according to the active theme
<perlhead> But it doesn't mention which "theme" we're talking about. It sure doesn't use my gtk theme's settings...
<ra3vat> perlhead: but at least size you can change there :) 
<ra3vat> <perlhead> Just installed PAPO. Everything looks good, but the font is hideously large.
<ra3vat> :)
<perlhead> Not really: "# Font size if fixedWidthFont = 1 (ignored otherwise)"
<perlhead> It doesn't work if fixedWidthFont == 0
<ra3vat> may be monospaced is best for now, do not know about theme 
<ra3vat> other encodings should work also
jcater (~jason@65.105.10.202) joined #gnuenterprise.
<perlhead> The default is proportional... I guess that indicates that it works.
<perlhead> jcater: Hi! you're the forms man here, right?
<perlhead> Having some trouble with my fonts...
<perlhead> Just installed PAPO. Everything looks good, but the font is hideously large.
<perlhead> And the encoding is not ISO-8859-1, which sucks too.
<jcater> PAPO's encoding is not ISO-8859-1
<jcater> ?
<jcater> btw, you probably wanna change pointSize=10 (or so) in your gnue.conf
<jcater> somehow the default was increased and got passed us the last release
<perlhead> It's not ISO-8859-1???
<jcater> I am not too familiar with PAPO
<jcater> but it is written specifically for Argentina iirc
<jcater> and I'm not sure what encoding they used
<jcater> btw, the ISO-8859-1 line was a question :)
<jcater> i.e., PAPO's encoding is not ISO-8859-1?
<perlhead> yogurt2unge is sitting next to me, he tells me it's ISO-8859-1
<perlhead> gnue.conf says pointSize is for fixed with only...
<jcater> um
Action: jcater didn't know forms worked properly w/o fixed width fonts
<jcater> I haven't tested it that way
<perlhead> It worked for the size. The comments in gnue.conf are misleading:
<perlhead> # The next 2 options are only used by the wxPython clients
<perlhead> # Normally, default font style and size is used, according to the active theme
<perlhead> # Set this to 1 if you want fixed width fonts
<perlhead> #fixedWidthFont = 1
<perlhead> Gives the impression that the default is fixedWidthFont=0
<jcater> true
Action: jcater will change that
<ra3vat> jcater: if i have multitabbed form and i do query on one tab (data looks great) then go to another tab, run query there, data looks great also on that tab but cleared on the first one
<ra3vat> how to change that?
<jcater> not sure
<perlhead> jcater: great.
<perlhead> jcater: As to the encoding: the form I'm executing begins with "<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>"
<jcater> so, what's the issue?
<perlhead> Weird thing is, it yogurt2unge's machine it works fine, but not in mine.
<perlhead> I get ciryllic characters instead of accented ones.
<ra3vat> perlhead: how it behave on yours?
<perlhead> I suspect it's because forms is picking a font with the wrong encoding... but I can't find out which.
<perlhead> Wait ! idea striking! Let me check...
<ra3vat> jcater: not sure - was it for me? it should not work that way or what?

<ariel_> who is maintaining gnuedtd?
<jcater> me, sort of
<jcater> I'm not sure "maintaining" is a good word :)
<jcater> patches are welcome

<ra3vat> back
<ariel_> jcater: i generated a gnue-schema.dtd and found some bugs.
fil_c (~username@public1-cosh3-3-cust12.cosh.broadband.ntl.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<ariel_> 1) the nice boxes around the comments are not recognized by nsglms ( and other parsers i think)
<ariel_> 2) an entity that must be further referenced must be defined as <!ENTITY % foo "bar"> and not <!ENTITY foo "bar">
<ariel_> 3) %true and %false are declared AFTER %boolean.
<jcater> ok
Action: jcater was wondering about #2
<jcater> as the sample dtd's I was learning from didn't have them
<jcater> but other ones I saw later did have them
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> wrt #1, how do you do comments in dtd's ?
<jcater> will <!-- --> not work?
<jcater> err
<jcater> I just committed fixes to #2 and #3
<jcater> but am still not sure about #1
<ra3vat> jcater: can you answer my question i've asked above?
<jcater> ra3vat: I'm not sure
<ra3vat> not sure what?
<ra3vat> is it expected behavior?
<ra3vat> where some mistakes unproper (settings) may exist? in my .gfd?
<jcater> I'm not sure if pages can be queried separately
<ra3vat> ok
<ra3vat> but if i hit f8,f9 on first tab(block), so getting all data why other datasources not queried with the same pattern (to get all data)? 
<ra3vat> or i should provide filter for each block before query would be raised?
<ariel_> try to generate gnue_schema.dtd
<ariel_> then open in emacs foo.xml
<ariel_> that contains only:
<ariel_> <? xml version 1.0 ?>
<ariel_> <!DOCTYPE schema SYSTEM "/foo/bar/gnue-schema.dtd">
<ariel_> <schema></schema>
<ariel_> then when xml-mode tries to parse the dtd complaints about the errors.
<ariel_> if you fix them by hand it parses it well
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> so I have to install emacs?
<jcater> grr
<ariel_> jcater: i'm also not sure on #1 but it seems me that is desturbing also sabcmd
<ariel_> i created a schema for a simple table that has the !DOCTYPE row
<ariel_> then when i run sabcmd with pgsql.xsl to get a .sql batch file it complaints about nested comments
<ariel_> may be changhing all the minuses with pluses will work.
<ariel_> let me check..
<ariel_> with all pluses it works
<ariel_> jcater: i don't think that you have to install emacs
<ariel_> altougth it is not a bad idea
<dneighbo> ra3vat i brought up same issue i think
<dneighbo> about pages being separate query wise
<dneighbo> i think jcater/jamest were 'split' on how to approach
<dneighbo> as some tiems you want the query to span pages other times you dont
<ariel_> the point is: until we have a working designer for schemas
<dneighbo> my particular sampel was i had like 5 table maint forms
<dneighbo> i was going to make into one form with 5 tabs
<dneighbo> and it caused grief :)
<jcater> well, yeah
<jcater> because you are trying to do 5 forms within one form
<ariel_> the best way to write xml documents is using emacs.
<dneighbo> what are we fussing trying to make a dtd for again?
<ariel_> and if you want from emacs all the nice features like inserting the elements semi-automatically
siesel (jan@dial-213-168-72-116.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ariel_> you have to specify the DOCTYPE (i.e the dtd) in the xml (or gsd,gfd...) file

<siesel> :)
<chillywilly> nothing much really...just a small start
<chillywilly> but I should be able to spend a few hours on it tonight :)
<siesel> but not bad, I've added some code too, so if you have finished the parser you can test it with gtestcvs 4 4
Action: chillywilly looks at cvs commits list
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> so i can test the parser with your script now? groovy
<chillywilly> oh, I forgot to commit something
