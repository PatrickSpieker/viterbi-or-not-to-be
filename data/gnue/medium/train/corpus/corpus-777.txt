<siesel> hi all
<jcater> howdy
<siesel> how are you? 
<jcater> overworked
<jcater> underpaid
<jcater> and hungry
<jcater> same old thing :)
<siesel> sounds familiar
<siesel> btw. do you know why cvs is SOOOOO slow?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> some project on savannah hosted a p2p mldonkey server file
<jcater> so in a short period of time
<jcater> a multitude of distributed p2p clients have been pounding on savannah
<jcater> savannah is blocking that traffic, but the traffic is still taking up bandwidth before being dropped
<jcater> :(
<jcater> someone should take that project leader out back and cane him
<jcater> and hurt him really badles
<jcater> badly
Action: siesel thinks of using a 2000 kg trout 
<siesel> to slap him a bit
<siesel> where would you put an LDAP dbdriver? common/datasource/driver/ldap 
<siesel> or common/datasource/driver/special/ldap
<jcater> the first
<jcater> special/ is for stuff that's internal to gnue that the user wouldn't explicitly choose
<jcater> or such
<siesel> ok. I will put it at common/datasource/driver/ldap. 
Action: siesel hopes to get it working till the weekend
<jcater> that is cool
<jcater> an LDAP driver is something I've been dreaming of
<jcater> as I could use it too
<siesel> I will use it to manage samba-tng accounts in OpenLDAP. 
<siesel> for which purpose do you want to use it? 
<siesel>  /want/could/
<Vee2d2> sign reads: "If you're smoking, you better be on fire!"
<jcater> siesel: well, for one long term thing, I have all my contact information in an Oracle database
<jcater> I'd like for our LDAP clients (email, etc) to be able to access that info
<jcater> so to transfer that data would be nice
Action: jcater forgets the other stuff... but I remember thinking "boy, an LDAP driver would make this easier"

<revDeke> i did apt-get install dcl
<revDeke> now what the hell do i do?
Action: revDeke loves them personally, believe me when its someone other than me complaining... its well odd ;)
<jbailey> Ah, joy.
<jbailey> Perhaps this weekend.
Action: revDeke is thinking if you dont have time to do config stuff can i provide you like a one paragraph post install instruction list?
<revDeke> and have the deb pop up that blue deb screen that says ... you need to to the following <insert steps here> you can find this list at /usr/share/docs/dcl/install.html or something
<revDeke> i.e. so during the install it points them somewhere to get more information
Action: revDeke notes the deb is in production on at least 4 production sites

<revDeke> any postgres date field wizards around?

Action: revDeke vaguely fougth this battle in 6.5 about 2 years ago
<revDeke> and its raising its ugly head again, but i dont recall the specifics :)
Action: esv is not wizard anymore  :(
<jcater> no wizard
<jcater> but what's the question?
<revDeke> in a nutshell i think the problem is that postgres install A has date format of
<revDeke> YYYY-MM-DD
ra3vat (~ds@ics.elcom.ru) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> and install B has date format of
<esv> same as MySQL
<revDeke> YYYY-DD-MM
<revDeke> and so doing a dump B to A has issues
<revDeke> as 2003-28-02 is valid in B
<revDeke> but wont load into A as 28 isnt a valid month
<esv> hehehe, isnt that a locale problem? no it does not look like a locale problem
Action: revDeke thinks this is the problem
<revDeke> i know at install of postgres you can 'configure' this
<revDeke> i think i chose default of SQL_ASCII
<jbailey> How depresing.  I just figured out that I will spend 10 days and 10 hours walking to and from work this year.
<revDeke> but i have no clue how to change after the fact
<esv> quick and dirty: use sed/perl/awk to convert :)
<esv> rev: but you can create a database with different locales , cant you?
<revDeke> dont know :)

<esv> well, I was confused, you can create different instances with diferent character encodin, but I dont think this is related.
<esv> s/encodin/encodings/
<ra3vat> am i missed something?
<revDeke> not related
<revDeke> its a datestyle thing
<esv> ok, check the LC_TIME setting 
<esv> and to "initdb" for example the manual says to use --locale=fr_CA --lc-monetary=en_US, to set the locale to canadian french and use USA monetary system.
<esv> hope this helps have to run.

<jamest> some of the date field types are depreciated in the 7.3.x series

lupo (~lupo@pD9542108.dip.t-dialin.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> the database itself can handle input date in just about any std format
<jamest> try it on a test table
<revDeke> jamest: its a DATESTYLE problem
<jamest> insert '2002-28-01' into foo;
<jamest> insert 'Jan 01 2002' into foo;
<revDeke> 6.5 db has US (non european) conventions
<revDeke> 7.2 db has ISO with european conventions
<revDeke> i pg_dump'ed out of 6.5 using proper insert strings
<reinhard> jamest: insert 'Mothers Day 2002' into foo; ?
<reinhard> ;-)
<revDeke> and am doing a psql dbname < sqldump.out to import into 7.2
<revDeke> you can change DATESTYLE on the fly
<revDeke> just cant find someone that knows how to on command line
<lupo> hi
Action: revDeke thinks maybe i will do the 'load' from a psql session
<jamest> set DATESTYLE ?
<jamest> from the psql prompt?
<revDeke> jamest:
<revDeke> export PGDATESTYLE=us
<revDeke> then
<revDeke> psql -U user dbname < sqlfile.out looks like it just might work
<lupo> revDeke: yes, iirc that works
<revDeke> seems to be working
<revDeke> this is good real world postgres experience
<revDeke> i.e. having to migrate an app with lots of data from one distro to another going from 6.5 to 7.2 ;)
<revDeke> and upgrading the application that uses the data at same time
<revDeke> its almost liek work ;)
<revDeke> oh wait it is

<revDeke> i can not get this to work in postgres
<revDeke> n oone in the postgres channel can either
<revDeke> i think postgres 7.2 has a bug 
<revDeke> jamest how did you get 7.3 on woody?
<revDeke> oh got it to work
<revDeke> YES

<revDeke> sigh
<revDeke> i am trying to run packages only
<revDeke> i got it to work FINALLY
<jamest> regression test has sucsessfully completed 0 times for me
<jamest> i gave up on it in the 6.5.x days
<jamest> postgresql is worth installing from source
<jamest> the .debs have a nice habit of mad goat raping your data during an upgrade

<jcater> deb http://people.debian.org/~elphick/debian woody main
<jcater> Postgres 7.3.2
<jamest> i won't do it
<jamest> having it spit our online database out at me in little pieces was the last straw
<jcater> I have yet to do a successful .deb upgrade w/postgres either
<jamest> building from source is simple and works exactly as advertised
<jamest> plus I like controlling when my db upgrades 
<jamest> that said I think ash postgresql is .deb installed
<jcater> my only issue w/that
<jcater> is all the postgres support libraries I ahve to dick with 
<jcater> like python, zope, etc
<jamest> i've not had much issue with that
Action: revDeke had 7.2 upgrade to 7.3 last week on debian work in sid
<jamest> WHAT!
<revDeke> but i have had it fail lots too 
<jamest>  /msg jcater something worked for HIM?
<jamest>  /msg jcater nothing works for him.....didn't we plan it that way?
<jcater>  /msg jamest doubtful... my guess is he doesn't yet realize it dropped the timestamp columns
<jamest> lol
<revDeke> as evidenced by fact im running 6.5 in production still, i dont plan on upgrading DB at every release :)
<jamest> I think 7.3.2 is worth it
<revDeke> jcater actually i did as dcl has lots of them, and its going to be 'fun' to fix
<revDeke> another reason 7.2 is fine for me right now :)
<jamest> actually every 7.x has been worth it
<jamest> just not the x.0 releases :)
<revDeke> jamest: i totally agree with that

<derek> jbailey: do you know if you can get source code for opera?
<jbailey> I don't know.
<jbailey> Is it something worth looking for?
<derek> no
<derek> just curious
<lupo> derek: i doubt that very much. you'd have to negotiate a source license with Opera
<lupo> if you want to see a well-written free browser, look at khtml :)
Nick change: SachaS -> Sacha_lunch

<chillywilly> opera is non-free IIRC

<lupo> chillywilly: CSS sucks in konq?
<lupo> i hear that for the first time
<lupo> css has always worked fine for me
<lupo> the only browser that fucked up my style sheets was IE
<lupo> as I could have expected before i wrote my CSS stuff
<Vee2d2> baby, bbiab
<jbailey> lupo: IIRC, konq has some weird trouble with valid CSS2.
<jbailey> Positioning and all that.
<jbailey> Been awhile since I looked at it, though.
<chillywilly> konq does not handle CSS properly
<jbailey> Probably fixed now, since that would mean that wired's site would be screwed, among others.
<chillywilly> it's not
<chillywilly> heck I was developing a web site the last few days and konq sure doesn't honor padding or borders in divs
<chillywilly> nor did it handle image margins, IIRC
<chillywilly> needs some more work
<derek> jbailey: have an apache quesiton for you
<derek> i am using virtual hosts and symlinking some directories into them, but apaache logs those accesses to the default host? is there a workaround?
<lupo> derek: ... a buuuuug?
<derek> dont know asking you :)
<derek> is jamest coming back?
<derek> he would likely know
<derek> how about you jcater
<chillywilly> don't annoy the coders derek
<chillywilly> they're cranky
<chillywilly> subversions has got their undies all in a bunch
<derek> that happens when close to a release ;)
<derek> no crap
<derek> took me about 2 hours to update
<derek> btw: apache question is from someone at lug
<chillywilly> I forgive them though...
<chillywilly> I suppose
<jbailey> derek: Dunno off hand.  Is it going to the wrong logfile or being logged incorrectly?
<lupo> derek: if i had his config file, i could say something
<derek> wrong log file
<jbailey> I'd have to look at the config file to eliminate human error.
<derek> i have customlogs on the vhosts but because of the symlink the dire resolves to the documentroot of the default host
<lupo> because such a behavior seems odd. at the company i work for they have multiple setups of vhosts this way and it works there.
<jbailey> Shouldn't matter if the logging is happening through the vhost.
<derek> i will bring the logfile back some other day, but thanks though
<jbailey> I need to go to bed.
<jbailey> g'night all
Action: chillywilly has done apache vhosting, but doesn't play with that box anymore (vhosting on crazymike's box)

<chillywilly> hi dsmith 
<dsmith> Good Evening, chillywilly
<dsmith> galeon is borken in sid
<dsmith> :(
<chillywilly> apt-get install galeon-snapshot
<chillywilly> is that the one that is broke?
<chillywilly> nope, it works
<chillywilly> grab the gtk2 version
<dsmith> Hmm.  I thought it was just galeon.  It broke when mozilla-* upgraded recently.
<chillywilly> mine isn't broke I I upgraded like a few mins ago
<chillywilly> s/I I/I/
<dsmith> dsmith@sparky:~$ galeon
<dsmith> /usr/bin/galeon-bin: relocation error: /usr/bin/galeon-bin: undefined symbol: begin_assignment__13nsCOMPtr_base
<chillywilly> got mozilla-snapshot?
<dsmith> chillywilly: Do you have the aa-font mozilla package installed (fo you get aa fonts in moz and galeon?)
<dsmith> installing snapshot
<chillywilly> yea I have aa fonts
<chillywilly> I dunno if I have any special package for that
<chillywilly> I set that one env varibale to '1'
<chillywilly> GDK_XFT....something
<dsmith> Cool.  galeon-snapshot works!  It's a gtk2 thing alright.
<dsmith> All my bookmarks aren't in it though.
<dsmith> chillywilly: Thanks!
<chillywilly> cause it uses a diff dir
<chillywilly> ~/.galeon-snapshot
<chillywilly> so just copy them over
<chillywilly> no dsmith 
<chillywilly> s/no/np/
<chillywilly> oops
<dsmith> chillywilly: Yeah, I got em.
Action: dsmith was having galeon withdrawl
<chillywilly> heheh
Action: chillywilly is now running Gnome 2 again but basically cause the KDE debs I had installed were now dependent on some experimentl version of X that wasn't working here
<chillywilly> but I did miss Gnome in a way
<chillywilly> it's not so bad when you have a bit more RAM ;P
<dsmith> I don't use gnome. (I did install mrproject, which sucked in a lot of gnome though)
