<Arturas> hello
<derek> hi Arturas
<derek> you ever see M?
<Arturas> Hello Derek
<Arturas> yes, tomorrow will see him
anilp (~tell_anil@202.144.91.253) joined #gnuenterprise.
<anilp> Hi
<anilp> I am new to gnu enterprise
<anilp> Can any body help me
<anilp> Is anybody there
<derek> im here
<derek> getting ready to go to bed
<anilp> thanks derek
<derek> you have a quick question?
<anilp> :)
<derek> Arturas: tell him i said hello
<Arturas> derek: ok :)
<anilp> I am new to gnu enterprise. I have so many questions. 
<anilp> let me ask you this quick one
<Arturas> anilp: so go ahead :) we can at least try to help you :)
<anilp> I have a pc with win2000
<anilp> is it possible to get involved in the gnu enterprise development
<Arturas> yes :) of course :)
<Arturas> currently windows native usser interface is under development
<Arturas> and naturally it's possible to use gnue under windows
<Arturas> with other interfaces
<anilp> I would like to know more about the development environment and the technologies used
<Arturas> hm, python as a main language
<Arturas> databases...
Action: Arturas anyone else know some magic words? :)
<anilp> I do development in java and oracle is the database I use :)
suny (~zll_sy@210.83.202.175) left irc: 
<Arturas> java status i'm afraid is not very good
<Arturas> my knowledge might be a bit outdated
<Arturas> but java is basically stopped
<anilp> ok so the entire development happens only in python
<Arturas> and oracle seems to be supported
<Arturas> (personally i use postgresql and haven't tried oracle, so can't say about it for sure)
<Arturas> user interface is for curses, gtk2, qt, win32 and wx
<Arturas> some of them work not perfectly, but it's only a question of time
<anilp> If I want to install the gnu enterprise and use it where can I get the binaries
<Arturas> basic www is: http://www.gnuenterprise.org
<Arturas> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/current.php
<anilp> I am there :)
<Arturas> the ones that are lowest in the page
<anilp> Is it just one file GNUe-Tools-0.4.3-setup-debug-on.exe
<anilp> I am downloading the one for which debug is off
<Arturas> hm, there should be at least two of them - with debug-on and debug-off
<anilp> do you have an IDE
<Arturas> hm, if IDE stands for Intergrated Development Environment, then no
<anilp> so you use a simple text editor :)
<anilp> I have downloaded GNUe-Tools-0.4.3-setup-debug-on.exe what to do next
<Arturas> what's the size of a file?
<anilp> 9737Kb
<anilp> Is there any thing which I need to do before I install it
<Arturas> then you shouldn't need any dependencies
<anilp> let me install it 
<anilp> Help me to make a connection
<anilp> I have an "Editor for Connection string"
<Arturas> you have some time?
<anilp> tell me
<Arturas> i'll download the file for myself
<anilp> Sure
<Arturas> and run the install
<anilp> Sure
<Arturas> because i just can't tell what is the thing for
<anilp> ok
<Arturas> a minute or so
<Arturas> anilp: in what place do you get the question about Editor for Connection string?
<Arturas> i have run the setup and it hasn't asked me this
<anilp> after you run go to menu
<Arturas> menu => Start menu?
<anilp> I mean start -> GNUe
<anilp> Yes
<Arturas> ok
<Arturas> you click on gnue connections?
<anilp> yesw
<Arturas> this is to define your connection to the database
<anilp> Is there a place where I can find the db scripts to create the necessary schemas
<Arturas> hm, you create database yourself
<Arturas> that is
<Arturas> you use gnue forms to connect to your database and to
Nick change: SachaS -> SacaS_away
<anilp> But how... Is it documented any where
<Arturas> work with already existing there data
<anilp> Yes you are right
<anilp> Where can I get the db documentation
<Arturas> sorry to tell so, but documentation for this probably is in db
<anilp> ok, how can I access it
<anilp> :)
ra3vat__ (~ds@ics.elcom.ru) left irc: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)
<Arturas> mm, let me start for the other side - if you know what you need
<Arturas> you can manually create base schema
<Arturas> and then connect gnue to it
<Arturas> then work with data
<Arturas> gnue is not the tool to create db schemas
<Arturas> (maybe some of the main leaders could be more informative at this point)
<Arturas> for oracle there is something like sql plus (i don't remember the name exactly) in start menu
<Arturas> that allows you to connect to the db
<Arturas> and the you use usual sql to create tables
<anilp> assume if I already have the db with sample tables then I can just connect to it
<Arturas> yes :)
<Arturas> then you will probably need to create some form to display the data in these tables
<anilp> ok I have a database whose SID is say "testsid" and the host is say "testhost" and on port "1521"
<anilp> Then how will I make a connection
<Arturas> at first you'll have to give some name for this connection (Connection name)
<Arturas> then
<Arturas> it's oracle db?
<anilp> ok
<Arturas> if it's oracle - choose something about oracle in Provider feeld
<Arturas> there are two possible options
<Arturas> (or maybe more, if i missed some)
<anilp> I have choosen oracle (oracle)
<Arturas> ok
<Arturas> then you'll need host and port
<anilp> ok
<anilp> What to give for encoding
<anilp> and RPC Type
<anilp> and Transport
<Arturas> encoding - you can leave empty
<anilp> ok
<Arturas> and both rpc type and transport are for appserver
<Arturas> (just say 'ok' :)
<Arturas> you won't need it for now
btami (~tamas@ip102-205.ktv.tiszanet.hu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<anilp> ok how to submit this
<anilp> I don't see a ok button
<anilp> :)
<Arturas> hm
<Arturas> you do see menu
<anilp> yes
<Arturas> and a bit lower - row of icon
<Arturas> and a bit lower - row of icons
<Arturas> the first one, with floopy on it
<Arturas> is 'Save'
<Arturas> or it should be so :)
<anilp> It says save the record to the db
<anilp> I want to connect to the db
<anilp> any way I pressed it nothing happened
<Arturas> one moment
<Arturas> it did save
<Arturas> you can look at pure source
<Arturas> in
<Arturas> program files\gnue\etc\connections.conf
<anilp> yes it is done :)
<anilp> What is the next step
fixe (~fixe@dsl093-081-253.chi2.dsl.speakeasy.net) left irc: "Client exiting"
<Arturas> you can run gnue forms client to see some sample form
<Arturas> but basically you'll need to create a form for your db
<Arturas> and open it - it will be able to connect to your db and work with contents
<anilp> I have opened the GNUe Forms editor
<anilp> I don't see a menu option to connect to the database
<Arturas> one moment
<Arturas> File-> Connect to database
<Arturas> or something like that - i see localised version
<anilp> I don't have that option in File
<anilp> you just have save, clear form, print, exit
<Arturas> you have launched forms client or forms designer?
<anilp> ok let me launch the designer
<Arturas> :)
<anilp> I said connect to test the connection which I made
<anilp> nothing seems to happen :)
<Arturas> try to open tools->datasource editor
<anilp> one min
<anilp> It is blank
<Arturas> hm
<Arturas> ok
<Arturas> in tools menu
<Arturas> you should see 
<anilp> ok
<Arturas> object navigator
<Arturas> via it it should be possible to add new datasource with right mouse click on data sources
<anilp> yes I have opened it
<Arturas> and also in tools there is schema navigator
<Arturas> it should clearly show whether it's possible to connect to your db
<anilp> one min, let me try :)
<anilp> Can you help me creating one datasource, here it does not take any thing except for the db name
<Arturas> i can try, but are you trying to create a datasource in desiger?
<anilp> Is there any place where I can find documentation. I can just go through i
<anilp> it
Action: Arturas feels a bit lost
<Arturas> 1
<anilp> :)
<Arturas> from designer you only show what database you connect to
<Arturas> this database is called datasource
<Arturas> and connection to it is defined in the form we discussed in the same beginning
<Arturas> gnue connections
<Arturas> 2
<Arturas> documentation
<Arturas> one moment
<Arturas> there is some in program files\gnue\doc
<Arturas> other can be found in http://www.gnuenterprise.org/project/docs-all.html
<anilp> I think I need to go through this documentation. thanks for the help
<btami> hi Arturas, anilp
<anilp> I would like to have some general informtion about this project
<btami> i'v just read the log
<btami> if i read correct, anilp tries the packaged win wersion
<btami> it doesn't contain any drivers to Oracle
<Arturas> hi Bajusz
<Arturas> i didn't know that
<Arturas> :(
<btami> they are not gpl-ed, or what
<btami> anilp have to go and download it
<anilp> where can I get it
<btami> wait a min...
<btami> there is DCOracle at http://www.zope.org/Members/matt/doc2
<btami> or
<btami> cxOracle at http://www.computronix.com/utilities/
<btami> i typed this from gnue/common/README.databases
<btami> i'v never tried this links
<anilp> I am not able to access this link  http://www.zope.org/Members/matt/doc2
<anilp> I am not able to access either http://www.computronix.com/utilities/
<btami> try http://www.zope.org/Products/DCOracle
<anilp> there is nothing like products
<anilp> I am able to access 
<anilp> http://www.computronix.com/utilities.shtml
<btami> http://www.zope.org/Products/DCOracle/DCOracle-1.3.2.tgz/view
<anilp> looks like it requires python 2.3
<anilp> I am afraid, I need to leave now....  Can I have your email ids.
<anilp> A little introduction also -:)
<btami> use gnue@gnu.org list (http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnue)

<siesel> hi Jason
<jcater> morning
<chillywilly> hey home slice
<siesel> I've a "short" question about passing parameters to db drivers.
<jcater> ok
<siesel> parameters which are too "variable" to put them in the connection.conf file
<siesel> but it don't make sense to add them into a special crafted table name
<siesel> like the odbc and the oracle driver do
<jamest> do they need to change dynamically or are they hardcoded to the specific .gfd?
<siesel> It would be ok to make them hardcoded in the .gfd
Action: jcater is confused about what's special about these
<siesel> I need to pass a lot of parameters to the ldap db driver.
<jamest> ldap heirarachy does lookups differently
<siesel> especially some rules how to create new instances.
Action: jamest has rusty ldap knowledge though
<siesel> the main difference between ldap and sql is that ldap is a tree, and sql is "just" tables.
<siesel> so I just take one level out of that tree.
<jamest> can't the levels change too
<jamest> can't it be like
<jamest> cn.ou.person
<jamest> or
<jamest> cn.person
<jcater> and why could that not be the format for the table name?
<jamest> or cn.ou.foo.person
<siesel> i.e. tablename="ou_People" means that I access everything below ou=People.
<siesel> thats what I've done. but there is still some info missing.
<siesel> If I have the record (uid=siesel, cn=jan) then I could store it with the FQDN uid=siesel,ou=People and cn=jan,ou=People
<siesel> so I could use tablename="cn_%_ou_People" to choose the later case for new records
<jcater> wouldn't cn be a field?
<siesel> yes its a field and it can be part of the FQDN
<siesel> FQDN = the unique identifier of an record
<siesel> but using that kind of tablename, schema discovery would be very difficult to implement
<jamest> so your if your form was accessing people entries from an ldap database
<jamest> then the people could exist at various levels 
<jamest> and the form would need to find them all?
<siesel> yes.
<jcater> that sounds more like a primary key than a table name
<siesel> but to find them is no problem, because I'm doing a subtree search.
<siesel> the problem is: where should new persons go.
<siesel> yes the FQDN is a kind of primary key.
<jamest> ah so you need to specify where to insert new records
<jamest> a default location
<siesel> BTW is it possible to pass primary key information in the <datasource> tag at the moment?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> <datasource primarykey="...">
<siesel> great, so I can use that to pass something like "cn=%s,ou=%s" which would allow to store a record like
<siesel> cn=jan ou=sinologie into cn=jan,ou=sinologie,ou=People and
<siesel> cn=jamest ou=mathematics into cn=jamest,ou=mathematics,ou=People 
<siesel> great. I'll try that.
<siesel> thx
<chillywilly> yea, what he said

<chillywilly> guys if you have a table that has a reference to another one (and not using postgres with its cool REFERENCES keyword) how the heck do you make sure that when you enter a row that it gets properly referenced in another table?
<chillywilly> erm, assuming you enter both these entries at the same time
<chillywilly> (or hel even from your sql file with test data in it)
<chillywilly> i.e., create table Foo (BIGINT UNSIGNED ZEROFILL NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT primaryKey, ...) create table Bar (BIGINT UNSIGNED ZEROFILL NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT primaryKey, fooKey  BIGINT UNSIGNED ZEROFILL...)
<chillywilly> erm
<chillywilly> wrong order

<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> messed it up again ;P

<jamest> I'm going to hack hylafax to insert the faxes in format (foo) into a specific location and insert an entry into the db
<jamest> then forms or a java app will be used to assign them to the right accoutn
<jamest> i'm leaning toward forms
<chillywilly> they really have some lame ass shows on TV these days
<derek> java app
<chillywilly> "married by america"
<chillywilly> wtf
Action: derek goes to get the shotgun to put the 'old horse down'
Action: chillywilly works some sql magic
<derek> jamest: it might be a little overhead but could you use one of the python
<derek> pdf2html type libraries
<derek> to convert it to html and then 'display' the html in an html widget?
Action: jamest looks at his <image> forms support
<jamest> hmmmmm
<jamest> i may have to go that route
<derek> have you tried http://piddle.sourceforge.net/
<chillywilly> heh, what a name
<derek> chillywilly: i think its python image display, does little else
<chillywilly> Because of the not-so-positive connotations of the name "piddle", I have put together a a development version with the same functionality and interface under the the name "SPING" (Simple Platform Independent Graphics)
<jamest> that may be what I needed
<jamest> i'll look in a bit, thanks
<derek> no problem
<derek> hope it works

<derek> there is donut boy ask him
<jcater> glazed
<jcater> those are the best
<jcater> (was that the question?)
<jamest> you know of a python redering lib for ps/pdf documents
<jamest> i'm dealing w/ multipage faxes
<jamest> so png isn't really an option :)
<jcater> why not tiff?
<jamest> faxes are not real tiff
<jcater> they are tiff-f
<jamest> the tiff is a fax tiff to do the page breaks
<jamest> right
<jamest> the tif image handler in wx doesn't deal with it right
<derek> does PIL support tiff-f
<jamest> nor does the gimp
<jcater> but we aren't concerned about wx
<jcater> we are concerned about PIL, right?
<jamest> i didn't see it in pil's supported types either
<jcater> ghostscript is only free ps/pdf rendering I'm aware of
<jcater> off top of my head
