<lekma> hi everybody
<Arturas> hello
<lekma> someone available to help??
<Arturas> i can try :)
<lekma> "TypeError: 'intern' is an invalid keyword argument for this function" <-- error i get
<lekma> when i try to launch a form
<Arturas> it's your custom form? (not the one from the samples)
jcater (~jason@w202.z065105010.mem-tn.dsl.cnc.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<lekma> it's the layout.gfd form from samples/testcases/forms/layout
<Arturas> let me see it
<Arturas> one moment...
<lekma> which form should i test my install with ?
<jcater> forms/samples/intro/intro.gfd is usually a good first start
<lekma> jcater: i got the same error
<lekma> i install everything from cvs
<lekma> s/install/installed
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> can we get more of the traceback?
<jcater> err, error message

<lekma> DB000: TypeError: 'intern' is an invalid keyword argument for this function
<lekma> more?
<lekma> hmm i must say i'm a newbie concerning gnue...
<lekma> maybe i did forget something...
<jcater> that is very odd
<lekma> when i installed forms it complained about a missing 'login' module
<jcater> is this a custom python installation?
<lekma> jcater: nope fresh gentoo standard install
<jcater> this is odd
<jcater> as the error is coming from python
<jcater> not from our code
<lekma> the module was missing from src/dialogs

<jcater> are you using setup-cvs.py?
<jcater> or setup.py?
<lekma> setup.py
<jcater> we haven't updated setup.py yet... that's on our list of things to do for the pending release
<lekma> :-)
<jcater> I'd recommend using setup-cvs.py when running from cvs
<lekma> ok i'll try
<chillywilly> hey
<chillywilly> where is the password for dcl installed?
<chillywilly> erm, in one of the tables?

<derek> jcater: fwiw dcl for sid was created before postgres 7.3 was in sid
<derek> i think cvs has many of the 7.2 to 7.3 postgres changes fixed
<jcater> ok
Action: jcater got around the issues
<jcater> just wanted to make sure he/y'all were aware of it
<chillywilly> dcl rocks my socks
<Vee2d2> this must be cross-channel conversation
<chillywilly> nah, delayed
<derek> Vee2d2: yeah
<derek> cross channel AND delayed
Action: derek would have responded in #dcl but jcater left :)
Action: derek wonders why jcater is running sid
<jcater> I do on my personal workstation
<chillywilly> me too
<jcater> woody on everything else
<chillywilly> I second that motion
<Vee2d2> I'm too impatient to run anything but sid
<chillywilly> gandalf is running testing
<jcater> dudes
<jcater> I take back all I said about linux desktop publishing not being there
<jcater> it has arrived
<chillywilly> cool
Action: jcater grabbed latest scribus
<jcater> and it kicks ass
<jcater> looks and feels a lot like QuarkXPress
Action: chillywilly hears "another one bites the dust" theme song
<jcater> though not as powerful yet
<jcater> it still is pretty damn feature complete as it sits today
<jamest> ah, but how does it stack up against the gimp?
<derek> cool
<chillywilly> ack
<derek> actually the gimp kicks major butt, but its just not user friendly
Action: jcater thwapos jamest
Action: chillywilly covers up so as not get hit by the flying debree
<derek> i.e. the gimp is a lot like linux vs windows
<derek> powerful with a steep learning curve
<derek> if only gimp had 'idiot' interface
Action: jcater can't stand gimp
<chillywilly> hey if *I* cna make logos witht he gimp then it can't be that steep ;)
<derek> jcater: me either
<jamest> you guys know that the gimp makes the perfect photoshop, illustrator, quark, python, viagra, dryer lint replacement
<derek> but its prett powerful
Action: derek has seen some people do some wicked stuff with gimp
<derek> just most people dont have 500 man hours to learn how to resize a photo ;)
<Vee2d2> pretty neat, scribus has improved a **bunch** since the last time I checked it out
<jamest> l8r
jamest (~jamest@adsl-64-216-111-42.dsl.tpkaks.swbell.net) left #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> derek: but there's nice Free books for the gimping
<chillywilly> heck I wlays forget how to create an alpha channel and set a certain color to transparent so I googled and it was like 3rd hit
<Vee2d2> I dont see any point to creating anything 'new' in a raster gfx application
<jcater> depends on the need
<jcater> there's room for raster paint, vector paint, and page layout apps
Action: jcater sees those as 3 distinct tools
<Vee2d2> with exception to creative expression.. 
<derek> btw: Vee2d2 and jcater not ignoring gnue-sb mail
<derek> just major backlogged
<derek> hoping to maybe respond to some of them tonight
<Vee2d2> I've been super busy lately
<chillywilly> you guys need to stop distracting me
<chillywilly> before I kick all your asses
<chillywilly> ;P
<jcater> bring it on
<jcater> ooooo
<jcater> that was a good movie
<jcater> w/kirsten dunst
<jcater> in a cheerleading outfit
Action: jcater runs to take a cold shower
Action: chillywilly mails logs to mrs. cater
Action: jcater adds chillywilly to his spamassassin blacklist
<chillywilly> woopdeedoo
<derek> so jcater if my wife just maybe happened to know the dunst family
<derek> if say i got you a lunch with kirsten
<jcater> derek: two words
<jcater> s/two/three
<derek> would that get more or less gnue production than a box of glazed donuts?
<jcater> massive heart failure
<derek> oh in that case never mind
<chillywilly> so that would be less
<derek> heart failure == poor productivity
<jcater> or I might poke myself in the eye
<jcater> upon meeting her
<derek> well i guess thinking it through even if your production potential were increased
<derek> the fact your wife woudl kill you on return to memphis would negate any potential gain
<chillywilly> yea think these things through for a change
Action: chillywilly hides
<jcater> oh, believe me
<jcater> I've been thinking that meeting over and over and over
<jcater> she must be exhausted
<derek> the one with kirsten? or the return meeting with your wife giving you a WWF smackdown in the memphis airport?
<jcater> well, we've already established that kirsten would give me a heart attack
<jcater> (esp. with all the donuts recently)
<jcater> so the return trip isn't a worry
<derek> :)
<derek> good point
<chillywilly> who says he can slip it under the radar?
<chillywilly> women have a freakish 6th sense about them
<chillywilly> you may get smacked down while trying to depart memphis
<jcater> 6th sense?
<jcater> I thought that was the sense of "you have spair cash on you. I can tell!"
<derek> hmm
<derek> my wife tells me i have sixth sense of humor all the time
<chillywilly> gee, wonder where ya get that from
<jcater> well, pray for da boys overseas
<jcater> my brother in law is over there
Action: chillywilly has been :)
