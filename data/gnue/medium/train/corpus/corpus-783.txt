<jcater> psu: 'sup?
<psu> hi jc
<psu> I was looking at yesterday's log
<psu> & your conversation with Derek
<psu> I don;t see why the widiget he describes 
<psu> couldn't work in text
<psu> (of course, this leaves aside the q
<psu> of whether it's a good idea or not anyway)
Action: psu is normally a fan of KISS, in widget sets as elsewhere
<jcater> it could
<jcater> and I'm torn
<jcater> how would it work in html?
<jcater> I mean, you could have buttons
<jcater> but to have the webpage reupdate each time would suck imho
<psu> html is actaully more tricky
<jcater> I didn't say it was a bad idea...
<jcater> just applying the same litmus tests we apply to everything else
<psu> either you refresh after each selection 
<psu> jc - agree absoluetely
<jcater> my main concern is what would such a device default back to?
<jcater> if the UI didn't support such a thing
<psu> How do we feel about javascript in HTML clients?
<psu> (I know java = proprietary standard, and
<jcater> personally, I see it as an option
<psu> hence to be avoided
<jcater> I would like to see a basic html client
<psu> would same apply to javascript
<jcater> that worked under lynx and everything else
<psu> or do we regard that as more free-friendly?
<jcater> but could see an enhanced html driver
<jcater> that made it more "friendly" to use, but required a more modern browswer
<jcater> there's a free implementation of javascript
<jcater> iirc
<psu> problem is the proliferation of possible UIs
<jcater> yes
<jcater> personally, I think all our forms should work w/a stock browser (lynx or otherwise)
<jcater> BUT
<psu> in efect, you have HTML lite and HTML thick
<jcater> at my office, I'd prefer to use a JS-enabled form :)
<psu> How difficult would it be to make lynx use javascript
<psu> at least for things that are physically possible for it?
<jcater> well, that was an example of a basic client
<psu> Or do I seriously not even want to go there?
<jcater> I didn't specifically mean lynx
<jcater> but a basic web browser
<psu> no, but principle is there
<jcater> um, well the way I see it
<jcater> in practicality, most web "browsers" support stuff like JS
<jcater> BUT
<jcater> what about HTML widgets (such as wxWindows wxHTML)
<jcater> ppl could embed our forms in their apps using a stock
<jcater> html widget
<jcater> and I can promise, those wouldn't support JS
<jcater> I'm torn
<jcater> but I'm also not coding it :)
<jcater> btw, I have NO idea about JS+Lynx support
<jcater> it very well could already be done :)
<psu> Just thinking out loud
<jcater> I use (*gasp*) IE 6 and Konqueror
<jcater> :)
<jcater> btw, also consider something as basic as a line-oriented forms client
<jcater> in which curses support isn't there
<jcater> it basically displays one question/line at a time
<psu> Derek's form could be done as a Q & A script
<psu> it would be hideous, but pretty much
<psu> everything in line based would have to be
<jcater> true
<derek> ok a few things
<derek> there is a free implementatoin of 'java script' iirc
<derek> i.e. java script != java
<jcater> just thinking out loud :)
<derek> i think its called spidermonkey
<derek> as for lynx support i dont see much value
<derek> we have curses across the web
<derek> if someone wants that
<derek> imho
<psu> If we make a JS (or free equiv) browser the min spec for
<psu> HTML forms
<derek> i think webclients will pretty much have to support some language
<derek> or it will be painful
<psu> this resolves a lot of our problems
<jcater> like I said earlier, lynx was being used as an example of a basic clients
<psu> on validation 
<derek> as you will be sumbitting forms like crazy for the most trivial of things
<psu> as we can build a limited amt of validation 
<psu> into the client
<derek> this is just my opinion
<jcater> well, I've stated my opinion
<psu> <aol>me too</aol>
<jcater> I foresee a basic (although limitedly useful) HTML client
<jcater> and a modern JS-or-such based client
<jcater> that can handle client-side validation
<jcater> but, also, like I said, I'm not coding it :)
<psu> jcater - what would we lose by dropping the basic HTML client?
<psu> As derek says, char based people are probably better with curses than lynx
<jcater> 2 things:
<jcater> well, like I've been saying, I was using lynx as an example of a basic client, not as an example of a text interface
<jcater> 2 things:
<derek> jcater: true, i suppose there might exist something like galeon or konq that has js turned off to be lightweight or such
<jcater> 1. As much as we hate to admit it, a lot of ppl still use old browsers and a lot of ppl (like me!) disable JS support, etc
<jcater> 2. It's a implementation test for us... basically, keep us truthful to our abstraction :)
<jcater> if that makes sense
<psu> yes
<psu> normally I'm a big fan of multi-browser support
<psu> so I fell kinda odd arguing to require JS or equiv
<psu> I suppose the thing is
<psu> you are going to get an easier ride with JS
<psu> (poss client-side validation for a start)
<psu> but the GNUe philosophy is not to rule anything out
<derek> psu: yip
<derek> hate to admit that
<jcater> that was my point :)
<jcater> like I said earlier, my office would use the JS-enabled version :)
<jcater> well, actually, my office will use the wxQT when it's available :)
Action: jcater doesn't liket he thought of any HTML-based forms honestly 
<derek> doh
Action: derek either
<derek> i think we NEED to support it for the 'trendy' folks
<derek> but short of that im not a fan
<jcater> yip
<jcater> I might have a *few* uses for that if we can get it to work w/my Zope portal
<derek> i could prolly live with a vt100 curses version though ;)
<psu> If we can solve the issues of distributing client code
<psu> HTML forms can be relegated to occasional users only 
<psu> or extranet
<derek> psu: way i see it is broswers only live to half the hype
<derek> sure every pc has one
<derek> but each one is different even in same family
<derek> and behave so oddly
<derek> writing code for them is brutal
<derek> so the concept of 'thin client' no maintenance on 'client' seems odd
<derek> in our environment GENERALLY it will all be intranet usage
<derek> in which case putting the client binaries in shared location and the gfd's in shared location
<jcater> psu: what do you mean about "issues of distributing client code"
<derek> means clientless maintenance anyhow
<psu> I'm coming from situations where we loved 2-tier client server
<derek> jcater: technically if you arent on an internet
<psu> until our first upgrade ;-)
<derek> say an employee wanted to use gfds from home
<derek> and you didnt have a vpn setup
<psu> that was a fun week - 400 clients at multiple locations 
<psu> some 50 miles away
<derek> i.e. didnt offer forms binaries
<derek> they would have to install local copy of forms
<jcater> psu: I understand... believe me
<psu> With GNUe, if you have n-tier
<derek> but i dont see gnue like a 'web site'
<psu> with a preferred client of GNUe Forms
<derek> in sense you probably dont want to expose everyone in the world to your gnue system :)
<psu> then presumably all the apps logic is in GEAS
<psu> so you don't have to upgrade GNUe Forms client as often 
<psu> but you will still have to occasionally?
<psu> Or am I missing the plot?
<derek> psu: i think jason and james both use shared binaries
<derek> i.e. they put the stuff for forms client in shared location
<jcater> psu: no, you have the plot :)
<derek> and the remote clients use it
<jcater> we are another piece of software that must be upgraded at points
<derek> or i could be missing the boat
<jcater> but like derek said, we use shared binaries
<jcater> which solves part of the problem
<derek> so you only upgrade the client in 1 place and all users are upgraded
<derek> so its not like old days of going to every machine
<jcater> BUT you still have to upgrade every office
<derek> yes
<jcater> which in my case is 2, so no big deal
<psu> Plus, at the moment, you can network install it 
<psu> even the Windoze version 
<psu> AFAIK
<jcater> psu: s/at the moment,/
<jcater> that is a requirement for jamest and I 
<derek> and me too
<jcater> so you should see that for a long time :)
<psu> good
<psu> The problem is that people have become brainwashed 
<derek> psu: good thing about gnue
<psu> that client code is inherently bad
<derek> we are equal part business folks, programmers and sys admins
<derek> and the sys admin blood w/in gnue will ensure that maintenance ease is at top of list
<psu> wheras client code is actually good (got an expensive PC, use its processor cycles)
<psu> as long as you can resolve distro issues
<psu> IMHO
<jcater> y ip
<jcater> psu: also, my situation is a little different
<jcater> my remote office uses LTSP -- diskless x-stations
<jcater> so the binaries are always shared
<jcater> but at our main office, with the upper management folk, they *have* to have their own Win?? machines
<jcater> with the latest and greatest :)
<jcater> so at one end of the spectrum, one of my offices is the easiest to maintain
<jcater> at the other end, very disparaged computing platforms :)
<jcater> argh!
<jcater> bbias
<psu> Problem is that people assume that web-based is the only way to resolve client code distro problem
<psu> http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/publications/frameworks/egif2/execsum.htm
<derek> brb
<psu> "The main thrust of the framework is to adopt the Internet and World Wide Web standards for all government systems. "
Action: psu would rather have a tightly-written effective GNUe Forms client
<jcater> who knows, we may have self-updating forms clients someday :)
<psu> than a beastie d/l like some of the java forms clients out there
<psu> bbl
jcater (jason@24.92.70.201) left irc: "bbiaf"
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> client side code is very nice in the general case
<Isomer> but some of the problems with client side code: Version Skew, some people upgraded to the new version and some didn't.  Having everything nicely shared makes it fairly easy to upgrade everyone, but if they're still running the old one and haven't yet quit, then they're still running the old one.
<Isomer> And another, possibly more important, you have clients that have direct access to the database.  While you can limit them with the client to certain abilities, you can't necessarily stop them connecting with access via ODBC then doing a "DELETE FROM table"
<psu> Hi Isomer
<psu> I guess I'm thinking more generally 
<psu> about clients in n-tier 
<psu> rather than 2-tier
Action: Isomer would be scared to give people SQL access :)
<Isomer> yeah
Action: Isomer does a lot of work with irc servers, and unfortunately IRC servers do far far too much.
Action: psu would ban anyone from direct SQL access
<psu> anyone but me, anyway
<psu> As I understand it, with n-tier using GEAS
<psu> any changes to the application you can just do on GEAS
<psu> You only have to re-install the GNUe Forms client when that changes
<psu> Once it becomes a stable product, not very often
<psu> hopefully
<Isomer> right
<psu> PLUS you make the re-install as painless as possible
Action: psu likes jcater's idea of self-updating forms clients
<Isomer> self updating is usually a very bad idea
<Isomer> eg: Self update to a trojaned version.
<Isomer> or, say users are running version 4.0, and the admin hasn't upgraded everyone to 4.1 yet because it's known to have an exploit
<Isomer> someone can force the upgrade to 4.1 then exploit everyone.
<psu> Yes, but we are not talking M$ here
<chillywilly> but we only put the trojans in for the ones running on M$ platforms
<psu> It's up to the sysadmin what version he runs
<chillywilly> ;)
<Isomer> psu: Yeah, but you crack a box in the DMZ, and suddenly you've got control of all of the clients
<Isomer> not the good look
<Isomer> a simple way of doing upgrades is a good idea "A new version is available, would you like to upgrade?"
Action: derek is away: nap
<Isomer> but make sure it does smart things like check a signature on the file
<psu> Isomer - as this is free software
<psu> I expect sysadmins to be clueful ;-)
<psu> and to make absolutely sure they are happy with the upgrade
<psu> before releasing it 
<psu> signatures are an excellent idea
<Isomer> the thing is, there are situations where the sysadmin may not be the one making that choice
Action: Isomer arp steals the app servers IP, and releases a trojan as a "required upgrade"
<Isomer> any number of things
<psu> With GNUe, the sysadmin (well, actually the enterprise) should always be making the choice.

<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> you know about windows update?
<chillywilly> who me?
<chillywilly> what about it?
<psu> cw is our resident expert on updating Windows
<psu> ... to Debian GNU/Linux
<Isomer> rofl
<chillywilly> hehe
<Isomer> well, it uses http to check a site "updates.microsoft.com"
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> I ran it for my mom's buggy ass win 98
<Isomer> A) In the last round of CodeRed Virii, updates.microsoft.com ended up being infected.
<chillywilly> that didn't want to shutdown juts because I put a network card int it
<Isomer> http://wlug.linuxcare.co.nz/codered.html
<Isomer> B) You can automatically configure a windows machine to use a proxy.  it looks up a hostname "wpad" and fetches the file "/wpad.dat" from it.  As searches strip off the domain components one at a time, you can register "wpad.com" and provide a proxy configuration file and tell all *.com clients to use you as a proxy server for updates.microsoft.com
<Isomer> this is a company with basically infinite resources
<Isomer> and they're very vunerable
<Isomer> I don't want to see us in the same situation :)
<chillywilly> that web page is funny
<psu> isomer - I think we can guarantee that we will never have infinite resources ;-)
<chillywilly> m$ only cares about making money
<chillywilly> and making computing "easy"
<Isomer> right, and theres at least one trap there that we can fall into :P
<psu> Isomer - I think you are right to point out that 
<psu> "Urgent Security Upgrades - strongly recomm" updates
<psu> on gnuenterprise site must be validated somehow
<psu> digital signatures etc
<psu> But with free software, users are ultimately responsible
<Isomer> digital signatures still don't protect against the attack of forcing an upgrade to a legitimate, but known buggy, version.
<psu> for their own security
<Isomer> heh
<Isomer> while that is true
<psu> s/free/all
<Isomer> we all know that they suck :P
<psu> Isomer - I wouldn't personally support any kind of
<psu> gnuenterprise as a project/product 
<psu> forcing users to upgrade
<psu> IMHO, the concept of a "mandatory upgrade" for free s/w is an oxymoron
<psu> also probably violates GPL
<psu> Make it as easy as poss, yes
<psu> But someone in the enterprise has to say 
<psu> "I accept GNUe's recomm, let's take this fix"
<psu> & be aware of the consquences
<psu> Once that has been done, 
<psu> they need the tools to distribute that fix
<psu> as easily/quickly within their enterprise
<psu> and poss extranet as well

Action: jcater is still an apt-get newbie
Action: chillywilly just lets aptitude do its thing
Action: ajmitch too
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> what's the difference?
Action: ajmitch is a newbie, /me means :)
<ajmitch> see the manpage :)
<chillywilly> aptitude is a front end
<chillywilly> tp apt
<chillywilly> to apt
<jcater> bah
<chillywilly> it is curses
<chillywilly> it's purty too
<chillywilly> you could always go with gnome-apt jcater?
<chillywilly> s/?//
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> why?
<jcater> apt-get isn't exactly complicated
<chillywilly> it was a joke
<chillywilly> we know how much you lpve our beloved gnome
<chillywilly> love
<jcater> bah
<chillywilly> kde ppl don't tend to like debian for some reason
<chillywilly> wonder wehy that is
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> kde developers that is
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> never heard that myself
<chillywilly> I know it from experience
<chillywilly> and hanging out in #kde too much
<chillywilly> (soemthing I wouldn't recommend)
<chillywilly> bah, galeon is crashing when I close a tab
<ajmitch> heh
<jbailey> chillywilly: I'm not having that problem - I updated my galeon today, which also pulled in mozilla 0.9.7
<chillywilly> jbailey: not using the deb though
<chillywilly> I just compiled from cvs
<chillywilly> maybe I should dl the deb
fil_c (~username@host213-122-192-57.btinternet.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jbailey> galeon and mozilla are now sufficiently good for me that I'm not tracking CVS anymore.
<chillywilly> umm, I always compile galeon ad I like it that much
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> s/ad/as
<chillywilly> but  may instal the deb
<chillywilly> since it is b0rked
<jcater> anyone know if the stock debian 2.4.x kernels support root reiserfs?
<chillywilly> I hope that doesn't hose my bookmarks
<chillywilly> they just switched to xbel format or something
<jbailey> jcater: I think I saw it mentioned in 2.4.17
<chillywilly> real men compile their own
<jbailey> or so, anyway.  I switched to a root ext3 at 2.4.16.
<chillywilly> ;P
<jbailey> lazy men don't =)
Action: chillywilly has all xfs file systems, except fpr /boot
<ajmitch> i have all ext3 (apart from one reiserfs)
<jcater> ajmitch: what's the status of ext3?
<jcater> you have issues?
<jbailey> I haven't had any at all.
<ajmitch> no issues here
<jcater> this is a production server 90 miles away
<jcater> so I don't want to get *too* experimental :)
<ajmitch> heh
<jcater> but would prefer to use ext3 as that's probably the future standard
<ajmitch> i don't think ext3 is experimental, it's bene in production use in servers for a couple of years now
<jbailey> I chose ext3 because I didn't have to reformat.
<jcater> right
<ajmitch> that was my main reason too :)
<jbailey> Otherwise I probably would've chosen reiser.
<jcater> do the stock kernels support that?
<jbailey> jcater: Yup!
<jcater> I've used reiserfs in production for 6 months
<jcater> well, 8 months now :)
<chillywilly> xfs is the best
<chillywilly> imho
<jbailey> I havent' looked at them extensively.  All I know is that reiser seemed to support a number of features that make sense, and ext3 is trivial to implement (4 commands and a reboot) with stock kernels.
Action: jcater isn't looking for the technical best... I'm looking for the stablest :)
<jcater> ok
<jcater> this sold me
<jbailey> Almost all of my servers are between 10 hours and 80 hours drive from here, so...
<jcater> "ext3 has been in production use on some widely-accessed servers, including the rpmfind.net servers, for more than two years."
Action: chillywilly has had 0 prblems and likes that he can keep the kernel in cvs
<ajmitch> ok, gotta go, cy'all later :)
<jcater> LATER
<chillywilly> I could do that locally on my own system too I suppose

<jcater> there's one oddity of konqueror that kills me
<jcater> if you do a Ctrl+End
<jcater> it takes you to the end of the page
<jcater> now, what would you expect Ctrl+Home to do?
<jcater> it brings up a listing of your home dir
<Remosi> rofl
<derek> galeon is goofy like that too
<derek> ctrl=end goes to end
<derek> ctrl-home takes you to your home page
<derek> iirc
<derek> as it bites me ALL the time
<jcater> I'll have to learn to do ctrl-alt+[end|home] as that behaves as I'd expect the former to do
<jcater> but that's not like IE
<jcater> <whine>
<derek> i would look, i bet its configurable
<derek> well in gnome stuff things like that are configurable (usually)
<jcater> I'm sure it's configurable in KDE too
<jcater> I just hate not having default behavior at work
<jcater> (it's one of those, taking my own medicine thingies)
<derek> yip
<derek> C has got to be the most atrocious hideous beast i have ever seen
<derek> especially when teamed with GTK
<derek> looking at logjam to hack in a feature and its just HIDEOUS
<derek> being spoiled by Delphi, writing code to 'draw windows' seems archaic enough (gtk)
<derek> but then add to it doing so in C and its just gross :)
<derek> wx makes you do the archaic window drawing etc, but at least with python the blow is soften by an elegant language ;)
<derek> yes these are flame words i understand
<jcater> lol
<jcater> I saw the coolest article on python programmers today
<jcater> lemme find it

<jcater> "C++ programmers sometimes seem to think the rest of us are blithering idiots and are only allowed to live so that there are end users to sqeeze Porche payments out of."
<mdean> funny - I got met with "Why code in Python?" just a couple days ago
<jcater> were you hostile towards them?
<jcater> ;)
<mdean> no - I'm one of those C++ coders ;-)
<jcater> rofl
<mdean> derek: review docs yet?
<derek> nope, been watching football (oregon won!)
<derek> and my livejournal fetish has me dicking with logjam code
<mdean> it will take you like 2 minutes to read both of them ;-)
<jcater> what are you doing with livejournal?
<derek> jcater: using it as my diary
<derek> but im finding it most enthralling
<jcater> ah, cool
<derek> its what slashdot should be :)
<derek> by joining a few groups already have been sucked in
<derek> one thing it does is if someone responds to you it emails you 
<derek> and lets you fill out a form in the email to respond back
<derek> so its almost a cross breed between slashdot weblog
<derek> and irc
<derek> without trolls
<jcater> interesting
<derek> basically its a time eater
<derek> i had originally planned on using it soley for a journal
<derek> as the client was nice (not html)
<derek> and i could get it to work from work :)
<derek> but then had revelation it had an interesting concept for 'workflow'
<derek> then ditched that and thought it would make an interesting model for business 2 business communication
<derek> then said forget it, its just fun
<derek> plus it led me to great films like l33t films presents : romeo and juliet

<madlocke> hey jamest
<jamest> hey
<jamest> madlocke: you still here?
<madlocke> jep
<jamest> you got your savannah account up?
<madlocke> didn't try it yet but i did configure it...
<madlocke> i was reading in kc that you are working on rewrite of forms?
<jamest> the UI rewrite?
<madlocke> yes
<jamest> yes
<madlocke> hm... me too ;)
<jamest> well
<jamest> i didn't read the last KC
<jamest> but the rewrite shouldn't reference me but gnue in general
<madlocke> but what i am doing will maybe break the structure of the .gfd files
<jamest> as it's really just cleaning things up and making it play nice with your stuff
<madlocke> ah ok...
<madlocke> what i am doing now is a different way of linking objects
<jamest> typically the rewrite is mentioned allong with "we've got this guy doing an HTML interface"
<jamest> :)
<madlocke> and integrate a layout manager...
<jamest> I'd love to get this in cvs
<madlocke> some parts work already... want to show it to you after i added a few more things
<madlocke> ;)
<madlocke> the html works with the new version too
<jamest> ?
<madlocke> and it can be possible to use x,y coordinates and layout manager
<jamest> what do you mean
<madlocke> not at the same time of course
<jamest> :)
<madlocke> hm... at the moment i call it locally forms.new
<madlocke> could add this to cvs...
<madlocke> i need maybe 1 or 2 more days then i want to show you what i did...
<jamest> is it a whole new you isystem
<madlocke> yes
<jamest> argh!
<jamest> not at you
<jamest> at the xchat replacement of you i
<jamest> instead of UI
<jamest> :)
<jamest> musta put a space in there
<madlocke> ok...
<madlocke> the creation of objects will be much more transparent
<madlocke> und separation between uibase und wxpython is more clean
<madlocke> it is not that you won't see anything that is already done
<jamest> can you put in cvs?
<madlocke> but the way is different
<jamest> and does it break lots of stuff
<jamest> ?
<madlocke> tomorrow... i want to finish some things today and don't want to bother with cvs now...
<madlocke> some things not everything...
<jamest> ok, I just confirmed that you do have cvs write privs
<madlocke> for example the tab pages are not a type of form they are child objects
<madlocke> so you can have buttons and more besides tabs on a form
<jamest> ah
<jamest> is this working with the wxPython driver as well?
<madlocke> the wxpython driver changed a bit ;)
<jamest> that's ok
<madlocke> it is a new one :)
<jamest> however I need to fix some things in the UI system for a form I'm working on
<madlocke> i want to get rid of this phase init stuff...
<jamest> I'm not sure how you can do that
<jamest> we had a single init at one time
<madlocke> you won't be able to replace everything yet... i may need some help to link objects to database etc...
<jamest> but kept having to kludge in work arroungs
<jamest> arrounds
<madlocke> if i understand it right the main reason for phase init is because you don't
<madlocke> have all information at time for object creation
<madlocke> that is needed. right?
<madlocke> for=of
<madlocke> or did i miss something?
<jamest> yes
<jamest> but it's not just at the UI level
<madlocke> it's connections datasources and so on, isn't it?
<madlocke> connections=connecting
<jamest> yes
<madlocke> ok...
<jamest> it's several places
<jamest> i can't recall all of them 
<madlocke> sure...
<jamest> i haven't touched a computer (other than twice) in the last approx 2 weeks
<madlocke> first thing i'll do is visual stuff, then look at the parser again
<jamest> and then only to make sure the stuff at work didn't blow up
<jamest> hmmm
<madlocke> that's good... then i hope you had a great holiday. happy new year btw. :)
<jamest> I was planning on working on fixes on the UI for forms today
<jamest> as I needed to fix checkboxes for a form I have here at wotk
<jamest> work

<ToyMan> dneighbo: you around?
<dneighbo> yip
<dneighbo> kind of anyhow :)
<dneighbo> digging into financials here
<ToyMan> hi
<ToyMan> my access db is freaking
<ToyMan> grows to like 10x it's original size over the course of a day
<dneighbo> suffice to say if someone needed a fund accounting package in gnue i could probably produce one quickly
<dneighbo> yikes
<ToyMan> any progress on the psql 7.1 install
<ToyMan> ?
<dneighbo> have you made any changes recently?
<ToyMan> nope
<dneighbo> no progress, BUT based on your comment right now i will put it on highest priority
<dneighbo> i.e. i will start it tonight
<ToyMan> i shut everyone down and compact 3x a day
<ToyMan> ok, thanks
<dneighbo> btw: iirc this is a known bug of access
<dneighbo> er maybe im thinking of quicken
<dneighbo> one of the two we called htem and they said your db is HOW big
<ToyMan> first time i'm seeing it after 2 years of use
<dneighbo> and they said dood you are fscked
<dneighbo> basically the internals couldnt handle the size and would reek havoc
<dneighbo> we ended up having to pull out a years worth of data to archive
<ToyMan> hmm. original size is only 2 MB
<dneighbo> hmm that isnt too big at all

<dneighbo> we were at like 75mb
<ToyMan> i've kept the screens and code seperate from the data
<ToyMan> so it isn't growing
<dneighbo> im thinking it was quicken now that i think about
<dneighbo> er quickbooks rather
<ToyMan> seems to be generating all sorts of ~*.* files
<ToyMan> that don't show up in the db
<ToyMan> with hidden objects on ;)
<ToyMan> but they're there
<dneighbo> oh what this is windows stupid me
<dneighbo> reboot pc
<dneighbo> upgrade to microsoft xp
<dneighbo> and office xp
<dneighbo> and if it is still a problem call 1-800 shaft you support line
<dneighbo> ;)
<ToyMan> heh
Action: dneighbo is doing some quick research for you
<nickr> shaft!
<nickr> damn right
<dneighbo> oh schiest
<dneighbo> toyman have you changed any of your queries?
<dneighbo> or do you maniuplate queries on teh fly?
<dneighbo> msdn is claiming that EVERY modificatoin to a query in code or other wise writes a whole new query
<dneighbo> and saves the old one
<ToyMan> yes
<dneighbo> created the ~*.* files i assume
<dneighbo> if you compact the db it will remove those
<ToyMan> yeah, but how to get them to show in the db?
<dneighbo> as you are finding out
<dneighbo> they dont show there
<dneighbo> you have to 'code' around it
<dneighbo> let me get you the technical doc
<dneighbo> dood we need to save you this is just horrid
<ToyMan> oh, wait!!! I'll just right a little shell script and call it with a cron job and...oh, MS, never mind

<dneighbo_> ok
dsmith (dsmith@d100.as1.clev.oh.voyager.net) left irc: Read error: 54 (Connection reset by peer)
<dneighbo_> In general, your database grows in size as you work on the design of its objects. For example, repeated modifications to the design of a table, form, or report cause a database to grow; compacting the database restores it to a smaller size. However the growth is faster and more dramatic when you change the SQL property of a query, or if you change the SQL statement in the RecordSource property of a form or report. 
<dneighbo_> This is because the Jet database engine generates a new query plan each time you change the SQL, and the new plan is saved to an unused portion of your hard disk. 
<dneighbo_> This behavior is reported frequently in databases that use SQL pass-through queries because application developers will often modify the SQL property of a query in code to change a parameter passed to a SQL Server stored procedure, for example, or to change an Insert, Update, or Delete statement. 
<dneighbo_> i assume you have probably been running a report(s) that have this passthru type of code
<ToyMan> hmmm. not really sure.
Action: ToyMan has a hard time remembering his own code...
<dneighbo_>       Sub TestQDF()
<dneighbo_>          Dim i As Long
<dneighbo_>          Dim qdf As QueryDef
<dneighbo_>          Dim db As Database
<dneighbo_>          Set db = CurrentDb()
<dneighbo_>          Set qdf = db.QueryDefs("qryPassThruTest")
<dneighbo_>          For i = 1 To 3000
<dneighbo_>             qdf.SQL = "sp_test " & Chr(34) & i & Chr(34)
<dneighbo_>          Next
<dneighbo_>       End Sub
<dneighbo_> would be an example of code that would create 3000 new files
<ToyMan> well, no code like that, anyway.
<dneighbo_> so i assume if you use QueryDefs() you are getting bitten
<dneighbo_> let me find a the article
<ToyMan> no QueryDefs()
<dneighbo_> http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q165823
<dneighbo_> im not an access expert but this sounds vaguely like the symptoms your seeing
<dneighbo_> the question is 
<dneighbo_> a. how to tell whats causing it specifically
<dneighbo_> b. how to fix it
<dneighbo_> as compacting your db a few times a day just sucks
<ToyMan> thanks i'm checking the page out now

<dsmith> Anyone here care to comment on the differnt python postgres modules?  reliability? speed?  clarity of code?  Any preferences?
<jamest> sure
Nick change: IsoosI -> Isomer
<jamest> the postgresql one is the worse :)
<Isomer> rofl
<jcater> I've had good results with pypgsql
<jcater> I'd recommend either that or psycopg
<jamest> agreed
<jamest> postgresql driver has issues with python db API 2.0 support
<jamest> however we typically run forms thru with all of them so any of them should work
<jcater> if you have any use for GNue Forms on Windows, the pypgsql comes precompiled for win32
<dsmith> Thanks Guys
<jcater> fwiw, psycopg is supposedly more tuned for high-throughput server-based situations, so if/when GEAS uses gnue-common, i'd imagine it might be the library of choice for server-side stuff
<jcater> but I haven't actually done any timing myself :)

<neilt> anyone here with Cisco experience?

<neilt> any experience or thoughts
Bill_H (~unknown@ga-cmng-u1-c3a-384.cmngga.adelphia.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jbailey> The 1700 is the one with the encryption module in it, right?
<neilt> not sure?
<jbailey> Yeah, it's been a few years since I've looked at the different produce revs.
<jbailey> There was one in the 1700 range with had the VPN encryption in hardware.
<neilt> i think there is one 
<neilt> but not sure if we have that one
<neilt> forgot to look at the details before i left work
<jbailey> I used to use a 3640 for my firewall / NAT / HSRP box.  It was overkill.
<jbailey> We also had OSPF for three cities.
<Mr_You> anyone have any opinions as to whether a BSD based router shouldn't be used versus Cisco if you already have BSD machines in use?
<jamest> neilt: i myself don't use cisco firewall, however
<neilt> jamest:  because
<neilt> ?
<Mr_You> I guess if yer into throwing money at cisco training and support that would be the way to go
<jamest> when I was looking into options Theo (openbsd) claimed that a low end pc would outperform a cisco
<Mr_You> man these cherry cobler portions are smaller ugh.. so good tho
<neilt> in looking at the cisco specs that seems reasonable
<jbailey> jamest: That depends on the Cisco and what you're asking it to do.
<Mr_You> eatin dinner
<jamest> the thing I like about using a basic unix system as a firewall is I can make it do lots of stuff I'm not sure a cisco can do
<neilt> some of the low end ones are slo
<jbailey> The processors in the cisco IIRC aren't interrupt driven, so packet flow is smoother under load.
<jbailey> jamest: I can answer those questions. =)
<Mr_You> jamest: I'd say yes for multiple DS3 circuits.. I dunno the status of drivers for hardware greater than that... actually I'm assuming you

<jbailey> I always use external ones, becasue the damned thing have a habit of dying on me. =)
<jamest> fwiw
<jbailey> At least then I can replace it without taking the whole router down.
<jamest> the main campus uses cisco routes, switches
<Mr_You> hot-swap PCI (supposedly) ;-)
<jamest> and it seems they replace "faulty" cards fairly frequently
<neilt> jamest: do you know if they are using the firewall software in the router?
<jamest> no clue
<jamest> my off the shelf P-133 w/ a couple of 3com cards has worked quite well for our department
<neilt> cool
<neilt> anyknow how the html forms are comming along
<jamest> and unless you've got a huge pipe 
<jcater> yeah, we have an elcheapo 133 w/3com and OpenBSD as our firewall
<jcater> never notice it
<jcater> (which is a good thing :)
<jamest> you can saturate the line with a p-133
<neilt> our pipe is dual t1's
<neilt> is that huge
<neilt> ?
<neilt> probably not
<jamest> that's 2.88 megabit IIRC
<jamest> 10base-t is 10MB
<Mr_You> they are bonded?
<jamest> megabit
<neilt> Mr_You: no
<Mr_You> how is load balancing done?
<neilt> not yet
<neilt> they are separate networks
<Mr_You> ahh
<jamest> so an old PC should work I would think
<neilt> but its on the TODO list
<jamest> if you have one laying arround
<jamest> but I am not an expert
<jamest> I'll just give it a "works for me" stamp
<jamest> :)
<Mr_You> neilt: how much utiliation on each circuit?
<Mr_You> utilization
<neilt> 0 on one, 100% on the other
<neilt> sorry thats not right
<neilt> dont know on the one being used
<Mr_You> wow, how many machines?
<neilt> one is also not used now
<Mr_You> 100% utilized with packetloss?
<neilt> dont know
<neilt> Our support folks just quit
<Mr_You> I use mrtg to graph usage
<neilt> so we are working to fingure all this out
<Mr_You> full T1s are usually a lot more than most orgs need
<neilt> we run active ecommmerce site
<Mr_You> even so ;-)
<jamest> Mr_You: untill upper management finds out about www.hotandwildteens.com

<neilt> exactly
<Mr_You> depending on the site, a couple million hits a day can only utilize around 384kbps+

<Bill_H> Glad to be (or not be) here :)
<derek> gnue is quite usable at this point
<derek> only took a few years but hey, we still use sun dials to keep time around here
<Bill_H> derek: still doing work for the county?
<derek> yip
<Bill_H> jamest: you still at the college?
<derek> been digging into chart of accounts REALLY heavy now a days
<derek> too bad its all fund accounting
<derek> unless we can get a govt / non profit to be interested in gnue
<derek> it will be wasted knowledge
<jamest> Bill_H: yip
<Bill_H> I've always felt (and seen on the list) that it was at least nonprofit that would use gnue first.
<Bill_H> It is in the gov't price range.
<jamest> :)
<Bill_H>  BTW, the web site looks great.  Saw gnue mentioned on a slashdot snipit a week or so ago.  I'm sure you guys saw it.  It was part of an open source ERP thing.

<jamest> no

<chillywilly> doooooh!!!!!
<derek> since im on redhat tonight mine will probably work :)
<jcater> derek: you using compiled orbit or apt-get woody orbit?
<jcater> as supposedly 0.3.0 doesn't have this issue
<jcater> so if you have that version or earlier, this could confirm that it's this issue and not some jamest-specific stuff
<jcater> :)
[21:36] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<derek> well im on 0.1.3 i think
<jamest> whoops
<jamest> actually
<jamest> nevermind, I am running 0.3.1

<jamest> whoop!
<jamest> we'll be dependent upon cvs code!
<derek> any tricks to compiling geas
<jamest> no
<derek> jamest we have had this issue in the past
<jamest> just be sure and have a few small animals around
<derek> i think as we start to move forward we might want to control our own like ximian and others do
<derek> especially if some of these maintainers release as infrequently as we do :)
<derek> in case of orbit-python i would just distribute the .so
<jamest> we don't have the people for that :(
<jamest> i think i'll look at using cvs orbit-python in the morning
<derek> like we did for python (for embedding in geas)
<derek> btw: im not advocating we become dependent on cvs versions
<derek> just noting this could be more problematic as we advance
Action: chillywilly should make this a "friend" to this class

<derek> ?
<mdean-lt> almost done - deadline is tomorrow close of business ;-)
<derek> didnt know you were making one of those, busy guy eh
<mdean-lt> yeah - javascript, dhtml - drag-n-drop - the whole bit
<derek> i thought you guys used dreamweaver or something for that?
<mdean-lt> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<mdean-lt> I use homesite for coding
<mdean-lt> in windows land, anyway
<derek> ok homesite then :)
Action: derek is curious as to why writing an editor
<mdean-lt> thanks to jcater, I use Kate in Linux
<derek> linux needs a goodone, but i would assume easier to extend existing one, but what do i know
<mdean-lt> it's a visual layout editor for real estate listings
<derek> ah my bad
<derek> so you mean a web based editor
<mdean-lt> ja
<derek> that lets someone customize how thier 'specific' pages look
<mdean-lt> wysiwyg for our details
<derek> more than a real 'html' as in tag editor?
<derek> sounds cool
<mdean-lt> ja - this is all div elements
<mdean-lt> works in Mozilla too :)
<mdean-lt> though our software doesn't
<mdean-lt> but I wrote it according to w3c dom
<derek> standards are for sissies

<jbailey> Is this a recent problem?

<jamest> then a fresh co worked
<jamest> sigh,
<jamest> looks like my modem will be busy tonight
<jbailey> Is your machine at home up to date?
<jamest> yes
<jbailey> 'cause it would probably be very nice to help troubleshoot this - I think perhaps check to see the differences between the CVS directories on the two machines.
<jamest> you want me to keep old and new trees

<dneighbo> specifically im looking for somethign 'faster'
<dneighbo> i heard kde was fast, but in my testing its similar in load/speed to gnome
<dneighbo> i.e. slightly faster but not very noticeable
<dneighbo> i was thinking of icewm or windowmaker or something
<jcater> icewm is supposed to be fairly fast
<jcater> I also used sawfish w/o gnome before
<jcater> as it's fairly lightweight IIRC
<jcater> there's always twm

<jamest> chillywilly: in some administrative circles at universities things like the math department are not called departments
<jamest> they are called "cost centers"

<jcater> i.e., anyone who wants to go can go
<dneighbo> jcater: i wouldnt be k12 trying to claim works of its students soon
<chillywilly> heh, yea
<dneighbo> as kids programming useful things are getting younger and younger
<chillywilly> my uni wasn't too gustoppoish
<chillywilly> they let me release my senior design project under the GPL
<dneighbo> well i love this concept on two levels
<jcater> what concept?
<dneighbo> a. the tax payers subsidise public schools so how fitting the university make money off my money
<dneighbo> b. the student pays the rest of the cost my tax dollars dont (via tuition) how fitting that the school help SHARE their royalities
<dneighbo> i have a brilliant idea.....
<dneighbo> we should make it so that if you come up with an idea or thought and expand on it ANYWHERE you dont 'own'
<dneighbo> that the 'owner' of that spot has claim to your royalities
<dneighbo> example, i was in the library reading about database design one afternoon
<dneighbo> and it sparked how to handle a problem in contact manager for gnue i was complentating
<dneighbo> i think that makes the library entitled to GNUe
<dneighbo> right/
<dneighbo> ?
<dneighbo> i mean i did take some notes there, i thought of it there and heck i used thier books to help further my idea
<chillywilly> I think ppl just need to realize that it's not all about da benjamins
<jcater> dneighbo: don't talk about this in a logged channel
<jcater> 'cause you are on to something
<dneighbo> jcater: it was actually a anetedote, but im serious about that its coming to that
<jcater> I imagine that argument would hold water in today's society
<jcater> chillywilly: btw, excellent article
<dneighbo> the moral of the story
<dneighbo> dont create a business that makes money
<dneighbo> create one that attracts and encourages smart people to hang out at, and discuss ideas and live off their success
<dneighbo> btw: in many ways most software houses are little more than that
<dneighbo> in fact most of them even call their facilities 'campuses'
<dneighbo> goal: entice bright young minds to work for you for minimal money bastardizing their concepts for profit
<chillywilly> jcater: I can't take credit for it ;)....but it is definitely and issue that irks me
<dneighbo> only universities are really the kings
<dneighbo> a. they get you and i to pay as well as the employee and still want a piece of the action
<dneighbo> b. they have figured out how to do this with physical property as well as mental property (re: college athletics)
Action: dneighbo assumes KSU got a pretty penny for coming to the insight.com bowl here last week, of which little will go back to the 'students academic areas'
<dneighbo> btw: jamest KSU football is considered a profit center ;)
<dneighbo> so dont expect it cut anytime soon 
<dneighbo> <end rant>
<jamest> lol
<jamest> actually you're right
<jamest> it's sad but today people think good football team = good university
<dneighbo> btw: a school with successful football and basketball w/ boosters doesnt really need tuition ;)
<jamest> so our administration really pumped up the f-ball team
<dneighbo> i.e. a math department is obsolete
<jamest> so we have a really good one
<jamest> and it helps enrollment
<dneighbo> well good football == lots o jocks
<dneighbo> lots o jocks == lots o cute girls
<chillywilly> the lesson here is that both the gov't and its public institutions will always find a way to screw us
<dneighbo> lots o cute girls == lots of horny nerds
<chillywilly> it's just the capitalistic disease my friends
<dneighbo> (or horny sys admins) you can pick ;)
<jcater> rofl.. my high school counseling dept had an appropriate comic strip.. it was of a senior saying "I can't decide between a Big 4 or Ivy League School"
<dneighbo> sad thing is sports bond people
<dneighbo> and it used to be in an ivy league you make so many contacts that its more important than the 'education'
<dneighbo> but now with people getting big out of non ivy league schools
<dneighbo> having 'frat buddies' and 'good ole boy' network
<dneighbo> is tremendous for success later in life
<dneighbo> i.e. at the bcs game last night
<dneighbo> something like 45,000 nebraska fans piled into rose bowl
<dneighbo> a small example....
<dneighbo> you go to say miami as an mba
<dneighbo> and a few football guys are in your pyschology 101 class
<dneighbo> you hang with them and get buddies with them help them with their homework to pass classes etc
<dneighbo> 2 years later they are in the pros
<dneighbo> making 4 million a year
<dneighbo> you want to start a business
<dneighbo> so you go to them and ask for them to 'invest'
<chillywilly> hehe
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> or to share women?
<dneighbo> i.e. a lot of these guys end up making serious bank and dont really know what to do with it
<chillywilly> they can buy plenty o' skrimps wit dem benjamins
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> anyhow no system will be perfect
<dneighbo> btw: i read livejournal now a bit
<chillywilly> yea, but it sure could be a lot better
<dneighbo> one kid on there published his supension notice
<dneighbo> the school district suspended him for 10 days
<dneighbo> and was requesting district remove ALL his computer access
<dneighbo> because he downloaded gnapster and icq
<chillywilly> like maybe not undermining the original intents of the constitutions
<dneighbo> and had two deleted porn files in his user dir
<chillywilly> er, constitution
<dneighbo> er and ws-ftp
<dneighbo> btw: the reason for all this
<dneighbo> is they found wsftp installed
<dneighbo> made by ipswitch
<dneighbo> so the network 'investigator' stated wsftp was put on the machine
Action: chillywilly has used it before
<dneighbo> as a trojan back door to switch (route) IP traffic
<dneighbo> and circumvent firewalls and such
<chillywilly> omg
<dneighbo> and ICQ is a tool to 'remotely control schools servers'
<dneighbo> now talk about friggin clueless
<chillywilly> b3w4r3
<dneighbo> and then they said illegally trading music via gnapster
<chillywilly> 1 h4v3 1CQ
<dneighbo> the kid did excellent job for a 15 year old in responding
<chillywilly> y0u w1ll b3 h4x0rd
<dneighbo> basically saying that icq and wsftp are xyz and not what the district is claiming
<dneighbo> and showed technical specs from both companies
<dneighbo> as to gnapster he said prove to me ONE single file on my machine that was copyright violation
<dneighbo> i.e. i had mp3's but all were LEGAL
<dneighbo> and as to the two porn files
<dneighbo> he stated those were DELETED BEFORE YOU INVESTIGATED
<dneighbo> he said someone transmitted them as mp3
<dneighbo> er as something other than porn
<dneighbo> i.e. he didnt know they were porno in nature until after playing
<dneighbo> at which he deleted it
<chillywilly> he probably put them on disk first ;)
<chillywilly> btw, I got to that article form linuxtoday....if anyone cares to know
<chillywilly> from
<chillywilly> not many talkbacks yet
<chillywilly> hehe, they mention lessig's book
<chillywilly> cool ;)

<dneighbo> btw: had meeting w/ budget manager today and in his office quietly playing was
<dneighbo> nickelback
<dneighbo> just went up to drop some numbers off to him (he wasnt there) but tool was playing 
<jamest> you always said you would die for me
Action: dneighbo is seriously wondering if someone played w/ his radio station or if he is having mid life crisis
<jamest> when then are you so suprised to hear your eulogy
<dneighbo> normally he has classical music cd's playing
<jamest> are you saying that people that listen to tool are in a crisis situation?
<dneighbo> rofl
<Mr_You> haha.. the best thing about when it snows is watching all the people with rear wheel drive cars make attempts... the news guys get some good shots of people spinning
Action: jamest glances at the only 2 cds in his office
<dneighbo> i woudl say someone that listens to classical as well as tool is seriously weird
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> i fit that bill
<dneighbo> but i am seriously werid so its all relevant i suppose :)
<Mr_You> I think we're all weird
<jamest> um
<jamest> i have tool and a perfect circle cd on my pc
<dneighbo> most cd's are a perfect circle jamest ;)
<jamest> and wqxr is the only station in my realplayer radio list

<dneighbo> P.O.D and Project 86
<dneighbo> picked up a Pillar CD and its pretty good but different
<Mr_You> 2 hours a day?!?
<Mr_You> oh hour one way I guess
<dneighbo> 2/3 of the songs kick butt and the other 1/3 sound like a different band entirely :)
<dneighbo> Mr_You yip 25 miles one way
<dneighbo> during holiday i was making trip in about 30 minutes one way
<Mr_You> 25 miles takes an hour?
<jamest> staind and pod yip

<jamest> anywhere
<neilt> sounds good
<neilt> must use geas/CORBA or it segfaults
<neilt> that should spur some development

<chillywilly> haha
<jamest> that was IIRC a fraud
<jamest> you get the GSOD is you put in a DVD and you don't have DVD kit
<jamest> mine has been rock stable
<jamest> and it got the crap played out of it
<mdean> I refuse to buy a console - get enough enjoyment out of my pc
<chillywilly> I can't believe you sit here and defend the monopolist

<jamest> I dont defend their OS
<jamest> but their console isn't bad

<jamest> their keyboards rock

<jamest> the 6/7 thing
<jamest> ?
<chillywilly> yes and that passport and product activation is just da bomb
<jamest> passport sucks
<mdean> jamest: more like 4/5/6 or 5/6/7 for one index finger
<mdean> don't remember which, but I was really annoyed
<chillywilly> oh and its' so convient for me to store my data on M$ servers so I can be anywhere and still access my data...damn I love you M$!
<mdean> XP is starting to look more and more like KDE too
<Mr_You> XP is up to par and does feel like KDE
<chillywilly> onyl took then what?
<chillywilly> 10+ years to design a stable OS
<mdean> if you count the GUI, 15+ years ;-)
<chillywilly> haha
<chillywilly> but hey man, money is th ekey to innovation
<Mr_You> yeah.. thanks to BSD code its gotten better
<chillywilly> if you thrown enough money at it....
<mdean> I have the Windows/386 box - it's a "Graphical Environment"
<chillywilly> uh
<chillywilly> you can take 15+ years to develop a stable OS too
<Mr_You> I don't even want to talk abot M$ past.. its hell

<neilt> whats interesting the the owner of the company i work for's (and my boss's) best friend was Gore's campaign manager
<neilt> so i am learning a lot about politics
<chillywilly> I;ve had just about enough of this 2-party system that I can take....
<chillywilly> I want a party that is for the ppla nd not one that is bought
<neilt> the system really works well when compared to the alternatives
<chillywilly> umm, I don't beleive in our system at all....it's not working at all...it's basically all about the money as is every damn thing...what's the point? How is having a pile of money going to help make the world a better place?
<neilt> chillywilly:  that does not play for the best country in the world to live in
<neilt> you've been brainwashed
<chillywilly> heh, now you're resorting to insults?
<neilt> no not at all
<chillywilly> you're the one who is brainwashed
<neilt> maybe
<neilt> surly you dont imply that because i disagree with you that i am insulting you
<neilt> because that just not the case
<chillywilly> you called me brainwashed
<chillywilly> that's kind of insulting
<chillywilly> like i have no mind of my own
<Mr_You> the system works, just need more parties 
<Mr_You> campaign finance reform, etc.
<chillywilly> yes, the system as it is intended would work great
<chillywilly> but it's not carried out that way
<neilt> sure it is
<chillywilly> look at the DMCA, you think that is constitutional?
<neilt> but you have to look at the really happens, not what you hear in the news
<neilt> we are not talking about DMCA
<neilt> we are talking about the government
<chillywilly> it's bullshit...ppl need to realize that times are chaning and they need to find other ways to make their money rather than killing free use, etc.
<chillywilly> DMCA is a product of our corrupt system
<Mr_You> try to think of one thing which has been "perfect" through out a single lifetime or multiple generations
<chillywilly> it applies
<neilt> DMCA is bad
<neilt> we need to kill it
<Mr_You> everything is in constant change
<chillywilly> heh, it's not going to happen
<chillywilly> it has been bought and paid for
<neilt> freedom means that special interests have a freedom to suggest and attempt to get self serving things done
<neilt> that is freedom
<neilt> and we need to see that it is defeated
<neilt> and it will be
<neilt> because the system works in the long run
<Mr_You> politicians never think long-term
<neilt> thats what the people are for
<Mr_You> they believe the next-generations can worry about that
<chillywilly> then maybe we need less of them
<neilt> the politicians only represent the people
<chillywilly> heh, no they don't
<neilt> yes they 
<chillywilly> they are supposed to
<neilt> do
<Mr_You> they represent who puts them in office
<Mr_You> they represent who they think put them in office
<neilt> it is a complicated systems, but its still better than the alternatives
<neilt> they do in the end represent the people
<neilt> there will never be a perfect system
<neilt> but all in all, they are doing a good job
<chillywilly> that's an excuse to stop trying
<neilt> there is no excuse to stop trying
<Mr_You> there could be a perfect system if people in general were more concerned about other things than themselves
<neilt> in that we agree
<chillywilly> I thinknthe systemis nice if implemented as intended
<neilt> the system only works if we participate and make our voice heard
<chillywilly> which not everyone does nor do they care, which is sad
<chillywilly> but ppl aren't elected they are bought in this country
<neilt> chillywilly:  not true in generall
<neilt> but i does happen from time to time
<neilt> s/i/it
<chillywilly> this is the United Corporations of America, for the dollar and by the dollar
<neilt> chillywilly: it appears that you live in a really sad world
<neilt> i am glad it is not my world
<chillywilly> you are helping to create it
<chillywilly> directly
<Mr_You> thats incorrect
<chillywilly> sure he's like a big shot executive now
<chillywilly> ;P
<neilt> and proud of it
<neilt> but i have been before so its nothing new
<Mr_You> its still not directly, indirectly

<derek> which only helps give them a bigger war chest to make legislation to restrict my freedom
<derek> so i cant really agrue much w/o being a hippocrite on that issue :)

<chillywilly> maybe
<chillywilly> you never knwo when da masta will appear
<chillywilly> knwo even
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> I did it again
<chillywilly> some day I will learn to type and then everyone better look out ;P
<kreiszner> I am completely new to this IRC thing and I was trying to arrouse him to get some preliminary direction in installing gnue
<kreiszner> What roll do you play in this thing.
<chillywilly> court jester ;)
<chillywilly> j/k
<chillywilly> I hace contributed code to GEAS (the application server) and they actually let me gave cvs write access
<chillywilly> shace/have
<chillywilly> s/hace/have
<chillywilly> damn I should go to bed
<chillywilly> my typing is going down the tubes
<kreiszner> Well at least I know that this works. My thping is no better
<chillywilly> must....code....
<chillywilly> jim, I'm a doctor damnit, not a hacker
<kreiszner> k
<chillywilly> woops
<chillywilly> star trek flash backs
Action: chillywilly is trying to see how many code red mlountain dew cans he can stack on his desk
<chillywilly> er, mountain
<kreiszner> How do I you leave a message that will be brought to the attention of derek.
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> you can leave a memo with memoserv
<chillywilly> I have not used it though
<chillywilly> it just bugs me after I identify with my nick
<chillywilly> you may have to register your nick name to do it
<chillywilly> [20:42:42] -NickServ- Password accepted - you are now recognized
<chillywilly> [20:42:45] --- services. sets mode +e chillywilly
<chillywilly> [20:42:45] -MemoServ- You have no new memos
<chillywilly> we have nickserv, chanserv and memoserv
<chillywilly> all little server programs for registering channels, nick names, and leaving ppl memos
<chillywilly> you /msg them
<chillywilly> like
<chillywilly> to register your nick
<chillywilly> you do
<chillywilly>  /msg nickserv register <password>
<chillywilly> I think
<chillywilly> where you pick the password of course
<chillywilly> I hope you are not bombarded with info ;)
<chillywilly> I tend to ramble
<nickr> hotchy motchy
<kreiszner> I noticed
<chillywilly> nickr: you live!
<chillywilly> ;P
<nickr> I sure do.
<chillywilly> sup g money
<nickr> namuch cdawg
<kreiszner> When derek says install dependencies that means things like pearl, wxWindows and the third thing.
<kreiszner> Do you have to install all three
<chillywilly> yea, code that is used by GNUe code
<nickr> python
<chillywilly> yea we don;t use perl
<nickr> I don't think gnue depends on perl
<chillywilly> its python
<chillywilly> you need to install them all
<kreiszner> Sorry about error
<chillywilly> you using redhat?
<chillywilly> what GNU/Linux distro you got?
<kreiszner> Does Red Hat 7.2 install all of these if you install everything.
<chillywilly> ummm, I have no idea but jyou can probbaly get rpms of all of them
Action: chillywilly uses Debian
<nickr> possibly
<chillywilly> you know how to install an rpm and stuff?
<chillywilly> you can first query the installed packages to see if they are already installed
Action: chillywilly tries to remember rpm syntax
<chillywilly> you can do: rpm -qa | grep python form the shell
<kreiszner> I also use Corel R2 (I understand Dibian derivative) on my file and print server because it was easy to set up for a novice
<chillywilly> yea, that was a debian derivative....that distro is dead now
<chillywilly> they aren't making it anymore unfortunately
<kreiszner> I havn't been ver successful in installing RPM's in the past
<chillywilly> well you can do the query all thing and grep for strings to see if you already have python, etc. installed
<kreiszner> I saw where some group was planning to revive Corel L it but I suspect it will take a while
<chillywilly> like: rpm -qa | grep <string>
<chillywilly> ok
<kreiszner> How do you query all
<chillywilly> rpm -qa
<chillywilly> that will list everything
<chillywilly> iirc
<chillywilly> everything that is installed
<chillywilly> to narrow things down you 'pipe' that output into grep like this: rpm -qa | grep <string>
<chillywilly> where <string> is python, wxwindows, etc.
<chillywilly> whatever you want to look for
<chillywilly> of course there's other ways of doing it....but we won't go there I don't want to confuse you
<kreiszner> I did the rpm -qa and gosh. I did a rpm -q python and got 1.5.2-35
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> that version is a bit old
<chillywilly> I think we require python 2.x now
<kreiszner> does grep creat a file
<chillywilly> you said redhat 7.1 right?
<kreiszner> RH 7.2
<chillywilly> kreiszner: no it seraches for strings....see the pipe takes output and reroutes it into input
<chillywilly> it's a way to glue 2 programs together
<chillywilly> but you don't really nedd to worry about it
<kreiszner> When you are in a shell how do you send the output to a file instead of the screen.
<chillywilly> like this
<chillywilly> rpm -qa > file
<chillywilly> that will stick it in a file named 'file'
<chillywilly> the output from rpm
<chillywilly> that is
<kreiszner> gosh thats simple enough. Thats the prob. with being a newbie.
<chillywilly> the '>' redirects standard out
<kreiszner> how do you print from the shell
<chillywilly> use the lpr command
<chillywilly> that hsould send it to a printer
<chillywilly> but you have to have your printing configured
<derek> kreiszner: hello
<chillywilly> there he is
<kreiszner> hello
<derek> we need to find jbailey
<derek> kreiszner: i think he could easily convert your corel box to debian
<chillywilly> ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/redhat/7.2/en/os/i386/RedHat/RPMS/python2-2.1.1-2.i386.rpm
<chillywilly> there's python for ya
<chillywilly> ;)
<kreiszner> chillywilly has been telling me that the dependencies I need to set up are the ones that I downloaded from your web site so my next step is to try to install them
<chillywilly> derek: it is easy you just point it to a debian mirror and update
<kreiszner> I would love to convert it to Dibian
<derek> kreiszner: up front do you plan on using any windows clients?
<derek> or only linux clients
<derek> chillywilly: im not sure if it would be as easy as changing apt sources and doing dist-upgrade
<chillywilly> well progeny is
<chillywilly> I don't see why corel would not be
<derek> if you plan on using any windows clients i think it might be best to get postgres installed on your server
<chillywilly> but I'm not an expert on it
<derek> and then setup a windows gnue client to test it out
<chillywilly> maybe good ol' nickr would know
<derek> and then we can work on the linux client
<derek> yeah nickr would likely know
<nickr> I think its possible to convert corel to debian
<chillywilly> me too ;)
<nickr> if corel is based on a reasonbly recent iteration
<chillywilly> it might be based on slink
<chillywilly> isn't corel pretyy old?
<chillywilly> pretty
<nickr> that may present an issue
<nickr> yea
<derek> nah i dont think its that old
<derek> i think its based off potato
<derek> kreiszner: you still here?
<chillywilly> then there should be no problems
<chillywilly> (or relatively few)
<chillywilly> if I wasn;t so lazy I would investigate the matter
<kreiszner> sorry my daughter just called
<chillywilly> it's called corel easy linux right?
<kreiszner> she is traveling 
<derek> ah
<derek> let me know when you are done
<nickr> ls
<kreiszner> I back
<derek> cat: ls
<derek> : No such file or directory
<nickr> woop
<derek> kreiszner: did you plan on using any windows machines?
<chillywilly> linux.corel.com redirects to http://www.xandros.net/
Action: derek is thinking if you have a windows box maybe we start there
<derek> as it should take all of 10 minutes to get up and running
<derek> so you have an idea of what is there
<chillywilly> the on .exe should ne painless
<kreiszner> I had thought about setting up the client on both the windows and RH 7.2 because they are both on the same machine w dual boot.
<chillywilly> s/on/one
<derek> then we can work on getting your server and clients up to snuff
<derek> of course we want to make it so you do NOT need windows anymore :)
<kreiszner> of course
<derek> are you in windows or linux now?
<derek> if linux are you on the corel or the redhat box?
<chillywilly> he running the real OS ;)
<chillywilly> he's
<kreiszner> thats fine with me I already installed at least 2 of the 3 dependencies on windows.
<derek> kreiszner: in windows you dont have to install any dependencies :)
<kreiszner> RH 7.2
<derek> ok lets get your rh7.2 machine ready :)
<kreiszner> I have yet to get IRC up and running in Windows
<derek> no lets do the linux box
<kreiszner> OK
<derek> i have time :)
<derek> and would rather see you on linux :)
<derek> open a terminal window
<derek> and su
<derek> i.e. have root access
<derek> btw: you run gnome or kde (or some other window manager?)
<chillywilly>  ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/redhat/7.2/en/os/i386/RedHat/RPMS/python2-2.1.1-2.i386.rpm
<chillywilly> there's the python rpm
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> he's got an old 1.5.2 python
<chillywilly> installed
<derek> thats fine
<derek> kreiszner: you still here?
<chillywilly> you need 2.x now right?
<kreiszner> I am running K right now but both instlled.
<derek> kreiszner: cool, just checking :)
<derek> you have terminal open?
<derek> and root?
<derek> if so do rpm -qa | grep python
<derek> and paste the output here
<kreiszner> How do you make a note with the kreiszne: thing
<derek> you using xchat?
<kreiszner> I am trying to open a terminal
<derek> if so type the first letter or two of persons nick and hit tab key
<derek> and it will autocomplete and add the :
<nickr> its called konsole in kde
<derek> nickr: thanks :) i dont use kde so i had no clue 
<derek> i think it looks like a monitor w/ a shell in the corner
<chillywilly> nickr: you admit to using kde?
<derek> on your bottom bar (iirc) been long time
<chillywilly> brb
<nickr> chillywilly: no, I admit that lusers that I know use KDE so I occationally have to help them
<nickr> I admit nothing!
<derek> kreiszner: you able to get konsole up?
<kreiszner> It seems to hate me but I have a shell console open as root on 1 will that do
<kreiszner> I now have a console up as root
<derek> ok do that rpm -qa | grep python
<chillywilly> good job
<chillywilly> ;)
<derek> and paste output here
<chillywilly> nickr: hehe
<chillywilly> [23:04:22] <chillywilly> you can do: rpm -qa | grep python from the shell
<chillywilly> derek: don't you read the back log?
<chillywilly> he said he had 1.5.2
<derek> cool your jets :)
<kreiszner> How do you copy from console
<chillywilly> derek: never
<chillywilly> that's what the man wants be to do
<chillywilly> but you know what I say about that
<derek> highlight it with mouse in console
<chillywilly> f*** the man
<derek> then click in the window you are typing to talk to us
<derek> and then click left and right mouse at same time 
<derek> iirc
<kreiszner> iirc
<derek> iirc == if i remember correctly
<chillywilly> recall
<chillywilly> ;P
<kreiszner> I am confused.
<derek> cant get it to paste?
<kreiszner> not so far
<derek> ok can you just type what the output was?
<derek> you only have python-1.5.2
<derek> or was more listed?
<kreiszner> When I highlight in terminal am I supposed to do anything else
<derek> nope
<kreiszner> yes only 1.5.2
<derek> i think i have almost all the dependencies downloaded now
<kreiszner> iirc ==
<derek> i was going to upload them to our website for you
<derek> once you have the terminal highlighted (the text you want to copy)
<derek> then go to where you want to paste it (in this case xchat)
<derek> and click left and right mouse buttons at the same time (to do the paste)
<kreiszner> I may already have 2.2.7 downloaded
<derek> the iirc is short hand for saying if i remember correctly

<nickr> left andright buttons, or middle button if you have one
<derek> kreiszner: im grabbing all deps for sanity so next time someone has to do this they can go to ONE spot and get all they need
<derek> also wx* stuff is picky
<kreiszner> doesn't work for me
<derek> you have to have right packages for each as well as right packages for python
<derek> kreiszner: you must not be kicking the computer hard enough ;)
<nickr> you may have to middleclick in the area that you normall type in of the window
<nickr> like if theres an input box or something
<derek> yes

<derek> KICK BUTT!
<chillywilly> he's got python 2.x
<chillywilly> rock on
<derek> you have python 2.1
<derek> damn
[00:02] Last message repeated 2 time(s).
<derek> only damn cause someone (CHILLY)
<derek> told me you didnt have python
<derek> so i grabbed all wx stuff for 2.2 :)
<kreiszner> I told you were talking to an infant
Action: derek trout slaps chillywilly
<derek> kreiszner: not a big deal really
<derek> just give me another few minutes :)
<chillywilly> no I said he had the old one
<chillywilly> get your facts straight
<nickr> chillywilly: that implied that he didn't have any 2.x
<kreiszner> are you 2 going to argue all nite
<chillywilly> no
<chillywilly> I just said he had the old one
<chillywilly> ;P
<kreiszner> this is the most fun I have had since I last flew my Mooney
<nickr> you just said that he just had the old one
<chillywilly> Mooney?
<derek> :)
<chillywilly> nickr: "I will no t admit to anything"
<chillywilly> s/t/to
<derek> kreiszner: actually im really really really glad you are here
<derek> besides being a good potential user of gnue
<derek> we really need a red hat user
<derek> i think all of us run debian now
<kreiszner> An airpane that now sits idle for lack of an anual a 1963 beast that flies at 175 mph and almost 20 mpg
<derek> i used to run some redhat stuff so always was keeping redhat stuff current
<derek> but i started compiling from source on redhat
<nickr> debian is a virus
<derek> so now i can post the dependencies for others to benefit
<derek> and maybe you can make a newbie install doc for rh7.2 :)
<kreiszner> sounds ok to me
<kreiszner> or I can install Dibian I have no real loyalties at this pt I havn't been able to run Samba on RH
Action: chillywilly has samba running on his network on his debian machine(s)
<derek> i would say you would be way better off running debian on all machines
<derek> BUT red hat has some nice newbie tools
<derek> so for now i think you have an ok setup
<derek> rh7.2 client
<kreiszner> yes it does
<derek> soon to be debian server :)
<nickr> someone should port newbie tools to debian
<derek> once we get you using linux regularly
<nickr> actually I was thinking of making a netcfg like program that uses the ifup/ifdown/etc-network-interfaces thing
<derek> we will have you 'upgrade' to debian and deploy it to rest of your workstations
<nickr> once I finish tmta, once I finish whatever
<derek> main reason most of us stopped using red hat was its more a sys admin nightmare than debian
<derek> im gonna get a soda
<derek> bbiam (be back in a minute)
Action: derek is uploading dependencies to gnue.org for you
<kreiszner> I have many linux volums left on this 100 G HD that could be used for another Linux OS intall
<kreiszner> iirc 4 
<derek> kreiszner: no need to do that :)
<derek> unless you want to
<derek> rh7.2 will work
<derek> i do think you will want to get rid of corel on that server though
<kreiszner> lets do rh7.2 first
<derek> as its not 'supported' well, i would suggest moving to debian
<derek> if its not a 'critical' working server
<derek> we can surely try the apt-get dist-upgrade
<kreiszner> gosh I wiil do whatever you want
<derek> if its critical server we will get jbailey involved and he can help :)
<chillywilly> jeff is da man
<chillywilly> derek: you da man too
<derek> argh, i hate that my upstream broadband is crap
<kreiszner> I primarily use rh to tar my widows stuff. Its great to do backups when windows is not looking and trying to stop you from copying some file.
<derek> btw: once you move to linux for data storage
<derek> you will fall in love with rsync :)
<derek> cheapest backup utility on the market
<kreiszner> ? rsync
<derek> rsync is a utility that will keep to directories in 'sync'
<derek> and can use ssh (a secure connection) i.e. so the directories can be on 'remote' machines
<derek> i.e. you can clone your data every night with an incremental backup
<derek> to hard disk (instead of removable media)
<derek> but lets stick to gnue :)
<kreiszner> another thing to learn but I gues I am ready
<derek> kreiszner: run the following in your konsole 
<derek> rpm -qa | grep wx
<derek> and paste the output here
<kreiszner> [root@localhost /]# rpm -qa | grep wx
<kreiszner> [root@localhost /]#
<derek> ok
<derek> now try
<derek> rpm -qa | grep mesa
<derek> and paste here
<derek> then do 
<kreiszner> [root@localhost /]# rpm -qa | grep mesa
<kreiszner> [root@localhost /]#
<derek> rpm -qa | grep postgresql
<derek> and post here
<kreiszner> I like thsi pat stuff
<kreiszner> [root@localhost /]# rpm -qa | grep postgresql
<kreiszner> postgresql-7.1.3-2
<kreiszner> postgresql-docs-7.1.3-2
<kreiszner> postgresql-tcl-7.1.3-2
<kreiszner> postgresql-libs-7.1.3-2
<kreiszner> postgresql-server-7.1.3-2
<kreiszner> postgresql-odbc-7.1.3-2
<derek> almost done uploading last file so we can get to the 'fun stuff'
<kreiszner> postgresql-tk-7.1.3-2
<kreiszner> postgresql-contrib-7.1.3-2
<kreiszner> postgresql-perl-7.1.3-2
<kreiszner> postgresql-python-7.1.3-2
<kreiszner> postgresql-devel-7.1.3-2
<kreiszner> postgresql-jdbc-7.1.3-2
<derek> ok cool so you have postgres installed here :)
<derek> so we can test all of gnue on this machine
<derek> w/o the corel box
<kreiszner> k
<derek> eventually you will want postgres on the server opposed to your client
<derek> but for sake of testing tonight its good that you have postgres on this machine :)
<kreiszner> ok
<derek> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/dependencies/python2.1/
<derek> you will find the wx dependencies you need there
<derek> save them in the same place on your machine
<derek> let me know when you have downloaded them all and we can walk through installing them :)
Action: derek really likes nickelback
<kreiszner> I already have wxGTK & wxPython 2.3.0 downloaded
<kreiszner> It doensn't look like much so I will download all
<derek> have you installed the wxgtk and wxpython?
<derek> if not i would grab whats there and delete your other download (just to be sure its correct versions)
<derek> as the wxpython is specific to version of python
<derek> and the wxgtk is specific to the version of wxpython
<derek> wxgtk-gl might not be necessary, but i generally install it anyhow
<kreiszner> OK The other files are on a FAT volumn
<derek> let me know when you have 
<derek>  wxBase-2.3.2-1.i386.rpm 04-Jan-2002 23:18   564k  
<derek>  [[   ]] wxGTK-2.3.2-1.i386.rpm 04-Jan-2002 23:23   1.8M  
<derek>  [[   ]] wxGTK-gl-2.3.2-1.i38..> 04-Jan-2002 23:23    19k  
<derek>  [[   ]] wxPython-2.3.2.1-1-P..> 04-Jan-2002 23:29   2.1M  
<derek>  [[   ]] wxPython-gl-2.3.2.1-..> 04-Jan-2002 23:29    32k  
<kreiszner> anothe min or two and I will have them
<derek> all downloaded
<derek> and we will brave the install :)
<derek> also if you go to 
<derek> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/dependencies/
<derek> there should be a single rpm for mesa
<derek> go ahead and download it too
<kreiszner> ok
<derek> anyone read 'the white plague' by frank herbert
<derek> found it on my shelf (from books inherited from dad) and picked it up and started reading it
Action: derek is rather impressed good book
<kreiszner> it says 1 min 20 sec to mesa
<derek> considering its circa 1982, rather good grasp on genetics and dna/rna type of scenarios
<derek> scary thing is then it was 'speculation' about things science 'could someday do'
<derek> now these are things science could quite easily achieve
<kreiszner> yeah now there are indications that the speed of light can be exceeded and electronic messages can be sent back in time
<kreiszner> I can see the day when some countries will really create the Clonus scenario or something close to that.
<kreiszner> I am downloaded
<derek> oops sorry was reading...
<derek> thast right you are scientist of sort no?
<derek> chemist?
<derek> ok in your konsole window go to the directory that you downloaded those files in
<derek> and type 'ls'
<derek> and paste the result here
<kreiszner> I am a PhD analytical chemist and specialize in air analysis
<derek> sweet, i was going to school to be a bio chemist, but computers allured me away
<derek> i loved chemistry and biology, but i couldnt see working for a big pharmacutical doing same expirement for hours every day
<kreiszner> When I had initial contact with computers it was an IBM 360 & punch cards
<derek> and the thought of medical school was hideous :)
<derek> hey now
<derek> i use an os/390 now :)
<derek> no punch cards though
<nickr> why is mesa a dependency?
<derek> nickr: it might not be
<kreiszner> It took a million dollars or so to own one of those things and the price tag turned me off. The personal computer turned me on again
<derek> nickr: the deal is you can install the gl stuff
<kreiszner> I am in dir
<derek> for wx to get more widgets
<nickr> uh
<derek> in which case you need mesa or python gl
<nickr> thats silly
<derek> we to my knowledge do NOT use any widgets that use this so its probably not necessary 
<kreiszner> what is mesa
<derek> so i plan to try w/o it :)
<derek> its a 3d library
<derek> do an ls
<derek> and paste contents of output here
<kreiszner> [root@localhost Ken4]# ls

<derek> if you use U
<derek> it upgrades but if its not installed it installs anyhow

<uzr> i don't know much about "enterprise" software.  I'm looking for software that will access my bank account for me.  Is this gnue ?
<derek> kreiszner: rock i think you might be set
<derek> im gonna hold off on the gl and mesa packages for now
<derek> nope
<chillywilly> gnucash ;)
<derek> banks wont let free software access them
<derek> at this point NO free software i know of does this
<derek> HOWEVER
<derek> there is a product that is commericial but runs on linux
<uzr> open source?
<derek> that has open source clients that will let you access merchant accounts
<derek> and do EFT
<derek> i.e. direct deposit and such
<derek> but doesnt allow you to do 'online' banking
<derek> your best bet is to use a bank that lets you have web access
<uzr> hmm.  what is 'online' banking? I mean what does it not allow?
<derek> uzr: EFT's and Merchant Accounts are basically for business to business type of transactions
<derek> credit card processing
<derek> direct deposit
<derek> fund transfers etc
<uzr> well.  I get my salary direct deposit.
<derek> i assume you are looking for something more like quicken
<derek> that lets you download your bank account info into it
<derek> kreiszner: its time to install gnue :)
<uzr> Ok.
<kreiszner> how do you get my name at the beginning of text
<derek> i typ kr and hit enter
<derek> er tab not enter

<kreiszner> de
<chillywilly> nick completion rulez for us alazy ppl
<uzr> I want a open source client that publishes a standard protocal for dealing with banks' web-based services through backends written for the banks' service.
<derek> and download gnue-common-0.1.0.tar.gz 
<chillywilly> heh, that would make too much sense
<kreiszner> derek: I am ready to install
<chillywilly> they needa  way to screw the customers you know
<derek> uzr: you want to talk to dres or grib (sometimes in here)
<derek> or on irc.gnome.org #gnucash
<uzr> aha.  Is gnucash eventually going to do this?
<derek> they probably have more experience than anyone trying to get this kind of thing going
<derek> as they develop gnucash
<derek> uzr: they have wanted to for a very long time
<uzr> cool.
<derek> the banks are not friendly 
<uzr> not cool.
<uzr> what do they do?  Change there interface constantly?
<uzr> s/there/thier/
<derek> no they wont publish the interface (or so is my understanding)
<uzr> But If an open source browser can access it ... ?
<derek> and i suppose reverse engineering a client is a big no no more than normal
<derek> as it could be viewed as 'hacking' a bank
<derek> which is federal crime
<derek> uzr: i havent played much i dont know the issues and such
<dres_> well I know my bank has changed the web pages three times in the last year.  there are standard protocols, but no bank will provide us specs or a test machine.  so...
<derek> kreiszner: were you able to find gnue-common-0.1.0.tar.gz ?
<chillywilly> banks can kiss my butt
<derek> dres_: thanks for piping up :)
Action: chillywilly puts his money under hsi matress ;)
<derek> chillywilly: they told me to tell you to bend over and part the hairs
<dres_> uzr: there are plans for a couple of the internet setups (paypal for one), but no one has gotten to it yet.

Action: chillywilly locks his doors
Nick change: dres_ -> dres
<uzr> i'm c++,c,java,...
<derek> kreiszner: you still here?
<dres> uzr: your best bet it to search the mailing list for "online banking" or somesuch and read the discussion that has occured.
<chillywilly> nice to meet you c++,c,java,...
<dres> uzr: gnucash is C and scheme.
<dres> that's MR. c++,c,java to you buster. ;)
<chillywilly> hehe
<dres> derek: saw the blue tab :) I like xchat.
<chillywilly> why can't I make this class a friend in c++ and get the compile to let me access data members of the class that it is a friends of?
<chillywilly> this is pissing me off
<chillywilly> it should work
Action: dres forgets C++ access rules faster than driving home. ;)
<uzr> friend is a one-way thing in c++.
<chillywilly> I know
<uzr> well. i don't know, than.
<chillywilly> I made this class a friend of another
<uzr> s/than/then/
<kreiszner> derek: its downloaded
<uzr> so it's a bug in the compiler?
<derek> cool
<uzr> have you used friends with the compiler before?
<derek> go here http://gnuenterprise.org/download.php?op=viewsdownload&sid=5&orderby=dateD
<chillywilly> and the compiler bitches to me about undefined variables, instaed of recorgnizing it as the members of the class it brefriends it just bitches at me
<derek> download GNUe-Designer-0.1.0.tar.gz 
<derek> then go to http://gnuenterprise.org/download.php?op=viewsdownload&sid=1&orderby=dateD
<derek> and download 
<derek> GNUe-Forms-0.1.0.tar.gz 
<uzr> You're sure you completely understand the c++ friend concept?
<derek> let me know when they are downloaded
<uzr> It doesn't make sense to say "it has the members of the class it befriends".

<chillywilly> if you make something a friend you can it can then access your data memebers right?

psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<uzr> well. yes and no.  The data doesn't exist unless you have an instance.  i can access member x if I have instance a:  a.x;   Inside the member functions you can say just x because of the implied "this" instance:  this->x

<derek> hello psu
<chillywilly> yea, I am thinking of inheritance like a moron
<chillywilly> no wonder
<chillywilly> duh
<uzr> In a friend class, you can access the other classes members but those members don't belong to the this instnace.
<psu> hi derek
<chillywilly> you are right
<chillywilly> thanks
<chillywilly> I am a bit rusty
<uzr> maybe you want inheritence instead of friend.
<chillywilly> no I don't
<chillywilly> I was just thinking of friends like an inheritance type of thing....I dunno guess I am smoking crack or something
<chillywilly> anybody want some?
<derek> kreiszner: also download http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/dependencies/python2.1/PyXML-0.7-2.1.i386.rpm
<uzr> In OOP, composition as opposed to inheritence, usually yeilds a more flexible design.  So as a general rule, I never use inheritence unless I have thoroughly considered and discounted an alternative composition approach.
<chillywilly> I am using the strategy patter so...inheritance is out of the question
<chillywilly> pattern
<uzr> ok.
<uzr> "friend" classes should be avoided too of course, but it's always judgement call.
<chillywilly> I don't want the I don;t want the strategy to be inherited form the context
<chillywilly> bah

<derek> ok since there is that conflict we have a few choices
<derek> you could do the upgrade with a --force (but would probably screw up 4suite)
<derek> or you could remove 4suite (but we dont know what its used for)
<derek> or you can get the tarball of pyxml and compile from source
<derek> the last is probably the safest option

<kreiszner> lets do the source
<derek> it runs our setup program

<derek> btw: this is why redhat sucks :)
<derek> what we did here woudl have take maybe 15 / 20 minutes in debian

<derek> then do

<derek> then
<derek> python2.1 setup.py install

<derek> then go back to GNUe-Forms-0.1.0/
<derek> and do python2.1 setup.py install
<derek> and if its successful you should be able to do a gfclient -v
<kreiszner> OK I will be out of town through next tues starting sat evening or sunday but I will try to download and intall in the meantime I am saving all this in a word procwessor file.
<derek> er gfclient --version

<holsch> error: can't copy 'doc/techref.pdf': doesn't exist or not a regular file
<holsch> ... and ./setup.py build  doesn't create the PDF from the TEX file ...
<ra3vat> does it prevent other things to be installed?
<holsch> I don't have a clue --- with a "make -n" I could check it, but ./setup.py is pretty alien to me (used it today the first time)
<ra3vat> hold on
<holsch> Yes, it prevents. After "touch doc/techref.pdf" it bailed out with an error about a missing user_guide.txt ...
<holsch> Looks like  ./setup.py build  does not create everything
Action: jbailey is away: Breakfast with Angie.
<ra3vat> holsch: have you installed gnue/common before gnue/forms?
<holsch> Yessir!  :-)
<ra3vat> holsch: and after that you can try to do ./setup.py devel in gnue/forms
<holsch> (I even copied the connection.conf and gnue.conf as told)
<holsch> That seemed just to create client/gfcvs  ...   but now it's done
<holsch> 'devel' was not listed in ./setup --help-commands. What is it's purpose?
<ra3vat> and you can use client/gfcvs instead of client/gfclient
<holsch> Aha ...   BTW I'm still VERY unknown with GNU, I did not even get to install a product or setting up my postgresql database for GNUe ...
<ra3vat> it lets to test forms without really installing it, making some links needed
<holsch> 'gfcvs helloworld2.gfd' works

<derek> i know i have asked this before but how do you get X to run on a different display?
<derek> i.e. i have it running on f1/f7 now
<derek> but i want to run another instance on f2
<derek> is something like startx -display :1
<derek> or something
<derek> .......
<nickr> ttyblah
<nickr> startx -- :1 tty2
<nickr> although you can get read of all the gettys and the X will be on the next available I think
<nickr> likew if you only have getty running on tty1, :0 will be on tty2
<nickr> :1 on tty3
<nickr> tc
<nickr> etc
<derek> ah sorry was in other window
<derek> startx -- :1 
<derek> seems to work
<derek> damn -- always gets me :)
<derek> until i read man xinit
<derek> instead of man startx
<derek> nickr: you ever play games on linux
<derek> what i really want to do is run a game in current X session but make it so i can go to other virtual desktops etc
<derek> and never can do that
<derek> so just do in separate X session :(
<derek> ls
<derek> oops
<nickr> most fullscreen games in X assume exclusivity
<nickr> theres no reliable way to recover from the game capturing the mouse etc for the window manager
<nickr> unless the game explicitly gives it up
<nickr> or is killed

Action: chillywilly can play full screen snes with zsnes and still minimize it
<chillywilly> snes games that is
<chillywilly> I think it it dependent on the toolkit
<nickr> it ddepends on hwo the developers do things
<nickr> fullscreen in X is getting better and better
<chillywilly> yes, that too
<chillywilly> but they shouldn't hog the whole screen imho ;)
<chillywilly> you should be able to pause and minimize it if you want
<chillywilly> speaking of games
<chillywilly> do you think it is ethically correct wrt to Free Software for a company to release their gaming engine as Free Software, but not any of the levels/data to play the games that they develop? ike say how id software does it
<chillywilly> s/ike/Like
<nickr> I think it is
<chillywilly> yea, me too because it is art and not a functional work that you are buying
<chillywilly> when you buy the levels and stuff
<nickr> thats exactly my argument
<nickr> although I think they should release Free data or at least specs to the engine
<chillywilly> I think RMS would agree on that one too
<Isomer> hmm
<chillywilly> well yes, the Free engine needs Free documentation too ;)
Action: chillywilly just had to read a section int he flex manual twice before he understood it
<nickr> thats not good
<chillywilly> well sometimes I am slow
Action: chillywilly braces for impact
<chillywilly> come on you know you want to take a shot
<chillywilly> ;P
<nickr> what shot? no, I think its a failing in the manual
<chillywilly> I think I read it too fast the first time
<chillywilly> I think I am going to hack the parser to do GObjects
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> muuwaahahahhaa
<nickr> sounds like a smart thing to do
<chillywilly> I am sure to get some flack so I will have to post a patch first ;)
<chillywilly> to the mailing list
<nickr> why?
<nickr> seems like an easish way to do GEAS
<chillywilly> well, because glib 2.0 is still in development and I would be stepping on reinhard's toes
<chillywilly> but we already depend on glib anyway
<nickr> yea
<derek> to me it should all be free
<derek> BUT
<derek> i would be more lenient in the gamers model
<derek> for one reason,
<derek> i can think of no economically viable model for them to survive w/o it
<derek> i.e. in business apps you have support and services to go with your goods
<derek> so what i see is 'levels' and such being more a 'service'
<derek> i.e. you are buying game content
<derek> i dont 'like' the idea, but i am willing to be pratical in nature :)
<derek> i would even be ok at this point w/ prop games
<derek> that when shelf life not profitable are completely gpl'd
<derek> this puts lots of good bases out there for free software developers to expand on
<chillywilly> I really have no beef with proprietary games as they aren't an essential element or anything ;)...you don'y NEED them
<chillywilly> don't
<Isomer> hrm
<derek> well and there is the argument of does it make it any better for society
<derek> but i still dont like EITHER of those arguments
<Isomer> I've run into rather frequently having OSS software thats got checks in it to catch cheaters
<derek> i truly believe they should be libre
<Isomer> and the cheaters RTFS and evading them
<chillywilly> I suppose one could say that games are a poduct of coiety and reflect how we live
<chillywilly> society
<derek> well to me its all about innovation
<derek> like some people say art shoudl be exempt
<derek> where i distinctly disagree
<derek> i have too often heard musical artists do 'remakes' of songs
<derek> or use 'samples' of songs
<derek> and made in my opinion surpassed the original work
<chillywilly> yea, billy organ's verison of landslide is better than the original, imho ;)
<chillywilly> corgan's
<derek> copyright heavily restricts this
<nickr> I like the shelflife idea
<derek> nickr: im staunch facist :)
<derek> i really believe seize the moment
<nickr> because it makes it a service
<chillywilly> hehe
<derek> the idea of getting 'protection' for a period of time seems cowardly to me
<chillywilly> no compromises here
<nickr> you are pying for freshness someting you'll get for free eventually
<derek> BUT
<chillywilly> we want freedom
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> NOW
<derek> i would however settle for something like a 1 year copyright
<derek> as in this day and age if you have something and cant turn a profit on it in a year
<derek> you dont deserve to IMHO
<derek> and being the 'leader' for a year should  give you more than a fair entrenchment in the market
<chillywilly> well the original constitution recognized that copyright is justa  way of limiting Free speech and that is why copyrights are supposed to expire
<derek> to stay ahead of the pack
<chillywilly> they wanted a balance
<chillywilly> but we aren't getting that at all
<derek> chillywilly: well they were made in an age where information did not have the ability to transmit so fastly
<derek> and products took MUCH longer to develop
<derek> and had SERIOUS overhead costs for development
<chillywilly> now anyone with a PC can be a software house ;P
<derek> and so to encourage people to pour out the cash and resources to innovate they had to give them protection (or lead time to recoup costs)
<derek> chillywilly: EXACTLY
<derek> for 1500 i can create my own music studio
<chillywilly> which is cool
<derek> and for basic .50 a cd i can cut PHYSICAL cds
<derek> or for 40 a month (broadband) i can distribute my music over the net
<chillywilly> this is why i think the whole corporate strictire which is supposed to fund such SERIOUS overhead things is obsolete
<derek> we are seeing same advances in movie/video
<derek> and book distribution
<derek> and have LONG seen it (since BBS systems) for software
<chillywilly> yep
<derek> i think these are the issues really driving copyright reform
<chillywilly> and now they want to try and reign the internet back in
<chillywilly> with internet II
<derek> the things that are really difficult and costly
<derek> i think can be covered by patents
<derek> instead of copyright
<derek> i.e. if ford develops a new propane combustable engine
<derek> patent the technology
<chillywilly> yes, and industrial endeavor
<derek> to get the competitive lead time to recoup costs
<nickr> patents shouldn't last so long though
<derek> same with pharmicutials
<derek> nickr: i agree
<nickr> and shouldn't be so far reaching
<chillywilly> you have read Tony's essay on M$ being a dinosaur?
<derek> i would say then based on 'industry' 
<derek> i.e. technology (software) would not ahve concept of patents
<chillywilly> (I know you don't see eye to eye with him)
<derek> some things would
<derek> liek pharmacetuals
<nickr> people patenting poutting plugs on the edge of pcmcia cards!
<derek> and engineer feets
<derek> put they would be very limited 
<derek> like 1 to 5 years in length
<derek> i would do a stari step
<derek> where for the 1st year no one could touch the technology
<chillywilly> it is abasically about how the corporate structure is good for industrial endeavors that required massive capital investments
<derek> in year 2 - 3 people could start to develop but have some limited distribution or pay a kick back to patent holder
<chillywilly> but in this age it is not the case
<derek> and in year 4 - 5 it would lax even further
<chillywilly> at leats not for IT
<chillywilly> and software, etc.
<derek> and after year 5 the patent becomes public domain
<derek> or something
<derek> chillywilly: i agree
<derek> software, music, etc are becoming less need of 'industry' and thus the protection HURTS more than it HELP
<chillywilly> yea...
<chillywilly> that's why I am so anti-corporate these days....they are only in it for the money (some of them) and the simple truth is they are a dying breed ;P
