<nickr> hah
<chillywilly> hmmm, why does reinhard count lines himself instead of using the yylineno option?
<chillywilly> hmmm, I don;t get why he would define his own alphanum, etc. ethier when there's [:alphanum:], etc. classes that you can use

<holsch> Hey, does anybody have a tip for me on how to make geas running?  It complains about geas-alias.cfg but I cannot find a template for it

<holsch> Hi Neilt
<holsch> Do you have a tip for me on how to make geas running?  It complains about geas-alias.cfg but I cannot find a template for it
<neilt> hello
<neilt> holsch: let me look, hold on
<neilt> what exactly does it complain about?
<holsch> When it does not exist: kernel segmentation fault: root file system corrupted. system terminating.
<holsch> When I touch it (I have not found any docu on it's contents): error: Parse error in line 1 of file 'geas-alias.cfg'
<neilt> where is geas-alias.cfg located
<neilt> ?
<holsch> in /usr/local/etc  (the path where it is is in /usr/local/etc/geas.conf)
<neilt> thats real interesting
<neilt> i have never installed geas, i run the development version out of the source dir
<neilt> reinhard does the install stuff, but let me look around a bit
<holsch> I could run it out of sourcedir, too. But my "find" command didn't find that file either. Is it created somehow automatically?
<neilt> thats what i am checking
<neilt> i dont seem to have it either
<neilt> and my geas seems to run fine
<holsch> What's in your geas.cfg file then?
<holsch> BTW, in the CVS there are TWO geas.cfg's ...
<neilt> are you running from cvs or distribution?
<holsch> CVS
Action: neilt goes to get current cvs and make it
<neilt> hold on
<neilt> i dont have that file
<holsch> Sure, I don't have it either :-)
<holsch> but geas/source/geas-server.c loadTableAliases want's this file

<holsch> (after I removed /usr/local/etc/geas.cfg)
<neilt> dont remove geas.conf
<neilt> that is absolutly required
<neilt> however if removing it causes a seg fault, then we need to fix that
<holsch> I didnt remove the two ones in the CVS, I removed my local installed one. And as you can see from above, geas found the cfg file in the current directory
<holsch> The segfault is NOT because I remove geas.cfg --- the segfault is because there is no geas-alias.cfg !!!!!

<neilt> holsch: agreed, but not right, we need to correct that
<holsch> Maybe I recompile with --enable-debug to see why it breaks?
<neilt> yes then run with ./geas-server -v -d9
alexey_ (~alexey@195.151.214.34) joined #gnuenterprise.
<neilt> most likely you need to revise your geas.conf file
<holsch> Currently I was using the one in gnue/geas/src ...
<holsch> Ok, with -d9 I get several errors:
<holsch> ++++ Pass 1 File: ../examples/businessobjects/addrbook.gcd
<holsch> error: file ../examples/businessobjects/addrbook.gcd, line 21:
<holsch> Duplicate class name found.
<holsch> class person
<neilt> even a problem in the confg should not seg fault geas
<holsch> And now it did no longer segfault ... it just hang ... the last msg is:
<holsch> Initialising business class method handling.
<holsch> error: [methods_python.c/481] [load_python_binding] Could not load ORBit-Python module
<holsch> at: /usr/lib/python1.5/site-packages/CORBAmodule.so
<holsch> I guess the segfault was because I had done a make install before and there have been stuff in /usr/local/share/geas that you people don't have
<neilt> do a find for CORBAmodule.so
<neilt> and update geas.conf with the correct locations
<neilt> i think the current conf file is for 1.5 and we have standardized on 2.x and the conf file has not been updated.
<neilt> reinhard has on the todo list to make the CORBA stuff self finding so we dont need this in the conf file at all
<holsch> I don't have this file. Do you know by any chance in which debian package it is?
<neilt> it is in ORBit
<neilt> nope sorry
<neilt> you need python-orbit or orbit-python
<neilt> cant remember which
<holsch> Thanks, already apt-getting it ...
<holsch> By the way: once it hangs, you can't kill with with Ctrl-C. You have to do a killall geas-server from another console
<neilt> on my systems i have to Ctrl-Z
<neilt> then kill <pid>
<neilt> but i am on a mac
<holsch> Now it worked somewhat better, it terminates now with:

<holsch>     text name<20>;
<holsch> )
<neilt> that error is because no classes were defined
<neilt> so lets look at the first error
<holsch> Yes, I just found it out. The gnue.conf in CVS has commented out the first classdir and methoddir entries.
<holsch> It still says:

<holsch> In my case I get the error in the first '+++ Pass ...' line, so something is REALLY broken :-(
<holsch> Must I start orbit somehow?
<neilt> what is in the geas-debug.log file at the point of the error
<neilt> no, orbit is done automagically
<holsch> I don't have a geas-debug.log ... do you mean geas.debug.log?
<neilt> that would be it, yes

<neilt> i cant come up with anything
<neilt> it is was a PC i would say, because of all of the seg faults and such to reboot and recompile geas
<neilt> s/it/if/
<holsch> I guess I make some debug session with GNU Debug or ddd ...
<holsch> However, the segfaults where due to, hmm, nonexistent documentation on how to get the thing running. I had not a single error, but multiple ones in the geas.cfg, /usr/local/share/geas, /usr/local/etc/geas.cfg and so on ...
<neilt> its too bad Reinhard is not around today,
<neilt> he is converting geas to use new parser
<neilt> and I suspect it is related to that
<holsch> ... and then again I tried CVS head. I should expect problems, shouldn't I ?  :-)
<neilt> not really
<neilt> we try very hard to keep cvs head running
<neilt> i am running it right now
<neilt> so its a wierd problem, or i am just brain dead right now
<holsch> Some other problem: in geas.cfg it says "username hacker" in the database test_postgresql section. geas does not use a password?
<neilt> the username and password in geas.conf must match the username and password used to set up PostGreSQL
<neilt> sorry, i meant username and tablename must match between geas.conf and how PostGreSQL was set up
<neilt> so mine are set up as
<neilt> [ database test_postgresql ]
<neilt> active         true
<neilt> type           PostgreSQL
<neilt> dbname         ntiffin

<neilt> port           5432

<neilt> this makes things easier
<neilt> as psql works with defaults
<neilt> -
alexey_ (alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<neilt> geas does not currently have much password protection
<holsch> I have more problems ...    I uncommented the old parser and it works now somewhat better. But when it tries
<holsch> to create the table geas__searchfield I get a SQL error. I tracked it down to the CREATE TABLE command. The
<holsch> field name "constraint char(32)" is not allowed, maybe constraint is reserverd in PostgreSQL 7.1.3-5 ?
<holsch> When I manually enter the SQL statement with a different field name it works.
<neilt> sounds reasonable
<neilt> you should email this to gnue-dev mail list

<chillywilly> hey reinhard
<reinhard> hello
<chillywilly> I got through reading the flex manual and your scanner last night ;)
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> any comments?
<chillywilly> well did you read the part about multiple inputs streams and their little example about how you could process include in a depth first fashion?
<chillywilly> includes
<chillywilly> s/about/showing
<reinhard> i don't process includes at all
<chillywilly> that seemed interesting
<chillywilly> and could save a whole 2nd pass from having to happen
<chillywilly> (mayeb)
<chillywilly> maybe
<reinhard> gcd will not require includes
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> neither does having the include processing
<chillywilly> if there's no include tokens it cimply will nto process them
<chillywilly> it doesn't require you to have an include
<reinhard> sorry i guess you don't understand
<reinhard> we will not need includes at all
<reinhard> even if some gcd depend on others
<chillywilly> why will you not need includes?
<reinhard> some magic code in depend.c will decide in which order the gcd files should be processed
<chillywilly> won't that make it harder to know what classes ppl are trying to extend?
<chillywilly> "magic" code?
<reinhard> :)
<reinhard> first pass: register which symbols are defined in which file
<reinhard> then: find an order in which the files can be processed so that every symbol is defined before it is used
<reinhard> second pass: do the real parsing of the files, in the needed order
<chillywilly> ok
<reinhard> the new parser treats "include" as a comment :)
<chillywilly> that seems to make things harder
<reinhard> harder to code yes
<reinhard> harder to write gcds no
<chillywilly> so why don't we write C compilers that don't need includes?
<chillywilly> basically the parser is a gcd compiler
<reinhard> because we don't want the C compiler to compile all files in a directory tree at any time i compile something
<chillywilly> just like you have an idl compiler
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> and when you update just one gcd file? You have to recompile them all?
<reinhard> chillywilly: you will have to
<reinhard> chillywilly: for example you could delete an object from a gcd file
<reinhard> and other gcd files could reference that object
<chillywilly> which is a modification
<reinhard> so those other gcd files would become syntactically wrong
<reinhard> which you wouldn't know if you didn't process all of them
<chillywilly> I see your point
<reinhard> actually the main point was
<reinhard> that gcd authors will not be programmers
<reinhard> but rather business people
<reinhard> and you can't require business people to write includes :)
<chillywilly> shouldn't more metadata be used to help this so you don't have to process classes that wouldn't be effected
<chillywilly> I don't buy that
<chillywilly> business ppl don't program
<reinhard> exactly
<chillywilly> they hire ppl to do it
<reinhard> but they could write gcd's
<reinhard> or at least change gcd's
<reinhard> minor changes like adding a field to a class or so
<chillywilly> hrrrrm, but the odl spec has includes though, don't we won't to be odl compliant?
<reinhard> i still have to see the odl spec
<reinhard> but i would say if we can be compilant to odl except that we have less constraints
<reinhard> then it would be better than to be die-hard odl compilant
alexey_ (alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<chillywilly> well, I need to read some more stuff and look at your parser code
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> cause I want to parse things into actual objects
<chillywilly> like GObject
<chillywilly> if that's possible
<chillywilly> but first
<chillywilly> I must watch football ;P
<reinhard> ok
<chillywilly> Go Packers!!!
<reinhard> i would really like to get your comments about
<reinhard> - understandability of code
<reinhard> - stability of code (in case of faulty input)
<reinhard> - coding style in general
<reinhard> etc.
<chillywilly> why is it case-insensative?
<chillywilly> also you knwo you can use predefined classes like
<chillywilly> [:alphanum:]
<chillywilly> for alpha numerics
<chillywilly> anyway, I will go watch the game ;)
<reinhard> re case insensitive: i think it is better to be case insensitive in gcd files
<reinhard> otherways you will always have to remember the case how you defined the symbol
<chillywilly> I always hated case-insensative systems
<reinhard> it is easier
<chillywilly> wonder what systems are like that?
<chillywilly> ;)
<reinhard> and it doesn't make sense IMHO to define a symbol foo and another symbol FOO and have different meanings for them
<reinhard> this is just for confusing ppl anyway
<reinhard> re [:alphanum:] it isn't used for 2 reasons
<chillywilly> but it makes it hard to read
<reinhard> 1. it wasn't documented in my copy of the flex manual :(( (i have printed version from fsf)
<chillywilly> cause then ppl can do stupid astuff like foo.killme() FOo.HeLpThisSucksTOREAD
<reinhard> 2. i'm not sure if non-gnu lex does have this feature too
<chillywilly> ok
<reinhard> chillywilly: you can do the same stupid stuff if you have case-sensitive
<reinhard> except that you will have to use same stupid writing anywhere you reference that symbol :)
<chillywilly> well C and C++ don't seem to bug me to much with their case sensativity ;)
<chillywilly> but, I don't care that much about things you wrote a lot of code
<chillywilly> and it is appreciated
<chillywilly> :)
<reinhard> thanks :)
<reinhard> i am really happy to get input
<reinhard> and to be asked questions
<chillywilly> more questions will come ;)
<chillywilly> now ontop the game
<chillywilly> :)
<reinhard> btw if you can give me a pointer 
<reinhard> whether std lex understands [:alphanum:] or not
<chillywilly> ok
<reinhard> i will be likely to change it
<reinhard> :)
<chillywilly> I'll look into it
<reinhard> thanks
<chillywilly> there's a whole section on lex compatibility
<chillywilly> and POSIX compatibility
<reinhard> i have a lex incompatibility somewhere anyway
<chillywilly> i c
<reinhard> jamest wasn't able to process it through sun lex
<chillywilly> :(
<reinhard> and we didn't have the time (patience?) to track it
<reinhard> as installing flex was a matter of 5 minutes for him
<chillywilly> well he just needs to give us access to a sun box over there ay ksu ;)
<reinhard> btw sun lex == solaris lex
<chillywilly> a/ay/at
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> I figured that
<reinhard> in case you didn't figure anyway :)

<holsch> hi psu
<psu> hi holsch
<psu> how's the redhat install going?
<psu> did you and derek sort it out?
<holsch> psu: Red Hat?  I have debian here ...    GNUe Forms is working, geas-server has problems. I just sent two mails into gnue-dev.
<holsch> I tried to resolve them with neilt.
<psu> ah 
<psu> serves me right 
<psu> for only half-reading the logs ;-)
<holsch> why?
<holsch> where do you read the logs?
<psu> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/
<psu> Both bigbrother and gnuebot are just loggers
<psu> Actually, bigbrother was programmed to do some bot-like stuff a few weeks back
<holsch> And why are two bots watching?
<psu> basically trout-slapped chillywilly every time he signed on 
<psu> but soon got tired of joke
<psu> holsch - redundancy - 2 bots are better than 1
<psu> As far as logging goes itself, 
<psu> because we use IRC as a 
<psu> sorta mailing list subsititute
<psu> it's useful for everyone 
<psu> to be able to look back and see what was said
<holsch> Yeah, I got the impression the IRC is used far more than with other projects.
<psu> Some of the guys are just logged in all the time 
<psu> & can use their own irc logs
<psu> but us poor dial-up users don't have that option
<psu> It would be an interesting metaphysical discussion
<psu> as to why GNUe is so IRC orientated
<psu> as opposed to the mail list culture 
<psu> of other projects 
<holsch> I got my cable-modem with the almost-flat rate (5 GB are free and I'm not in MP3's) just two weeks ago.
<psu> As a UK dial-up user
<holsch> So I can afford to keep my system longer in IRC than ever before. I hardly used IRC before ...
<psu> same here - just got almost-flat rate (no call charges from 18:00 to 08:00 and weekends)
<psu> makes such a diff to how you use internet
<neilt> irc is better for discussing ideas, and
<holsch> Methaphysical: basically, I'd say that with IRC you get a quicker answer, with Mailinglist sometimes a better thought-thru answer.
<neilt> email is better for documenting ideas
<psu> PC next to me has no CD, so I just ftp-ed debian via modem - took 8 hours.
<neilt> everything important that has been discussed re gnue is in the irc logs
<psu> Would have freaked out doing that at 1p a minute
<neilt> holsch: exactly
<holsch> I've read the discussion on case-importance above. Basically I like Turbo-Pascal and Delphi and they are both case-
<holsch> insensitive. But then again I hate to look at other's source codes because they uppercase
<neilt> i hate upper case
<holsch> in a different style. WRITELN vs Writeln vs writeln.
<psu> irc is a very lower case medium as well ;-)
<neilt> Writeln is best style
<holsch> English is a very lower case language as well (compared to German or French)
<neilt> in direct marketing all upper case is 15% harder to read
<holsch> neilt: anything is best style ... it's a matter of taste
<neilt> yes, 
<holsch> neilt: I used mixed case for vars and uppercase for keywords in Pascal, that way the keywords did stand
<holsch> out, even without a syntax-highlithing editor ...
<neilt> do non-syntax-highlighting editors exist today
<neilt> hmmmm
<holsch> neilt: yes, sometimes. Not sure if programmers are using them for real-work.
<neilt> the poor programmers that use those must feel like they live in the 18th century
<neilt> :)
<holsch> by the way: I documented the two geas-problems I had, it's should by now be in gnue-dev@gnue.org
<neilt> j/k
<neilt> yes i have it
<holsch> whats 'j/k'
<holsch> ?
<rdean> every syntax-highlighting editor that I've come across has an option to turn it off.
<neilt> just kidding
<neilt> recheck out cvs
<neilt> and try the addrbook.gcd should be fixed
<neilt> now

<holsch> How comes it that my geas-server barks about "lookup" and yours is accepting it?
<holsch> BTW i had the other errors again, like "Duplicate class name found." : "class test" 
<neilt> lookup is not valid with new parser (or rather the syntax of lookup has changed
<neilt> comment that out
<neilt> and try again
<holsch> Comment out lookup in adrbook.gcd or the call to the new parser?
<neilt> lookup in adrbook.gcd

<neilt> sorry we need Reinhard
<neilt> then
<holsch> Hmm, I was watching TV while he was online :-(
<neilt> me too
<neilt> spending some time with the wife
<neilt> and missed him
<neilt> he is in austria and sundays are family day usually
<holsch> same in germany (except that I don't have my own family)
<neilt> so you are practically neighbors
<holsch> Sort of. Maybe 5 to 8 hours by car, depends where he is living. That would be "neightbors" for Texanians, wouldn't it?
<neilt> yep
<neilt> what part of germany
<neilt> are you in
<holsch> 30 km north of Frankfurt.
<neilt> i used to work for Bayer
<holsch> Leverkusen?
<neilt> yes i coordinated research with leverkusen and dormagen (?)
<holsch> And you live near Washington?
<neilt> i still live in Chicago and work in Washington DC
<neilt> we should be moving shortly
<neilt> but i never made it to germany
<holsch> I don't have a map handy ... but sure you must be often in planes ... ?!?!
<neilt> its a 14 hour drive
<holsch> I made it twice to the US. Abilene/Texas and Redlands near LA.
<neilt> what was your impression?
<holsch> Very different. Part of your culture is very near to ours, and other parts are very far away.
<neilt> :)
<holsch> I disliked most the 2-3 death people a day in the LA area due to gunshoots.
<neilt> that is a downside
<holsch> I never saw a CompUSA store (or equivalent) here in Germany guarded.
<neilt> i have never seen one either
<neilt> you found a guarded one in LA
<holsch> People told me that just the LA area has 900 gun murders a year. In Germany we 82.000.000 people and have less then 100 a year.
<holsch> Yes, I LA they had. I found it awkward.
<neilt> i would to
<neilt> but then again i would not go to LA
<neilt> long beach is another story
<holsch> In Texas it was better, but while I was there 3 KKK people put a black american with a chain behind their pickup. Somehow I was
<holsch> always at the wrong moment in your country ...   at least those 3 were catched. But then
<holsch> again they also got death penalty, something that a modern country should not do.
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise.
<neilt> thats one opinion
<holsch> Hey, I liked the openness of the poeple an their kindness. It was not all bad.
<holsch> But yet, I could imagine living in the UK, but I would never move to the US.
<neilt> i spent 2 years in the UK
<neilt> and would never like there
<neilt> live
<holsch> Back to GNUe --- was it ever discussed to have some domain-concept for variables?
<neilt> Its not as bad as you think
<holsch> I mean:
<holsch> You define a variable type, but not just the type "char(64)", but
<holsch> also how the label should be named, what lookup-table to use and so on.
<holsch> Whenever you use this variable type in a table or form, it would inherit this
<neilt> we have that
<holsch> properties and makes life easier for forms designers.
<neilt> but forms designers have not warmed up to it
<holsch> I never worked with SAP, but read a book on it and found it there. I liked the idea.
<holsch> I think it gives consistency.
<holsch> And, as far as I know, they force it. You cannot put a field into a table before re-using an
<neilt> we treat it as a data element
<holsch> existing domain or creating a new one.
<neilt> look in packages/base/language/classes/language.gcd
<neilt> class help
<holsch> Ok, what I mean is: you have there, for example:
<holsch>   char  dialect<8>;
<holsch> but I meant something like
<holsch>   char  dialect<8>
<holsch>   short prompt language en "Dialect"
<holsch>   short prompt language de "Dialekt"
<holsch>   long prompt language en "In what dialect is the help"
<neilt> we have that but use a different stufture
<holsch>   lookup table thisandthat;
<neilt> our prompt is tool_tip
<holsch> Basically the possibility to define lots of properties.
<neilt> then we have short and long
<neilt> labels
<neilt> and we have help text
<holsch> Okay, I will look further into this, right now I'm not understanding enought of GNUe.
<neilt> all designed around the language based help calss
<holsch> Do you know the commands to convert the *.sgml files into something legible, e.g. HTML or even TXT?
<neilt> each field will have an entry in the help class for each language supported by geas
<neilt> are you talking about docbook sgml files
<neilt> ?
<holsch> Yes
<neilt> db2html
<holsch> I tried several jade commands, but it seldom worked :-(
<neilt> which file are you trying to convert
<holsch> and dirs with *.sgml files don't have Makefiles ...
<holsch> Basically every file, because I want to read them. Lyx files I can read directly in Lyx ...
<holsch> s/dirs/many dirs/
<neilt> all of the docs are built on the web site, but not in a consistent place
<holsch> I know. I thought that the ones in the CVS might be more up-to-date.
<neilt> the ones pertaining to geas are all up to date on the web site
<neilt> i dont know about the others
<neilt> i have an script that i kickoff to rebuild the docs
<neilt> so they all get rebuilt
<holsch> In geas you have lot's of *.txt files in doc/ ...  easy to read :-)
<neilt> these are the ones listed at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~neilt/sc.html
<holsch> Ok, currently the GNU Module Guide is what I find most interesting (once geas-server works somewhat)
<holsch> The supply_chain_math/t1.html still contains TeX-code :-)
reinhard (~rm@62.47.44.225) joined #gnuenterprise.
<neilt> yes, i need to remove that
<neilt> speak of the devil
<holsch> Guten Abend, Reinhard !
<reinhard> huh
<reinhard> Tach auch
<reinhard> guess i should read the logs :)
<neilt> reinhard: you weren't around so I blamed you for all of holsch's problems
<neilt> :)
<reinhard> neilt: the possibility exists that you are acutally right with that.
<neilt> no, not that, then I will blame Andrewm
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> on the reason why GNUe is so IRC oriented
<reinhard> that has historical reasons
<holsch> reinhard: the essence of the problem is also in gnue-dev@gnue.org
<reinhard> GNUe was a mailing-list project for 3 years
<reinhard> with zero implemented code
<reinhard> then we started irc and within 1 month we had some prototyes
<reinhard> prototypes
<reinhard> holsch: let me look
<holsch> neilt: even the Postscript has TeX syntax ... ;-(
<nickr> uh
<neilt> forget the math article
<neilt> ariel was supposed to send a better conversion and never did,  i need to remove it
<holsch> I was just curious because I'm sysadm in a company that makes radio-based warehouse solutions
<neilt> cool
<holsch> (Partly I'm looking into GNUe to releave our programmers from programming EVERYTHING in
<holsch> C and embedded sql ...)
<holsch> However, I would have to re-surrect the ncurses-version of gfclient. Radio terminals
<holsch> usually have a small text-only display.
<holsch> But it might very well that GNUe is too early (typical chicken'n'egg situation)
<holsch> in the development process
<neilt> two tier should be getting very close
<neilt> geas is a little farther away
<holsch> GNUe Forms was up and running not-so-badly, but geas-server ...  this would speak for 2-tier :-)
<neilt> geas-server is n-tier
<holsch> i know
<neilt> forms directly to SQL server is 2 tier
<neilt> exactly
<holsch> And for 2-tier I also would have to adapt SAP DB (we use SAP DB since half a year
<reinhard> holsch: first of all i really *love* your subject line
<reinhard> "Adventures with geas: strange old parser?"
<neilt> sapdb works fine in 2 tier
<holsch> with great success, it's 24x7, no vacuum as compared to PostgreSQL)
<holsch> Sounds good.
<holsch> reinhard: there's a question mark at the end --- no accusation !   :-)
<reinhard> holsch: there is a reason that i wrote a new one ;)
<holsch> reinhard: was it ok to simply uncomment the old parser and use the new one only?
<holsch> (as in my second e-mail?)
<reinhard> on the status of old vs. new parser
<reinhard> the status is the worst you could think of
<reinhard> i.e. parts of the code use the old parser and parts use the new parser :(
<reinhard> as i am in the middle of the transition
<neilt> we dont call that bad we call it a challenge
<holsch> No, I meant it technically. I saw discussions on parse run 1 and 2, so maybe the new parser might still
<reinhard> neilt: rofl
<holsch> use info the old parser gathered
<reinhard> holsch: no they are independant
<reinhard> and to _start_ geas you would only need the new parser
<reinhard> but to do inserts/updates/selects etc. the info is taken from the old parser
<holsch> readhard: with the new parser it was at one time actually running and not aborting :-)
<reinhard> yeah
<reinhard> the errors are because of postgres reserved words
<holsch> reinhard: you have a table of reservered words. Why simply add a _ to them when it comes to the database?
<holsch> Not sure if it is possible to omit all reservered words of all SQL engines that exist in the world.
<reinhard> holsch: the old parser did that
<reinhard> for the new parser we considered following
<reinhard> we want different modules written by different persons to extend the same class (= table)
<reinhard> so i have a table "customer"
<reinhard> and neilt writes his xx module that introduces "customer.foo"
<reinhard> and you write yy module that introduces "customer.foo"
<reinhard> because you don't even know about each other
<reinhard> if i (as the third person) want to use both xx and yy module
<reinhard> they would not work together
<reinhard> except we introduce namespaces in column names
<reinhard> so we decided to prefix every column name for the database with the modulename and a double underscore
<reinhard> so your column will be yy__foo
<reinhard> and neilt's will be xx__foo
<reinhard> and they will not conflict
<reinhard> so far so good
<reinhard> this is not yet done to keep compatibility with the old parser as long as some part of the code uses the old parser
<reinhard> but is already marked as TODO in the new parser code
<reinhard> and then when this is done _every_ db column will contain a __
<reinhard> because every column will be part of a specific namespace
<reinhard> and because no reserved word of (IMHO) no db of the world contains a double underscore
<reinhard> we can be 100% sure that no column name of ours conflicts with a db reserved word
<holsch> sounds good
<reinhard> therefore i don't check for reserved words now
<holsch> However, I read from your lines that the current CVS geas-server cannot be
<holsch> used, not even for "finding out what it is"
<reinhard> holsch: yeah there are some 5 or 10 minutes of thought in geas ;)
<holsch> right?
<reinhard> no
<reinhard> it should run
<reinhard> with the old and the new parser in parallel
<holsch> But it doesn't :(
<reinhard> this is my point now
<reinhard> we need to find out what the errors are about with the old parser
<holsch> One thing is strange: neilt said it runs on his mac, but it doesn't on my debian.
<reinhard> did you configure with --enable-debug?
<holsch> Yes
ToyMan (~stuq@c5300-3-ip137.albany.thebiz.net) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<holsch> I even sent him my geas.conf file
<reinhard> what do you have as "classdir" in geas.conf
<holsch> I only have the one line "classdir            ../examples/businessobjects" the other is uncommmented
<holsch> but it breaks also with both
<holsch> and i'm running ./geas-server in gnue/geas/src, without make install
<reinhard> the question is why do you get a duplicate class name error
<holsch> Agreed.
<reinhard> hehe
<reinhard> now we should answer the question ;)
<holsch> When I look at the +++ lines, then I get the first error on the first file.
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> but not on the first class in that file
<holsch> Right. But look at "class contact". There is a "object person" in it. Maybe this is a trigger
<reinhard> hmmmm
<reinhard> wanna try to uncomment that line?
<reinhard> however i don't get those errors either and i am using suse linux
<holsch> Hmm, did not help.
<reinhard> and i know for example chilly uses debian and it works for him
<holsch> Maybe the code should not say "Duplicate class found: person", but
<holsch> "Duplicate class 'person' found in file XYZ:20 and ABC:44"
<holsch> At least GCC does this, that's very handy.
<reinhard> holsch: please add in file yparser.y between line 191 and line 192

<reinhard> oh oh
<reinhard> no wait
<reinhard> please send me your yparser.c
<reinhard> to reinhard@gnue.org
<reinhard> i will make a diff to my copy

<chillywilly> bison (GNU Bison) 1.30
<chillywilly> ;P
<reinhard> chillywilly: does geas-server run for you?
<chillywilly> ummm, it has been to long to even know
<reinhard> can you try?
<chillywilly> well ti will take a bit
<holsch> chillywilly: the CVS head version
<chillywilly> as I have setup postgres to work over my network
<chillywilly> unless yall want to hold my hand
<holsch> chillywilly: no, the error in question happens before PostgreSQL comes into play
<reinhard> chillywilly: that doesn't matter, we are just interested in the error messages you get from the old parser
<chillywilly> it is has been too long since I setup postgres
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> alrighty
<chillywilly> I'll compile it and give it a whirl right now
<holsch> reinhard: does geas use other libs, e.g. glib?
<reinhard> yes glib
<chillywilly> glib, orbit, uuid-dev
<reinhard> yes what chilly said
<chillywilly> bison and flex
<holsch> ii  orbit           0.5.12-1        A CORBA ORB (used with Gnome)
<reinhard> holsch: our problem can't be orbit
<holsch> holger:/usr/src/gnue/geas# glib-config --version
<holsch> 1.2.10
<reinhard> same for me
<chillywilly> danielb@obfuscation:~/src/cvs/gnue/geas$ ./autogen.sh --enable-debug --prefix=/usr
<holsch> Not sure how to find out the uuidlib version, but i guess it's not needed at this time
<chillywilly> what other options should I pass?
<reinhard> holsch: correct guess
<chillywilly> that should bbe good enough now right?
<reinhard> chilly that's ok this way
<holsch> chillywilly: that's all you need. You don't even need to "make install" it.
<chillywilly> I know....just that you used to have to specify a databse
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> holsch: actually i thought about reinhard@gnue.org being the "To:", not the "Subject:" :)
<reinhard> nevermind
<reinhard> got it anyway :)
<chillywilly> so it uses parts of the old an dnew parser right because you have not finished the migration to the new one?
<holsch> AAAAH. Again I felt into the Kmail trap
<reinhard> chillywilly: exactly
<chillywilly> just use mutt ;P
<chillywilly> we don't need a stinking gui for email ;)
<holsch> KMail can put he mailing list address into the too field and sometimes I forget about that ...
<holsch> chillywilly: I could use pigeons, I know ...
<chillywilly> ok, built it
<chillywilly> what does your geas.conf look like?
<reinhard> chillywilly: nevermind thanks but i guess we found it
<chillywilly> oh?
Action: chillywilly is lost
<holsch> chillywilly: in geas/src/geas.conf I commented out one classdir so that only the one
<reinhard> holsch: i get similar (not identical) errors with your yparser.c
<holsch> pointing to the ../examples is active
<holsch> (tip from neilt)
<reinhard> can you send me yparser.h just to be sure?
<chillywilly> whatever
<chillywilly> I can go bacl to reading  the bison manual now right?
<chillywilly> back
<chillywilly> oh another thing reinhard
<reinhard> chillywilly: yeah till we call you again
<chillywilly> couldn't you use yylineno
<reinhard> chillywilly: btw who told you that you could stop coding?
<chillywilly> to keep track of the line you are at?
<chillywilly> or is that a global count
<holsch> reinhard: sent
<reinhard> <reinhard> chillywilly: re yylineno
<reinhard> <reinhard> from flex doc
<reinhard> <reinhard> yylineno this is an undocumented feature of Lex that does not appear in Flex or POSIX.
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> er?
<chillywilly> doesn't say that in my manual
<chillywilly> I didn't think it did
Action: chillywilly checks
<reinhard> chillywilly: appearantly i have other version of manual than you
<chillywilly> well at any rate that's a good reason not to use it
<holsch> reinhard: I could install byacc and use it instead of bison ...

<reinhard> holsch: sent you working yparser.[ch]
<reinhard> so you can try
<reinhard> ************************************************
<reinhard> and just another note for all the ppl that questioned
<reinhard> whether the rewrite of the parser was worth the effort or not
<chillywilly> who questioned it?
<chillywilly> wasn't me
<reinhard> the old parser relies on undocumented behaviour of bison
<chillywilly> I didn't want to touch the old one with a ten foot pole
<reinhard> and appearently doesn't work under bison 1.30
<holsch> Ok, now the "Abort" at the end is gone.
<reinhard> ************************************************
<holsch> I still have the SQL errors about "position"
<reinhard> what is the last line?
<reinhard> holsch: that is ok
<holsch> The GNU Enterprise Application Server is ready.
<reinhard> holsch: cool that means it is working
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> it only thinks it is ready
<chillywilly> ;)
<holsch> reinhard: Huh, it's ok that two CREATE TABLE statements did not work?
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 04:02:39)
<reinhard> that's the reserved word issue we discussed before
<chillywilly> I forgot to change thaty
<chillywilly> btw, I'm back ;P
<holsch> I know. But now my geas-server.c has both parsers enabled.
<reinhard> yeah that's the way it is needed now
<holsch> holsch: I misunderstood you probably. Thought
<chillywilly> it's not a parser it's a gcd compiler ;)
<holsch> that with the old parser it cannot happen.
<holsch> s/holsch/reinhard/
<reinhard> the code to create the tables already uses the new parser
<chillywilly> objectstore right?
<holsch> reinhard: aha. Just the tablenames by themselves are handley by the new parser
<reinhard> chillywilly: yes
<holsch> create table geas__searchfield ...
<reinhard> yes exactly
<reinhard> the tablenames and the fieldnames
<reinhard> for creating the tables
<reinhard> holsch: you should now be able to start
<chillywilly> reinhard: not to change the subject but hav eyou thought about how to do replication an load balancing?
<reinhard> geas/examples/python/addrbook.py
<reinhard> and use at least the menu "S" (Setup"
<holsch> chillywilly: load balancing is often done with transaction monitors ... even built in ones
<chillywilly> the dotGNU ppl want an application server
<chillywilly> but they were talking about writing itin C# to test out portable.net
<chillywilly> er, their compiler
<chillywilly> there's a good link about how IBM does load balancing with Open LDAP on the dotGNU developers list

<chillywilly> this all lead to the discussion and someone saying that would head up a project to write an application server
<holsch> reinhard: it works. I just don't like the string "US$"
<reinhard> chillywilly: i will think about load balancing as soon as i get geas to do something like "select name from customer where number = 10" properly
<holsch> s/US$/EUR/g   :-)
<reinhard> holsch: i need to make my U.S. friends happy somehow ;)
<holsch> chillywilly: it's also interesting to read how Lotus Notes does it's replication. I always wondered
<chillywilly> reinhard: well yes, I was just bringing it up for the fun of it
<holsch> why such a wonderful replication engine nether made it's way into open source.
<reinhard> chillywilly: talking about fun to me is like talking about sex to the pope
<chillywilly> ok, back to my bison manual reading
<reinhard> j/k
<chillywilly> lol
<holsch> reinhard: many priest have sex :-)
<chillywilly> hey you know there's a grammar file for oql
<chillywilly> maybe it will make sense to me after I finish the bison manual
<reinhard> chillywilly: hehe
<reinhard> holsch: btw i am from vorarlberg (most western part of austria)
<reinhard> bodensee
<holsch> chillywilly: I have seen a similar HA solution for SAP DB.
<holsch> chillywilly: (similar to the one from IBM). It used NBD (Network Block Device)
<chillywilly> ok
<holsch> chillywilly: from linux to mirror the database and log of two computers
<holsch> chillywilly: and used also www.linux-ha.org's heartbeat for the take-over.
<chillywilly> thsi thing looks like a c++ parser
<chillywilly> options {
<chillywilly>     language="Cpp";
<chillywilly> }
<chillywilly> class OQLLexer extends Lexer ;
<chillywilly> options {
<chillywilly>     k=2;
<chillywilly>     charVocabulary = '\3'..'\377';
<chillywilly>     testLiterals=false;     // don't automatically test for literals
<chillywilly>     caseSensitive=true;
<chillywilly>     caseSensitiveLiterals=true;
<chillywilly> }
<chillywilly> fyi, the flex manual is a lot more painful to read than the bison one ;)
<chillywilly> probably because RMS had a hand in the latter ;)
<reinhard> i still can't believe that i get an outdated manual from the fsf
<chillywilly> you got a paper one?
<reinhard> yeah
<holsch> Byby, I have to find some sleep
<reinhard> ordered for $$
<chillywilly> hmmm

<dneighbo> yo yo yo
<dneighbo> say if i apt-get install blackbox
<dneighbo> how do i use it instead of say gnome?
<nickr> dow do you start gnome?
<dneighbo> currently its wife pc
<dneighbo> so i have gdm installed
<dneighbo> as im 'expirementing'
<dneighbo> i have kde and gnome installed
<nickr> you could use the gnome session, and then pick blackbox as the WM and get rid of the panels and such
<dneighbo> and have gdm kdm(?) installed
<dneighbo> i think i have xdm
<dneighbo> could i use xdm?
<nickr> why?
<dneighbo> and then not have a gnome session?
<nickr> you can pick a non-gnome session from the gdm session list
<dneighbo> um the point of going black box would be too get things as small as possible
<dneighbo> ok i have black box installed dropping to gdm to see options

<dneighbo> screw it, gnome w/ do i think
<dneighbo> just have to stick to lightweight sawfish theme
<dneighbo> i still have jacked up fonts though :(
<dneighbo> the fonts seem really big
<dneighbo> (which they did on other debian install)
<dneighbo> but here if i try to pick a custom font
<dneighbo> all looks great in the font picker box
<dneighbo> but when i click ok it turns everything to squares :(
<nickr> interesitng
<nickr> do you have 100dpi or 75dpi fonts intsalled?
<dneighbo> smaker theme for sawfish seems nice
<dneighbo> nickr: how do i tell?
<nickr> thats the one that I use
<dneighbo> iirc i apt got about anything that had word font
<nickr> dpkg --list |grep ^ii |grep xfonts-
<dneighbo> to get the fonts to work at ALL on this machine
<nickr> oh
<nickr> maybe you're picking 2byte fonts then
<dneighbo> give it a minute in process of 'upgrading'
<nickr> the whole font situation is in the process of being worked out
<nickr> its sort of in the middle of a transition
<dneighbo> must get wife using debian all the time
<dneighbo> to do that i need to use this machine all the time
<dneighbo> to be 'fair'
<dneighbo> her #1 complaint
<dneighbo> a. fonts
<dneighbo> b. speed
<nickr> speed!?+
<nickr> what kind of computer is it?
<dneighbo> i even *gulp* switched her to KDE, KMAIL and KONQ for speed improvements
<dneighbo> but still too slow for her

<nickr> that should be a pretty cookin machine
<dneighbo> i even have custom k6 kernel installed now
<dneighbo> dood i know it should be pretty quick but win98 kicks its ass 
<dneighbo> on same machine same hardware
<dneighbo> loading gnome is pretty quick
<dneighbo> similar as windows
<dneighbo> but email and webbrowser take about twice as long to load
<dneighbo> as internet explorer and outlook
<dneighbo> :(
<dneighbo> if she used mutt and lynx

<dneighbo> dneighbo@grapevine:~$ 
<chillywilly> win98 is a slow POS
<chillywilly> on my mom's system that is twice as fast as this
<nickr> which browser? emain client?
<dneighbo> nickr: i have tried about all of them
<nickr> evolution is an order of magnitude faster than outlook in most situations
<dneighbo> konq, galeon, mozilla
<dneighbo> evolution, kmail, mozilla mail
<nickr> galeon doesn't load as fast as ie because ie loads at boot time
<dneighbo> well what i have found is galeon is faster after intial load SO if i could get her to 'leave it open' i think she would be happy
<dneighbo> but evolution is a dog
<dneighbo> you get it and other things going and you can actually watch it repaint some of its folders
<dneighbo> mozilla mail was even worse
<chillywilly> you got a 350MHz in there?
<dneighbo> kmail was pretty snappy, but she didnt like the 'feel' of it

<chillywilly> yes yes
<dneighbo> chillywilly: 350.797 to be 'exact'

<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> cpu MHz		: 451.026
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> this is my laptop
<dneighbo> man you overclocking by 1.026 or what, you rebel
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> rebel without a clue
<chillywilly> or a cause for that matter
<nickr> dneighbo: there are a lot of other email clients to try
<nickr> I really like evolution though, I've never had any speed problems
<nickr> you might try spruce, pyne and sylpheed
<nickr> I used sylpheed for a long time
<chillywilly> pyne?
<chillywilly> nothing like good ol' mutt
<chillywilly> ;P
<nickr> yea, its a newish gnome email
<dneighbo> i have heard of sylpheed recently
<nickr> I only use mh now
<dneighbo> i think i will try evolution again
<nickr> I've always generally only used mh
<dneighbo> i recently went from 48mb memory to 150mb
<chillywilly> nickr: but you're weird like that
<dneighbo> and havent retested all options
<nickr> except I had a pop account for a while that I used sylpheed then evolution
<nickr> memory makes a huge difference
<chillywilly> sure does
<dneighbo> dag nabit are they holding back galeon AGAIN?
Action: chillywilly has originally 64MB in this laptop and either desktop was painful to use
<dneighbo> just like friday or so they haad it back up
<chillywilly> then I put the max in here
<nickr> another mozilla conflict?
<chillywilly> 160MB
<dneighbo> nickr: probably
<nickr> thats the price you pay for unstable/ :)
<nickr> try dillo, its way coo
<dneighbo> dillo?
<nickr> I just about shit my pants when I first tried it
<nickr> browser
Action: chillywilly is using galeon compiled from cvs
<dneighbo> i htought it didnt work on most pages
<chillywilly> wtf is dillo?
<nickr> It does
<nickr> its amazing
<chillywilly> I never heard that one either
<nickr> try it out
<dneighbo> someone was telling me they use if for local web broswing
<dneighbo> like reading documentation and such
<nickr> just install it, then run it
<chillywilly> apt-get install dillo?
<nickr> it is a neat effect
<nickr> yea
<dneighbo> the good/bad thing about debian
<dneighbo> is its SO easy to get things to try
<chillywilly> hehe
<dneighbo> good when you want to try stuff a lot, bad when you have a harddriver under 50megs :0
<chillywilly> you spend too mcuhtiem playgin around?
<chillywilly> aaaah
<chillywilly> geta  bigger one
<chillywilly> ;P
<dneighbo> chillywilly: that too, i was thinking purely drive space
<dneighbo> i used to think no way i could chew up 40gig
<chillywilly> hehe
<nickr> for the full effect, run dillo from the command line
<chillywilly> then you got to dling those mp3s
<chillywilly> right?
<dneighbo> then became mp3 fiend and thought ah still plenty of room
<dneighbo> then started doing own sound studio work
<dneighbo> and was like hmmm im running out of space
<nickr> raw pcm takes up a lot of space
<dneighbo> then switched to debian an dplayed with apt
<dneighbo> and am like dood time for more drives :
<dneighbo> :)
<nickr> anyone try dillo yet?
<dneighbo> nickr: im still fighting my upgrade
<dneighbo> i need to get gnucash on here, im FINALLY making the jump
<dneighbo> no more quicken, as new years resolution
Action: chillywilly uses gnucash for his money
<dneighbo> vowed to get family completely off windows
<chillywilly> kewl
<chillywilly> f*** M$
<nickr> gnucash is really  sweet
<nickr> I love the account druid
<nickr> its cute
<dneighbo> i still need a windows box around, but will have to boot to use it
<dneighbo> basically used for data conversion stuff
<dneighbo> must fix this font
<chillywilly> I have encountered that squares font thing
<dneighbo> friggin 20inch monitor and tiny resolution and stuff is still way big
<chillywilly> I just keep swithcing to different themes in the control center until it goes away
<nickr> dneighbo: you might add -dpi 100 to your /etc/gdm/gdm.conf
<chillywilly> it is annoying as hell
<dneighbo> chillywilly: i got rid of the squares
<dneighbo> i just want to be able to choose a smaller font
<nickr> dneighbo: if its rendering 100dpi fonts at 75dpi they'll be big
<chillywilly> my font is pretty small
<dneighbo> for my gnome theme and my 'problem' will go away

<chillywilly> you hack the font server to do 100dpi
<nickr> dneighbo: gdm is where X is getting started
<dneighbo> mommie
<chillywilly> at least i did
<dneighbo> i need my .emacs file

<dneighbo> what is vt8?
<dneighbo> virtual terminal?
<nickr> dneighbo: thats a commented out line for another X server
<dneighbo> chillywilly: i did that on my laptop
<chillywilly> yep, virtual terminal
<nickr> gdm can run as many as you want, but its nicer to start them on demand
<dneighbo> and it was all groovy but then x died when i restarted

<dneighbo> how do i 'restart gdm' ?
<dneighbo> will it do it just by me logging out?
<nickr> no, you have to do an /etc/init.d/gdm restart
<chillywilly> or justs do
<nickr> probably from vc0
<dneighbo> ?
<chillywilly> ctlatl-backspace

<dneighbo> btw i hate gdm
<chillywilly> and force ti to restart

<chillywilly> gdm is sexy
Action: chillywilly pets gdm
<dneighbo> on my laptop and elsewhere so i am a total gdm newbie
<nickr> why?
<nickr> iiiiiiuuuu
<nickr> gdm rocks my world
<chillywilly> I don;t want to go to work tomorrow
<dneighbo> nick its evil because im nmot used to it :)
<dneighbo> i.e. i can never shut this machine down right
<nickr> heh
<nickr> oh thats easy
<chillywilly> you have to enable the system menu in gdm.conf
<dneighbo> and things like 'restarting' gdm are foreign to me
<nickr> if you have the conf file open still, I'll tell you what do change
<dneighbo> ok
<nickr> in the [greeter] section
<nickr> find the SystemMenu=false line, and change it to true
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> I hate that debian doesn't have a better default
<nickr> also in that section theres ConfigAvailable=false, change that to true
<dneighbo> hmm looks like you can configure a lot here
<chillywilly> guess they assume you will never shutdown your gnu/linux box ;)
<nickr> dneighbo: they have a gui configurer
<dneighbo> it was already true
<nickr> okay
<nickr> now save and quit
<dneighbo> waht is 'Browser'
<nickr> Thats the face browser
<nickr> it shows pictures associated with local users
<dneighbo> no way
<nickr> users can set their face picture
<nickr> its pretty cute
<dneighbo> that would be kickin
<chillywilly> hehe
<dneighbo> i have kids and all they woudl like it
<nickr> in the gnome menu, under settings theres a 'set my gdm face'
<dneighbo> yeah thats the ticket
<chillywilly> :)
<dneighbo> my ugrade is almost finished 
<dneighbo> then you can tell me how to restart gdm and relogin
<nickr> okay
<nickr> there are a lot of cute things
<nickr> it gets better every day
<nickr> I should start keeping notes as to where it could be smoothed out though
<nickr> I deal with a lot of newbies, so its like testing for it :)

<dneighbo> man it takes forever if you dont 'upgrade' regularly
<nickr> yea
<nickr> it does
<dneighbo> think there were like 180 packages to upgrade
<dneighbo> and like at least 50 were held back
<nickr> theres a lot of little scripts and tools that would make debian hugely easier
<dneighbo> and i dont even have much installed on here and i upgraded less than a month a go
<nickr> like a gui too to stop and start sysvinit scripts
<nickr> not to modify then, but to just stop and start them
<dneighbo> but thats the beauty of debian is its better than even a red carpet subscription :)
<dneighbo> stuff is 'fresh' :)
<nickr> yea
<dneighbo> other reason is i have kde as well as gnome on here
<nickr> those are big space users
Action: chillywilly couldn't handle sucking up his disk like that so kde went bye bye
<nickr> dneighbo: if you have kids, you should consider Debian Jr.
<nickr> lots of kid games in it
<nickr> edutainment
<nickr> and junior-gnome
<chillywilly> that's what I should install on thios little old mac classic
<chillywilly> debian jr.
<chillywilly> then scotty can play with it
<chillywilly> it's a cute littel thing
<nickr> I don't think that it'll run on a mac classic
<nickr> it has a lot of multimedia type apps
<chillywilly> no m68k port?
<dneighbo> nickr: i am part of debian jr project :)
<nickr> dneighbo: ah, then you don't need me selling to you
<dneighbo> nickr: i think my names are even in the credits somewhere
<chillywilly> dneighbo: what did you do to deserve that ;)?
<nickr> we're doing lots of debian-in-schools stuff so its great for that
<dneighbo> chillywilly: wrote junior-doc
<chillywilly> who's "we"
<chillywilly> wassat?
<dneighbo> documentation for debian-jr
<chillywilly> ok
<dneighbo> whew apt-get install gnucash requires a lot
<nickr> yea
<dneighbo> let me grab dillo and then i will be ready for restart of gdm
<dneighbo> i wonder why gnucash requires so many perl packages?
<dneighbo> dres_: why does gnucash require so many perl packages?
<dneighbo> Unpacking libnet-perl (from .../libnet-perl_1%3a1.09.01-1_all.deb) ...
<dneighbo> Selecting previously deselected package libmime-base64-perl.

<dneighbo> (Reading database ... 66262 files and directories currently installed.)
<dneighbo> Unpacking libhtml-tree-perl (from .../libhtml-tree-perl_3.11-2_all.deb) ...
<dneighbo> to name a few
<dneighbo> and python2.2 ?
<dneighbo> most odd
<nickr> because its a wild and crazy thing
<dneighbo> wondering if they are bolting on perl web front end to gnucash or something but if so they shoudl have it modular
<chillywilly> bah, anyone having problems getting packages from us.debian.org?
<dneighbo> so you could get that or not depending on if you are using it
<nickr> chillywilly: all the time
<nickr> I always use ftp.us.debian.org
<dneighbo> chillywilly: nope, ive slurped about 200 in past 30 minutes
<chillywilly> I am getting a 404 on dillo
<dneighbo> chillywilly: i get that a lot in unstable
<dneighbo> where it cant find a package
<dneighbo> its like you catch them in a middle of an update or something
<dneighbo> as other packages will work
<nickr> you do
<chillywilly> guess so
<nickr> a dupdate run is going on
<chillywilly> should update then
<nickr> because it does the packages first and then it copies things over or whatever
<dres_> dneighbo: stock value grabbing code.
<dneighbo> dres_: shouldnt that be more modular?
<dneighbo> as like me i have no interest in that (at this time)
<dneighbo> so seems silly to get 4 or 5 packages to support it
<dneighbo> but maybe im being overly picky, with debian its not like it made it any 'harder' :)
Action: chillywilly grabs dres_ by his tail
<dneighbo> and not like they are huge disk space consumers
Nick change: dres_ -> dres
<nickr> maybe it is modular and the debian package doesn't separate it like it should
<nickr> that whole declining quality thing
<chillywilly> yea, so quit your belly aching
<dres> dneighbo: it's the debian package requiring it.  if you never used it gnucash would never run it, but better to be safe and require it.
<dneighbo> dres: guess im not being complete in my explanation
<dres> hrm?
<dneighbo> im thinking you should be able to compile gnucash w/ or w/o it
<dneighbo> and thus get debs with or with out it
<dres> oh. no.  you can't.
Action: dneighbo is tryinng to think of something similar
<dneighbo> say like apache
<dres> it's a bit of scheme code that calls a perl script that uses those libs.
<nickr> yea thats how it should be
<dneighbo> when i get apache it doesnt make me get every option of apache
<chillywilly> with or without what?
<nickr> you should be able to install that pakcage separately
<dneighbo> so i could do
<dneighbo> gnucash
<dneighbo> and
<dneighbo> gnucash-stock
<dneighbo> or whatever
<dneighbo> but anyhow, just an aside
<nickr> dneighbo: file a bug against it
<nickr> a wishlist bug
<dres> dneighbo: file a bug on the debian package :).  You can certainly separate out the perl script, but it's tiny and the perl deps are tiny too so it seems a waste of time and overly complicated.
<dneighbo> dres: difference of architecture opinion :
<dneighbo> :)
<dneighbo> my thinking is the stock piece might be small in that regard
<dneighbo> but it lays good groundwork and habits for other things :
<dneighbo> like say you build a small business module
<dneighbo> etc etc etc
<nickr>  /etc/gnucash/modules.d :)
<dneighbo> other than that i agree its tiny so barely worth the hassle just was curious :)
<dres> cvs is very separate, but even then it's unlikely that things will be packaged separately.
<dneighbo> nickr: dillo was pretty cool
<dneighbo> ready to restart gdm now
<nickr> dneighbo: did you poop?
<nickr> dneighbo: /etc/init.d/gdm restart . X will be killed
<nickr> I believe.
<dneighbo> ok if it gets killed will be back soon :)
<nickr> okay

<chillywilly> it does
<dneighbo> i think that restarted it as i saw the system menu now
<chillywilly> I do it all the time
<dneighbo> but fonts still big
<chillywilly> I am lazy like that
<dneighbo> and if i try configure from the system menu it shakes the screen a bit and does nothingg
<nickr> hrm
<chillywilly> it "wiggles"
<nickr> can you give us a screenshot to show us the 'big' fonts?
<dneighbo> if i try to configure the fonts it still give sme the blocks
<chillywilly> you need to install the configurator don't you?
<dneighbo> chillywilly: dont know probably :)
<nickr> dneighbo: apt-get install xfonts-75dpi*
<chillywilly> gdmconfig
<nickr> xfonts-scalable
<chillywilly> or something
<nickr> you can run gdmconfig as root from a logged in session
<dneighbo> beyond the 'big fonts' why cant i select any fonts
<chillywilly> maybe not
<nickr> dneighbo: it depends on what onds you're trying to select
<dneighbo> any one i select turns to that
<dneighbo> which is silly
<dneighbo> as they show up as good in the 'selector'
<nickr> try installing all the 100dpi and 75dpi and scalable fonts
<chillywilly> hey we should just switch to using C# for all GNUe tools ;)
<nickr> yea
<dneighbo> dres: whats up with gnucash in current debian?
<dneighbo> i run it answer druid questions
<dneighbo> then close it
<dneighbo> asks if i want to save i say yes
<dneighbo> type in file name click ok
<dneighbo> and it segfaults?
<dneighbo> nickr: ok i have apt-gotten those
<dneighbo> anything special i should do?
<dneighbo> s/current debian/today's unstable
<nickr> dneighbo: Its easiest just to restart X, theres some xset trickery that you can o to get it to rehash the font lists, but I newere remember how
<dneighbo> ok will do that
Action: dneighbo is now nervous to use gnucash w/ that segfault as i dont want to enter 3 hours of data and have it die when i save :(
<nickr> yow
<nickr> well maybe wait for the next version :)
Action: dneighbo always seems to have this happenn when i vow to get rid of quicken
<dneighbo> nickr: sigh
<dneighbo> i was running 1.5.x and it was 'flaky' at times so i was told switch to 1.6
<dneighbo> i tried that on rh6.2 and it basically wanted me to upgrade to rh7.x to beable to install
<nickr> at least versions don't take 3 year to come out.
<dneighbo> so i figured ok will just move to debian as i can apt-get it
<dneighbo> :(
<dneighbo> btw im not trying to complain, i just want to use it
<nickr> see if theres a bug filed against it
<dneighbo> i will try to enter a few transactions and see if it totally bombs or not
<dneighbo> as i ddint enter anything so wondering if it died as it was 'null' or something
<nickr> hrm, there doesn't seem to be a bug that matches that behavior
<dneighbo> brb restarting x

<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> well i looked over every font
<dneighbo> and only courier(bitstream)(all sizes)
<dneighbo> and a few clean (every other size)
<dneighbo> will work
<dneighbo> all other fonts will not work
<dneighbo> but it shows them in the picker with a * next to them
<nickr> you have more options now though don't you?
<dneighbo> at least courier 10 is smaller
<dneighbo> nickr: nope i think its same as before
<dneighbo> i just never went through every single one
<nickr> hrm.
<nickr> thats odd.
<dneighbo> btw: brb so my panel will resize to this new font
<dneighbo> i willl have to play with installing a font server some other time
<nickr> are you using xfs?
<dneighbo> dunno how can i tell
<nickr> you can set your panel size without changing a font or anyithng

<dneighbo> dneighbo@grapevine:~$ 
<dneighbo> um nickr i mean it changes the font in the panel
<dneighbo> but the spacing is horrid
<dneighbo> like if it were still a big font
<nickr> If the spacing is horid it means that its a truetype fonts not a bitmap font
<dneighbo> only way to get it to fix is restart x or get the panel to redraw
<nickr> how is it that you're having so much trouble with this?
<dneighbo> nickr: it will fix itself on an X restart (the spacing)
<nickr> its quite odd.
<dneighbo> nickr: every debian install i did had similar problems
<nickr> look at /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
<nickr> I've never had this problem
<dneighbo> everyone i know that installed debian around same time had the square font problem
<dneighbo> i always seem to get this larger than i like font but normally can change it by chaning the font of the gtk theme
<dneighbo> this is only install i have had that i havent been able to easily do that
<dneighbo> but then again it too me a week to get x running on this box

<chillywilly> fonts
<dneighbo> werd ta md
<dneighbo> 's mutha
<dneighbo> sorry watched one too many episodes of mtv's cribs last night
<mdean> good fonts depend on good font path order
<chillywilly> exactly
<mdean> and 75dpi
<chillywilly> that's what I have been trying to say
<chillywilly> 75dpi are better
<mdean> 100dpi is crap for web pages
<chillywilly> those are the small ones
<mdean> throws everything off
<dneighbo> i would settle for being able to use the ones i HAVE
<mdean> way off
<dneighbo> :)
<mdean> dneighbo: seriously - they should be 75dpi - accept nothing more ;-)
<dneighbo> xfs-xtt serves fonts using 100 dpi resolution                              
<dneighbo>     You should be aware that, by default, xfs-xtt (the X Font Server with      
<dneighbo>     X-TrueType) preferentially delivers fonts to clients using a resolution    
<dneighbo>     of 100 dots per inch.  This affects the visible font size.  Another        
<dneighbo>     common default is 75 dpi; some font rasterizers do not deal well with      
<dneighbo>     other dpi settings.                                                        
<dneighbo>     This setting can be changed by editing /etc/X11/fs-xtt/config.  See the    
<chillywilly> dneighbo: you know that apt has super cow powers?
<dneighbo>     xfs-xtt(1) manual page for more information.                               
<dneighbo>                                                     
<dneighbo> xfs-xtt does not listen on TCP port by default                             
<dneighbo>     Because xfs-xtt (the X Font Server with X-TrueType) is a daemon that       
<dneighbo>     runs with superuser privileges, by default it runs with TCP port           
<dneighbo>     listening disabled as a security measure.  This means that, as shipped,    
<dneighbo>     xfs-xtt is not reachable via the network and is unable to to serve         
<dneighbo>     fonts to X servers running on remote hosts.  Most people do not need to    
<dneighbo>     enable TCP port listening in xfs-xtt; it can serve fonts to local X        
<dneighbo>     servers without this functionality enabled.                                
<dneighbo>     xfs-xtt can be configured to remote X servers by appropriately editing     
<dneighbo>     /etc/X11/fs-xtt/config.  See the xfs-xtt(1) manual page for more           
<dneighbo>     information.           
<dneighbo>  xfs-xtt use 7110 port insted of 7100                                       
<dneighbo>     xfs-xtt would use 7110 insted of 7100 default, xfs-xtt does not            
<dneighbo>     conflict original xfs. So, if you installed xfs-xtt (1.3.0.1-15 or         
<dneighbo>     earlyer) previous and will not install xfs, you should modify font path    
<dneighbo>     in XF86Config, like this:                                                  
<dneighbo>     FontPath "unix/:7100" ->  FontPath "unix/:7110"                            
<dneighbo>                                                    
<dneighbo> ok apt got it now what?
<chillywilly> dneighbo: you know that apt has super cow powers?
<dneighbo> how do i tell its runnign etc
<chillywilly> you better look out
<chillywilly> ps ax | grep xfs
<mdean> you don't need xfs
<chillywilly> xfs is da bomb though
<mdean> xfs is an unnecessary layer for fonts
<mdean> it's unnecessary
<chillywilly> it's damn necessary
<dneighbo> grapevine:/home/dneighbo# ps ax |grep xfs

<chillywilly> for me
<dneighbo> i just want fonts man
<mdean> it doesn't provide anything more than X itself will do
<dneighbo> something other than the shitty squares :)
<chillywilly> hehe
<dneighbo> help.....
<chillywilly> mdean: you get the big WE in my book
<dneighbo> chillywilly: i did the apt-get xfs-xtt so what the hell do i do now
<nickr> my fonts look nice.
<chillywilly> start dat bizotch
<nickr> I have some really cool fonts
Action: dneighbo is confused
<dneighbo> doesnt it start itself?
<chillywilly> well did it do that at postinstall?
<dneighbo> sigh let me reiterate
<dneighbo> i need this to be continual
<chillywilly> otherwise you can use it's init script
<dneighbo> so what do i need to do to make it autostart?
<dneighbo> what do i need to add/remove from my X file?
<dneighbo> etc etc etc
<dneighbo> etc
Action: dneighbo is sick of fonts at this point nearly 2 hours and getting no where fast
<mdean> make what autostart?  X?
<chillywilly> it will start up with the script
<dneighbo> mdean: the font server
<chillywilly> fonts suck
<mdean> you don't need the font server
<chillywilly> X sucks
<chillywilly> Linux sucks
<chillywilly> eveything sucks
<dneighbo> ok chillywilly so if i restart x right now
<dneighbo> i wont be fucked?
<dneighbo> as when i did this on redhat i was fucked
<dneighbo> as it couldnt find the xfs-xtt server
<chillywilly> you should be good to go
<S11001001> chillywilly: you're right about linux
<chillywilly> if by some change it is horked
<mdean> dneighbo: say no to font server
<chillywilly> just purge it
<dneighbo> huh?
<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> mdean how should i do this?
<chillywilly> apt-get --purge remove xfs-xtt
<mdean> dneighbo: use FontPath in XF86Config-4
<chillywilly> dneighbo: you never listen to me anyway
<mdean> add a fontpath for each directory that contains fonts for X

<dneighbo> mdean: you get the hero award
<dneighbo> i have small fonts now :)
<dneighbo> yeee haw
<mdean> didn't chillywilly say 75dpi?
<dneighbo> um i had 75dpi all along
<chillywilly> yea, what about me?
<mdean> 100 is pure evil
<dneighbo> you were one that suggested ordering them
<chillywilly> feh
<dneighbo> chillywilly: yes amen to you too
<chillywilly> dude it is always dependent on the ordering
<mdean> order does matter ;-)
<dneighbo> however i still cant select custom fonts :(
<mdean> custom fonts?
<chillywilly> well neither casn I half the time
<dneighbo> i still get hte little *
<dneighbo> if i go to my gtk theme
<chillywilly> stupid blocks show up
<dneighbo> and select 'custom font'
<dneighbo> and then try to choose one
<chillywilly> it's bullshit
<dneighbo> i have several to 'pick from'
<dneighbo> but they have little *'s next to the sizes
<dneighbo> and if you pick ones with *'s you get blocks instead of a font :)
<mdean> where did you get these fonts?
<dneighbo> which sucks
<dneighbo> mdean: beats me
<dneighbo> came with debian i suppose
<dneighbo> they are int the 'chooser dialog'
<mdean> ah
Nick change: S11001001 -> everyone
Nick change: everyone -> every1
<dneighbo> its fairly moot at this point as i just maiking the font smaller solves my immediate problem
<chillywilly> you've spent enough time getting goat raped
<mdean> when you add fonts to X, you have to be sure that fonts.dir is rebuilt properly
<chillywilly> live long an prosper
<chillywilly> the debian packages post install scripts rebuils the fonts when you install the packages
<chillywilly> it's cool like that
Nick change: every1 -> S11001001
<mdean> chillywilly: yeah - it should - just good to make sure that it does
<dneighbo> mdean: ??
<mdean> dneighbo: each font directory in your FontPath should have a fonts.dir file - and it should be the latest timestamp in relation to the font files
<mdean> dneighbo: but like chillywilly says, deb should have rebuilt them
<dneighbo> ttf-openoffice - OpenOffice TrueType Fonts
<dneighbo> how can i get this package and play with it?
<mdean> install it and make sure the fontpath is in your XF86Config-4 file
<dneighbo> i.e. if i apt-get it what do i do when its done and how can i verify it instealled
<chillywilly> is that  a debian package?
<mdean> you don't have to restart X to reset the fonts, btw
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> how do you get around that?
<dneighbo> mdean: yes, but no one could reember how to do it w/o doing so :)
<dneighbo> so that was a quickest method deal :)

<derek> as they are trying to do 'real' accounting 
<derek> although that shouldnt be necessary it should do it behind the scenes for me
<chillywilly> basically yes
<chillywilly> doble accounting
<chillywilly> you transfer form an inclome account
