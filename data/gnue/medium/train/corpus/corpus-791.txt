<derek> hmmm my bbrain must be tired
<derek> i got the splits to work now and stop autocalcing stuff
<derek> but its backwards?
<nickr> I like ultratiny panels
<derek> help
<derek> this kind of stuff drives me mad
<derek> wsating too much time w/ it
<derek> have a transaction
<derek> i do a split
<derek> put 1000 as income in deposit
<derek> 100 as income as desposit
<derek> then say take out 100 (withdraw)
<derek> and what does the split want to do ?
<derek> put 1000 in withdrawl
<derek> when it should be 1000 in deposit
<derek> sigh no one in gnucash
<chillywilly> on OPN?
<derek> no irc.gimp.org
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> I c you there
<chillywilly> dres willcome back soon
Action: dres is back.
<chillywilly> well there ya go
<chillywilly> wb derek
<chillywilly> er, dres
<derek> dres most odd my brain must be dysfunctional tonight
<derek> if i do a split for a paycheck in an asset/checking ledger
<derek> and i do
<derek> deposit 1000
<derek> deposit 100
<derek> withdrawl 100
<derek> in the split lines
<derek> it tries to create a 1000 withdrawl line
<derek> when im expecting a 1000 deposit line
<derek> and i notice it is doing flipped transactions in the other ledgers
<derek> like income / expense
<derek> so if i flip all my transactions it does ok
<derek> should be doing these all as 'negatives' in the split?
<dres> no.
<derek> as that would probably fix it as well (or is my brain missing something obvious)
<dres> shouldn't be using negatives in splits
<derek> i flipped the two columns and seemed to get the desired result
<derek> but it seems 'wrong'
<dres> say you get a paycheck.  you should withdraw X dollars from income account in one split and the second split in the transaction should have a deposit to checking.
<derek> to get it to work i did this
<derek> where xxx:yyy:zzzz
<derek> xxx = account
<derek> yyy = deposit
<derek> zzzz: withdrawl
<derek> income::1000
<derek> income::100
<derek> checkingaccount:1000:
<derek> taxes:100:
<derek> and it put 1000 in deposit of the line item (which is what i desired)
<derek> but it seems 'wrong' to do a split this way
<derek> did you run away?
<dres> ok.  so split 1: 1100 withdrawal from income account A
<dres> split 2: 100 deposit to expense account (taxes) B
<dres> split 3: 1000 deposit to checking account C
<dres> is this about right?
<dres> no.  just having a conversation with the wife and you at once.
<derek> yeah thats what i input to get what i wanted as 'end' result
<dres> then it sounds right to me.  What feels wrong to you?
<derek> it appears to have put 4 transactions in my income account (which seems right)
<derek> the 1000 and 100 as income
<derek> and a 1000 and 100 for charge
<derek> remember what is weird about this too me is not used to doing 'home' finances this way
<derek> when i deal with the 2.5 billion dollars at work i dont have 'personal' attachment too it so i dont think of it outside formulas :)
<derek> i guess what feels unnatural
<derek> is the split i assumed was indicative of journal its in
<derek> so i think of it as
<derek> 1000 deposit to the journal
<derek> 100 deposit to journal
<derek> 100 withdrawl from journal
<derek> to end up with 1000 credit in the end
<derek> BUT i guess its because an 'income' account it needs to be a withdrawl
<derek> in any event i got it to work
<derek> just seems a little odd, maybe its a naming thing
<derek> i think i did find a bug though
<derek> when i selected accounts from spouse from your wizard
<derek> it put all the 'tax' accounts under income for the spouse
<derek> but it put all hte normal tax accounts under expense
<derek> bug?
<dres> maybe.  I'm not sure what you are describing.
<dres> probably better to write up an email and send it to gnucash-list@gnucash.org.
<derek> nother bug
<derek> if i say do
<derek> Holiday Pay
<derek> in the memo of a split (and probably elsewhere)
<derek> then i want to do
<derek> HOLIDAY
<derek> it wont let me
<derek> in another memo
<derek> it converst
<derek> HO
<derek> into
<derek> Holiday Pay
<derek> even if i type HOLDIAY 
<derek> it converts it back to lower case
<dres> yea.  the auto complete is sometimes a bit aggresive.

sledge_ (~sledge@B2d84.pppool.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<sledge_> hu?
<jamest> hi
<sledge_> hi :-)
<sledge_> i have a short question and a long introduction :-)
<sledge_> i've been watching the gnue project for quite a while
<sledge_> partly because i have a lot to do with free software, mainly in the educational and political sector (i occassionally work for the fsf europe in the lobby are(n)a)
<sledge_> partly because i have a job with the official title "researcher" at an IT company
<sledge_> (don't worry, the question will not be "when is it ready" :-)
<sledge_> two questions: i've failed installation of gnue on debian woody; the programs (forms, designer) tell me that i don't have the python xml libs, but i certainly have them.
<sledge_> tracing that error, i have seen that gnue catches an error that occurs on "import" this and that xml lib.
<sledge_> can i report that as a "bug" (or something similar) to someone or to a certain list?
<jamest> um
<jamest> do you have the python xml or the python SIG PyXML installed
<jamest> you need the  PyXML one
<jamest> and why they have 2 of them is beyond me
<sledge_> jamest: honestly, don't know, i've installed the debian package for "xml support for python 2.x"
<sledge_> so i need to install "the other one"
<jamest> no , that should work :(
<jamest> as I run woody as well
<sledge_> strange
<jamest> yip
<jamest> are you running the last release or CVS?
<sledge_> cvs
<sledge_> my last cvs update was about two weeks ago, haven't tried again since then
<jamest> do you still have python 1.5.x installed?
<sledge_> no, that was my first guess, 1.5.x interfering with 2.1; i have uninstalled 1.5.x
<sledge_> didn't help
<sledge_> is it possible that it is a problem with debian? because when i had 1.5.x _and_ 2.1 installed, the "python" command invoked version 1.5.x; perhaps some environment variable that points to the old libraries?
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> i had the same problem 
<jamest> removed 1.5.2 and it worked
<jamest> sigh
ra3vat (ds@195.239.204.226) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jamest> so I assume it's failing during the setup.py install?
<jamest> btw - please forgive my choppy responces
<jamest> I'm at my "real" job 
<jamest> :)
<sledge_> okay :) 
ra3vat (ds@195.239.204.226) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> is it during the setup.py install that it fails
<jamest> ?
<sledge_> yes, it has failed, but through raping the scripts, i have achieved an installation (into ~/bin). but that was no real solution, because forms and designer complained about not finding this or that class (of course, because i killed of the "import"s of the xml libs)
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> I think I would try to install pyxml from source
<sledge_> yes, that should be the easiest way, though i don't like it on a system with usually clever package management :-)
<jamest> http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyxml
<jamest> yes
<sledge_> yep
<jamest> i don't get it though
<jamest> as I swear at home I have only python-xml installed
<sledge_> if i find the error, i'll drop a mail to the list(s)
<jamest> that would be great
alexey_ (alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<sledge_> another very short question: what's the state? forms seems to be quite good in 2-tier, how well off is geas and designer?
<reinhard> geas is alpha state to be honest
<reinhard> we got an application server contributed by a company
<reinhard> and are in the process of adapting it to our needs
<sledge_> aha, that means you drop the current geas and use that app server instead?
<reinhard> btw sledge_ iirc we met at linuxtag in stuttgart?
<reinhard> no the current geas _is_ that contributed thing
<sledge_> ah
<sledge_> perhaps we met at linuxtag; i was there at saturday, at the fsf europe booth
<reinhard> yes
<sledge_> reinhard mueller?
<reinhard> exactly
<sledge_> i can remember the name, but not the face :-)
<reinhard> oh
<reinhard> the long haired guy with the big nose :)
<reinhard> www.bytewise.at/team.html
<sledge_> mom
<reinhard> and sometimes i write mails to the fsfe discussion list
<sledge_> yes, i know
<sledge_> ah, now i remember!
alexey_ (~alexey@195.151.214.34) joined #gnuenterprise.
<sledge_> me is christian selig -> http://www.newopenness.de/home/sledge/pics/schmidtbank-2001-ichbeimvortrag-small.jpg
<jamest> :)
<sledge_> what a small world we live in :)
<jamest> designer works ok
<jamest> our mouse support is alpha quality at best
<sledge_> that's nice. python is the scripting language of choice?
<jamest> wrt dragging widgets arround
<jamest> so far
<sledge_> i'd love to help, but i've got soooo much to do :-(
<jamest> we've talked about support other languages inside triggers
<jamest> but we've put no effort into making it happen
alexey_ (alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: Client Quit
<sledge_> don't worry about other languages; it's better to have one language supported well than having a dozen unmaintained. but you already know that. :)
<sledge_> btw, why have you choosen corba over xmlrpc or soap? (no religious discussion intended, i know their different strengths and weaknesses)
<jamest> actually jcater has done some work on grpc
<jamest> which should (when done) allow you to plug in comm systems like you do database drivers
<sledge_> cool
<sledge_> because a friend of mine has, two years ago, created apps that communicated over http, which was a big advantage in a corporate environment (no need to configure half a dozen firewalls and filters)
<sledge_> just a thought :-)

<jcater> both assignments have been signed and mailed... just wanted to make sure they were received
<dneighbo> i dont recall seeing an email saying they were
<dneighbo> we REALLY need to fix the process though
<dneighbo> often times is slow
<holsch> dneighbo: thanks
<jcater> dneighbo: as to the ssh and backpack, you really need to look at ssh tunneling
<jcater> ;)
<dneighbo> and record keeping is bad
<dneighbo> etc
<dneighbo> jcater: rofl, they do have it now where servers are commonly bootstrapped
<dneighbo> so that you can ssh into a small bsd box
<dneighbo> and have it 'turn on' the linux box
<dneighbo> i think fsf has a little setup like that now

<derek> enterprise wide office kommunication
<nickr> hrm, a gnucomm thing?
<derek> actually yes :)
<derek> gnucomm didnt exist then
<nickr> I see
<derek> gnucomm has come to in many ways replace ewok
<derek> at one time we had gedi
<derek> gnu enterprise data interchange/interface
<nickr> is this supposed to be like jabber?
<derek> and to be 'funny' as programmers can be we made light of ewok
<derek> nickr: nah it was to be more what gnucomm is
<nickr> more phoney
<derek> generic protocol for phone type devices
<derek> specifically fax
<derek> though jabber could have been used too
<nickr> nog
<derek> unofficially i think you will see this resurface VERY soon
<nickr> I want sort of a localnet broadcast IM thing
<derek> under the guise of
<nickr> for URLs
<derek> GNUe Groupware
<derek> GNUe Workflow
<nickr> ah
<derek> and we will reuse gnucomm/bayonne for telephony portions
<derek> waiting for some responses from FSF folks and then you see some movement :)
<derek> mmmm food was soooooooooo good, think i was just extra hungry
<nickr> ye
<nickr> it irks me that emacs doesn't have more 'wizard' type things
<nickr> like a manpage wizard
<nickr> HELLO services

<derek> * How can you tell when a blonde is having a bad day? 
<derek> * She has a tampon behind her ear, and she can't find her pencil.
<derek> * How do you keep a blonde busy for hours? 
<derek> * Ask her to go alphabetize your M&M's.
<derek> * What does it mean if a blonde has square breasts? 
<derek> * She forgot to take the kleenex out of the box.
<derek> * Why did the blonde write TGIF on her shoes? 
<derek> * To remind herslef Toes Go In First.
<derek> * How do you know if a blonde has been at your computer? 
<derek> * Whiteout on the screen.
<derek> * How do you know if another blonde has been on your computer? 
<derek> * Ink on the white out.
<derek> * How do you know if a third blonde has been on your computer? 
<derek> * Joystick's wet.

<chillywilly> http://www.apple.com/imac/
[22:58] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<nickr> I don't want to hear about jcater's expandable pouch

<nickr> it is
<nickr> but I get tired of hjow slow it is
<chillywilly> you see thr imac site
<chillywilly> I almost licked the screen
<nickr> so I I've been only using Xenophilia lately
<chillywilly> hmmm
<jcater> I get a new computer tomorrow
Action: chillywilly is using crux
Action: jcater is excited
<chillywilly> kewl :)
<jcater> Athlon 1700
<chillywilly> you pig bastard
<jcater> 512Mb memory
<jcater> it's for work :)
<nickr> chillywilly: try 'xeno gradient' or 'xeno buffered'
<nickr> they are very gentky pleasing
Action: chillywilly prefers to piece together a system
<jcater> chillywilly: I am :)
<chillywilly> aight
<nickr> apt-get install gtk-engines-xenophilia
<chillywilly> kewl
<jcater> btw, it's gonna suck for GNUe testing
<chillywilly> and "engine" is usually faster
<chillywilly> why?
<jcater> as how can I "profile" code
<jcater> "Um, it runs fast enough for me..."
<chillywilly> by using gprof
<jcater> that was a joke
<chillywilly> :P
<chillywilly> really?
<jcater> actually, I profile using
<jcater> gfcvs --profile 
<jcater> :)
<nickr> chillywilly: because a lot of themes use the pixmap engine, which is a dog running in molasses
<nickr> chillywilly: engines generally render images on the fly in a more efficient way
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> I was aksing jc why
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> why ugina  1.7GHz box would suck for testing GNUe
<chillywilly> my buddy has a nice system he pieced toggethe wth a 1.5GHz Athlon in it
<chillywilly> it flys
<chillywilly> flies
<chillywilly> even
<chillywilly> I think I will go steal it
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> we build all our own computers
<nickr> man my 550 is looking more and more oldschool
<nickr> and my 366 is ancient
<nickr> :(
<chillywilly> he's got a butt load of RAM in it
<nickr> my 550 only has 256, oh so does mt 366
Action: jcater wonders how much RAM is in a "butt load"
<nickr> "only"
<jcater> nickr: :)
<chillywilly> xeno gradient is nice
<nickr> I like the dark purple
<nickr> theres really no good sawfish theme to match it though
<chillywilly> well the color doesn'tshow up too great on my laptop
<nickr> crux-gtk is reasonable
<chillywilly> I like xeno light
<nickr> but its to big for my taste
<nickr> yea
<nickr> the various xeno iterations are pretty nice
jcater (jason@24.92.70.201) left irc: "night"
<chillywilly> wow
<chillywilly> my fonts just got teenie
<chillywilly> shit I can't even fucking read them
<chillywilly> there
<chillywilly> I don't like this font that much
<chillywilly> back to my default one
<chillywilly> one thing I hate about changing themes
<chillywilly> is that my terminals shrink
<chillywilly> that's very gay
<nickr> eh?
<nickr> chaning themes never seems to affect my terminals
<nickr> what teminal are you suing?
<chillywilly> gnome-terminal
<nickr> odd
<chillywilly> it's the whole font thing I think
<nickr> changing themes has absolulely no effect on my terminal
<chillywilly> it should be that way
<nickr> on feature I'd like is to be able to 'zoom' my terminal like I can zoom galeon, so the physical window dimensions don't change, but the font size changes, and the WxH changes
<chillywilly> that would be funky
<derek> jcater: depends on the butt
<derek> nickr: that would be trick, does eTerm do that?
Action: chillywilly is reading the GNUe KC
