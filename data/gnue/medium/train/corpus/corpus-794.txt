<reinhard> actually it's good
<reinhard> i work from 8:00 a.m. to 9 or 10 p.m. daily

<reinhard> so i will probably fulfill the year's income budget within the first month or so

<dneighbo> so jamest what you think of sun not supporting x86 hardware going forward?
<jamest> i think it's a good idea personally
<jamest> as solaris on x86 was kind of a joke
<jamest> very limited compared to what linux or the *BSDs offered
<jcater> hrrm
<jamest> jcater: whoops, sorry
<jamest> jcater: do you disagree or solaris x86 user?
<jamest> or = oh
<jcater> actualyl, I'm a little perturbed about the whole situation
<jcater> as we used oracle on sco/intel
<jcater> but oracle desupported sco
<jcater> so I asked Oracle, "What is your preferred intel platform?"
<jcater> "Solaris/x86"
<jcater> one year later...
Action: jcater gets a notice
<jamest> "Solaris" <snicker, snicker, psst, bob, he's falling for it>
<jcater> "Solaris/x86 is being desupported. The new preferred intel platform is RedHat"
<jcater> of course, the year earlier when I asked oracle if RedHat would be a better platform, they snickered at me
<jcater> I personally detest Solaris/x86
<jcater> I'm just getting sick and tired of being desupported left and right
<jamest> jcater: use GNUe, we'll support whatever platform you choose
<jamest> :)
<jamest> oh , and postgresql
<jcater> I'm still slightly leary of postgresql
<jcater> anyone familiar with the other not-so-free-but-freer-than-oracle options
<jcater> like SAP-DB, Interbase, etc
joebullhead (~joe@h-64-105-244-252.ATLNGAHP.covad.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> interbase WAS very nice
<dneighbo> BUT its ridiculed w/ legal problems
<dneighbo> inprise said here have it to the community
<dneighbo> and when the community took them up on that and started to make REAL changes
<dneighbo> inprise took it back
<dneighbo> and a 'war' insued
<dneighbo> it has been 'tainted' ever since
<dneighbo> which is most unfortunate as i think interbase would have been a real gem
<dneighbo> i used it a lot as a 'borland' user and rather liked it
<dneighbo> it does some trans isolation stuff that even oracle couldnt support
<dneighbo> and they had a local interbase
<dneighbo> that was FULLY compatiable 
Action: jcater is away: lunch
<dneighbo> btw: i aways thoguht they should have made interbase free and called it freebase...
<dneighbo> then the developers could say they were into 'freebasing' and not be telling lies

<dneighbo> has anyone here installed sap db?

alexey (alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: "Client Exiting"
Action: jcater is back (gone 01:01:28)
<jcater> I've installed it, but not actually used it
<jcater> I've heard positive things
<jcater> of course, if SAP R/3 can run on it, I suppose I can ;)
<dneighbo> well thats my thinking
<dneighbo> in looking at the licensing its GPL
<dneighbo> w/ the api stuff as LGPL
<dneighbo> looks like they readily support php/python/C/C++
<dneighbo> and we support it in gnue (in theory) :)
<dneighbo> for some enterprises that are a little larger it might be easier to sell sap db over postgres
<dneighbo> as there is a 'company' behind it
<dneighbo> and the good enough for R/3 good enough for me 
<dneighbo> not that im 'dissing' postgres ( i think that should still be the preferred for us)
<dneighbo> but i think it might be worth testing waters with sapdb even more

<ToyMan> hey guys
<psu> hi Toyman
<ToyMan> psu, not seen you around here before, hi
<psu> I think time diff usually keeps us apart
<ToyMan> ah, yes, the UK ic
<psu> good ol' +0000
<ToyMan> have you ever used Rekall from TheKompany?
<psu> nope. tell me more
<ToyMan> -5.00 for me
<ToyMan> http://www.thekompany.com/products/rekall
<ToyMan> front end for db
<ToyMan> db admin
<psu> Y
<psu> interesting
<psu>  very similar in concept to GNUe Forms
<psu> It even likes the same dbs (postgresql & mysql)
<psu> and script lang (python) as us
<dneighbo> ToyMan  please please use gnue instead :)
<psu> rekall is non-free 
<ToyMan> but not too much $$$
<dneighbo> yes i think pg_access should be suitable alternative
<psu> basically you get the source 
<psu> but still have to pay per seat
<psu> They are obviously aware of both BSD and GPL licenses
<psu> & imply they use them for other products
Action: psu is not keen on per-seat licensing for dbs (client or server)
<psu> if you have to go proprietary
<psu> I would prefer to license on server capacity or num of transactions
<psu> paying per seat can get you into a trap
<psu> where you want to have modern business processes 
<jamest> pgaccess suxs
<psu> but can't afford the licensing
<jamest> there I said it
<psu> so you end up doing your workflows on paper
<psu> and just having a central punch facility
<jamest> i wouldn't use pgaccess unless I was forced to
<jamest> as it's slow, unstable, and very, very unfriendly (at least what I've seen of it)
<ToyMan> jamest, any good alternatives?
<dneighbo> ToyMan there is a web alternative
<dneighbo> was mysqladmin
<dneighbo> but now i think supports much more
<ToyMan> hmm. whatever.  I was just looking around
<dneighbo> i saw someone elsewhere too remind me when i get home
<dneighbo> btw: i hope gnue will include some tools liek this
<dneighbo> to 'manage' db's
<dneighbo> its just not 'high' priority
<ToyMan> i just need something in between stupid and command-line commando
<dneighbo> i think you might find in many ways psql to fit that bill
<dneighbo> it is command line
<dneighbo> but is pretty straight forward
<dneighbo> but i think i recall a gui tool getting good review 
<dneighbo> i will dig for it at home
<dneighbo> btw: your conversion starts for real thursday :) (on my local machines)
<dneighbo> have cleared off other work to get you moving
<dneighbo> jcater: added much needed menu navigation
<dneighbo> and since i we dont need to be 0.1.x compatiable date masks should be there too for some playing
<ToyMan> that sounds good
<ToyMan> will you need the new file structues?
<dneighbo> i.e. the stuff that was 'hold' up kind of stuff from an architecture standpoint is seeing light
<ToyMan> structures
<dneighbo> yes i will need them
<dneighbo> provide when you can
<dneighbo> i can start w/o them
<ToyMan> hmmm.
<ToyMan> cd burner is down...

<dneighbo> jamest : ah yes that one was funny
<dneighbo> i think they release a lot of this info on purpose to a degree
<dneighbo> let me retract that, i think they can be as brash as they wish about things
<dneighbo> if they get caught they PR machine simply spins it in favor of their trial
<dneighbo> example:
<dneighbo> the poll
<dneighbo> a. they stuff the ballots to get people to believe everyone else wants .net so people adopt cause they think everyone is
<dneighbo> a. if they dont get caught people adopt cause of the FUD
<dneighbo> b. if they get caught they use it in their DOJ case, 'competition is so fierce' that others are beating us and we had to resort to last ditch just to get a foot in the market....
<dneighbo> another example:
<dneighbo> lead sales man get FUD on linux spread to your staff asap via an email
<dneighbo> a. if you dont get caught everyone in the org understands how to fight linux
<dneighbo> b. if you get caught it only enforces that competition is so steep we have to avhe 'action' plans to compete and the DOJ will see this and ease off

<dneighbo> i REALLY think M$ is in a no lose situation right (immediate term)
<dneighbo> as users are just too unwilling to hold a grudge regardless
<dneighbo> <me continues rant>
<dneighbo> i see microsoft as being a monopoly like the telephone or electric company at this point, if im a home or office user its too 'hard' to get out of the grip
<dneighbo> example: what would you do if your electricity provider in your next bill told you that rates were going up 25%
<dneighbo> pretty much you would have two choices:
<dneighbo> a. pay the increase
<dneighbo> b. go w/o electricity from them
<dneighbo> but in case b, there isnt much alternative other than 'home' generated power
<dneighbo> i would venture to say 98% of homeowners woudl swallow the bitter 25% pill and still consume energy

<kreiszner> derek: help
<jamest> kreiszner: what do you need?
<kreiszner> I was installing the gnue stuff with dereks help the other day and we got to the point that we had to install python fromsource I have tried to do that and now I have some error mesages
<kreiszner> our last conversation went like <derek> http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6473&release_id=66587
<kreiszner> <derek> you want PyXML-0.7.tar.gz
<kreiszner> <derek> you just tar xzvf PyXML-0.7.tar.gz
<kreiszner> <derek> then cd PyXML-0.7
<kreiszner> <derek> then do
<kreiszner> <derek> python2.1 setup.py build
<kreiszner> <derek> then
<kreiszner> <derek> python2.1 setup.py install
<kreiszner> <derek> and that should install it for you
<kreiszner> <derek> then go back to GNUe-Forms-0.1.0/
anderman (~anderman@rdu88-244-127.nc.rr.com) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<kreiszner> <derek> and do python2.1 setup.py install
<kreiszner> <derek> and if its successful you should be able to do a gfclient -v
<kreiszner> <kreiszner> OK I will be out of town through next tues starting sat evening or sunday but I will try to download and intall in the meantime I am saving all this in a word procwessor file.
<kreiszner> <derek> er gfclient --version
<jamest> so you have python installed?
<jamest> btw - what OS?

<jamest> hmmmm
<kreiszner> I know I know
<jamest> i didn't mean anything
<jamest> just supprised they don't have rpm's for this stuff
<chillywilly> they do
<chillywilly> go to the rpmfind site
<chillywilly> I bet you can find them there
<jamest> kreiszner: so where are you at in the install?
<kreiszner> They do. There was a prob and derek said the source could be solution.
<jcater> I don't think PyXML has an rpm for Python2.1 though
<jamest> sigh
<jcater> I think that's the issue most ppl have
<jamest> we need to be rid of pyxml some day
<jamest> when we did it I figured that pyxml (being a python SIG) would actually be included in python
<jamest> silly me
<jcater> lol
<jcater> that still blows me away
<kreiszner> evrything installed fine but the gfclient --version gives me som ?
<jcater> kreiszner: what errors are you getting?

<jamest> you say you installed python2.1
<kreiszner> I was and then I downloaded and installed Python 0.7 and installed 2.1 as per above instructions
<jamest> hmm
<jamest> python 0.7?
<kreiszner> the source PyXML-0.7.tar.gz
<jamest> ok
<jamest> could you please do 
<jamest> more `which gfclient`
<kreiszner> [root@localhost GNUe-Forms-0.1.0]# more 'which gfclient'
<kreiszner> which gfclient: No such file or directory
<kreiszner> is that what youwant

<jamest> how about 
<jamest> which gfclient
<kreiszner> k
<jamest> without the more
<kreiszner> [root@localhost GNUe-Forms-0.1.0]# which gfclient
<kreiszner> /usr/local/bin/gfclient
<jamest> ok now
<jamest> more /usr/local/bin/gfclient

<jamest> with a 320 line gfd file
<jamest> the gfd does more
<jamest> :)
<jcater> hurray!
<kreiszner> less is best
<jamest> kreiszner: what did the command
<jamest> more /usr/local/bin/gfclient
<jamest> show?

<jamest> ok, so forms is definately using your old python
<jamest> which will never work
<jamest> we moved to 2.x series so remove 1.5.2 hacks in the code
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> you did install python2.x 
<jamest> did it put it in /usr/local/bin?
<jamest> the new python
<kreiszner> yes supposedly from source

<chillywilly> it like
<jamest> chillywilly: no, you are correct
<jamest> I'm just saying we tried to fix what
<chillywilly> that's a python 2.x addition
<jamest> what = that
<jamest> and it didn't take
<jamest> :(
<chillywilly> I saw ;)
<jcater> for some reason, on redhat systems python's distutils doesn't change the #!/bin/env python to the install specific python
<jcater> we've seen this happen at least one other time
<jamest> we have that in the FAQ?
<chillywilly> nope :(
<jcater> no, but this confirms it
<jcater> ;)
<jamest> kreiszner: what editor do you like?
<kreiszner> lately jed
<jamest> ok, you need to edit /usr/local/bin/gfclient
<jamest> and change the word python on the top line to python2
<jamest> then rerun it
<jamest> jcater: i wonder if it'll screw up the environment then too

<jamest> i shouldn't post this
<jamest> but
<chillywilly> can't type
<jamest> http://www.math.ksu.edu/~jamest/school.jpg
<chillywilly> sleepy time
<jamest> is an example of a 2-tier app 
<jamest> where the form runs on a cient machine and accesses our database server at work
<jamest> this form pulls from 7 different tables
<chillywilly> the school going to whip you jamest?
<jamest> now most of our biz apps login is in geas
<jamest> which has a few issues
<derek> here now missed lots
<derek> kreiszner: glad the goatmen were able to help
<chillywilly> make sude psu doesn't put it in the KC ;)
<chillywilly> sure
<jamest> 1 - I can't get forms to play nice with it at the moment - segfaults on the client side
<derek> kreiszner: things will be productive by end of week
<jamest> 2 - performance
<derek> we will work on getting your postgres working and setup tongith if you have time
<derek> then get you using a data aware form
Action: chillywilly is about as helpful as a kick in the nuts
<derek> at which point you should see the ability to be productive :)
<jamest> derek - in the toot gnue horn catagory
Action: derek is back (gone 14:13:25)
<derek> ?
<kreiszner> I have some time before nite nite
<jamest> 320 lines of gfd file are replacing    4739 lines of C and 1451 lines of tcl/tk 
<jamest> and the gfd does more
<derek> gfd?
<derek> oh i get it
<derek> sorry was thinking geas (gnue)
Action: jamest smacks derek with a trout
<chillywilly> cool
<derek> but you are saying a gnue gfd is replacing a c program
Action: derek lubes up and removes head from ass
<jcater> hmm
<jamest> derek: yes, a 2-tier applicatoin
Action: jcater thinks derek has been having too much fun the last 14:13:25 hours
<chillywilly> poor poor geas
<derek> jcater: something like that
<derek> kreiszner: do a ps -ax 
<derek> er
<chillywilly> derek: heh, thanks a lot
<derek> 'ps -ax | grep postgre'
<kreiszner> jamest:  the form did come up that is pretty impressive as a user I can see all kinds of usefulnees here
<derek> and paste output here
<jamest> kreiszner: jcater whips that up real quick
Action: derek wants to fast track you getting postgres setup so we can show you the 'real power' muhahahahaa
<jamest> that's a 119 line gfd file
<kreiszner> can I do a ctr c in th e terminal to get the promt back
<derek> jamest: you are starting to sound like m$
<derek> shifting the numbers all the time
<derek> yes
<derek> kreiszner: yes
<jamest> well, that's not that impressize I guess
<chillywilly> well he is a proud owner of an xbox
<derek> or you can click on the X or whatever in your window manager to shut down the gfd and it will give you terminal back
<chillywilly> he has to keep his invest worth something
<jamest> the 40 line zipcode query form is data aware
<jcater> rofl
<jcater> we need a "size matrix" for form complexity
<jcater> each element counts as one, but complex entries count as 2
<jcater> and each line of a trigger counts as one
<jcater> "This form is a 65"
<jcater> "but replaces 2222 lines of C"
<jcater> ;)
<kreiszner>  derek[root@localhost Ken4]# ps -ax | grep postgre
<kreiszner>  2984 pts/2    S      0:00 grep postgre
<chillywilly> hehe
<jamest> what really rocks
<jamest> is when you can create a fully data aware form in minutes
<jcater> using designer's wizards ;)
<jamest> yes
<jamest> if you're fast on the buttons
<jamest> you may be able to get it under 60 secs
<jamest> for a simple one
<jamest> ;)
<chillywilly> I need to get my postgres working
<chillywilly> damn I'm lazy
Action: jamest hugs forms
<derek> anyone remember if redhat initizales postgres?
<chillywilly> do rpms have post install scripts now?
<chillywilly> redhat rpms
<derek> kreiszner: do
<derek> 'psql'
<derek> and tell me what happens
<chillywilly> iirc, when i used it back int he day it would not configure anything for me
<kreiszner> [root@localhost Ken4]# psql
<kreiszner> psql: connectDBStart() -- connect() failed: No such file or directory
<kreiszner>         Is the postmaster running locally
<kreiszner>         and accepting connections on Unix socket '/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432'?
<chillywilly> that's yet another reason debian was so appealing
<chillywilly> he got no postmaster running I bet
<derek> im pretty sure postmaster is running based on postgres
<derek> but just to make sure do
<chillywilly>  don't think redhat will start it up for you
<derek> type /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql restart
<derek> paste the output
<kreiszner> [root@localhost Ken4]# /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql restart
<kreiszner> [root@localhost Ken4]#
<derek> ok now do 
<derek> psql
<derek> and tell me what it says
<jcater> nite all
jcater (jason@24.92.70.201) left irc: "sleepy"
Action: derek checks his watch.....
<derek> someone call 911, i think cater just suffered from a krispy kreme overdose
<jamest> no, it's not 2am
<kreiszner> [root@localhost Ken4]# psql
<kreiszner> psql: connectDBStart() -- connect() failed: No such file or directory
<kreiszner>         Is the postmaster running locally
<kreiszner>         and accepting connections on Unix socket '/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432'?
<derek> kreiszner: at least its consistent :)
<derek> do me a favor and type
<derek> su postgres
<derek> and tell me if you get a 
<derek> >
<kreiszner> [root@localhost Ken4]# su postgres
<kreiszner> YPBINDPROC_DOMAIN: Domain not bound
<kreiszner> bash-2.05$
<derek> jamest: help :)
<jamest> kreiszner: you at home computer?
<derek> the bas is good
<derek> s/bas/bash
<derek> but the domain thing is od
<kreiszner> jamest: yes
<nickr> derek: its safe to ignore that I think
<jamest> you seem to be running NIS (ypbind)
<derek> though your machine says localhost instead of a domain, so its probably not set
<derek> i think you are ok
<nickr> derek: it has to do with NIS
<kreiszner> jamest: actuall my home and work are same
<jamest> ah
<derek> jamest: if postgres will work w/o it lets leave it for now
<derek> and focus on postgres
<derek> kreiszner: then we will come back and clean that up after the fact :)
<jamest> it'll work
<derek> bash-2.05$ prompt
<derek> type
<derek> anyone remember?
<derek> is it adduser or createuser?
<jamest> createuser
<derek> its been a while since i did fresh postgres install
<derek> type 'createuser' :)
<derek> and rememember that username and password
<derek> when you create them :)
<nickr> postgres' authentication handling is annoying.
<derek> feel free to post the questions here and ask how you should respond
<derek> nickr: it makes me fell warm and fuzzy ;)
<jamest> mysql is worse though IMHO
<derek> jamest: we only talk about 'real' databases in this channel
<derek> fancy indexed file systems are anotehr channel
Action: derek can be brutal at times i know
chillywilly (danielb@d50.as11.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<nickr> haha
<nickr> amen, though
<kreiszner> user should be able to create dbs?
<kreiszner> Shall the new user be allowed to create databases? (y/n)
<jamest> typically I setup one db superuser that can do that
<jamest> normal users i don't allow to create databases
<kreiszner> am I setting up myself as su or a normal user
<jamest> i'd do a normal user
<jamest> then just use the postgresql account (like you're doing now) for a superuser account
<jamest> but again, it's personal preference
<jamest> the less power I give myself in a normal role the better I feel
<kreiszner> jamest: why
<nickr> sounds like a line of the beans song.
<nickr> generally its good practice to use the minimum possible level of power for any given action, so that if you mess up you don't break as much
<jamest> kreiszner: in my work database systems 
<jamest> if I run the command 'drop table foo;'
<jamest> as a normal user in the prod database nothing bad will happen
<jamest> as all tables in that database are owned by a admin account that no one logs into unless creating/removing tables
<jamest> so I save myself from myself and stupid errors
<kreiszner> can you still create tables from this account or do you have to do su
<jamest> you'll still be able to create tables
<jamest> just not databases
<jamest> (which contain tables)
chillywilly (~danielb@d50.as11.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<kreiszner> Shall the new user be allowed to create more new users? (y/n)
<chillywilly> weird
<chillywilly> all of a sudden my keyboard wouldn't work anymore
<derek> kreiszner: generally i create one user that can do everything
<chillywilly> right when I started messing with xmms
<derek> then i create normal accounts that answer no to
<derek> since we want this to be simple more than anything for right now
<kreiszner> well I just put n for the crate database can i GO BACK
<derek> i would answer yes to this and the one before it
<derek> or if you answered no to one before answer no to this one too
<derek> then when done do another createuser for a super user type account
<derek> and answer yes to both
<derek> you cant go back
<derek> kreiszner: sorry i was away getting drink
<kreiszner> Shall the new user be allowed to create databases? (y/n) n
<kreiszner> Shall the new user be allowed to create more new users? (y/n) n
<kreiszner> psql: connectDBStart() -- connect() failed: No such file or directory
<kreiszner>         Is the postmaster running locally
<kreiszner>         and accepting connections on Unix socket '/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432'?
<kreiszner> createuser: creation of user "kenneth" failed
<nickr> derek: it looks like its still an issue of the server not being run
<jamest> kreiszner: as root
<jamest> can you go to 
<jamest> /etc/rc.d/init.d
<jamest> and see if there is a postgres or postgresql file in there?
<jamest> I assume postgresql was from RPM
<nickr> <kreiszner> [root@localhost Ken4]# /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql restart
<nickr> <kreiszner> [root@localhost Ken4]#
<kreiszner> how do I wuit postgre..
<kreiszner> quit
<chillywilly> /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql stop
<derek> ctrl -c
<jamest> exit
<derek> or exit
<nickr> hehe
<jamest> nickr: you a RH7.2 user?
<chillywilly> my bad
<derek> jamest: he needs to edit his conf files
<chillywilly> don't listen to me
<nickr> jamest: no, that was a paste from a bit back
<chillywilly> I am an idiot
<nickr> I wouldn't touch RH wih an 8 meter pole
<kreiszner> [root@localhost init.d]# ls post*
<kreiszner> postgresql
Action: nickr plots to convert everyone secretly
<jamest> kreiszner
<jamest> ./postgresql restart
<derek> jamest: i think in red hat you have to do an 'initialize'
<derek> first
Action: derek goes to get his manual...
<nickr> you have to buid the base database
<nickr> thingy
<jamest> that'd be init_db
Action: derek also wonders why 'red hat is easier' :)
<jamest> IIRC
<derek> jamest: yeah that
<derek> :)
<kreiszner> hey guys if you want me in Dibian give me a couple days and I will be there
<derek> kreiszner: no, we want you to do red hat
<derek> for this machine
<jamest> kreiszner: you'd be traiding one pain for another
<derek> as its GOOD for us to have this experience
<nickr> we're spoiled.
<derek> it lets us know what to fix to make it easier for next red hat user
<derek> also we will get chance to get you debian on that corel box :)
<derek> when its time to get 'serious' :)
<kreiszner> [root@localhost init.d]# ./postgresql
<kreiszner> Usage: ./postgresql {start|stop|status|restart|condrestart}
<derek> kreiszner: one thign you will find (i will toot gnue horn) is that is group is about most knowledgable linux channel i have ever seen
<derek> guys that have been sysadmins for years learn new stuff in here, mostly because everyones level and background is so different
<derek> anyhow back to task at hand
<derek> jamest you remember how to do the init_db
<chillywilly> we rock
<derek> or should i go get my postgres docs
<jamest> su - postgresql
<derek> is it
<derek> su - postgresql
<jamest> you have to run it as the postgresql superuser
<derek> or
<derek> su - postgres
<derek> ?
<derek> i think postgres
<jamest> however I have no idea on a redhat RPM setup
<kreiszner> so I am to be the gueny pig OK
<nickr> su postgres without the - no?
<derek> kreiszner: do
<derek> su - postgres
<derek> you should get a 
<derek> bash2.04$
<derek> then type
<derek> init_db
<derek> and tell me what happens
Action: derek has the unfortune of having a redhat6.2 im using as we speak
<kreiszner> [root@localhost init.d]# su - postgres
<kreiszner> YPBINDPROC_DOMAIN: Domain not bound
<kreiszner> bash-2.05$
<chillywilly> time to compile a new kernel
<chillywilly> :)
Action: chillywilly updates his cvs
<kreiszner> bash-2.05$ init_db
<kreiszner> bash: init_db: command not found
<jamest> try
<jamest> initdb
<derek> what jamest said :)
<chillywilly> man someone has been hacking on usb
<derek> chillywilly: wasnt me :)
<kreiszner> derek: this seems to be important stuffCopying template1 to template0.
