<nickr> I had a gourmet creation of my own invention
<nickr> its somewhere between a soup and a cassorole
<nickr> with tuna!
<nickr> but no cheese
<nickr> cheese is what I miss most of all.
<dtm> haha
<dtm> nickr: why do you find yourself lacking cheese?
<nickr> lack of refrigeration technology and this thing 'money' I've been hearing about.
<nickr> thankfully my tribe has invented fire
<dtm> no tienes el refrigeranto?
<nickr> I see your primative culture does not yet have the great discovery 'refridgeration', we would happily trade it for your technology 'perl skillz'
<dtm> hmmm
<dtm> is that what you tell the prospective alien constituent?
<dtm> er i mean, is that what they tell you?
<dtm> )(#
<nickr> heh
<nickr> no its a Civ reference.
<nickr> nickr wisemen discover 'python'
<dtm> heh!!
<dtm> yay
<dtm> yew da man
<nickr> heh
<nickr> gnue: I see that your primative culture has not yet developed 'GEAS'. We would gladly trade it for five pounds of beef jerky
<dtm> lol
<dtm> that's grand.
<dtm> nickr: so are you totally unemployed, bruH?
<nickr> I am virtually unemployed
<nickr> People still expect me to work though because I'e already been payed for it
<dtm> oh i see
<dtm> doing what?  may i ask?
<nickr> web developemnt
<nickr> well
<dtm> is the nature of your employment appropriate to repeat in public?
<dtm> ;)
<nickr> bullshit conversion of pages
<nickr> Yes
<nickr> www.scientifickarate.com
<dtm> what a name
<dtm> conversion from what to what?
<nickr> conversion from stupid macusers-who-think-they-know-about-page-layout crap into webpages
<nickr> you would not believe the crap these people shoved in my direction.
<nickr> Next time, I ask for a lot more money and a lot more time. :)
<nickr> ANd be more explicit about what they can give me that I can deal with.
<dtm> heheh
<dtm> yeah
<dtm> yessir
<dtm> good lukc
<nickr> well I only have one book sample left right now.
<nickr> and I discovered a nice thing to take care of the first 25 minutes of each page in about 1 second
<nickr> called 'tidy'
<dtm> huh.
<dtm> what's the input file format?
<nickr> 25 minutes is an exageration
<nickr> the first 3-5 minutes of each page
<nickr> they are horrible word produced HTML that was cut and paste from the quark files
<dtm> amazing
<dtm> i can only imagine
<dtm> then they're prolly like 1MB apiece huh?  ;>
<nickr> the worst part, though, is the images
<nickr> they all have screwey names, most are eps format, but there is zero consistantcy of resolution
<dtm> so it may as well have been sketched on a napkin as far as you're concerned, huh?
<nickr> some are print resolution, some are screen, some are tiny
<nickr> they included idealized printouts
<dtm> so you have no coherently importable page layout, image resolution, or any quality at all huh?
<nickr> Nope
<nickr> basically I'm working from nealy scratch
<nickr> page-layout wise
<dtm> so they used Word as a Quark-to-html export tool?
<dtm> or what
<nickr> and the layouts of each page are sort of random too
<nickr> no
<nickr> they just gave me the copy and the images and want me to do the rest
<nickr> so its a quark-word-nickr filter
<nickr> not very automatic
<nickr> when we talked about it I was thinking oh 1 or two pages per book
<nickr> but no
<nickr> there are four books for which I have content, each one has about 15 pages
<dtm> so shan't you complete them with haste?
<nickr> bah. :)
<nickr> yes, I should've
<dtm> well.
<nickr> but I've stretched it out a bit
<dtm> call it your personal work ethic
<dtm> protecting your reputation
<nickr> yea
<nickr> well I don't really have a good work ethic
<dtm> that's easy for me to say, i know
<nickr> this is what my fifth grade teacher said
<dtm> i have a good one but it's oftendisconnected from my actions
<dtm> i have an anger problem :>  which creates a motivation problem.
<nickr> hehe
<nickr> I have an inspiration problem
<dtm> kinda like chillywilly except without the material support network ;>
<dtm> oh really?
<nickr> I depend on hack mode to get things done
<dtm> uh huh
<nickr> which isn't real dependable
<dtm> mmhm
<dtm> describe 'hack mode' briefly
<nickr> its a trancelike state of highly effective action
<dtm> oh
<nickr> well not trancelike exactly
<dtm> yeah it's "in the zone"
<nickr> yea
<dtm> i see
<dtm> yet you have a problem initiating hack mode?
<dtm> or what
<nickr> THats my general problem yes
<dtm> well i could hurt, insult, and otherwise negative reinforce you!  if you like!
<nickr> hehe
<Mr_You> hey, does gtk have a wizard type installer?
<dtm> or i guess we could try that positive reinforcement stuff
<nickr> well, I can see you'd really like that, but no thanks.
<Mr_You> similar to the windows wizard installer we have?
<nickr> Mr_You: loki's installer?
<dtm> but that'd have a higher startup effort
<dtm> nickr: no i'm kdding. i dont do tha
<dtm> t
<Mr_You> nick: is there one that we plan to use or no?
<nickr> Mr_You: I don't think so.
<nickr> Mr_You: I'd think it'd be packaging-system-specific
<Mr_You> ok.. this recent article makes a good point..
<Mr_You> thats one thing that is holding back linux desktop
<Mr_You> packaging would be fine if you could "auto-execute after download"
<Mr_You> that would need to tie into the desktop
<Mr_You> and webbrowser or shell
<Mr_You> tnx
<nickr> ah
<nickr> yea
<nickr> or just add an apt source and use your favorite package chooser
<nickr> such as Synaptik
<nickr> nickr wisemen discover the secret of kawfee.
<Mr_You> well.. for widespread adoption.. the use will need to be able to download via a website
<Mr_You> user
<Mr_You> thats what they are used to.. I guess it will be up to the browsers and desktop enviros.
<nickr> it depends on what it is
<Mr_You> its all about the mime-types heh
<nickr> If for example the debian way is heavily integrated into an organization, then having an apt source, or the binaries in the archive as official packages would be the best
<nickr> In RPM or some sort of click and drool installation, then having it launcgh from a browser would be normal
<Mr_You> I'm talking about joe blow luser ;-)
<nickr> but it depends on which joe blow you are referring to
<Mr_You> yeah, its definitely good for either or
<Mr_You> I'm talking MS replacement
<nickr> yea
<nickr> in that case its point and drool
<nickr> drool resistant pixes
<nickr> pixels
<nickr> I wonder if vodka+icedteamix+coffee is a good combo
<Mr_You> man I so want to check out my roomies laptop but he was tired and seems the batteries are dead
<Mr_You> eeww
<Mr_You> I'll have plenty of time tho

<llarens> morning
<llarens> people, I still with installation problems (may be related with python)
<jamest> whats up?
<llarens> emm
<jamest> what is the problem you are having?
<llarens> setup.py say that not found...
<jamest> what is not found?
<llarens> /usr/lib/python2.1/config/Makefile
<jamest> ?
<llarens> ups, Im trying this from redhat 7.2
<jamest> and you have installed the python2 rpms from the redhat CD?
<llarens> apparently there is a problem with dependencies o versions
<llarens> python2 from cd2, yes
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> and you are running setup.py for common?
<llarens> yes
<jamest> like this? python2 setup.py install
<llarens> this: /usr/bin/python2.1 setup.py install
<llarens> the question is that setup.py seek for /usr/lib/python2.x/config/Makefile
<llarens> file that I dont have
<jamest> hmmmm
<jamest> does redhat have a seperate rpm along the lines of python2.1-dev.rpm
Action: jamest is not a redhat user
<llarens> just a moment, I'll look for...
<llarens> YES! it is! python2-devel-2.1.1-2.i386.rpm
<llarens> im'listin the rpm...
<llarens> AND THE config dir IS THERE :)
<llarens> thank you veeeeery much jamest
<jamest> :)
<jamest> great!
<jamest> um
<jamest> are you installing from cvs or last release?
<llarens> yes
<llarens> cvs 3/18
<jamest> cool
<jamest> i was going to recommend it
alexey (Alexey@strel.techkran.vladimir.ru) left irc: "[x]chat"

dtm (dtm@ip32.promontory.sfo.interquest.net) got netsplit.
dtm (dtm@ip32.promontory.sfo.interquest.net) returned to #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> ok
<jamest> wassup?
<jamest> llarens?
<llarens> uh, now gfdesigner ask for pyXML, but PyXML IS installed
<jamest> is the pyxml installed for the default python or the python2.1
<jamest> in debian they are seperate packages
<llarens> mmm
<llarens> may be for python 1.5
<jamest> btw - i know this is a bit of a pain as we adopted python 2.x thinking the distros would be supporting it by the time we were ready
<llarens> (i think :-/)
<llarens> interesting... does aaaanybody have so much problems like me?
<jamest> yes
<jamest> its our fault
<llarens> I must test other distro or download sources of everything?
<jamest> but python 1.5.2 was giving us headaches
<jamest> so we made the jump thinking redhat and others would move to 2.0 rather soon
<jamest> debian woody made the move but redhat didn't 
<jamest> so now we're causing suffering for our redhat users
<jamest> :(
<llarens> so the best step is to pass to debian?
<jamest> no
<jamest> i would never ask that of anyone
<jamest> we just have more dependencies that need manually delt with on redhat 
<jamest> i apologize for that
<llarens> ahh so is a common problem
<llarens> here we say "al que quiere celeste, que le cueste¨jje
drochaid (drochaid@pc2-kirk2-0-cust175.ren.cable.ntl.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<llarens> ehhh... I dont know how to translate that
<jamest> :)
<llarens> something as "what costs, may be valuable" 
<llarens> emmm, I lost the path... where I am?
<llarens> so I must to configure PyXML for python2.1 ?
<jamest> yes
<jamest> it must be under the python2.1 lib section
<llarens> just copy dirs?
<jamest> um
<jamest> that might work but i think it'll generate lots of API changed warnings in your console
<llarens> ups
<jamest> in debian most of the packages are bundled for each version of python available
<jamest> so i had a python-xlm and a python2.1-xml
<jamest> maybe redhat did the same
<jamest> btw - i think we have a redhat 7.2 how-to somewhere on the site
<jamest> did you happen to look at that?
<llarens> so I must search for PyXML for python2.1
<llarens> no I did not 
<jamest> let me see if i can find it
<llarens> thanks
<jamest> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/redhat_install.html
<llarens> yes, I read, and says that 4suite must be uninstalled, I did it
<jamest> and it gives you location for pyxml source
<llarens> oh? let me see
<llarens> ups, seems that Im little anxious cause I dont see that :)
<jamest> To run the install scripts you need to have PyXML which you can get at http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/dependencies/python2.1/
<llarens> in process...
<llarens> (thanks God for clablemodem...)
<jamest> :)
kitchen (~grue@ip68-2-137-57.ph.ph.cox.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<llarens> ups I lost the path, having 2 o 3 dirs with gnue, Im going to erase all and start from scratch
<derek> llarens: for pyxml
<derek> they dont have 2.x version for redhat iirc
<derek> you have to download the source and compile it
<derek> as if you try the rpm for 2.x it will complain that 4suite is using the 1.5.2 version so wont let you 'move'  the other one out of the way
<derek> im sure a red hat expert coudl tell you how to make both work
<derek> but pyxml is an EASY install
<kitchen> derek: didja get the X fixed?
<derek> python2.1 setup.py install
<derek> kitchen: no i talked to X developers
<derek> they say i have found a bug (remember that special talent i was telling you about)
<kitchen> hahaha
<llarens> emmm, no problem, Im not interested in 4Suite
<derek> so i had to send have my files to a developer over there that does trident drivers
<derek> llarens: that is the other option is to remove 4suite
<kitchen> so...if I keep you away from my software/code, my job is secure :-)
<derek> the guy that did the doc for rh7.2 for us (kevin) did that :)
<llarens> yes I did, but now I have a lot of dirs with gnue moving from 1 to another
<llarens> is al total mess thissssssssss
<llarens> so much F8 mc's now :)
<derek> must go to work now

<dneighbo> i just sent them make-ssh-tunnel :)
<dneighbo> btw: i was able to demo that at the LUG
<jcater> did it work for ya?
<dneighbo> using forms via ssh tunneling to a postgres server behind firewall on net

Arturas (~raven@gsk.vtu.lt) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> Hello
<jamest> hi
<dneighbo> Arturas jamest and jcater both appear to be 'partially' here 
<dneighbo> now might be a good time to hit them up with your proposed changes to forms
<dneighbo> adn questions about where the problem lies
<dneighbo> about i18n
<Arturas> i'm here
<Arturas> mmmmmmmmmmmmmm............
<Arturas> :)
<dneighbo> also, im curious i noted in your email
<dneighbo> that you said you were looking at way to exchange data
<dneighbo> im curious as to what method you are planning to use
<dneighbo> so if i have a form that says
<dneighbo> 'Good Night'
<dneighbo> in native tongue do the translation/mapping to
<dneighbo> Labanaktis
<dneighbo> or
<dneighbo> Guten Nacht
<dneighbo> or
<dneighbo> Spokoinoi Nochi
<dneighbo> or
<Arturas> :)
<dneighbo> Bon Soir
<dneighbo> etc etc
<dneighbo> were you giong to use gettext?
<dneighbo> xml entities
<Arturas> yes
<Arturas> ok
<dneighbo> etc etc etc
<Arturas> 1.
<Arturas> text in *.py fiels
<Arturas> files
<Arturas> (/common, /designer and etc)
<Arturas> these will have to be translated
<Arturas> with gettext
<Arturas> (not with gettext exactly, there is some other named tool with the same functions)
Action: dneighbo wonders if there is a free python implementation of gettext
Yurik (yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) left irc: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)
<Arturas> 2.
<Arturas> pygettext
<Arturas> (or something like that - don't remember know exactle)
<Arturas> (or something like that - don't remember know exactly)
Yurik (~yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> yurik: jumping? :)
<Arturas> 2.
<Arturas> strings in .gfd fiels
<Arturas> er, files
<Yurik> Arturas: :)
<Arturas> all national symbols there are supported by xml parser
<Arturas> (i mean, i changed parser the way to support them)
<Arturas> and the problem i )*&!&@$#!@#*@# on is:
<Arturas> these symbols are NOT displayed correctly
<Arturas> (form title: ARE displeyd, anywhere else: NO)
<Arturas> reading docs
<Arturas> help files and etc
<Arturas> asked in conf
<Arturas> (wxwindows)
<Arturas> noone replied
<Arturas> after forcing, some mentioned that my system may be not configured exactly
<Arturas> gtk takes font information
<Arturas> not from KDE
<Arturas> but from .gtkrc
<dneighbo> ah
<Arturas> so in the morning i had a little time
<Arturas> (didn't go to the lecture)
<dneighbo> let me try to reiterate things then
<Arturas> yes
<dneighbo> we need to make the tools support gettext and have someone make translations files
<Arturas> what is reiterate?
<dneighbo> restate or go over again
<Arturas> o
<Arturas> ok
<dneighbo> then our tools will be i18n compliant
<Arturas> wait
<dneighbo> with error messages and such
<Arturas> tools do support i18n
<dneighbo> ?
<Arturas> something with X11/gtk or something does not display i18n correctly
<dneighbo> so you did a patch for the pygettext stuff
<dneighbo> we just need to make the translation files
<Arturas> was going to send today with some more pathches
<Arturas> one moment...
<dneighbo> then on the forms/designer
<dneighbo> we support i18n in parser and such
<dneighbo> but are workign out issues with display
<Arturas> if in some .py file, responsible for form
<Arturas> i create some sstring='national syblos here'
<Arturas> i create some sstring='national symbols here'
<Arturas> and put:
<Arturas> print sstring [=> into console]
<Arturas> everething is printed ok
<Arturas> form.title=sstring
<Arturas> everething is ok
<Arturas> form.label.title=sstring
<dneighbo> ok so you have the pygettext working then in the tools
<Arturas> and this doen't work
<Arturas> tested with one file
<dneighbo> im just trying to get a grasp of the items out there
<dneighbo> as im new to i18n
<Arturas> it takes out strings marked for translation
<dneighbo> cool
<Arturas> puts into separate file
<dneighbo> WAY COOL
<Arturas> for human-translation
<dneighbo> ok so we need to figure out the display issue
<Arturas> yes
<dneighbo> and we are good to go
<Arturas> :|
<Arturas> :)
<dneighbo> then is the next task
<dneighbo> for i18n
<dneighbo> and that is for the applications
<dneighbo> i would like to see us have ONE form file
<dneighbo> that supports all languages
<dneighbo> instead of redoing the .gfd for every language
<Arturas> that is gfd?
<dneighbo> as i understand it the current work
<dneighbo> makes it so the tools support any language you write a translation for (in the file)
<dneighbo> and make it so you can author a form in any language
<dneighbo> but what would be nice 
<dneighbo> is in the form definition (gfd)
<dneighbo> to use entities or gettext or something to mimic the 'substituion' behavoir
<dneighbo> so if i have an contacts.gfd
<dneighbo> i then have a corresponding language files for it
<dneighbo> or something
<Arturas> mhm
<Arturas> pygettext works fine with .py
<dneighbo> other wise to make contacts.gfd i18n i have to copy the form and hand change all the labels etc
<dneighbo> maybe its best i wait for the patch
<dneighbo> as perhaps you have already addressed this and im just not asking correctly
<Arturas> no
<Arturas> don't know how to imagine that
<Arturas> now i've made to support languages
<Arturas> possibility to translate .py files
<dneighbo> just supporting the languages is a HUGE win
<dneighbo> and having our tools support the languages
<Arturas> but haven't thought how to translate .gfd
<dneighbo> we dont have applications ready to ship
<dneighbo> so the .gfd translation is secondary :)
<dneighbo> my gut is since we use xml to do it the xml way which i think is via entities
<Arturas> :)
<dneighbo> so in the .gfd you point to an entity file (which is the lanaguge file)
<Arturas> excellent
<dneighbo> and let the parser do the work of using the entity 
<Arturas> :)
<Arturas> got the idea
<Arturas> fine
<Arturas> parser will need additional modifications
<Arturas> but that won't be a problem
<dneighbo> we could probably even put an entry in gnue.conf
<dneighbo> to set default language code
<dneighbo> 'en'
<dneighbo> or
<dneighbo> 'fr' etc
<Arturas> that would be googd
<Arturas> that would be good
<dneighbo> then if we do entities properly like gfdname-code.ent
<Arturas> because on different platforms
<Arturas> locales are 
<dneighbo> then we could AUTO select 
<Arturas> set-up diffferent
<dneighbo> so if i have default_language='lt'
<dneighbo> in gnue.conf
<Arturas> and even on linux there is a big nightmare
<dneighbo> if i fire up a form it tries toget gfdname-lt.ent 
<Arturas> to have language defiend in gnue.conf
<dneighbo> when making the form
<Arturas> would be easier for all files to get that info
<dneighbo> or somethign like that
<Arturas> yes
<dneighbo> hope im mamking sense
<dneighbo> and i wish jamest and jcater would pipe up with an opinion :)
<dneighbo> s/mamking/making
<Arturas> dneighbo: you're not only making sense, you're making excellent ideas :)
<Arturas> i thought to create a file, something like i18n.txt somewhere in /
<Arturas> or in /doc
<Arturas> with phylosophy and status of i18n
<dneighbo> would be good idea 
<Arturas> what has to be done/what way and etc.
<dneighbo> i will say i am VERY excited to hear we are merely a display problem away from having tools be i18n
<dneighbo> this is SO big for this project
<dneighbo> as the people that have the most interest in GNUe at this point are non English speaking countries
Action: Arturas doesn't want to sound sad (?), but guess that display problem will become the biggest headache
<Arturas> no one no where has no knowledge about i18n symbols in all wxwindows
<dneighbo> Arturas you think it might be a 'configuration' problem on your end
<Arturas> can't exclude that possibility
<Arturas> ~50%
<dneighbo> as if that is the case i wonder if yurik or ra3vat could test it on their configuration
<Arturas> :)
<Arturas> we can try
<Arturas> i have .py file with i18n data on it
<dneighbo> ra3vat_ you here?
<Arturas> could email them
<Yurik> dneighbo: I have no GNUe installed
<Arturas> you have x11
<Arturas> python?
<dneighbo> Yurik well we need to fix that ;)
<Arturas> there is no need for GNUe
<Yurik> dneighbo: fix the fact that GNUe isn't installed? :)
<Arturas> :) :)
<Arturas> Yurik: can i send the file to you? All that it requires is X,python, and wxwindows
<Arturas> ~30 lines
<Arturas> dneighbo: there is 3rd side that i haven't noticed until yesterday
<Arturas> date, time and etc
<Yurik> Arturas: I have no X right now - in Windows now :((
<Arturas> Yurik: no problem :)
<ra3vat_> dneighbo: yes
<Arturas> in USA time is AM/PM, in Lithuania time is in 24:00
<Arturas> and etc.
<Arturas> but maybe leave it after i18n symbols support
<Yurik> Arturas: it's a problem, it's a big problem... you can send me file, but I'm not sure I will have spare time, since I spend all spare time to E/AS :-))))))
<Yurik> 24:00 here, too
<Arturas> Yurik: what is E/AS?
<dneighbo> ra3vat_ woudl you be willing to work with Arturas on i18n for gnue?
<dneighbo> he has come a LONG way
<ra3vat_> sure
<dneighbo> but is having some display issues
<Yurik> Arturas: Enteprise / Automation System
<dneighbo> we are wanting to rule out that its a bad configuration
<dneighbo> if you have X, wxWindows, wxPython
<dneighbo> he will send you a file
<dneighbo> and see if you can get it to work
<dneighbo> if you can we know its a config problem
<dneighbo> if you cant its probably a wxWindows problem :(
<ra3vat_> np
<Arturas> may i have your email?
<dneighbo> Arturas for now lets concentrate on text
<ra3vat_> ds@ics.elcom.ru
<Arturas> dneighbo: i'd imagine priorities something like that:
<dneighbo> in the tools lets just make time 24:00 no AMPM for now (if the tools display time at all)
<Arturas> 1. Finish preparing .py for translations. Trying to fix i18n in forms display.
<Arturas> 2. Prepare .gfd to i18n.
<Arturas> 3. National data (time, numbers, etc.)
<Arturas> ra3vat_: thanks :)
reinhard (~rm@62.47.45.104) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> and then for forms time/numbers we will have to look at masks i think
<Arturas> Hello reinhard
<dneighbo> reinhard you can test this too :)
<dneighbo> Arturas you might have another victim :)
<Arturas> :)
<dneighbo> Arturas has started implementing real i18n into gnue tools
<dneighbo> wants to test a configuration 
<Arturas> or another man, who'll show that i'm an idiot :)
<dneighbo> as wxPython isnt playing nicely

<Yurik> btw, GNUe guys,

<Yurik> I have a proposition of collaboration
<Yurik> Here at E/AS we plan to develop robust directory management
<Yurik> and will start doing it soon
<Yurik> if such kinda functionality is need in GNUe, we can try to share resources (and if our goals in this subject are equal, of course)
Nick change: rm-dinner -> reinhard

<Yurik> the reason why LDAP is ignored: LDAP will make system administrator required to edit its configs; also (most important) - LDAP do not provides changelists, sync-backs and so on
<Yurik> for us it will be a supplementary application, used primarily for configuration issues and tracking things that are out of an object model - like system clients
<Yurik> so, if any interest, feel free to contact me.
<dneighbo> im not sure what you are talking about
<Arturas> jcater: can't get you csv diff - i'm using not cvs, but lincvs, and that things doesn;'t support cvs diff
<dneighbo> when you say 'directory managment'
<dneighbo> Arturas sure you can :)
<dneighbo> go to the file system
<dneighbo> do
<dneighbo> mv fileedited.py newfile.py
<Yurik> dneighbo: I mean facilities to store some portions of data in tree-like directory
<dneighbo> then recheckout that file via cvs
<dneighbo> then do
<dneighbo> diff filedited.py newfile.py 
<dneighbo> and look at results
<dneighbo> then do a 'man diff' to see how to make a patch file
<dneighbo> patch filedited.py newfile.py i18n.patch
<Yurik> will go home shortly
<dneighbo> i think is what you would do 
Action: Yurik will go home shortly
<dneighbo> why not use existing standards?
<Yurik> dneighbo: do you mean LDAP?
<dneighbo> i see gnue 'replicating' this information
<dneighbo> i.e. storing it in SQL
<jcater> Arturas: I can't do a diff
<jcater> that's why I need a diff from you :(
<jcater> as I don't have the same version of cvs as you do I'm sure
<jcater> hmm
<dneighbo> and replicating to LDAP or ActiveDirectory or NDS or such
<dneighbo> i.e. i dont thing gnue is interested in authoring directory services
<dneighbo> we have enough work :)
<Yurik> dneighbo: the reason is above - it should run standalone
<dneighbo> what should run standalone?
<Yurik> dneighbo: ok, no problem :) it was just a proposition
<Yurik> dneighbo: directory management service
<Arturas> jcater: 
<dneighbo> if you write directory services certainly we would be willing to 'replicate' to your directory as much as we are to LDAP or ActiveDirectory etc
<Arturas> doing diff right now
<Arturas> dneighbo: thank you :)
<Arturas> jcater: you need diff <my changes> <original cvs>
<Arturas> jcater: or
<Arturas> jcater: diff <original cvs> <my changes>?
<dneighbo> he needs
<jcater> um
<jcater> not sure :(
<jcater> I'd think the first one
<Arturas> ok :)
<dneighbo> patch original mychanges pathfile.patch
<dneighbo> iirc
<Arturas> as you wish :)
<jcater> um
<jcater> patch applies patches
<jcater> but doesn't create them
<jcater> iirc
<dneighbo> er sorry
<dneighbo> my bad
<dneighbo> correct then on the first one
<jcater> btw, I think we focus on one thing at a time
<jcater> firstly, adding gettext support to our internal py files
<jcater> :)
<Arturas> priority 1
<Arturas> got 10 minutes left
<dneighbo> i think we put things in priority in case you didnt read log jcater
<jcater> the internationalization of dates/times/etc are being worked on wrt the existing Input/Display Masks
<dneighbo> 1. is get py files up to i18n speed which seems to be done
<Arturas> not all fiels
<Arturas> files
<Arturas> currently in /common/src
<dneighbo> 2. getting .gfd files to ahve i18n compatiable -- having display issues
<dneighbo> 3. getting .gfds to do substituions 
<dneighbo> 4. getting date time / numbers sorted out
<dneighbo> Arturas good point, started and proven (not done) :)
<jcater> just out of curiosity
<jcater> how much is this going to kill performance?

<chillywilly> how's it going my man?
<reinhard> well it was quite easy
<nickr> chillywilly: life sucks and then you die, thats how its going
<chillywilly> well, duh

Action: llarens hate mx... etc etc
<llarens> grrr
<dneighbo> mx?
<llarens> somebody knows where is the mx.DateTime module for python 2.1?
<dneighbo> as in mxDateTime
<dneighbo> www.egenix.com
<dneighbo> btw: really should hate python for not having this stuff natively
<llarens> I just downloaded it, but gfdesigner insist that its not here
<dneighbo> having to rely on mx sucks
<dneighbo> you instlal it properly?
<dneighbo> i.e.
<dneighbo> python2.1 setup.py build
<dneighbo> python2.1 setup.py install
<llarens> uh? is not enough with the rpm command?
<llarens> (Im using redhat 7.2)
<dneighbo> i suspect the rpm command is installing it for python1.5.2
<dneighbo> get the source isntead
<dneighbo> http://www.egenix.com/files/python/eGenix-mx-Extensions.html#Download-mxBASE
<llarens> ehhh... I dont think so, is an explicit 2.1 version
<dneighbo> thats problem is redhat packaging is horrid about dependencies
<dneighbo> it doesnt like to let multiple things exist
<dneighbo> llarens i see no OFFICIAL rpms for mx from egenix
<dneighbo> therefore i cant comment 
<llarens> let me see...
<dneighbo> i.e. unlike debian rpm relies on rpms made by peole all over that never check with the whole redhat system :(
<dneighbo> so if its not from the redhat disk its hard to 'trust' it will do what you expect 
<dneighbo> :)
<dneighbo> in the past we have had people get source for
<dneighbo> mxDateTime
<dneighbo> pyXML
<dneighbo> and
<dneighbo> DBdriver of thier choice
<dneighbo> as its less painful than fighting rpm 
<dneighbo> if you are able to get rpms from all those to work please let us know so we can update our rh7.2 install doc
<dneighbo> honestlyh with python ithink
<dneighbo> setup.py install
<dneighbo> is easier than
<dneighbo> rpm -Uvh packagename
<dneighbo> ;)
<llarens> and as I can see, more effectiveeee
<dneighbo> its been SO long since I have installed rpms on my redhat 6.2 box because of the pain :(
<dneighbo> to me its most unfortunate as i like the redhat system
<dneighbo> i like the company redhat
<dneighbo> but the packaging needs work :(
<llarens> well i'll get the mxdat... source and try
<llarens> see later
<reinhard> oop

<reinhard> can't paste 'cause it's different machine

<llarens> jajaaaa I catch the gfdesignerrrrr
<llarens> the mxdatetime resides in /usr/local/lib, and the rest in /usr/lib
<reinhard> hey wait
<llarens> just copyng from one place to other
<reinhard> dneighbo: i did ifup eth0 and now i got it in ifconfig
<dneighbo> cool
<dneighbo> wish you could paste that output
<llarens> (sorry)
<dneighbo> as i wonder if you dont have it as 'auto eth0'
<reinhard> no
<reinhard> i have as
<reinhard> iface eth0
<reinhard> can i do "auto eth0"?
<dneighbo> hold on have to check home box :)
<dneighbo> as here i us dchp
<reinhard> nevermind
<reinhard> is only for playing anyway
<reinhard> and for getting python 2.0 to run
<dneighbo> auto eth0
<dneighbo> iface eth0 inet static
<dneighbo>         address 24.221.112.50
<dneighbo>         netmask 255.255.255.0

<dneighbo>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<dneighbo> so before you iface etho
<dneighbo> er eth0
<reinhard> ah ok
<dneighbo> add auto eth0

<Chipaca> guys, we want to separate the business logic from the forms. Has anyone here thought along those lines, and if so, where is your braindump re that?
<dneighbo> um yes
<dneighbo> that is what GEAS is for :)
<dneighbo> but SPECIFICALLY you can do this in two tier as well
<Chipaca> ummm
<dneighbo> you can put the actual python code outside the form file
<dneighbo> and just do an 'include' 
<dneighbo> so say you had some accounting functions
<dneighbo> you could make accounting.py
<dneighbo> and just include that in forms that needed those functions
<dneighbo> long term GEAS is the way to for this
<dneighbo> GEASv1 does this right now today but has some technical limitations
<Chipaca> ok, my mistake
<dneighbo> and we are addressing the short comings in GEASv2

<llarens> oh
<llarens> eh
<llarens> now it works
<llarens> what a hell its happend ?!
<jamest> no idea
<jamest> :)
<jamest> maybe a bad username/password triggered a bug in our notification?
<llarens> ehh uh i dont know, from mysql console all seemes ok
<llarens> oh, a beautifull master/detail form :)

<chillywilly> well
<chillywilly> I should send those guys a bill now eh?
<jamest> llarens: :)
<chillywilly> instaed of calling tech support for their prop. unix
<chillywilly> they call me
<chillywilly> and I help them out for free
<chillywilly> hrrrm
<chillywilly> it would've cost $6,000
<chillywilly> if they called tech support
<llarens> mmm but stiiill somethins is wrong
<chillywilly> why do I feel like I just got ripped off?
<chillywilly> ;P
<jamest> llarens: what's up?
<llarens> the gfclient show a laarge amount of error lines (uf)
<jamest> ?
<jamest> um
<jamest> i have to run home now but I'll be back ASAP and we'll get this straightened out
jamest (jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) left irc: "[x]chat"
<llarens> the last says (Typeerror: unsuported operand type for +)
<dneighbo> llarens errors or warnings
<llarens> eu?
<dneighbo> um you are using wrong python :)
<llarens> ehh python2.1
Action: chillywilly goes back to reading the c++ binding for odmg
<dneighbo> um unsupported +
<dneighbo> means you are running forms with python 1.5.2
<llarens> uh??
<llarens> lets see
<dneighbo> chillywilly i think the bill should say remit payment to nickr
<chillywilly> no one says I wouldn't split it
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> I ain't like that
<dneighbo> llarens go to the place where your gnue cvs is
<llarens> dneighbo: mmno, i changed the /usr/bin/env python to python2 (nad the other stuff)
<chillywilly> but shit I just saved them $6,000
<chillywilly> with the help of nickr of course ;)
<chillywilly> imagine what one could do if I converted them to using apache and GNU/Linux
<dneighbo> then go to common/scripts
<dneighbo> llarens you have it working i dont know what mmno means
<chillywilly> anyone hear of cobalt?
<chillywilly> is that Free software?
<jcater> what is free software?
<chillywilly> that's the web server they use
<dneighbo> cobol or cobalt
<chillywilly> cobalt
<chillywilly> cobol is alnaguage
<dneighbo> cobalt the server runs linux
<chillywilly> er, langauge
<dneighbo> which is free
<chillywilly> hrrm
<dneighbo> but owned now by sun 
<chillywilly> heheh
<dneighbo> actually cobalt RAQ's can run many unixes
<dneighbo> but ISPs were getting them with linux by the boat load
<chillywilly> hrrm
<chillywilly> yea
<llarens> sorry dneighbo, i want to say; 'no, im supposing using the python2.1' 
<chillywilly> that's probably what they got
<dneighbo> go to common/scripts/
<chillywilly> well the person I was talking to doesn't know dick
<dneighbo> there is a file called gnue-diag.sh
<chillywilly> she's a web master
<dneighbo> chmod it so you can run it
<dneighbo> and run it
<llarens> ok
<chillywilly> I thought she meant cobalt is the web server
<chillywilly> er, sofwtare that is
<chillywilly> but yea
<chillywilly> cobalt rack server would make more sense ;)
<llarens> guau
<dneighbo> crap jcater we need to fix the script :)
<dneighbo> its expecting a real install :)
<dneighbo> Contents of /usr/local/gnue/etc:
<dneighbo>   Directory does not exist! Checking aborted
<dneighbo> when trying to read conf files
<chillywilly> dneighbo: go to it ;_
<dneighbo> i will when i get home
<chillywilly> what about the top level devel script?
<dneighbo> as i use this script a lot
<chillywilly> to install from cvs
<dneighbo> this isnt about installing its for troubleshooting
<chillywilly> oh
<dneighbo> llarens can you paste the python2.1 section here
<chillywilly> oh that one that probes python
<chillywilly> but doesn't the devel script call it?
<dneighbo> should look something like

<llarens> lets see
<chillywilly> hrrrm, why does that seem so autoconf like ;)
<dneighbo> then you will need to change gfcvs, gfdes etc (wherever you put them) proably ~/bin/
<dneighbo> and edit them to say
<dneighbo>      /usr/bin/python2.1 /home/dneighbo/downloads/gnue-cvs-2002-03-07/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/forms/GFClient.py $*
<chillywilly> I don't get it 
<jcater> chillywilly: that's not an installation/configuration script, but a diagnostic tool for us tech support people :)
<dneighbo> only where /usr/bin/python2.1 is the location of your python
<chillywilly> jcater: heheh, sure
<llarens> oh ho, I have TWO python section
<dneighbo> right you should have more than one
<chillywilly> well I really need to pund out this api spec ;)
<dneighbo> as you have python1.5.2 and python2.1
<chillywilly> as it is late now
<dneighbo> im just interested in the one you THINK you are using :)
Action: chillywilly should know better then to say he will get something done on the weekend
<dneighbo> so we can verify everythign is good and installed
<jcater> chillywilly: api for what?
<dneighbo> then we will edit gfcvs, gfdes
<dneighbo> geasv2 i suppose?
<chillywilly> geas client api
<jcater> um
<chillywilly> yep, I want to propose soem ideas anyway and see what everyone thinks
<jcater> personally
<chillywilly> taking some freom reinhard's and building on that
<jcater> I think we are starting at the wrong end of the geas problem
<dneighbo> i agree
<chillywilly> well....
<dneighbo> i think in someways it might be best to take what we have
<dneighbo> and see what it would take to make it use common
<dneighbo> and common rpc
<chillywilly> the client api needs transaction support though
<dneighbo> and slowly clean up as we go
<chillywilly> they way I see it
<chillywilly> you don't do anything without using a transaction object
<dneighbo> but i dont know much
<dneighbo> a rewrite sounds good too
<llarens> emm seemes that mysql module not found (but ASK ME for a user & pass (?))
<dneighbo> llarens well i still think its executing wrong python for forms
<jcater> chillywilly: imho, we should start out with what we want the gcd files to look like
<dneighbo> if you are getting += unstupported
<chillywilly> besides where's the best place to go for a more fully intergated GNUe ;)
<dneighbo> can you look at gfcvs and gfdes files for me?
<chillywilly> jcater: I'd like them to look like ODL files
<jcater> then make a converter to generate the relational backend sql that creates the tables
<jcater> I don't really give a damn what they look like
<jcater> just that we need to look at that first :)
<dneighbo> and tell me what is there for python like what i pasted above?
<chillywilly> that's fine
<jcater> dneighbo: I think we need to add the Python version number to the -d output of the tools
<jcater> what do you think?
<jcater> :)
Action: jcater already knows the answer to that
<dneighbo> yes agree
<llarens> wait wait all this mess is because i dont want to compile from te sources
<dneighbo> no
<chillywilly> http://news.gnome.org/1016562428/
<chillywilly> hehe
<dneighbo> im not certain thats the problem llarens 
<chillywilly> have you seen this hacker?
<chillywilly> ;P
<llarens> ups
<dneighbo> you shouldnt have to cmpile from sources
<dneighbo> cept egenix and pyxml (and thats just cause its easier than fighting rpms)
<dneighbo> chillywilly thanks for that link
<dneighbo> this is good reason for copyright assignment as well
<dneighbo> only not to change license
<dneighbo> but imagine if the copyright was in question
<dneighbo> and they had to forfiet their defenese
<dneighbo> because they couldnt find hacker X
<dneighbo> ask me this is just sloppy legal work on mozilla's part
<chillywilly> not to mentiona  big pain in the ass
<chillywilly> ;)
<dneighbo> llarens you still here?
<llarens> uep?
<llarens> yes, but this f****** xchat dont let me to paste the file
<llarens> mail it?
<chillywilly> use the middle mouse button or click both of them
<chillywilly> llarens: or you can do /exec -o cat file ;)
<llarens> (auch, feature intentionallu deactivated ;)
<llarens> lo que?
<chillywilly> do you guys no EBNF?
<dneighbo> not too worried about pasting it
<dneighbo> just tell me what is in gfcvs, gfdes
<chillywilly> I mena if I had the EBNF for ODl would it make sense to yall?
<jcater> dneighbo: for future use, the cvs tools will now show the underlying python version when run with -d1
<chillywilly> er, ODL
<dneighbo> the line after PYTHONPATH=
<jcater> doesn't help today, but someday :)
<dneighbo> depends llarens you running cvs?
<dneighbo> if so from cvs or from a nightly
<llarens> nuuu, i just downloaded a snapshot
<llarens> remember: im a poor mediocre developer from a third world country :)
<dneighbo> gotcha
<dneighbo> for now if you can just type the line after PYTHONPATH=
<llarens> (and becoming to miss the old good days of btrieve/clipper)
<dneighbo> from gfcvs
<dneighbo> hmm in some fashions gnue will be simliar to clipper for you
<dneighbo> jcater you ever get patch from arturas?
<dneighbo> llarens which third world coutnry you from?
<dneighbo> kansas?
<dneighbo> er did i say that ;)
<jcater> dneighbo: yes
<llarens> arrrrr
<jcater> it's what I expected to see
<llarens> yentinaa
<jcater> a lot of _() usage
<jcater> which is the standard gettext stuff for python
<dneighbo> what is _() you mean method calls
<jcater> um
<dneighbo> or is _() something special
<jcater> to use gettext in python
<jcater> instead of doing a 
<jcater> print "Derek is a dumbass"
<jcater> you would do
<jcater> print _("Derek is a dumbass")
<jcater> it's a special method
<dneighbo> gotcha
<dneighbo> i started thinking about this
<jcater> :)
<llarens> or: argentina :)
<dneighbo> do we really need all the lines to do this?
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> i.e. or can we assume 'developers' will speak english
<jcater> that's one of my issues
<dneighbo> so only 'error' type messages
<jcater> he converted a lot of stuff
<dneighbo> should we convert
<jcater> that I don;t think needed converting
<jcater> like our debugging print statements
<dneighbo> well some of these maybe we do want converted?
<dneighbo> the ones that run when you dont choose a 'leve'
<jcater> I think only text the enduser will see should be translated myself
<dneighbo> er level
<dneighbo> right i agree
<jcater> well, some perhaps
<dneighbo> thats what i mean by any messages that get put out w/o debugging turned on
<jcater> maybe -d1 or -d2 level stuff
<jcater> but anything higher up is really stuff for jamest and my use
<jcater> -d1 might be useful translated
<dneighbo> btw: i think he is only doing what we told him so he probably woudl agree with us :)
<jcater> not sure
<dneighbo> as we said make it i18n
<jcater> my main hangup isn't laziness on jamest and my part
<dneighbo> at a minimum --help needs to be gettext
<dneighbo> speed
<jcater> it's that the more we use _() for, the
<jcater> more translators will have to translate
<jcater> and I don't want to waste their time on frivolous debugging statements
<jcater> oh, and speed :)
<dneighbo> i think a good rule of thumb is developer out put should be english only (like the code)
<dneighbo> end user output should be i18n
<dneighbo> the hard thing is defining developer vs. enduser :)
<dneighbo> i.e. most of the time its crystal clear but not always :)
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> :(
<llarens> mm i dont found PYTHONPATH
<dneighbo> in gfcvs?
<dneighbo> your gfcvs should look similar to
<dneighbo> dneighbo@wright:~/bin$ less gfcvs0307 
<dneighbo> #!/bin/sh
<dneighbo>      if [ "z$GNUE_CONNECTIONS" = "z" ]

<dneighbo>   
<dneighbo> dneighbo@wright:~/bin$      
<dneighbo> im interested in what you line says where mine is /usr/bin/python2.1
<dneighbo> what is yours?
Action: dneighbo is also curious as to method you installed cvs 
<dneighbo> from root gnue cvs dir did you run setup.py install or did you run that for each tool
<llarens> seeing...
<dneighbo> jcater regardless im tickled that we have the support htere so we are forced to make a choice
<dneighbo> so llarens and the others from argentina can make native forms :)
<dneighbo> plus jamest can make those ks locales he's been crying for so his forms feel 'right'
<jcater> I can do my TN versions too
<dneighbo> rofl

<dneighbo> i can see the inventory screen now

<dneighbo> gnucash actually seemed ok

<nickr> are you kidding?
Action: dneighbo needs to get cvs version running again only this time with postgres db
<dneighbo> so i can use gnue
<nickr> gnucast has sweet reporting
<dneighbo> nickr: im not kidding
<dneighbo> if you know how to make good reports with gnucash please clue me in
<nickr> write a reports plugin for gnucash so they can interoperate ;)
<dneighbo> ah actually its not so bad
<dneighbo> just shitty ui
<dneighbo> i ws going to say you couldnt even choose date ranges
<nickr> complain :)
<dneighbo> but thats not true you just have to find the 'options' button
<nickr> or redesign the ui
<dneighbo> never seen a product like this that didnt do reports more 'wizard' like
<nickr> yea
<dneighbo> nickr: have you dealt with gnucash folks or code?
<nickr> well its still up-and-comming
<nickr> no
<dneighbo> easy is not in their VOCABULARY
<nickr> I just dispense advice at random
<dneighbo> example you extend gnucash with SCHEME (like thtat is popular for end users that arent MIT grads)
<dneighbo> and code
<dneighbo> look at the source some time
<dneighbo> hell look at the dependencies :)
<dneighbo> that said i just want a pfm (personal finance manager) that works
<dneighbo> they seem to be providing one so im not out to knock them :
<nickr> I thought they added python to their extension languages
<nickr> ah
<nickr> perl
<nickr> well thats easier than guile at least :)
<nickr> guile as actually really easy
<dneighbo> um actually the have perl
<dneighbo> but no one has used it :)
<dneighbo> and its no longer maintained :)
<nickr> its just that most people learn procedural languages instead of functional
<dneighbo> nickr: i wasnt knocking scheme
<dneighbo> my comment was unless you are an MIT grad
<dneighbo> meaning most folks other than MIT/Berkley grads are really learning functional programming :)
<nickr> many colleges teach functionaly programming in the CS program
<nickr> well UIUC does in additon to those you named at least
<nickr> :)
<nickr> the only reason I know scheeme is that my exgf went to UIUC aond she gave me her copy of tThe little Schemer

<dneighbo> hmm actually the reporting is pretty ok
<dneighbo> now i just need to corral them into adding budgeting
<dneighbo> nickr: yes many do
<dneighbo> i shouldnt say MIT students
<dneighbo> but rather computer science students
<dneighbo> though thats too general
<dneighbo> as only a small percentage of them get more than a brief introduction
<nickr> yea, it really depends on how 'serious' the CS program is
<nickr> if they are *scientists*, then they learn scheme
<nickr> else they are very procedural oriented
<dneighbo> you know what its just kick butt i think i finally for REAL am totally windows free
<nickr> hehe
<dneighbo> though i suppose i need to get camera and scanner working to really say that
<nickr> those are easy
<dneighbo> but i havent had windows installed for over a month or so
<nickr> they are either supported or not
<dneighbo> and i have financials
<dneighbo> nice color reports printing
<dneighbo> its just so nice
<dneighbo> and of course there is frozen bubble :)
<nickr> of course. ;)
<nickr> you should install cuyo for when you get tired of frozen bubble
<dneighbo> honestly if debian came installed on an oem pc
<dneighbo> i think normal home users could use it without much problem
<nickr> yea
<nickr> definitely
<nickr> especially if it had some sort of auto fix/auto update thing
<nickr> as part of the purchase price
<dneighbo> especially if they have never been infected w/ having to use windows
<nickr> heh
<nickr> yea
<nickr> debian is really weird
<nickr> its like a service of quality control for all software in existance
<nickr> most people are used to going to a vendor and downloading the software
<nickr> debian does that part for you
<nickr> and indexes it
<nickr> its so strange.

<jcater> hmm
<jcater> well, if I were you
<jcater> (which I'm not)

<jcater> on the grounds that you can't get the reports right
<jcater> not sure if they'd buy that or not

<dneighbo> i dont have quicken installed anymore so i cant look at one of thier reports to explain what im after
<dneighbo> but i think they put the liabilites stuff under expense reports or somehting
<dneighbo> or maybe not, i suppose i just did them as 'categories' or expenses
<dneighbo> but i know thats not correct way to do accounting
<jcater> I'm off
<jcater> please read my reports email :)
<jcater> if those damn gnu servers will ever send it on

<dneighbo> so i dont get real depiction of what im 'spending'
<dneighbo> i could make them just expense accounts but that doesnt seem correct
<dneighbo> im half way remember you have to have an 'middle man'
<dneighbo> so you have an expense account you book the charge to
<jamest> lindsay isn't sure
<dneighbo> then move from the expense account to the liability account
<dneighbo> so that you see the 'payment' as an expense
<dneighbo> but the liability account is still intact for a balance sheet
<dneighbo> i think being a dumb quicken user was more simple :)
<dneighbo> i think i just got evil with my bad self
<dneighbo> now a mortage payment is 4 transactions
<dneighbo> in: mortgage account
<dneighbo> out: checking account
<dneighbo> in: mortgage loan (liability)
<dneighbo> out: mortgage account (expense)
<dneighbo> now to see how that shows up on the expense report
<dneighbo> as suspected in hindsight that makes the mortgage (expense) zero so that doesnt solve problem
<dneighbo> f it 
<dneighbo> for now im moving them to expense accounts and having no liabilities so i can run rerpots 
<nickr> isn't that how its supposed to be structuerd?
Nick change: chillywilly_ -> chillywilly
<chillywilly> every transaction has 2 entries
<chillywilly> you are always transferring form one accoutn to the other

<dneighbo> chillywilly: im aware of that
<chillywilly> whatever, dude
<chillywilly> you complain too much
<dneighbo> i cant get credit card payment or loan payments to show on an 'expenditure' report
<dneighbo> to show my outflow amounts
<dneighbo> and your point is?
<dneighbo> i moved my loans to expense accounts since im not really tracking the 'loan' anyhow
<dneighbo> which at least recovered some items
<dneighbo> but the credit cards i had no such luck
<chillywilly> point is wait until dres gets here and go to the source ;)
<chillywilly> or drag your happy ass over to #gnucash
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> in fact I found them to be very helpful wehn I first started using it
<chillywilly> they held my hand

<dtm> talk about a paradigm shift
<nickr> ouch

<Chipaca> no, I mean I did grep -r -i create.*database in gnue and all I found were some samples and some stuff in geas
<jamest> ah
<jamest> geas autocreated the db's, when not using geas we don't have any complete system
<Chipaca> shoot
<jamest> <bang!>
Action: Chipaca tries to laugh, but fails
<jamest> :)
<Chipaca> could you send me a schema dump of the db so we can try the stuff out wo geas?
<jamest> i don't have anything like that that could be used
<jamest> which part are you interested in?
<jamest> complete apps? the tool themselves? other?

<Chipaca> sheiße
<jamest> i think there are some very crude things in the works
<jamest> more as samples of the tools though
<jamest> at one time I swore I heard dneighbo talk about using SQL*Ledger schema w/ a gnue front end as a sample
<jamest> but I'm not sure if that was something someone did or something someone was thinking about doing

<Chipaca> yeap
<Chipaca> why?

<Chipaca> yes, it just works (tm) :)

<yogurt2unge> jamest: where is SQL*Ledger?
<Chipaca> ...
<jamest> http://www.sql-ledger.org/
<Chipaca> so what you're telling me is that there is no standard schema for business apps?
<Chipaca> or is in a whitepaper somewhere and we just have to implement it?
<Chipaca> we've got to start with the schema [sounds like a name for a song]
<jamest> :)
<jamest> neilt and others have been defining one in geas's gcd language 
<jamest> it's in the packages dir

<Arturas> do you have root access?

<klog> aah sucks
<nickr> create table satan ( 
<klog> jamest
<Chipaca> who is responsible for the schema currently in the .gcd files ?
<klog> howcome you've got a "real work" and not your own business?
<jamest> because gnue is my hobby
<jamest> it wouldn't be as fun otherwise
<klog> why only a hobby?
<klog> its business systems
<Chipaca> specifically, who should I tear down a strip for ./packages/finance/ar/classes/invoice.gcd ?
<jamest> klog: a quick read thru it  makes me think it's somewhat like GNUe
<klog> yes
<jamest> s/java/python
<klog> same goals
<jamest> s/pixel based ui/char based ui
<jamest> the navigation system seems farther along (if this is a working product)
<klog> but there were a few things that i thought were missing with gnue
<klog> yes
<klog> its hierarchy
<klog> instead of flat space
<klog> i'm working on security currently, security clearances, sensitivity labels, integrity, etc.
<klog> i thought maybe there's a way to interoperate with gnue
<klog> or even merge code 100%
<klog> take best of all, make opensource software of it
<jamest> hmmm
<nickr> I personally would think interoperating security mechanisms would be a good thing
<dneighbo> Chipaca i will say this again
<dneighbo> THE GCDS WERE WRITTEN TO BE READ BY OBJECTS
<Chipaca> YES OK
<dneighbo> thusly the schemas are evil and not to be used without the objects
<Chipaca> I GOT THAT
<Chipaca> ugh
<dneighbo> i would avoid the gcd's at almost all costs at this point :)
<dneighbo> unless you are willing to wait for GEASv2
<dneighbo> not trying to be a jerk just trying to reduce your frustrations
<Chipaca> I have a problem then: I need to create a schema that will be useful with geasv2
<jamest> klog: it's an interesting idea for sure
<dneighbo> klog looking now
<jamest> lots of people here will have things to say about it
<dneighbo> from just what i read here
<jamest> dneighbo is one of them :)
<klog> i dont care if some code is lost in the process
<dneighbo> a. we are not java fans, but that doesnt rule interoperation or merging out
<klog> its evolution, evolution means code dies, other lives
<jamest> unless someone can figure out a way to keep him quiet.....we're all out of ideas on that though 
<dneighbo> b. we are all about 'free software' and thus on a whole we dont mesh with 'open source' ideology always
<nickr> we haven't tried tying him up and putting him in the closet yet
<dneighbo> i.e. even if technically all things for a merger line up if the philosphical differences are too great all is lost
<dneighbo> that said giong to go read the page
<klog> what is diff between free software and opensource?
Action: Chipaca holds his head
<klog> policies are not a problem
<klog> dneigh, we had talks a while ago
<klog> i had time to think of this
<dneighbo> klog the differences are in philosphy
<dneighbo> open source is a saying giving source code away is good for business and helps the business be more profitable
<dneighbo> free software is saying sharing is good (giving source is part of sharing) and if that helps a business and profits great if not too bad
<klog> ok
<Chipaca> dneighbo: you should insert some punctuation now and then: as in '...profits, great; if not, too bad' or something like that
<Chipaca> :)
<klog> how can you give away source while restricting people from giving away free
<dneighbo> see this is the philosphy difference i speak of :)
<klog> does opensource not imply most likely free?
<nickr> no
drochaid (~drochaid@pc2-kirk2-0-cust175.ren.cable.ntl.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> im not going to be militant like rms and say that one can not use term opensource or die an untimely death
<dneighbo> just saying when i hear you say opensource
<nickr> although the OSI approved licenses re mostly free software

<dneighbo> my first thought is that our ideleogies are probably vastly different
<klog> i am unable to grab the difference
<dneighbo> and why i stated if the philosphy of the two projects dont mesh
<klog> i am for 0 restriction
<dneighbo> we are not
<dneighbo> a real world example
<klog> free software means cannot make people pay for it also?
<dneighbo> people say that america is 'free' correct
<dneighbo> but i cant walk to the cube next to me and kill someone
<dneighbo> or i will go to JAIL
<dneighbo> so am i free or not?
<dneighbo> technically i am NOT free to do what i want
<klog> ok but...
<dneighbo> free software as in GPL is the same way
<nickr> dneighbo: you are free to do that as long as you choose to take the punishment
<klog> ok
<dneighbo> you are free to do what you want as long as you dont harm the collective
<dneighbo> nickr right just as i can violate the GPL if i choose to suffer an consequences
<nickr> dneighbo: yep.
<klog> see free soft as opposed to open source not only implies obligation of providing source with software but also provide software at no cost?
<dneighbo> klog we are not saying you cant make money with free software
<dneighbo> we are not saying you cant make commercial free software
<dneighbo> no it does not imply that to m
<dneighbo> e
<nickr> klog: thecre are two meanings of free which you are mixing up
<dneighbo> HOWEVER in many ways it DOES mean that
<klog> no i understand 'free of charge' and 'free of ownership'
<dneighbo> because if i charge nickr $100 for my software
<dneighbo> he has the right to put it on his web site for free
<klog> opensource being 'free of ownership' as i know it
<dneighbo> in which case people probably will stop giving me $100 for it
<nickr> klog: uh no
<nickr> klog: you are very, very mistaken
<klog> ok then
<klog> i misused term opensource
<nickr> public domain is 'free of ownership' eg, without owner
Action: Chipaca notes this is getting OFF TOPIC
<dneighbo> nickr correct even free software has owners :)
<dneighbo> Chipaca yes
<nickr> free software is 'freedom of usage'
<dneighbo> but if klog is interested in making a contribution or merging software
<drochaid> nickr: is public domain not that the entire public are the owners, rather than no owner?
<klog> then make software free software
<dneighbo> its important we are on same page :)
<jcater> actually, public domain isn't free of ownership
<jcater> but ownership is granted to the public good
<klog> really
<nickr> well its as close to free of ownership as can be had
<klog> i dont fucking care
<drochaid> jcater: roughly what I said
<klog> i want to code
<klog> !
<dneighbo> klog honestly that is an acceptable answer
<jcater> drochaid: sorry, missed your comment
<drochaid> heh
<dneighbo> in fact its the answer many people here have
<jcater> yeah, what drochaid said :)
<Chipaca> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ no flames beynod this line ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<dneighbo> and there isnt anything wrong with it
<nickr> sure.
<Chipaca> :)
<dneighbo> now back to subject
<Chipaca> yeah, schemas and their suckiness
<dneighbo> what were your thoughts klog on interoperating/merging or such?
<Chipaca> :)
<nickr> I don't think they need to buy into all the philosophy as long as they agree to adhere to it in the context of that philosophy
<nickr> imho.
<dneighbo> Chipaca i want more information with what you guys are doing with gnue :)
<dneighbo> so maybe we can help you guys out and in the process get some gnue packages released :)
<dneighbo> nickr correct, just making sure they dont OPPOSE it
<klog> dneigh: tep current status is what is described on the webpage
<Chipaca> ok, we'll try to summarize it and send it to gnue-devel, ok?
<Chipaca> (it's big)
<jcater> sigh
<dneighbo> yes that is fine
<jcater> are the gnu mailing lists down for anyone else?
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left irc: "[x]chat"
<jcater> ah, they're back!
<dneighbo> klog from the sounds of it we would love to have you work on geas v2
<dneighbo> as it seems this praefectus seems very similar to it
<nickr> i had an interesting idea
<klog> a few things that i believe should be in gnue
<dneighbo> if that isnt what you had in mind certainly you could make our forms engine, reporting engine etc talk to praefectus
<nickr> why not use python syntax to describe schemas and triggers in gaes?
<klog> 1) hierarchy of objects (is there?), 2) trusted security mecanisms
<Chipaca> gnue-dev would be the right list, no? or just plain gnue?
<dneighbo> nickr too languages specific i think xml will be better
<nickr> dneighbo: well, it would simplify a prototype AND it is easy enough to parse that you can impliment it yourself in other languages.
<dneighbo> i think xml is probably easier all around as we have good parser built and such
<nickr> its also not as balky and ugly as xml ;)
<dneighbo> and makes it REALLY easy to use designer
<dneighbo> with MINIMAL hassle
<Chipaca> yes, by all means stick with XML, *please*
<dneighbo> nickr if i didnt forsee a visual tool for object creation, maintenance i would 100% agree with you
<klog> dneigh: all that is xml, should work on making interoperability between gnue and praefectus
<dneighbo> klog im a blunt guy so here is my issue
<klog> and if you plan to use protocol such as soap for distributed objects, than that could be too
<nickr> dneighbo: maybe a thing that transforms something in sort of a psuedopython into xml hehe
<dneighbo> doing two of the same thing but making them interoperate when they are both small is silly to me
<nickr> that'd be easy enough.
<klog> me too but
<dneighbo> i.e. we BOTH woudl get a lot farther doing one project instead of two that interoperate
<klog> i dont wanna drop java
<dneighbo> and any time spent on interoperation
<dneighbo> is time lost to bring products forward
<klog> true
<dneighbo> so its really hard for me to justify spending the time
<dneighbo> i dont mean this rudely
<dneighbo> im just trying to be practical
<klog> no, you're 100% right
<klog> geas = python, right?
<dneighbo> i know that here java is not liked much
<dneighbo> which makes its a real issue
<dneighbo> klog current geas(v1) == C w/ C and python capable object method code
<dneighbo> future geas(v2) == python w/ python capable object method code
<dneighbo> v1 == only CORBA
<klog> why you plan to replace C with python?
<dneighbo> v2 == any RPC (xml-rpc, soap, corba) etc etc
<dneighbo> because we have somethign called gnue-common in python
<dneighbo> that handles rpc abstraction, database abstraction, xml parsing etc
<dneighbo> that is rather tested and advanced
<klog> hum ok
<dneighbo> and coding in python is MUCH more maintainable and quicker
<klog> and is python performance good?
<dneighbo> as good as java's
<dneighbo> no one tries to kid someone that its as fast as C
<klog> wouldnt hurt me learning a new language though ;)
<nickr> butter than java's in my experience.
<dneighbo> but converting python code to C isnt a huge jump
<dneighbo> so if we start seeing bottlenecks
<dneighbo> we convert those pieces to C
<dneighbo> for now maintainablity is more important than speed to us
<dneighbo> (as is for java developers)
<klog> you have experience of treating large amount of data with geasv2?
<dneighbo> as in enterprise development speed of development and maintainability is much higher cost than the speed at which it runs
<dneighbo> we have experience from geasv1
<dneighbo> our gnue-common
<dneighbo> regularly is pulling about 3million records off an OS/390 mainframe running IBM DB2
<nickr> I would think in enterprise development, you could get huge metal
<klog> and is geas object management hierarchy based?
<klog> would you have any interest for that, and strong security?
<klog> really is about seeing where i could help
<klog> hierachy = tons of interesting things it could bring
<klog> authority spaces, common namespace between multiple object servers, etc.
<nickr> I've heard tell that RBAC is desired
<klog> geas could be b2 graded ;)
<klog> tcsec
<nickr> only if the undelying OS is also b2, no?
<klog> probably implied
Action: nickr wonders if gnue runs on VMS
<klog> should see, comparer to trusted oracle
<klog> compared to
<jcater> hehe
<jcater> that's an oxymoron
<jcater> "trusted oracle"
<nickr> 'trusted oracle'
<nickr> hhe
<nickr> yea
<klog> ;)
<klog> trusted oracle (intl version), trusted oracle (us version)
<nickr> Crusted Oracle
<nickr> It'd be nice to have OS-level RBAC
<klog> also want to see if there are possibilities of profitable business to be made on services, training, etc.
<nickr> maybe the Hurd can have that.
<klog> security not meant to be os-level anymore
<nickr> Heh.
<nickr> I'd settle for being able to group 'groups' into other gorups
<nickr> so I coul/d say 'desktop users' all are in group 'audio, video, cdr'
<klog> hierarchy user management
<nickr> indeed
Action: nickr puts it on his hurd todo list.
jbailey (jbailey@HSE-Toronto-ppp319327.sympatico.ca) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<nickr> jeff!
<nickr> oh
<nickr> quit
<nickr> heh
Action: nickr reads more carefully.
<dneighbo> hold up
<dneighbo> two issues
<dneighbo> a. we are interested in security specifically RBAC
<dneighbo> b. we are NOT willing to dicate an OS one needs to run GNUe
<dneighbo> there was a proposal a rather nice one
<dneighbo> about having SELinux do all security from OS level
<dneighbo> but we are not willing to force one to use SE/Linux
<klog> do all security from os level?
<nickr> dneighbo: I wasn't referring to gnue specificly
<klog> selinux is not meant to do security for your application
<jcater> I'm one for "pluggable" everything
<dneighbo> as to hierarchies chilly or reinhard would be best to ask specifics
<jcater> be it "pluggable security", etc
<dneighbo> klog you would have to read stan's proposal
<jcater> hey, I haven't seen sklein in a while
<dneighbo> he is around
<dneighbo> wants marketing material for FOSE
<klog> is selinux even aware of gnue object concepts?
<dneighbo> or whatever that DC based outfit is
<klog> fose
<klog> remembers me smtn
<klog> selinux related?
<dneighbo> klog one of the philophies of gnue is 
<dneighbo> we dont try to impose things
<dneighbo> even security wise
<dneighbo> as while a bank wants rock hard security
<dneighbo> someone in a small shop may not want the hassle
<klog> good philosophy
<klog> pluggable would be a good thing
<klog> pluggable authentication, access control and audit
<Chipaca> ok, sent email to gnue-dev :)
Action: dneighbo does happy dance
<dneighbo> its in spanish right Chipaca 
<dneighbo> ;)
<dneighbo> j/k
<dneighbo> how many on your development team
<dneighbo> klog: as to learning python
<dneighbo> if you know C/C++/Java its hardly called 'learning'
<klog> i fear python
<dneighbo> it almost just comes naturally :)
<klog> i would have prefered C
<klog> cause the day you introduce security
<dneighbo> i think (correct me if im wrong)
<dneighbo> we have had several C die hards in here
<klog> everything changes in terms of performance
<dneighbo> that went to python kicking and screaming
<nickr> I find C programming profoundly satisfying and incredibly detious
<dneighbo> and almost every single one of them hasnt touched C since learning python
<nickr> tedious
<jcater> klog: I'm not sure that's actually an argument for or against python
<jcater> as it'
<dneighbo> as to speed
<dneighbo> so java would be faster?
<klog> nop
<jcater> as it's easy to add functionality to python later on and not affect stability
<dneighbo> and if you went from java to C for security thats nuts
<klog> actually i was thinking about a rewrite
<klog> in C
<dneighbo> C forces you to manage memory and such
<jcater> I would fear, greatly fear, adding features post-mortem to C
<dneighbo> and MUCH more susceptible to buffer overflows and such
<dneighbo> and yes i know the argument that good C programming doesnt have htis issue
<dneighbo> but i like to counter with well bad java/python/etc dont have it
<klog> i mean, with acls that have hierarchical relations, compartments and security clearances to verify, audit trails to emit, it quickly adds up in terms of performance
<dneighbo> and im not gonna bank on every snippet of code being 'good' :)
<dneighbo> certainly
<nickr> nbah
<Chipaca> dneighbo: nope
<Chipaca> dneighbo: erm I mean nope, it's not in spanish
<nickr> procedural languagse are so 1945, get with the times, scheme man!
<dneighbo> but as stated if it gets too slow its easy to move to C parts that need faster
<Chipaca> dneighbo: right now it's 5 of us
<dneighbo> i.e. we think of python as a good prototyping language
<dneighbo> that is suitable for real work as well
<dneighbo> but we arent unwilling to drop to C when performance is an issue
<dneighbo> our analogy is we ahve some C code
<dneighbo> that is slower than same code in python
<dneighbo> because it wasnt coded as optimally
<dneighbo> so just because you choose a faster language doesnt mean faster code :)
<dneighbo> we would rather implement in something that is easy to use and maintain
<dneighbo> and if we find it slow
<dneighbo> profile it
<dneighbo> try to get more optimization
<nickr> the hardest part of python is breaking C habits and structuring it like a python program.
<dneighbo> if its too slow still refactor into C
<dneighbo> so far we havent had to do that
<klog> do you think there is a really opportunity to build businesses around gnue?
<klog> that would provide gnue-related services?
<nickr> probably consulting
<Chipaca> Well we certainly think so :)
<klog> with closed source software, i'm alone
<klog> most likely will never market the software since lack of time and capital
<klog> free software, if there is a possibility to build something real
<klog> with large network of people around it, than i'm in ;)
<nickr> yea
<nickr> nice community
<nickr> very fzzy
<Chipaca> heh
<nickr> fuzzy not fizzy
<nickr> well some of them are fizzy
<nickr> they need to shower more.
Action: Chipaca looks at the ceiling
<nickr> hehe
<nickr> I wonder how the CORBA bindings are for Scheme
<klog> any business people here? with studies in business?
<jamest> i think that's neilt's and dneighbo's focus
<jamest> not mine :)
<klog> ok
<jamest> they are tech people turned managers or something
<jamest> scary :)
<nickr> freak out
<jamest> or is that managers turned tech people
<jamest> hmmmm
<jcater> rofl
<drochaid> <cough> what you saying about us business type peeps? ;P
<nickr> drochaid: they smell like cheap aftershave, thats all I'm saying. Its horrible.
<klog> i turn business too
<klog> finance/commerce
Action: drochaid smacks nickr
<klog> no shame in that, more tech people do this, more intelligent business people
<Chipaca> nickr: you've got it wrong: they smell like *expensive*, cheap-smelling aftershave
<drochaid> lol Chipaca
<nickr> hahaha
<nickr> ye, the MBAs do
<jamest> :)
<drochaid> master of business arseups?
<drochaid> oops .. just changed side ;)
<nickr> better than smelling like coffee and sweat I guess
<nickr> drochaid: exacto
Action: Chipaca wonders if gnue-dev is moderated
<jamest> nothing is moderated
<nickr> where are the gnue lists controlled? I want to subscribe to all of them
<nickr> I don't get enough interesting email
<dneighbo> sorry was gone
Action: Chipaca wonders where his email went, then
<jamest> mail.gnu.org
<dneighbo> typically a software house has following items
<jamest> the fsf mail servers seem to be down
<Chipaca> nickr: subscribe to debian-user
<dneighbo> a. install
<dneighbo> b. training
<dneighbo> c. bug fixes
<nickr> Chipaca: INTERESTING email
<dneighbo> d. feature enhancements
<dneighbo> e. procedural support
<dneighbo> f. consulting
<dneighbo> i think for gnue because its complex there is money to be made in
<dneighbo> a. instaling the software
<nickr> manuals? boxes? support?
<dneighbo> b. in training people
<dneighbo> bug fixes should not hold revenue
<dneighbo> feature enhancements because its free software are going to be less revenue generating
<nickr> I would think gnue would have a big money in 'customization'
<dneighbo> procedurel support lots harder to  get money for
<dneighbo> i think most of the money will be in
<dneighbo> customization(feature enhancement)
<dneighbo> and
<dneighbo> consulting
<dneighbo> but install and training revenues should be there
<klog> sounds good
<dneighbo> i see c adn e falling into the 'support contract'
<dneighbo> so in GNUe scenario
<dneighbo> gnue is free
<dneighbo> but if you want me to install it for you
<dneighbo> it costs X to install
<dneighbo> oh you want to convert your data
<Chipaca> dneighbo: heh, I charge W!
<dneighbo> we do that at a fee of X per hour
<dneighbo> now if you want someone to call for support, procedure issues, bug fixes
<dneighbo> we offer a year long contract for X
<jcater> of course, to stay on the community's good side, we'd expect some code contributions back into our project if you're gonna profit off of our hard work
<jcater> :)
<jcater> just a minor observation
<dneighbo> i.e. i dont think the SAPs ORACLEs etc are making thier bank on licensing fees alone
<dneighbo> example we bought a package recently
<dneighbo> the licensing was 125,000
<klog> jcater: i think it should not be minor, but unfortunately hard to enforce
<dneighbo> but they paid 240,000 for consulting, training and implementation
<dneighbo> and we pay 25k per year for support/upgrades
<drochaid> jcater: and for those of us who profit from your work but have no coding skill whatsoever?
<jcater> donuts
<drochaid> lol
<klog> porn
<drochaid> and I'm guessing pizza for dneighbo ;)
<dneighbo> klog we are food addicts not sex addicts
<dneighbo> dots, pizza, donuts etc
<dneighbo> will do fine
<nickr> I'd settle for one of those trips into low earth orbit
<dneighbo> klog long of short of it
Action: Chipaca works for hardware
<klog> dneigh: guess we could distribute "license" profit on services profit
<dneighbo> i think companies that rally around gnue (or any project)
<klog> indirectly
<dneighbo> burden the development cost
<klog> to pay for development
<dneighbo> negating the fact that you dont charge for licensing
<dneighbo> the ones that are good consultants and treat customers right will do just fine
<dneighbo> imho
<dneighbo> i wouldnt expect a free software consultant using gnue to be a millionaire
<dneighbo> but i would suspect one day they could live comfortably
<klog> all that sounds good
<klog> i'll take a better look into gnue
<drochaid> dneighbo: I think you undervalue the potential for a product such as GNUe
<klog> consulting cannot bring you millionaire
<dneighbo> no im just a socialist :)
<drochaid> I think the only limitation is the continued developement it requires
<drochaid> klog: it most certainly can
<klog> dr: how?
<drochaid> It may not be easy, but it is possible
<klog> on your own work?
<nickr> dneighbo: your social group can be a millionaire as a community and all live comfortably
<dneighbo> um how is it nickr you say chipcas mail but i havent?
<dneighbo> rofl
<drochaid> klog: IBM charged me out at around £850 a day ... and that was really basic stuff
<klog> ibm...
<drochaid> that was for the standard 7 1/2 hr day
<klog> unless we organise real good
<drochaid> I normally worked upto 14hrs a day
<klog> we must
<drochaid> regularly 23hrs
<klog> ibm has image
Action: Chipaca looks in a mirror
<Chipaca> I have image, too
<drochaid> the possibility is there, whether or not the clients willing to pay what's needed can be found in sufficient supply is another matter
Action: drochaid has no image .. damned vampire disease :/
Action: Chipaca hands drochaid a blessed spell of vampire vanquish
<nickr> mmm, blood of the innocent
<drochaid> heh
<drochaid> IBM bled me dry and turned me into one of them ;)
<nickr> thats cool
Action: drochaid thinks he's just been added to a dozen /ignore lists
<nickr> actually that explains a lot about IBM...
<jcater> ****************************************

<dneighbo> sigh
<jcater> no, didn't kill his stuff
<dneighbo> ok cool
<jcater> ok, you may return to your regularly scheduled trout-slapping now
Action: nickr gives jcater a crappie across the jaw.
<jamest> um
<jamest> wait a minute
Action: Chipaca waits
<jamest> isn't the sign of kwalitee koding an increase in the number of lines of code and dependencies
Action: Chipaca shudders
<nickr> yes.
<nickr> clearly you are working if the LoC are going up
<nickr> and its good code reuse if you add dependencies

<Chipaca> isn't DCL only for projects?
<dneighbo> work orders / help desks

<dneighbo> example you could run a plumbing company on it
<Chipaca> ah
<dneighbo> every 'service call' is a 'work order'

<jcater> I just resent it :(
<dneighbo> what you using carrier pigions now a days or what?
<psu> it still works if you want files that haven;t changed a year ;-)
<jcater> i think gnu lost it
ToyMan_home (CaryKittne@c5300-3-ip66.albany.thebiz.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> you stole my thunder
<dneighbo> reading your mail about half way through im thinking why not namespaces :)
<dneighbo> you may have lost me on the formatting eninge
<dneighbo> i think i would still see it as xslt
<dneighbo> just the sytlesheet would be inline and would work with streams rather than files
<dneighbo> my hope is we start simple
<dneighbo> with file in file out external
<dneighbo> get serveral formats supported
<dneighbo> then move it to stream in file out
<dneighbo> then to stream in stream out 
<Chipaca> dneighbo: same here!
<dneighbo> i will reply formally but upfront other than the 'formatting' stuff
<dneighbo> i agree
<Chipaca> I mean reading the mail and half way through saying 'namespaces, you foo', only carry on reading ...
<dneighbo> i think i agree with the formatting stuff too but want mroe details :)
<jcater> well
<jcater> the point of the "formatting engine"
<jcater> was options that this would allow
<jcater> IN THE FUTURE
<jcater> :)
<jcater> i.e., going this route would leave room for other formatting options
<jcater> besides using external XSLT scripts
<jcater> not that I wanted to pursue this at that time
<jcater> err, pursue that at this time
<jcater> the next set of emails from me will
<jcater> address what we actually want the output xml stream to look like
<jcater> I looked at datavision.sf.net
<jcater> and it has some merit
<jcater> but isn't exactly what I was envisioning
<jcater> i.e., I think it hardcodes positioning in the report definition
<jcater> which complicates a lot of my goals
<dneighbo> on that note are you against making internal XSLT?
<jcater> ?
<jcater> I don't follow
jamest (~jamest@fh-dialup-201072.flinthills.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> well you say leave room for other formatting optoins besides EXTERNAL XSLT scripts
<jcater> you mean have the reports engine apply the XSLT?
<dneighbo> i see external as only temporary
<dneighbo> utnil we prove it
<jcater> no, I'm not against internal XSLT
<jcater> but I would write that as pluggable
<dneighbo> then the transformation would happen in the internal transformation engine
<dneighbo> correct
<jcater> (with the default plug being the XSLT transformer)
<dneighbo> i see the first being xslt as its most bang for buck
<Chipaca> umm
<jcater> that what you mean?
<dneighbo> kind of like what wxWindows is for gui
<Chipaca> I'm going to show off my ignorance here for a while
<dneighbo> not only one but best bang for buck
<dneighbo> if that makes sense
<Chipaca> what work would be necessary to get a thing that plugs into reports and generates a gtk frontend from whatever it (reports) hands it (the frontend) ?
<jcater> not much
<jcater> that's being factored into the exposed RPC interface
<Chipaca> is that what the wxwindows thing does?
<jcater> yes
Action: Chipaca isn't AT ALL hazy
<jcater> wxwindows provides a layer over GTK
<Chipaca> :0
<jcater> as well as the same layer over Win32
<jcater> (and soon Mac OS and OS/2)
<Chipaca> no, I mean does the wxwindows frontend plugin to reports, or did i get that wrong?
<jamest> mac os X works today
<jamest> we've got screenshots on the site of forms running there
<jcater> there are no frontend plugins for reports as of yet
<Chipaca> when you say RPC you mean XMLRPC, right?
<jcater> except a preliminary command line interface
<jcater> Chipaca: xmlrpc, soap, corba, etc
<jcater> but xmlrpc will be the first supported
<Chipaca> whew
<jcater> I imagine

<chillywilly> yes

<chillywilly> that's what I have
<jcater> why would gnue-common be an interpreter?
Action: chillywilly did a dpkg -s gnue-common
<chillywilly> dunno
<chillywilly> because it uses python?
<chillywilly> (stupid reason)
<derek> not sure
<derek> our debian stuff needs a LOT of work
<derek> better debconf stuff
<derek> and get it working
<derek> and do apache style packaging
<derek> as well as good descriptions, keywords etc :)
<nickr> no
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> our packages blow
<derek> chillywilly: i wont say that
<nickr> I don't think the debian maintainer of the packages knows what he's doing
<derek> as i SO greatful someone has started the work
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> I will
<chillywilly> sure, it's better than nothing
<derek> that im not going to say it blows it just needs work
<chillywilly> ok, fine
<chillywilly> they "need work"
<nickr> I suggest filing bugs, lots of them
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> hehe
<nickr> acurate bugs
<chillywilly> good idea nickr
<jcater> do you file bugs at debian.org, or what?
<chillywilly> afaik, bugs.debian.org
<nickr> they are official packages, you send a well structured mail to submit@bugs.debian.org
<nickr> read the website bugs.debian.org I think to figure out the format
<derek> a few things
<chillywilly> what si this crap?
<derek> a. yes file bugs
<chillywilly> s/si/is
<derek> but
<derek> b. we need to get the source of the packages in our tree and learn how they work 
<nickr> I suggest convinicing the maintainter to be more closely in chouch with you
<derek> c. re really need someone highly involved in the project (um jbailey) to help us in a pinch and maybe stand up as the 'maintainer'
<derek> as maurizo does out of kindness
<chillywilly> we are getting this I have a rich client/uncle/whatever that needs your help in getting his money type spam now
<jbailey> blue?
<jbailey> Oh, hey'all!
<derek> jbailey: jamest wants to make the packages in that color too, but i say red is bettter and more 'debianish'
<nickr> hey jeff
<derek> btw: you get hitched yet?
<derek> if so congratulations
<jbailey> Yeah, on the 9th.
<derek> rock
<chillywilly> woooo!
<jbailey> Pictures should be available soon.  I'm buying a scanner tommorow.
<chillywilly> congrats jeff!

<jcater> so there's a time difference
<derek> rofl
<jcater> I can see how you odd-ball AZ ppl can get confused
<derek> we definitely need to work on 3 or 4 marketing items

<derek> tri fold pamplet

<jbailey> derek: So what is it that you want?  Working debian packages?

<nickr> I could try osome stuff in Sodipodi

<nickr> Quark is really the best though :(
<derek> i wont comment publicly

<nickr> sodipodi IS kinky.. they use a squirrel as their logo

<derek>  rock
<derek> i will have to look at this sodipodi
<derek> i think ihave found my logjam obsession has to do with fact they are privy to goat luv
<nickr> its still not usable like Illustrator is usable
<derek> as evidenced by their logo
<derek> i think im sick
<nickr> the interface of Illustrator and Freehand is very refined
<nickr> imho
<derek> i have found myself going out of my way to find python programs
<derek> i.e. i find a program and say hey this looks kind of cool then see its in perl or C or something and go, nah im not interested
<derek> so now not only do i seek gpl software but python gpl'd software
Action: chillywilly likes the idea of using Free tools
<derek> this is most disturbing
<nickr> derek: you are sick, sick person. 
<derek> anyone else that is using python getting this way?
<derek> nickr: well it depends on the tool
<derek> something like frozen bubble i could less about
<derek> but an email program
<derek> or a cd program
<derek> etc etc
<nickr> python irritates me because I still don't have a groove for it.
<derek> i like idea if its in python i can 'easily' grok it
<derek> so i feel like i have a chance to make the software better
<nickr> I use too many temporary variables
<derek> with something in C and GTK i go and start looking at the code and get nauseated
<derek> reminds me of MFC in 1988
<derek> where all the windows are drawn by hand instead of having libraries etc etc etc
<derek> but anyhow
<derek> its time to get work done
<derek> jcater: btw i commented on your mail. :(
<derek> guess im nobody ;)
<derek> though i did so in irc only
<derek> also the chip did also
<derek> rofl... guy subscribed to lug email list and said in 2 days got 60 emails and is unsubscribing and called everyone spammers

<derek> all i can say is technology is so killer

<Maniac> derek ah,

<dtm> heheh same here
<derek> and his mp3 collection for cds
<derek> not that is incredible technical feat
<dtm> i need ideas, people!
<dtm> pg_control!
<dtm> dont make me go to #phpgroupware!  :)
<derek> but im jsut noting non techies are using technology more creatively than microsoft tells them too :)
<derek> oh no threats
<derek> what are you trying to do again:>
<dtm> well then get to crackin
<dtm> !
<dtm> my pg_control data was last modified in 1957 according to my formerly broken clock
<derek> what is the problme i missed it somethign about pg_control
<dtm> so i need to reset that
<dtm> coz pgsql WONT START :)
<derek> um production server?
<derek> you have data backed up?
<dtm> well almost
<dtm> no
<derek> im pretty sure that one way to do it is
<derek> initdb
<dtm> but it's disposable more or less
<nickr> touch it all?
<derek> but dont do that if you dont have backed up data
<dtm> nickr: it's not at a filesystem level coz i used 'touch
<dtm> '
<derek> what makes you think there is somethign wrong with this file?

<derek> hold up i think i have answer

<dtm> yay derek
<derek> another answer is alter the source :)
<derek> xlog.c is where the check happens comment it out :)
<dtm> yes
<dtm> and then simply recompile
<dtm> 4 hrs later i'm free!  :>
<derek> rofl
<derek> i was teasing (its a real solution) just not one i would do 
<nickr> you could copy the data out of the base and then initdb then copy it back over
<nickr> if it uses the same format
<nickr> oh wait that wouldn't working
<dtm> :(
<nickr> haha
<derek> if he had good backup no sweat
<derek>  :)
<nickr> I love when songs go out side the dynamic range of CDs

<derek> what happened when you deleted the file again dtm
<chillywilly> these people at that ISP truly are clueless
<derek> if they have money maybe they can buy a clue?
<chillywilly> they got cracked and they wonder why when they are running tlenet and port 79 is open too
<dtm> derek: if i rm it, or rm and touch it, it's definately broken
<dtm> chillywilly: what's 79?
<chillywilly> finger port
<dtm> oh yeah
<dtm> geez.
<dtm> they wonder why?
<dtm> how'd you hear them wondering
<chillywilly> crazymike's gf works there
<nickr> dtm: When the sound in the song is outside the range of sounds that can be represented in the CD medium
<chillywilly> she all asking me how to extract a tar file from tape, etc.
<derek> dtm you cant initdb?
<derek> i.e you have data in there you cant lose?
<chillywilly> then telling me how they got cracked
<chillywilly> \so then I go get the trusty telnet and start probing ports
<derek> you might be able to move the data files then initdb then move them back but that always seems 'flaky''
<chillywilly> and they are like open to the world
<nickr> finger isn't all bad
<chillywilly> it's rediculous
<chillywilly> sure, but telnet sucks
<chillywilly> but who knows how theyreally got in anyway
<Maniac> i use telent over an ssh tunnel
<chillywilly> they sure don't
<chillywilly> Maniac: ssh tunnel sorta fixes the telnet problem doesn't it ;)
<nickr> finger is poormans web, dude.
<Maniac> :)
<Maniac> kinda pointless to tunnel telnet....
<nickr> 56k sucks for l33chez
<dtm> derek: well, initdb destroys all data, right?!
<dtm> derek: oh well yes i could
<dtm> derek: i'd just set everything all up again WHICH IS GOOD PRACTICE ANYWAY.
<dtm> :>
<derek> i think i learned something
<derek> backing up pg_control isnt an all bad idea :)
<nickr> yea really
<Maniac> tar -zxvf mybrain
<dtm> chillywilly: wait     crazymike's gf is their sysadmin, responsible for crisis recovery, and doesn't know how to restore tar from tape?  just checking!

<nickr> Marniacg: Input error: mybrain is not gzip format
<chillywilly> they don't even friggin have real IT people it seems

<derek> you will find a readme, .c file and makefile ehre
<derek> read the readme
<derek> this will wipe your xlog 
<derek> and rebuild your pg_control file
<derek> there is also a program in contrib/
<derek> that will let you 'view' pg_control
<derek> you could take that source and hack something to edit the date as well
<dtm> dude
<dtm> derek: i love you
<dtm> derek: but the README has warnings.
<dtm> partially applied transactions?
<derek> dont love me till you get it to work

<derek> i hate when those pop in
<dtm> haha
<derek> dtm look in xlog dir they point out
<derek> i assume its probably blank and you have no pending transactions
<chillywilly> "we gotsta get paaaid"
<derek> but i look at it like this
<dtm> derek: so uh.
<derek> right now you dont have a working postgres
<dtm> derek: what xlog
<chillywilly> "where's my mutha fuckin' movie check?"
<derek> so if your choices are blowing an xlog
<derek> or having no postgres
<derek> its a no brainer to me :)O
<dtm> well yeah plus i have no critical data
<derek> as an initdb blows alot more than xlog 
<dtm> so uh.
<dtm> do i have to dump/initdb/reload?
<dtm> even after htis?
<dtm> what's the xlog dir?
<derek>  9 pg_resetxlog is primarily intended for disaster recovery --- that is,
<derek>  10 if your pg_control and/or xlog are hosed badly enough that Postgres refuses
<derek>  11 to start up, this program will get you past that problem and let you get to
<derek>  12 your data files.  But realize that without the xlog, your data files may be
<derek>  13 corrupt due to partially-applied transactions, incomplete index-file
<derek>  14 updates, etc.  You should dump your data, check it for accuracy, then initdb
<derek>  15 and reload.
<derek> this fixes your problem so you can get at data
<dtm> where is the xlog dir
<derek> if you had no pending transactions (which you probably didnt)
<dtm> yeah probably
<derek> and you werent reindexing
<derek> you have no worries
<derek> worse case it has some issues
<dtm> there was no activity, i can tell you that
<derek> but at LEAST you can pg_dump
<derek> fix the data manually and reload
<derek> right now you cant even get to your data
<derek> i would say it appears there is minimal risk here
<dtm> do you know where the xlog dir is?
<derek> i.e. your in such a screwed state there isnt much worse that could happen :)
<dtm> well yeah considering i have no critical data
<dtm> if i did then there could be worse :)
<derek>   /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_xlog

<derek> its how you backup postgres
<dtm> mmhmm
<derek> or 'save it' before doing risky stuff :)
<dtm> and so if i do that i'tll output to a default location, righ?T
<dtm> can you hold on for ~5-10mins while i walk the dog? :)
<derek> do a man pg_dump or man pg_dumpall
<dtm> mom's going to bed and he sleeps with her :>
<dtm> ok
<nickr> actually this is what you shoulda done all a olng
<derek> let him dump on mom :)
<derek> j/k
<dtm> h0h0
<derek> nickr: :)
<nickr> you shoulda dumped it and the re initdb
<dtm> well he did pee on the floor at 3am 2 days ago which is what she's afraid of!
<dtm> coz we didn't walk him all day
<derek> ill be here
<dtm> nickr: yeah but i have to also do the pg_control rebuild
<dtm> brb
<nickr> you cant dump with a broken pg_control?
<derek> no
<derek> as it requires a running postgres daemon

<derek> you compiling there dtm
<dtm> #@*%!
<derek> ?
<derek> getting no where fast?

<dtm> ok sorry i was in a christian chat

<dtm> psu++
<psu> sorry, I only come in non-OO varieties ;-)
<dtm> yeah i gotcha
<dtm> well i hope you find your state sufficiently robust nontheless :>
<derek> dtm i need to go to bed
<psu> nite derek
<derek> let me know how it works out in the end
<dtm> i'm reading the man page for 'pg_dumpall';
<derek> you compile that program
<derek> and run it ok?
<derek> that is what i am most curious about
<dtm> so i only need to do 'pg_dumpall > db.out' and then run the other app we mentioned
<derek> can it compile and run
<dtm> it's compiled; it comes with pgslq
<dtm> pgsql
<derek> and does it let you get into the database
<derek> huh?
<derek> that pg_xlog thing came with it?
<dtm> pg_resetxlog, yeah
<dtm> it's in the 'contrib' dir
<derek> cool
<derek> and it compiled ok
<dtm> but 'pg_dumpall' requires that postmaster is running.
<derek> and you ran it out?
<dtm> well it came compiled
<dtm> but i can't back up first
<derek> and you can restart the postmaster?
<derek> no
<dtm> so should I run it first
<dtm> then back up?
<derek> you have to run that pg_resetxlog to fix your file
<derek> so you can restart postmaster
<dtm> then initdb, then do the restoration command?
<derek> then do a pg_dumpall
<dtm> ok stand bu
<dtm> by
<derek> and view the output
<derek> if it looks good you are done
<derek> if it looks funky
<derek> you will have to hand edit it and reload
<dtm> ah crap my db had recently crashed due to kernel panic
<dtm> ok it's reset
<derek> huh?
<derek> so its reset can you restart postmaster?
<dtm> not yet; now i'm getting permission problems
<dtm> filesystem perms
<derek> on a restart
<dtm> FATAL 2:  open(logfile 0 seg 2) failed: Permission denied
<dtm> yessir
<derek> um
<dtm> sorry to have delayed in resuming these operations, sir
<dtm> su -l postgres -s /bin/sh -c "/usr/bin/pg_ctl  -D /var/lib/pgsql/data -p /usr/bin/postmaster start  "
<dtm> that's what i ran
<derek> login a terminal as root
<derek> the do
<derek> su postgres
<derek> then
<derek> run that program
<dtm> oh yeah
<derek> then log out
<derek> and as just normal root run
<derek> /etc/init.d/postgres restart (debian) or /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgres restart (redhat)
<derek> or whatever you do to restart postgres
<dtm> it starts!
<derek> i would try this on my machine but i really dont want to reload my pg_control file:)
Action: derek does the happy dude dance
<dtm> you were right; i ran it as root rather than 'postgres'
<dtm> heheh yeah thanks anyway :>
<dtm> but i've shown you the importance of backing up that file too huh?:)
<derek> not too much
<dtm> so i think we've _all_ learned a little something here tonight.
<derek> as if you had good backup
<derek> probably easier to just initdb it
<derek> and reload data
<derek> however not all bad idea and good to know this exists
<derek> as most people (me included) only back up nightly
<derek> so if system freaked at 5pm
<dtm> so if i have my pg_dumpall output, then i dont need anything but a compatible pgsql installation, in order to fully restore and have identical operations, right?
<derek> this could save me from losing a days worth of data :)
<derek> right
<dtm> ok
<derek> pg_dump man page shoudl tell you how to reload it
<derek> but as stated its in there
<dtm> so in that case i wouldn't need my pg_control file or any other file, right?
<derek> so you SHOULD NOT have to reload it
<derek> UNLESS it looks corrupt
<dtm> well i dont know how to look except to click around in the GUI for my web apps
<derek> well i would do a pg_dump
<derek> REGARDLESS so you have a back up :)
<derek> but then look at the output make sure it doesnt look like any data is missing etc
<derek> you are probably fine as is 
Action: derek is currently listening to : 14-15=( artist - PAX217 - Prizm 15| 4:08 )15=14-
<dtm> hmm
<derek> but doing a dump and a restore wont 'fix anything'
<derek> you have to do a dump
<dtm> oh ok
<derek> then edit the dump to fix it 
<derek> then reload
<derek> but please do the dump :)
<derek> and do it nightly :)
<derek> and save it to another media source than that hard disk
<dtm> ok so if i only want to backup/mirror my working DCL database then i use 'pg_dump' to dump the entire db, copy the resulting file to the 2nd host, then use 'psql -f data.out dcl'  right?
<dtm> then my 2nd host has identical DCL operations?
<derek> not sure of syntax w/o looking but yes
<derek> but it will only have data as of last dump
<dtm> assuming the rest of the system is set up (apache, php, pgsql, linux username, and pgsql username/perms)
<derek> so its not a 'real time' mirror
<dtm> so that's it, right/
<dtm> correct
<derek> but rather mirror as of last 'sync'
<dtm> that's good enough for light usage
<derek> i call it an 'oh shit' mirror
<dtm> for a two person workgroup that would be pretty high tech
<dtm> yeah
<dtm> so is my perspective on backup/mirror correct?
<derek> yip
<dtm> i could then just failover to the 2nd host/
<derek> i would use rsync
<dtm> *elite*
<dtm> yes i will
<dtm> via rsa-auth ssh
<derek> yip
<dtm> wont be much data anyhow
<dtm> and i'll do it frequently
<dtm> multiple times per day
<derek> you can do as frequently as you see fit only limitation is time it takes :)
<derek> i.e. if it takes 10 minutes to execute the pg_dump
<dtm> DCL doesn't have a problem if the server it's running on, has a dynamic IP addr, right?
<dtm> yeah
<derek> most often you coudl do it is every 10 minutes :)
<dtm> and i dont have to stop the db in order to run 'pg_dump' right?
<derek> um i dont recall i do not think so 
<dtm> ok
<derek> it goes by name and you can set that to like ./
<derek> or something
<dtm> yeah
<derek> no you do NOT stop the db for pg_dump
Action: derek is currently listening to : 14-15=( FINE_YOUNG_CANNIBALS-She_Drives_Me_Crazy 15| 3:39 )15=14-
<derek> and it should work w/ people in the system
<dtm> but 'pg_dumpall' apparently tells the restore process to clobber all potential target data
<dtm> overlapping data, that is
<dtm> so if there's already a db called 'dcl' or whatever in the target pgsql installation, will the target db 'dcl' be totally erased and overwritten, resulting in an identical copy?
<derek> also verify tomorrow with jamest (he is postgres stud muffin)
<derek> if he uses this method for back up
<derek> i have in past as i had problem doing just the data files
<derek> but i believe pg_dump doesnt get partial indexes or something (not a huge deal)
<dtm> ok
<dtm> heheh
<dtm> doing what data files
<dtm> you mean backing it up from the filesystem?
<derek> dtm: i dont recall you can tell from the dump file
<derek> dtm: yeah
<dtm> yeah pg_dump doesn't get overall db objects
<dtm> only that which is directly inside a single db
<derek> right
<derek> pg
<derek> er
<derek> pg_dump for single db
<dtm> yeah
<derek> pg_dumpall all dbs plus shadow
<dtm> well ok you go to bed then

<derek> right but if your database gets toast
<derek> do you restore it from file system or a pg_dump?
<derek> or does it depend on the failure type

<Harald1> ok. is anything decided about how the merge will be executed? will only the db-structure of dcl stay?

<derek> the first thing you will see is that dcl is getting more external development
<derek> as of today some rbac stuff was submitted as a patch
<derek> while it might not be the long term direction it solves some important issues immediately
<derek> also in the cvs head branch you will notice GNUe Forms (non web screens) for DCL being checked in
<derek> the contact management portion will be much much more robust in next DCL
<derek> and probably even further extened into real CRM in the GNUe CRM stuff
<derek> i have to run :(
<Harald1> bye. thank you.
<derek> will be back in an hour or so
<derek> btw: if the db structures change the upgrade path will handle
<derek> example we are gutting the contact stuff heavily on the db side
<derek> and main reason its not released is (we need more testing) and because we will have to write a 'program' to upgrade the database
<derek> instead of simply doing ALTER tables
<Harald1> but the GNUe forms are already in cvs?
<derek> yes
<derek> mostly maintainance ones

<SachaS> how are you?
<reinhard> fine thanks
<reinhard> and you
<reinhard> how is the beach today? :)
<SachaS> good thanks. on my todo list ... havent been to the beach, today.
<SachaS> :)
<reinhard> :)
<SachaS> but its hot.
<SachaS> on my todo list is an item: tell reinhard about sweden.
<SachaS> so here it goes.
<SachaS> the openebxml laboratory in sweden has about 5 "scientists" doing projects for and around it.
<SachaS> the people have different projects.
<SachaS> they are placed between computer science and business
<SachaS> they want to realise business solutions with computer science help
<SachaS> one big thing was all the time:
<SachaS> modelling
<SachaS> they want to have modelling tools.
<SachaS> like uml
pattieja (~pattieja@www.pcxperience.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<SachaS> modelling business processes
<SachaS> in particular
<reinhard> yeah
<SachaS> but not only modelling
<SachaS> but have executable models.
<SachaS> so you model then "save" and "start".
<SachaS> basically.
<reinhard> exactly what we talked about
<reinhard> like 
<SachaS> it is not easy at all.
<reinhard> uml2gcd
<reinhard> or like that
<SachaS> yes.
<reinhard> em
<reinhard> dia2gcd
<SachaS> if you program gcd
<SachaS> only programmers can handle it
<SachaS> mostly
<SachaS> but if you have modelling tools
<reinhard> yeah
<SachaS> you can focus on a higher level
<SachaS> kind of.
<reinhard> that's what we are planning anyway
<reinhard> at least it was my understanding
<reinhard> to have a "designer" for geas
<SachaS> ok.
<reinhard> that will work on a high level
<reinhard> and save it into xml files and/or database
<SachaS> then there was another topic.
<SachaS> maybe you heard of BPML Business Process Modelling Language
<reinhard> never
<SachaS> :)
<SachaS> i "heard" about it.
<reinhard> what is it?
<reinhard> is it like our gcd language?
<SachaS> www.bpml.org
<SachaS> sorry i cant tell you. I did not read the specification. From my reading (around) I understand that it is more based on "MODELLING"
<SachaS> thats maybe not the best base for a discussion.
<SachaS> to get your brain working and model (draw) what is going on in the enterprise
<SachaS> I want to have a look at it tomorrow and come back tomorrow, to be prepared.
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> i'm downloading the spec now
<SachaS> :)
<reinhard> oh well
<SachaS> It seems, that with BPML you model the enterprise business.
<reinhard> i'd say I tried to
<SachaS> the next step is inter-enterprise business
<reinhard> server seems down or link broken or whatever
<SachaS> and there you can model with ebXML (electronic business XML).
<reinhard> i think i got that
<SachaS> ebXML focues heavily on inter enterprise business, called collaborations.
<SachaS> ok.
<SachaS> so problems are: enterprise wide you have BPML and inter-enterprise wide you have ebXML.
<SachaS> problem: you need some kind of mapping.
<reinhard> well BPML mention ebXML on their homepage
<reinhard> so i guess they are somehow related
<SachaS> i guess it is similar with programming languages. a server is written in c and a client in java. so you need a mapping. c does not have exceptions so you have to handle exceptions somehow.
<SachaS> and the somehow is the question. and there are probably many ways .
<SachaS> that what i wanted to tell you from sweden, more or less.
<reinhard> cool
<SachaS> did I say I study BPML for tomorrow ...... ahhh.
<SachaS> #@!)(1^!
<reinhard> have you already found what you need for your ebxml project?
<SachaS> good questions. i keep changing the topic. before was it the interface ebXML and ERP (or business application). The current topic is how to derive a Collaboration Protocol Agreement (CPA) from 2 Collaboration Protocol Profiles (CPP).
<reinhard> hehe
<SachaS> i found 2 supervisors! I need two. One knows XML the other electronic business.
<reinhard> cool
<SachaS> yes. how about you? did you get more time for GNUe?
<reinhard> not yet :(
<reinhard> silly customers keep buying my stuff
<reinhard> ;)
<SachaS> good.
<reinhard> it's weird
<reinhard> i do zero advertising
<SachaS> i read you talked about geas version 2 :)
<SachaS> maybe the just like it.
<reinhard> it's a 20 year old program basically that i support now
<SachaS> just like the support.
<SachaS> the must like the support
<reinhard> it dosn't run on win versions > ME
<reinhard> and i made 3 new installs within the last month
<SachaS> ???
<reinhard> all companies that saw the program at other companies
<SachaS> actually it must not run on ME to be better at all.
<reinhard> and asked them where they can get it
<reinhard> lol
<SachaS> good for you.
<reinhard> yeah of those 3 installs
<reinhard> 1 was GNU/Linux and 1 was FreeBSD
<SachaS> :) really?
<reinhard> yes
<SachaS> are you also in charge for backup, administration of the software?
<reinhard> seriously it's a zero administration system
<reinhard> i've got cumstomers i didn't hear from for years
<reinhard> but they still work with it every day
<SachaS> it must be like the vw combi year 1975 I use here!
<reinhard> :)
<SachaS> ok. i am off to bed. See you tomorrow. bye

Action: drochaid is considering pizza soon
<Harald1> I am just playing a bit around with designer and I am wondering how uptodate the BUGS file is?
Action: drochaid wonders if he should get some for dneighbo as well
<Harald1> because it describes that under win32 the "new" submenu do not work. But they work correctly here...
<Arturas> Hello Derek
<jamest> Harald1: just let us know and we'll fix the BUGS list
<jamest> do all the optoins work?
<Harald1> I didn't try every wizard, but "New->Form" creates a new window with an empty form, and "New->Wizard" creates a new window and starts a wizard
<dneighbo> no no no :)
<dneighbo> please please please
<dneighbo> use DCL to file any bugs
<dneighbo> soon the bugs file should be generated from there
<dneighbo> until then consider the bugs file out of date :)
<Harald1> ok. how exactly do I have to configure dcl, to submit bugs etc. to gnue?
<dneighbo> um go to 
<dneighbo> https://dcl.sourceforge.net/dclgw/
<dneighbo> i think there is a guest account
<dneighbo> and of course right now i dont recall it (grr that was on my list to add to the page)
<dneighbo> try guest guest
<dneighbo> VERY soon (as soon as on a weekend i can corral jamest)
<dneighbo> it will be as easy as submiting a bug to
<dneighbo> bugs@gnuenterprise.org
<dneighbo> to file a bug
<Harald1> but bugs still should be send to bugs@gnuenterprise.org?
<dneighbo> send it to info@gnue.org for now
<dneighbo> as im not sure who bugs would go to
<dneighbo> jamest: please note we need to get this stuff squared away...
<dneighbo> i will try to enter some tickets for it
<dneighbo> if i get a chance
<dneighbo> im drowning here though :(
<dneighbo> Harald1 it is guest & guest
<dneighbo> to login but i see that you can only 'view' bugs not submit them from that login
Action: dneighbo is looking to make dcl better at some of this (bug tracking kind of stuff)
<dneighbo> in the help desk side of the fence
<Harald1> i'll look at it as soon as the page loads here
<Harald1> which port was https on?
<dneighbo> um 80 i think
<dneighbo> if you go to http://gnuenterprise.org/dclgw/
<dneighbo> it should redirect you to the https
<Harald1> no that gives me a 404
<dneighbo> hmm your browseer support https?
<Harald1> well i tried ie (*ducks) and lynx
<dneighbo> hmm
<dneighbo> try fully qualified
<dneighbo> https://www.gnuenterprise.org/dclgw/
<dneighbo> if that fails then try
<dneighbo> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/
<dneighbo> if that fails, make sure you can get out on the net in general from that machine
<Harald1> https://www.gnuenterprise.org/dclgw/ works
<dneighbo> cool
<Harald1> though that's useless for me at the moment, as I can't post anything, right?
<dneighbo> yeah
<dneighbo> you could see 'filed' tickets and 'work orders'
<dneighbo> etc
<dneighbo> if you want to file bugs (we would love it)
<dneighbo> and i will create you an accoutn right now :)
<dneighbo> i just need your name and email

<linas> jamest: hi, also long time ... 
<linas> jamest: yes I understand, glade won't run on win or mac, that is not my concern.
<linas> I was thinking of something simple though:
<linas> <datasource table="inventory" name="inventory" database="devel"/> just like in forms today, and
Yurik_ (~yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) joined #gnuenterprise.
<linas> <glade gwidget="glade widget name" field="table.fieldname" >
<linas> of course its a bit more complicated, since you have to know what kind of glade widget
<linas> it is to poke date into it (or pull data out).
<linas> but hopefully, it wouldn't really be a whole lot more complicated ...
<linas> I would not want to modify glade *at all*
<linas> although you'd have this hassle of having to hand-write xml to match glade fields to db fields ...

<linas> haven't thought it that far through yet.

Action: drochaid dccs a piccy of the pizza to Yurik ;)
<linas> you'd need to use xml parser to read the hookups
<btami> hi all
<Yurik> drochaid: thanks
<jamest> so glade would draw the form and gfclient would run it, is that what you are saying?
<btami> jamest: have you received my 1 line patch email?
<jamest> the icon size patch?
<btami> yes
<jamest> yes, I'll try and get it applied tonight
<btami> OK, thanks
<reinhard> jamest: is python 2 in woody
<reinhard> or in sid?
<jamest> woody has up to 2.2
<jamest> 2.1 IIRC is the default install now
<reinhard> i did
<reinhard> apt-get python
<reinhard> and it installed 1.5.2
Action: jamest blinks
<jamest> reinhard....a debian user?
Action: reinhard is a debian newbie
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> for 2 days now
<jamest> you running woody?
<reinhard> :)
<reinhard> yep
<btami> sorry, what IIRC means?
<jamest> If I Recall Correctly
<reinhard> suse 6.4 doesn't contain python 2
<reinhard> and i decided to not buy suse any more
<jamest> reinhard: you have woody lines in your /etc/apt/source.list 
<reinhard> out of ideological and technical reasons
<jamest> and no stable lines
<reinhard> um
<jamest> linas: if we do this what are we gaining?  I'm trying to figure out the angle you are comming from
<reinhard> jamest: all lines have the word stable in them
<reinhard> i guess that's not correct
<jamest> reinhard: that is potato
<reinhard> why does my woody cd do that?
<reinhard> um
<jamest> stable - potato
<reinhard> on the cd label it said woody
<reinhard> :)
<jamest> what I would do is 
<jamest> apt-get install netselect
<jamest> netselect-apt woody
<reinhard> thanks
<jamest> this will create a source.list file that contains fastest mirrors for your machine
<jamest> hand copy the lines over of copy over it
<jamest> then
<jamest> apt-get update
<jamest> apt-get -u dist-upgrade
<jamest> the -u lets you see what it's going to do and confirm the updates
<jamest> if you hit errors in the update typically you can do this...
<jamest> apt-get -u dist-upgrade
<jamest> <error occurs>
<jamest> apt-get -f install
<jamest> apt-get -u dist-upgrade
Action: jamest is off to spread joy amongst the users
<jamest> now where's my bat
<reinhard> seems like its netselect not netselect-apt
<reinhard> jamest: thanks a lot
<jamest> netselect-apt may be a command with woody's netselect package
<jamest> it produces the sources.list file automagically
<reinhard> i have no command netselct-apt
<reinhard> netselect-apt
<jamest> if you don't want to hand code then just replace the stable with woody in the existing file
<reinhard> ok
<jamest> you can also put testing in there but I don't recommned it
<jamest> as some day woody switches to stable and sid to testing
<reinhard> ok
<jamest> you don't catch the announcement and do a dist-upgrade and <blam> you are now running sid :)
Action: jamest speaks from experience on that one :)
<reinhard> what is the diff between upgrade and dist-upgrade
<reinhard> ?
<jamest> dist-upgrade trys to be intellegent about the updates
<jamest> it's upgrade with dependency checking
<jamest> man apt-get will explain it on the first page IIRC
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> thanks again
<reinhard> doing dist-upgrade now
<reinhard> looks good :)
yogurt2unge (~charlie@modem42-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<Harald1> just a quick question: should debug->run in designer work?
<linas> jamest: I've got to develop a pretty looking glade app; its gotta be pretty or they'll
<linas> make me code in VB. Ughh.  I'm using glade and some custom gtk widgets.
<linas> Its mostly data-driven: which means most of it is gnue-forms-like
<linas> so I'm scratching my head: what's the easiest way from here to there?
<linas> I could do it from scratch, I could enhance gnue-forms, I could try bond/bonddb
<btami> reinhard: take a look at http://archive.progeny.com/progeny/debian/doc
<btami> reinhard: there is a 400 page users guige (GPL now)
<btami> er, guide

<reinhard> btami: thanks
<Harald1> jamest: something serious? I did some quick changes and it does run forms now, though I am not sure if everything is correct
<btami> nothing
<linas> jamest: every half hour I change my mind. The from-scartch approach is to hack some xml
<linas> that hooks up odbc table.fields to libglade widget names.  Should be easy, but ...
<jamest> Harald1: nothing serious just we didn't fix is after a while
<linas> but it leaves me cold for a long-term strategy (reports, etc.)
<jamest> linas: can you define "pretty"
<Harald1> jamest: looked like it. as everything is there, you just have to make the connections
<linas> jamest: "pretty looking": mxiture of buttons, menus, radio/select, text areas with padding and glitz
<jamest> work on dynamic menus is in the works, buttons work, text areas work
<jamest> glitz i don't know about :)
<linas> jamest: I also have some custom scrolling strip-chart widgets and a satellite photo map underlay.
<jamest> ouch

Chipaca (~john@modem42-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> StyXman: whassup
<linas> jamest: now I have to hook up a bunch of forms to a database thats the easy/hard part
<linas> jamest: easy but tedious; alternately, hard if I try to merge into gnue :-(  
<linas> spend a dollar to save a penny
<dneighbo> i dont have time to read back log
<dneighbo> linas glade support is a WASTE
<dneighbo> if you want glade use glade
<dneighbo> our designer IMHO is superior to glade at this point and cross platform
<dneighbo> i assume your "issues" are either
<dneighbo> a. lack  of 'cool' widget support
<dneighbo> or
<dneighbo> b. you desire native gtk
<dneighbo> if you want (a) forms really isnt too interested in that, i suggest just using glade
<dneighbo> if you desire native gtk simply write a UIgtk.py file
<dneighbo> i personally see glade as having nothing to do with forms
<jamest> linas: you may want to see about mixing and matching, using forms where it saves you time
<Chipaca> dneighbo: what's 'native' in this context? 
<jamest> as designer wizards make that part so easy
<dneighbo> a year ago, someone could convince me that perhaps glade could be retrofited to be our designer
<dneighbo> but honestly now our designer is there and it 'rocks'(tm)
<dneighbo> so i cant see going backwards :)
<jamest> but dropping to glade where you need the glitz
<dneighbo> if you just want easy databinding in glade
<dneighbo> there are lots of projects that are doing databinding for glade
<jamest> now it may be possible to extend the forms client to do more
<dneighbo> gnome-db being one of them
<jamest> ie: support widget plugins, but that's going to take work :)
<dneighbo> im not trying to be too harsh here, but we have hashed these in the past :)
<dneighbo> making gnue MORE complex isnt our goal :)
<dneighbo> Chipaca native in this context means no abstraction
<dneighbo> wx uses NATIVE widgets but doesn through an abstraction
<dneighbo> UIgtk.py would us pyGTK or something to natively talk to the gtk
<dneighbo> UIwxwindows.py talks to the wx api
<dneighbo> which then talks to gtk or win32 etc
<dneighbo> by authoring a UIgtk.py
<dneighbo> one is then removed of all wx dependencies
<dneighbo> and simply must have the gtk stuff
<dneighbo> if that makes sense
<dneighbo> i guess linas ran away.....
<dneighbo> and dangit i have a gnucash question

<drochaid> MySQL does NOT pass the relational tests
<Isomer> heh
<drochaid> doesn't even come close
<drochaid> as for acidity .. forget it
<Isomer> on Undernet, we have a bot "X" which is our channel service.  X uses postgres as it's backend.
<drochaid> not even oracle and ms sql pass cobb's test
<drochaid> cool Isomer

<Isomer> -X- Uptime: 0 days, 22:49:58

<drochaid> lol
<Isomer> most commands are several queries
<Isomer> and, of course, we have a web interface into the database *as well*

<dneighbo> who comes from teh equivalent of microsoft jet or paradox or dbase

<drochaid> oops, screw up on my part ... dneighbo is right, it was informix ... not ingres
<dneighbo> i know lots of folks using access because it was EASIER than MSSQL
<nickr> heh this is funny:
<nickr> (I use emacs, but the guys that started earlier than me still use vi as their main editor).
<dneighbo> that doesnt mean access is better
<nickr> considering that emacs was around before vi.
<Isomer> nickr: I got a good chuckle from that one :)
<drochaid> lol
<dneighbo> so mroe people using MySQL than Postgres surely shouldnt draw same relation
<drochaid> MySQL simply gets more publicity than PostgreSQL
<Isomer> we inherited a project based on mysql at work
<drochaid> for really simple dbs [ie noddy websites] then yeah, it's faster
<Isomer> and oh dear is it pretty hidious
jamest (~jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<drochaid> but as soon as you try even a moderate query, performance just dies
<drochaid> hey jamest
<dneighbo> drochaid it at one time (possibly still) did table level locking
<Isomer> drochaid: lets not forget it's ability to corrupt itself :)
<dneighbo> if you turn postgres to table level lock it smokes mysql
<dneighbo> but postgres team is smart enought to realize NO ONE should use table level locking :)
<drochaid> dneighbo: completely irrelevant, but I rather like the fact that the name of MySQL ... looks rather like MSSQL >:)
<dneighbo> unless they are crack addicted :)
<drochaid> uhm table level locking :((
<drochaid> I got away from that when I stopped using Access '95
<Isomer> dneighbo: It doesn't matter which one is faster -- since what really matters is if you can index things.
<dneighbo> drochaid : everyone who says mysql fast (a year ago)
<drochaid> talk about the best way to screw useability of even a small 16 person db
<Isomer> mysql until recently couldn't index any column that wasn't NOT NULL.
<dneighbo> iw ould say ok write report that endlessly loops or does a nasty query that takes more than 5 minutes
<dneighbo> then have people do data entry at same time
<dneighbo> they woudl say 'it froze' mysql
<dneighbo> we cant enter data
<dneighbo> thats when i gave them teh genius award :)
<drochaid> Isomer, dneighbo ... is it still the case that MySQL does not handle UNION or other rather usefull statements?
<Isomer> where as on undernet we have an index on "lower(username);"
<Isomer> drochaid: I don't believe it does UNION, but it does do LEFT/RIGHT/OUTER joins
<Isomer> drochaid: but doesn't do subselects
<drochaid> so it's getting better then ;)
<drochaid> I heard you can *fudge* sub-selects .. not pretty tho
<dsmith> Anyone know what a comparable command to "apt-cache search" is for a RedHat 6.2 system?

<dneighbo> make sure you document and close it out
<dneighbo> psu i will comment later on your report thing
<dneighbo> i think you might be overseeing the issue
<dneighbo> and how xslt and transformations might work
<dneighbo> i see two specifications
<dneighbo> one for how the format looks (the .grd)
<dneighbo> and one for how the data is spit back to me in file or stream
<psu> no problem
<dneighbo> i think jcater was trying to point that way engine works you need somethings in the layout (.grd)
<dneighbo> that muddy its readability
<dneighbo> and thus use xlnms for that
<dneighbo> and so the parser doesnt gag
<psu> a bit like you, I have a favourite proprietary reports package
<psu> that i'm hoping to sucker jcater into 
<dneighbo> btw: i need to reread his mail too
<psu> doing a free implemenation of ;-)
<psu> pref w/o too many donuts involved
<dneighbo> well i don tthink there is a package out there that does what i want :)
<dneighbo> and that is to uncouple the report query from the report
<psu> me neither actually
<psu> but I suppose we start from what we know + our own wishlist
<psu> jamest - any progress on getting me the stuff I need to become trainee webslave?
<psu> I have several jobs I've assigned myself in DCL
<psu> and should have some free time next week to do them
<psu> just need the relevant access
<psu> I may not be around much longer tonight 
<psu> but we can discuss via email if necessary
<jamest> um
<jamest> you're wanting to do web stuff?
<jamest> on the FSF site or gnue.org site?
<Harald1> dneighbo: no I did not post it to dcl
<linas> dneighbo: hi again walked away for a moment
<linas> dneighbo: read your comments, did I hit a nerve?
<Harald1> dneighbo: to dcl I posted, that a bug described in the BUGS file is obsolete
<jamest> linas: we constantly have to defend keeping the gfd simple :)
<linas> jamest: yeah, my biggest failing with gnucash was not policing it enough
<dtm> hi
<linas> its weird, you want to encourage contributors, so you don't want to piss people off,
<linas> but its hard to say "don't implement that its a bad idea" without pissing them off
<dtm> linas: are you a gnucash maintainer?
<linas> or accidentally specing something thats too grandioise for them to implement.
<dtm> i'm sensing senior gnucash staff here
<dneighbo> linas didnt mean to piss you off
<linas> dtm: it would be accurate to say, not much, not anymore 
<dneighbo> just saying that we have talked a lot in the past
<dneighbo> and im saying we disagree on philosphy
<dtm> linas: oh.  well gnucash seems to be a good thing, so thanks :)
<linas> but I wrote 90% for the first 50 or 100KLOCS
<dneighbo> as evidenced by somethign things in gnucash :)
<dtm> linas: i've never used it coz i couldn't figure out how to compile the bleeding edge libs it needed when i tried it about 2yrs ago :)
<dneighbo> im all for contributions
<dtm> linas: i need to use either that or the appgen.com stuff
<dtm> linas: Intuit is a non-option ;>
<dneighbo> im just saying what you are proposing doesnt make a lot of sense
<dneighbo> as iirc glade has some databinding capablities or so i hear
<linas> dneighbo: I sense hostility?  wazzup?
<dneighbo> in fact grib was even touting his own set
<dneighbo> not trying to be hostile
Action: dtm tosses dneighbo a couple of Scooby Snacks in the form of whole pizzas
<dneighbo> it is of course gpl software and you can do as you like
<dneighbo> and we would support you in it unless it was really whacked :)
<dtm> hey sometimes when designers/implementers disagree, they need to generate some proof-of-concept code.  :}  just a thought.

<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> hi jcater 
<dneighbo> how is life on the road?
<dneighbo> Lars_G this is a nice channel
<jcater> swell
<dneighbo> um jcater i will respond here
<dneighbo> becuase what im thinking and what legal documents need are SMART forms
<dneighbo> example
<dneighbo> you say this house belongs to:
<dneighbo> ::variable:: 
<dneighbo> but then you have to go ONE MORE STEP
<dneighbo> do you say
<dneighbo> man and wife
<dneighbo> single person
<dneighbo> etc
<dneighbo> actually that is bad example
<dneighbo> an example woudl be multiple borrowers
<dneighbo> or multi line addresses
<dneighbo> grr this is hard to explain as its been a while
<jcater> those are common reporting requirements
<jcater> I have to account for multiline addresses in a lot of our customer service reports
<jcater> that mail letters to customers
<dneighbo> no im talking i make a DEEDS document
<dneighbo> and i have a database field called relationship type
<dneighbo> 1 - married
<dneighbo> 2 - individual
<dneighbo> 3 - something else etcc
<dneighbo> and i have a lots of verbiage following that that is NOT in the database
<dneighbo> that is conditionally printed
<nickr> hrm. I have some work in that area put in.
<dneighbo> so if its type one the paragraph reads
<dneighbo> AS MARRIED COUPLE WHO BLAH BLAH BLAH
<dneighbo> and it varies by STATE
<dneighbo> so TX might be
<dneighbo> AS MARRIED COUPLE BAH FOO
<dneighbo> and OH
<dneighbo> AS MARRIED COUPLE yuck foo
<dneighbo> you wouldnt want to necessarily make a custom DEED for each state
<dtm> heh.
<dneighbo> but rather dynamically build the form based on some rules
<jcater> I do conditional reports all the time; that's a basic requirement as far as I'm concerned
<jcater> so I don't follow
<dneighbo> so its not a mater of printing data
<dneighbo> as long it will support a complex version of this fine
<dtm> what's all this shouting about marriage?!
<dneighbo> most reporting tools do not
<dtm> is gnue auctioning off your wives?
<dneighbo> build dynamic text that is not in the database
<dtm> dneighbo: aloha and stanx for the help last night
<jcater> dude
<jcater> for one
<jcater> it'll support triggers
<dneighbo> i the verbiage options would be in form
<dneighbo> yes like triggers
<dneighbo> if it supports triggers it will do what im thinking
<jcater> btw
<jcater> in my experience
<dneighbo> im still thinking this going direction that is good but not what i had originally hoped :) but thats ok i am not writing it
<jcater> stuff like that is exactly what you'd want in support tables
<jcater> just an observation
<dneighbo> jcater: its different beastie i promise
<dneighbo> until you have done mortgage lending documents
<dneighbo> thats why i think it might need to be a separate tool
<dneighbo> currently the only people i have seen that do this are vmp
<jcater> I think you are talking very specific/extreme case for one
<dneighbo> adn they make a killing
<dneighbo> jcater um doctors and lawyers need similar as well
<jcater> and I really don't see a justification for doing a separate tool
<jcater> as if a reporting package can't handle that
<dneighbo> my chiropractor is dying for something similar
<jcater> then it needs to be rethunk
<jcater> btw
<dneighbo> im not saying it has to be a spearate package
<jcater> I agree a lot of popular reporting packages DON'T do that
<jcater> but that doesn't mean they shouldn't
<dneighbo> im just saying if people say that the functionality is stupid and doesnt belong in reports (too specialized)
<dneighbo> then we should offere as a separate tool
<dneighbo> not saying i want it as a separate too
<dneighbo> l
<nickr> just make a separate document generator that can embed reports :)
<jcater> actually
<jcater> your argument for a separate "tool" is actually an argument FOR my use of namespaces
<jcater> as this "tool" more than likely would use the underlying reporting engine
<jcater> only with modified functionality
<jcater> so maybe I shouldn't argue against you :)
<nickr> hey, now theres an idea
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I scared him off
<dneighbo> im here
<dneighbo> i agree
<dneighbo> i like the namespace solution

<btami> hi all
<btami> Harald1: maybe these dirs are not used or dead
<reinhard> sorry back
<reinhard> had a long phone
<reinhard> they are dead yes
<reinhard> the dirs
<reinhard> where did you get those names from?
<reinhard> probably an outdated documentation or somehting like that
<Harald1> well you see them in the web interface
<Harald1> and they are in the cvs snapshots
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> which web interface do you use?
<reinhard> lxr/bonsay are heavy out of sync
<reinhard> AFAIK
<Harald1> http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/gnue/gnue/
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> that should be current
<Harald1> and in the snapshots here http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/snapshots/
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> those dirs are empty
<reinhard> or only contain other (empty) directories
<reinhard> they are obsoleted
<reinhard> and if you check out using -P then empty dirs are ignored
<reinhard> so everything is ok
<Harald1> yes, I just wondered, as I downloaded a snapshot and it contained these dirs. Then I did an update and the dirs disappeared

<reinhard> hi SachaS
<SachaS> hi Reinhard. how are you?
<reinhard> thanks fine
<SachaS> i had a look at BPML today. BPML is a meta language.
<SachaS> basically a xml vocabulary for business processes.
<reinhard> ah
<SachaS> (i still am not sure where to place it in connection with a erp system, though)
<SachaS> question what is a business process?
<SachaS> "A structure for action" ... according to some guy
<reinhard> hmmm
<reinhard> i would say it is
<reinhard> an algorithm for the business
<SachaS> so basically BPML has some tags which people can use to describe their business processes (as mentioned yesterday, mainly for enterprise business processes)
<SachaS> yeah is also good.
<SachaS> I cited the specification: "A process is a specific ordering of work activities across time and place, with a beginning, an end, and clearly defined inputs and outputs"
<SachaS> the main entities of the BPML vocabulary are: - messages, - participants, - activites, - rules, -transactions and - processes.
<SachaS> what are you doing when you analised your business processes and modelled/described them with BPML?
<SachaS> I guess there is no software out there yet which "simply" parses it and executes it and voila you have a system which handles your processes.
<SachaS> what i miss is a document, specification with the title: "How do I create a state-of-the-art Enterprise Resource Planning System"
<SachaS> maybe your work can result in such a document if there is none yet.

<Arturas> Hello Derek
<dneighbo> hey Arturas 
<dneighbo> how is i18n going?
<dneighbo> you get ra3vat to test things for you?
<Arturas> yes
<dneighbo> good news or bad news?
<Arturas> he said the strings even in source code were different [they should be the same]
<Arturas> :\
<Arturas> where in forms font is set up?
<Arturas> can't find it
<Arturas> know that on file ~/.gtkrc
<dneighbo> if set anywhere would be gnue.conf
<Arturas> depends only menu-fonts
<Arturas> no
<Arturas> there is font-size, width, but not font-name
<dneighbo> then its coming from your theme of either gnome/kde or windowmanager
<dneighbo> er maybe thats not correct
<Arturas> no :)
<Arturas> if that would be, everything would be fine :)
<dneighbo> as i think we use some fixed font
<Arturas> yes :)
<Arturas> in gnue.conf
<Arturas> but somewhere has to be
<Arturas> font name and font encoding
<ra3vat> Arturas: the test shows strings as one-byte character string, so no any i18n specific symbols
<Arturas> [at least default values]
<ra3vat> no unicode
<Arturas> ra3vat: the letter was encoded in utf8
<Arturas> ra3vat: could you maybe send the same letter back to me?
<Arturas> ra3vat: (dcc?)
<ra3vat> Arturas: yes the letter was. Saw it correctly in Outlook Express with specific symbols as you described in the message 
<ra3vat> and then what?
Action: yogurt2unge is away: get food

<dneighbo> outlok express.... shame on you dmitry
<Arturas> ra3vat: you have kde?
<Arturas> :)
<ra3vat> yes
<Arturas> better than me over telnet :)
<Arturas> ra3vat: can you open the same letter in kmail?
<Arturas> kde supports cut&paste with i18n
<Arturas> copy the source into file
<Arturas> chmod 777 :)
<Arturas> and run
<dneighbo> hey Arturas 
<dneighbo> # The next 2 options are only used by the wxPython clients
<dneighbo> # Normally, default font style and size is used, according to the active theme
<dneighbo> # Set this to 1 if you want fixed width fonts
<dneighbo> fixedWidthFont = 1
<dneighbo> # Font size if fixedWidthFont = 1 (ignored otherwise)
<dneighbo> pointSize = 14
<dneighbo> this tells me that the THEME font is used
<Arturas> eys
<Arturas> m
<Arturas> yes
<Arturas> ?
<dneighbo> so that is where you would get your font information
<Arturas> what is THEME?
<dneighbo> i dont use kde so dont know how it works
<dneighbo> in gnome
<Arturas> what it is in gnome?
<dneighbo> you can edit your 'theme' for gnome or your 'theme' for your windowmanager
<Arturas> we're back again
<dneighbo> in gnome if you go to settings:gnome control center
<Arturas> 1.
<Arturas> in kde i have the same control center
<dneighbo> then
<Arturas> 2.
<dneighbo> desktop->theme selector
<Arturas> all fonts are set up for iso10646-1 encoding
<Arturas> 3.
<dneighbo> it shows the themes
<dneighbo> and you can use a USER font instead of theme font there
<dneighbo> to override the 'theme'
<Arturas> all texts in kde are displayed [with i18n data] ok
<Arturas> 4.
<Arturas> if forms uses THEME
<Arturas> they should support  i18n data too
<ra3vat> Arturas: if i got the test source from your second message (from attachment) is not it the same? 
<Arturas> but it is not so
<dneighbo> an easy way to test
<Arturas> ra3vat: the same [at least should be :]
<dneighbo> change your theme to a really ODD and DISTINGUISHING FONT
<dneighbo> then open up forms
<dneighbo> if it has that same odd font you know its using the theme
<Arturas> what does it mean: odd, distinguish?
<dneighbo> if its font remains the same you know it is not
<dneighbo> means: something you would notice
<dneighbo> i.e. make font, big and bold or something
<Arturas> ok
<ra3vat> Arturas: in the source strings encoded as multybyte utf8 string but they displayed as one-byte lenght character strings on my system
<ra3vat> another source to get info about encoding is sys.getdefaultencoding() on python's startup
<Arturas> dneighbo: i'll (*@(*#%Q!#$&%#$@)!(#* you. Made my font size 48 and now can't cancell it - cancel button is below the screen :| and i can't reach it
<Arturas> :)
<dneighbo> ouch
<dneighbo> you dont have virtual desktops
<Arturas> ra3vat: don't know
<dneighbo> hey dont kill me
<dneighbo> jamest used to configure forms so that they were like 1000 times bigger than my video card could deal with
<dneighbo> thusly crashing X entirely
<Arturas> :)
<Arturas> have desktops
<Arturas> but windows don't extend
<Arturas> they stay in the same desktop 
<dneighbo> kde sux
<Arturas> :)
<Arturas> till NOW i WAS happy :)
<dneighbo> Arturas its problaby out in a .kde file somewhere
<Arturas> ra3vat: if i'm remembering good, defaultenc. is ascii 
davi (davi@80-25-136-215.uc.nombres.ttd.es) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ra3vat> Arturas: yes, and one need to change it to use forms with i18n strings 
<ra3vat> otherwise you 'll get 
<ra3vat> DB000: UnicodeError: ASCII encoding error: ordinal not in range(128)         
<Arturas> no, if i enforce strings as unicode
<Arturas> look:
<Arturas> sstring=('i18n data','utf8')
<Arturas> sstring2=str(sstring.encode('utf8'))
<Arturas> print sstring2
<Arturas> and you'll get nice i18n data
<Arturas> (you can try ;)
<Arturas> dneighbo: no changes in forms, although kde looked really awfully
<ra3vat> yes, but i'm saying about current forms codebase 
<Arturas> so the has to be font defined as iso88-something
<Arturas> and where is it??????
<Arturas> maybe i simple missed the line :(
Action: Arturas sometimes can be really big idiot :)
<Arturas> ra3vat: by the way
<Arturas> the same sstring2 in form won't be displayed with i18n data
<ra3vat> and even without .encode(..) strings there are enforced to behave as unicode strings and if correct encoding is not provided we'll get that exception
<Arturas> it will contain something like 'A[]"
<dneighbo> im an i18n idiot
<dneighbo> so im not much help
<dneighbo> Arturas i was under impression forms was not inflicting its own font
<dneighbo> i grepped the source and am not finding anything
<Arturas> dneighbo: you are the one who knows what is going on here 
<Arturas> that's the problem
<Arturas> ra3vat: ok, let's say we have python defaultencoding unicode
<Arturas> but i believe that i18n data in forms won't be displayed anyway
<jamest> um
<ra3vat> it displayed
<Arturas> Hello jamest :)
<jamest> the font encoding is in UIwxpython
<dneighbo> forms/src/uidrivers/wx/UIdriver.py:      self.splash.SetFont(wxFont(20,wxSWISS,wxNORMAL,wxBOLD))
<dneighbo> forms/src/uidrivers/wx/UIdriver.py:      self.splash.SetFont(wxFont(10,wxSWISS,wxNORMAL,wxBOLD))

<dneighbo> damn damn damn
<Arturas> mhm

<jamest>  initFont function
<Arturas> dneighbo: now we could set it to be unicode or utf8 or anything else and it doesn't work - i've tried that about 2 weeks ago :(
<Arturas> jamest: where is it/
<Arturas> jamest: where is it?
<jamest> derek:that sectoin only sets the splashscreen fonts

<dneighbo> Arturas my gut (but i could be way off)
<dneighbo> is in gnue.conf
<dneighbo> allow people to set the font
<dneighbo> like we do other font options
<dneighbo> and put what is in forms now as the 'default' there
<dneighbo> then just use GConfig
<dneighbo> to read that 
<dneighbo> should be example in init of GConfig
<dneighbo> for fixedfont variable and such
<dneighbo> line 85 - 9X on forms/src/uidrivers/wx/UIdriver.py
<dneighbo> def initFont(widget, affectsLayout=1):
<dneighbo>   if int(GConfig.get('fixedWidthFont')):
<dneighbo>     widget.SetFont(wxFont(int(GConfig.get('pointSize')),wxMODERN,wxNORMAL,wxNORMAL))
<dneighbo> you will need to read up on wxFont i think

<dneighbo> with
<Arturas> dneighbo: checking that now [downloading wxFont docs]
<dneighbo> GConfig.get('font')
<dneighbo> and put font = blah
<dneighbo> in the gnue.conf file
<Arturas> dneighbo: no, i hope adding something like 'encoding="utf8"' should be enough
<dneighbo> yes that would be nice :)

<Harald1> is anybody here using gfclient + mysql?
<nickr> this channel was highlighted but I can't find my name in backscroll
<jamest> Harald1: I'm not, jcater is not, but someone was at one time
Action: dneighbo was
<dneighbo> i test on mysql occasionally
<Harald1> dneighbo: should it work?
<dneighbo> i dont 'use' 'use' it but i make sure it works
<dneighbo> it was working at the 0.1.1 release or 0.1.2 (whatever last release was)
<dneighbo> what is your client platform and server platform
<dneighbo> my tests were with
<Harald1> I've got a problem under win 2000. when I want to login gfclient crashes
<Harald1> both win 2000
<dneighbo> debian (client) redhat (server) and
<dneighbo> win98 (client) redhat(server
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> using odbc driver or native mysql?
<Harald1> gfclient crashes with "TypeError: unsupported operand types for +: 'int' and 'NoneType'" 
<dneighbo> my win98 tests with mysql were using the odbc driver
<dneighbo> Harald1 ok you have a python problem :)
<Harald1> i use mysqldb and it seems that the error is in mysqldb
<dneighbo> you need python 2.x
<Harald1> I have 2.2
<dneighbo> ouch
<dneighbo> 2.2 you dont want
<dneighbo> drop to 2.1
<dneighbo> 2.2 is buggy
<Harald1> if i change the None in the source code of mysqldb to 0 it works...
<dneighbo> you can use it but you wont be able to save forms in designer because of a streamIO bug in unicode support w/ 2.2 (still unfixed even in last candidate release)
<dneighbo> ah
<dneighbo> well i would create a diff
<dneighbo> and send it to mysqld folks as a patch :)
<Harald1> dneighbo: well I am able to save forms in designer
<dneighbo> if you save them
<dneighbo> reopen them
<dneighbo> and save them
<dneighbo> can you reopen them?
<dneighbo> i was encountering this issue on linux w/ python and traced it back to a python2.2 bug
<Harald1> I'll contact the developers later/tomorrow
<dneighbo> jcater tried to put in a hack to work around it
<Harald1> i'll try...
<dneighbo> it seemed to not fix it for me
<dneighbo> BUT i was running python from pretty much cvs from right before 2.2 release :)
<dneighbo> so a newer official 2.2 might be ok as i noticed commits for unicode (just not stringIO) but as stated i think jcater put in a hack to maneuver around stringIO
<Harald1> streamIO bug is still present. python crashes
<dneighbo> well one thing you can do (painful)
<dneighbo> is open the form in a text editor
<dneighbo> and substitue ^@ for null
<dneighbo> and then the form will be ok
<dneighbo> but next time you save it it will save with the ^@'s
<Harald1> where are the ^@? at the end of lines?
<dneighbo> oh no
<dneighbo> after EVERY character
<dneighbo> so you get ^@o^@u^@t^@p^@u^@t^@ like that :)
<dneighbo> if you have someone one staff you want to 'joke' with
<dneighbo> this is one of thsoe good 'joke' bugs :)
<Harald1> should it be visible in an editor?
<dneighbo> um dependons on how cool an editor you use :)
<dneighbo> in emacs its visible
<dneighbo> but ^@ means its an escape char that most 'windows' editors wont show you like
<dneighbo> ^M
<Harald1> What should happen if I do save->exit->start->load?
<dneighbo> would crash designer
<dneighbo> iirc
<dneighbo> what happens is when you create a form no issue
<dneighbo> save a form no issue
<dneighbo> but when you OPEN a form it uses stringIO to read in the xml file
<dneighbo> and that is what converts it to unicode
<dneighbo> so then when you save it, it has that ^@ stuff in it
<Harald1> for me save->exit->start->load does not crash
<dneighbo> tainting it for next open or for reading by forms
<dneighbo> cool well then you might not have the bug
<Harald1> and no ^@ in gfd
<dneighbo> cool
<dneighbo> it might be a unix only problem too
<Harald1> but if i do save->load it crashes
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> is there way you can install python2.1 on that machine as well?
<dneighbo> or better yet just grab the 0.1.1 release
<dneighbo> it has all dependencies compiled in so to speak
<Harald1> I'll try it later/tomorrow
<dneighbo> adn try exactly same thing and tellme if it bomb
<Harald1> is 2.1 / 2.2 installation at the same time possible
<dneighbo> you can run them concurrently
<dneighbo> but for testing you can just get the release
<dneighbo> and windows puts everything in dlls
<dneighbo> that are much easier to download and install and remove
<jamest> Harald1: your running a python installed forms/designer
<jamest> ?
<jamest> that's cool, most people use the bins
<dneighbo> he is cooler than most :)
<dneighbo> as he actually submits bug reports :)
<jamest> lol
<jamest> i'm sure there'll be lots of them
<jamest> as I'm fighting w/ forms a bit at work on windows
<jamest> if i'd only get these !@#!@# web site accessibilty updates completed
<Harald1> jamest: yes, because I want to know what happens. and besides this the cvs has no bins...
<jamest> cvs on windows!?!?!?
<jamest> you are da man!

<dneighbo> grrr

<dneighbo>     widget.SetFont(wxFont(int(GConfig.get('pointSize')),wxMODERN,wxNORMAL,wxNORMAL,encoding=wxFONTENCODING_SYSTEM))
<dneighbo> which is what arturas was wanting to use i think
<dneighbo> what ticks me off
<dneighbo> is that here:
<dneighbo> http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~zeitlin/wxWindows/docs/wxwin155.htm#wxfont
<dneighbo> it shows wxFONTENCODING_UTF8 as a valid wxFontEncode type
<dneighbo> wonder i my wx version is too old or something
<dneighbo> crap
<dneighbo> they are saying UTF8 is a 'microsoft' only encoding
<dneighbo> one option is we could put 
<ra3vat> hmm
<dneighbo> EncodingType=
<dneighbo> in gnue.conf
<dneighbo> and then you can set it
<dneighbo> i wish i could 'test' the SYSTEM one
<dneighbo> ra3vat can you change to last code i pasted in UIdriver.py
<dneighbo> for wx
<dneighbo> and tell me if arturas sample works?
<ra3vat> to _UTF8?
<dneighbo> um this
<dneighbo>  widget.SetFont(wxFont(int(GConfig.get('pointSize')),wxMODERN,wxN
<dneighbo>                ORMAL,wxNORMAL,encoding=wxFONTENCODING_SYSTEM))
<dneighbo> the _UTF8 wont work on linux
<dneighbo> you might try it on windows
<dneighbo> if that doesnt work you could try
<dneighbo>                ORMAL,wxNORMAL,encoding=wxFONTENCODING_KOI8))
<dneighbo> for cryillic stuff
<dneighbo> i can get things to run with these different option (cept UTF8)
<dneighbo> but i dont have other charsets to 'test' them with :)

<jcater> you're name isn't "Derek", so that's a good start
<jcater> :)
<reinhard> lol
<jcater> must run to doctor
<dsmith> reinhard: No risk at all, just make sure you have another kernel that works and your lilo.conf is right before you run lilo.
<dsmith> reinhard: I used to make kernels all the time.  The "Debain Way" is very nice.
<reinhard> dsmith: thanks
<reinhard> 5
<reinhard> oops
<dneighbo> clarify
<dneighbo> install new STOCK kernel (in apt)
<dneighbo> or compile a new kernel
<dneighbo> since debian has so many kernel choices i suggest staying away from a compiled kernel unless there is just something you are in dire need of that isnt in a stock kernel
<dneighbo> if its stock kernel its about a 10 minute process
<dneighbo> though i would wait for nickr to be around
<dneighbo> as he has a groovy little trick that lets you upgrade your kernel and at the same time convert to GRUB and away from lilo :)

<drochaid> it's not my fault no one can say och

<drochaid> think loch .. unless you call it a lock :/
<nickr> throaty ch sound
<drochaid> yep
<drochaid> sounds like you're clearing your throat
<nickr> why didn't you say so in the first place?
<nickr> all this soft-ch stuff confused me

<drochaid> no, that's not a soft ch, that's an ah
<drochaid> *sh
<dneighbo> wow
<dneighbo> The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of the evil. We see before us a huge community of producers the members of which are unceasingly striving to deprive each other of the fruits of their collective labor?not by force, but on the whole in faithful compliance with legally established rules. In this respect, it is important to realize that the means of production?that is to say, the entire p
<dneighbo> oducing consumer goods as well as additional capital goods?may legally be, and for the most part are, the private property of individuals.
<nickr> er
<nickr> isn't that what capitalism is?
<nickr> the state allowing some people to rip off other people?
<nickr> comparing it to anarchy is false.
<dneighbo> what is amazing is that is written by Albert Einstein
<nickr> capitalism as we know it depends on laws
<nickr> hah
<nickr> cool
<nickr> I didn't know that Einstein was a filty commie
<nickr> I knew all those scientitsts were a bit fruity
<dneighbo> http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einst.htm
<dneighbo> yes he was it appears
<dneighbo> basically states capitalism erodes our sense of value to a society
<drochaid> I thought he was a Marxist?
<dneighbo> and makes us hostile towards one another
<reinhard> x5
<nickr> scientists are all the same... they SAY they are trying to help us, but what they're really doing is trying to RULE THE WORLD
<reinhard> argh
<dneighbo> well yes marxist veiw more
<nickr> theres a really good part of illuminatus that talks about capitalism
reinhard (rm@N812P008.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: "Friends may come and go, but enemies accumulate"
<drochaid> communism took marxism and remove the better points about it
<dneighbo> wow that essay is just incredible
<drochaid> the ideology behind marxism is fairly sound
<dneighbo> Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political s
<dneighbo> he described m$ and the trial in 1949
<nickr> Huh, thats pretty interesting
<dneighbo> This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevi
<dneighbo> the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.
<dneighbo> wowzers
<nickr> when was this written?
<nickr> hehe
<dneighbo> this BLOWS me away that this was authored in 1949
<nickr> its as true today as ever
<nickr> actually its more true today
<drochaid> tbh, it's been the same for hundreds of years .. he was simply recording what was the case then
<dneighbo> I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion.
<dneighbo> is his solution
<drochaid> the only thing that's changed is the extent a single person or company can control a market on a global basis
<dtm> dneighbo: good point; let's make an educational system which has goals!
<dtm> :)
<drochaid> wouldn't that be a contradiction in terms?
<drochaid> it would be in the UK
<nickr> the problem of a socialist state is that it moves privilage back into the hands of the state
<nickr> the key to true freedom is removwing privilage entirely
<drochaid> uhm
<drochaid> bollocks
<nickr> privilage is private law
<nickr> an economic system needs to have everyone on the level playing field
<drochaid> I don't believe that's possible
<nickr> Well, its possible to the extent that you remove thet state granting privilage
<drochaid> how?
<nickr> I don't know man, I didn't do it.
<drochaid> lol
<dneighbo> actually nickr he address your concern
<dneighbo> Nevertheless, it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is not yet socialism. A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual. The achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems: how is it possible, in view of the far-reaching centralization of political and economic power,
<dneighbo> to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and overweening? How can the rights of the individual be protected and therewith a democratic counterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured?
<dneighbo> Clarity about the aims and problems of socialism is of greatest significance in our age of transition. Since, under present circumstances, free and unhindered discussion of these problems has come under a powerful taboo, I consider the foundation of this magazine to be an important public service.
<drochaid> nah, still bollocks ;)

<nickr> not antique, probably 'classic'
Action: drochaid has an old light meter in a leather case
<drochaid> a flip down bit at the front to allow for strong or dull light conditions?
<nickr> no it has a wheell that you turn and you turn it so far and it switches to 'high'

<drochaid> if the alteration is obvious, the method I employed is more suitable
<chillywilly> well it is not geeky enough
<chillywilly> therefore you loose
<chillywilly> my method is sed-like at least
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> I have fully admitted several times my lack of serious technical knowledge
<chillywilly> well your windows usage makes that painfully obvious ;)
<nickr> drochaid: thats nothing a few quarts of coffee and some toothpicks and 'reeudcation' films couldn't fix

<drochaid> chillywilly: windows is the best OS ever created
<drochaid> I pity the user who doesn't use it exclusively
<chillywilly> *cough*
<nickr> lrol
<drochaid> muahahahahahahaa
<chillywilly> windows is like a glass house or something
<chillywilly> one stone and it goes crashing down
<drochaid> glass can be a very strong material
<drochaid> can withstand many times it's weight
<chillywilly> in my experience the best way to crash windows is to install a network card
<drochaid> can be made resistant to fast moving projectiles
<chillywilly> ths makes it near impossible to use
<drochaid> and provides warmth and protection to it's users
<drochaid> then the ventilation shuts off and they all die :)
<chillywilly> it provides "convenience" instaed of "security"

<chillywilly> a shitty bill that got renamed
<drochaid> ah
<chillywilly> says that all electronic devices must have copy-protection mechanisms
<drochaid> oh
<chillywilly> mandated by the federal gov't
<drochaid> that along the lines of the DMCA?
<chillywilly> (US federal gov't)
<chillywilly> it's worse than the DMCA
<drochaid> that's the thing you see,
<drochaid> DMCA has no effect on anyone outside the US
<drochaid> as it's been found illegal by international law
<chillywilly> well, don't think it's going to stay in the US and you can ignore it because I guarantee you America's disease will spread
<drochaid> indeed
<chillywilly> besides, nationalism is BS
<drochaid> but it will be much slower now there is legislation going into place to actively fight the DMCA in the UK and several other countries

<Harald1> should I post the complete results to dcl, as there were some more problems with the exe-releases
<Harald1> ?
<dneighbo> when you say same result
<dneighbo> which result :)
Action: dneighbo doesnt recall exactly what the problem was 
<dneighbo> the crashing after like save/reload
<Harald1> yes and that it only happens when gfdesigner is not exited
<dneighbo> where are you seeing designer 0.2.2a?
<Harald1> in the about dialog
<dneighbo> hmmm
<psu> cool
<dneighbo> guess im ill informed much anymore
<Harald1> 0.2.0a I mean
<dneighbo> ok that sounds slightly better :)\
<dneighbo> let me test here can you give me exact steps
<dneighbo> of what you are doing to make it crash
<Harald1> yes: open gfdesigner, load a file, save it, close the file (but not gfdesigner), load the file -> crash
<Harald1> but: open gfdesigner, load a file, save it, exit gfdesigner, open gfdesigner, load file -> no crash
<dneighbo> ok trying now
<dneighbo> hmmm i have different bug
<dneighbo> i open gfdesigner
<dneighbo> load a file
<dneighbo> save it
<dneighbo> close the file (But designer exits) insetad of closing
<dneighbo> never mind my stupidity
<Harald1> ?
<dneighbo> i forget that we dont do designer quite right :)
<dneighbo> i was doing designer file.gfd
<dneighbo> which is NOT the same as 
<dneighbo> designer
<dneighbo> then open the file
<dneighbo> so in my case close/exit behaved the same
<dneighbo> please file the bug
<dneighbo> it exists in windows as well
<dneighbo> er linux
<Harald1> to dcl?
<dneighbo> i.e. my current cvs does the exact same thing
<dneighbo> yeah to dcl
<Harald1> can you assist me? I'm not sure what priority, account, type I should add
<dneighbo> it appears as though even a debug level 50 gives no useful information on the crash so no need to submit anything
<dneighbo> what are options for priority
<dneighbo> it should be something like 'next patch release' or something
<Harald1> high, medium, low
<Harald1> no that's type
<dneighbo> let me look real quick
<dneighbo> you are contact
<dneighbo> account 'end user'
<Harald1> yes
<dneighbo> product gnue designer
<dneighbo> priority medium
<dneighbo> type next minor release
<dneighbo> btw: if every you arent sure guess what you feel is best and will change it if we dis agree :)
<Harald1> ok. I've got another thing:
<dneighbo> cool
Action: dneighbo loves that we have another bug hunter, i was feeling so lonely
<Harald1> there's a problem with the gfdesigner exe release. the normal release doesn't start, and the debug release has not /etc dir
<Harald1> not = no
<Harald1> so it wouldn't start either, it only displays for a second, that no gnue.conf is available
<Harald1> dneighbo: It seems that the saving bug is even worse. It crashes on other files, too, after one file was saved and closed
<Harald1> but it does not crash, when the first file is not closed

<chillywilly> hey you're the one who couldn't get money out of the tyme machine the other day ;)
<chillywilly> true dat
<dneighbo> um Harald1 the .exe's assume you create gnue.conf and such
<dneighbo> i.e. on your system in like program files/gnue/etc
<superphreak> thats what I am saying...we work for Simplex, therefore we don't have much money
<chillywilly> superphreak: you mean tyco ;)
<dneighbo> or something
<chillywilly> simplex had the shit to gether for the most part
<superphreak> chillywilly: yeah, sorry TYCO
<dneighbo> there should be a samples.gnue.conf and samples.connections.conf
<dneighbo> just copy those and name the copy gnue.conf connections.conf
<dneighbo> then try designer again

<Harald1> dneighbo: no that's the problem with the exe release, there's no /etc and sample confs, I copied my normal ones and then the debug release worked
<dneighbo> hmmm the .exe release on win95 had them
<Harald1> 0.1.1?
<dneighbo> um yes i think so
<dneighbo> did you get official releases
<dneighbo> or nightlies of some sort
<ra3vat> dneighbo: can you give me account in dclgw?
<dneighbo> i dont have a windows box here so i cant confirm

<dneighbo> ra3vat: just need name (i dont remember how to spell it) dmitry sorvokin? and email ds@telcom.ics.ru ?
<dneighbo> yeah thats right place
<dneighbo> but its common that would do the etc file et al
<dneighbo> i.e. you didnt just get designer right
<dneighbo> you got common/forms/designer when you got 0.1.1
<ra3vat> dneighbo: (login name - dimas) dmitry sorokin ds@ics.elcom.ru
<Harald1> no, I just wanted to test the exe release, so just designer
<dneighbo> er actually i think designer should install common
<dneighbo> install forms and designer
<Harald1> and debug works when I copy my /etc 
<superphreak> chillywilly: did you die???

<dtm> yeah
<dtm> i really like RMS's essay involving that
<dtm> really enlightening
<dtm> it even helped my perspective on it
<chillywilly> if I make you a copy of a movie that is copyrighted then I am  as bad as someon attacking, raping, and pillaging a ship right?
<dtm> not that it clears my conscience
<chillywilly> hehe
<dtm> coz i still commit theft
<dtm> i wouldn't ever deny that.
<dtm> but it's that their definition of theft is _wrong_.
<dtm> so it's theft in the name of civil disobedience, mostly
<dtm> and yeah sometimes i do steal stuff that i coulda bought or rented
<dtm> like downloading an mpeg rather than making a $0.99 rental. 
<dtm> that would have been fair.
<chillywilly> snoogans
<dtm> so it kinda blurs off into the distance
<chillywilly> how about they let me download it for free
<chillywilly> then I can send the author money directly
<dtm> i'd pay to download it
<chillywilly> and not the copyright police bastards
<dtm> well in the case of hollywood movies, there are tons of big money involved
<chillywilly> the "content" providers
<dtm> so having a gray distribution mechanismis understandable
<dtm>  the people who provide lighting, cameras, food, etc
<dtm> moviemaking is an incredibly huge job none of us can estimate
<dtm> well , often it is.
<dtm> some movies are as simple as typical software engineering
<chillywilly> wel copyright isn't supposed to last forever it is basically a restriction on free speech
<chillywilly> there
<chillywilly> 's no compromise anymore
<chillywilly> look at mutha freakin' disney
<dtm> yeah
<dtm> hey i found out recently that the word 'patent' is rooted in the phrase "to make public"
<dtm> isn't that fascinating
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> well you do have to disclose the information
<dtm> i never knew that before just recently.
<dtm> yeha
<chillywilly> you see that they renamed the SSSCA?
<chillywilly> and now are trying to pass that POS
<dtm> no and i dont know what the SSSCA is
<dtm> well at least i know i'm not _personnally_ responsible directly for the destruction of civilization ;)
<dtm> i dont come up with this shit.
<dtm> ;>
<chillywilly> federal law mandating that all electronic devices must have copy protection mechanisms in them
<dtm> all that's needed is for "good men" to do nothing :)

<dtm> HDTV already was infested with things like that
<chillywilly> sucko
<dtm> copy and content controls
<dtm> censorship
<chillywilly> dude this is like communist russia putting armed guards at copy mahcines
<dtm> i know HDTV is supposed to be a materially desirable consumer item but i'd just as soon smash it with Sledge O Matic(tm) as watch it if it had that stuff in it.
<dtm> yeah it is.
<chillywilly> but they do it with technology
<dtm> yep
<chillywilly> it's fascist
<dtm> and chilly, believe me, this stuff is _so_ important that i respect anyone who thinks this way about it
<dtm> i mean who prioritizes it this much
<dtm> and recognizes and analyzes it
<dtm> just think if everyone did that a _little_ bit.
<dtm> instead of having a few of us trying in futility to carry the rest
<dtm> but we still have to try.
<chillywilly> I think people are too busy being brainwashed by the PR and consumerism that is all too prevalent in america
<dtm> maybe something will happen such that we'lll not just slide slower down the slippery slope, but instead have some STRATEGIC advance.
<dtm> yeah
<chillywilly> so then the politicians and corporations get to pass the laws they want
<chillywilly> and no one says boo
<dtm> their self relationship is so screwed, they dont even know what choice _is_ let alone its value.
<chillywilly> because they are so apathetic
<dtm> yeah especially when it's marketed as a desirable consumable
<chillywilly> dude I am readying my protect sign once again
<chillywilly> er, protest
<dtm> what sign?
<chillywilly> the one I will make
<chillywilly> ;)
<dtm> heh
<chillywilly> right after I write my congressman
<dtm> gonna storm capitol hill?
<chillywilly> heck yea
<dtm> well shit dude
<dtm> think about it
<dtm> i heard that something like only TEN THOUSAND Americans wrote to the govt about the microsoft case.
<chillywilly> that's pathetic
<chillywilly> I don;t know who to be more pissed at
<dtm> if that's the case then not only do they surely have a filtering process for it reaching the desks of decisionmakers, but we could write a _GOOD_ one that'd get there.
<dtm> yeah i know
<chillywilly> the common americans aor the jag offs trying to screw them
<dtm> exctly
<dtm> well
<dtm> it wouldn't be possible unless it was a two part process
<dtm> it'd be different if the average American couldn't figure it out
<dtm> couldn't learn about it
<dtm> we may as well find already well written essays, put a quick cover letter on it, and forward it on.
<chillywilly> Free Software is an extreme and I recognize that, but I think it is only necessary if we are to win anything back for the people before it is too late
<dtm> see
<dtm> my personal problem is that i dont know my audience well
<dtm> so i have a writing style issue
<dtm> i dont know how specific or general to b
<dtm> e
<dtm> some of these people have never seen the inter-web
<dtm> i dont know if i should try cluing them in, or just casting a vote
<chillywilly> someone said that these guys doign this are clueless and they will leave a big mess for us to clean up
<chillywilly> (wrt to technology etc.)
<chillywilly> it's the old men who don't even know what the net is
<chillywilly> but guess whcih coporations(s) are behind that bill and basically bought it?
<chillywilly> disney, et. al.
<chillywilly> I'm never going to look at mickey mouse the same
<nickr>  the mouse is a huge, evil corporation, in the worst sense of the word

<nickr> probably

<dtm> well i do like Disneyland though

Action: chillywilly is away: I'm busy
<dtm> chillywilly: tlel her i said HIGH.
<dtm> some disney movies are quite inspiring and educational, even the recent ones
<dtm> i really liked Beauty and the Beast part 2
<dtm> and Hercules
<dtm> i especially liked watching them on a $1000 portable dvd player in a jet plane

<derek> i want pizza
<Harald1> derek: well I've got no pizza, but a question:
<Harald1> which trigger events are implemented, just those from http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/techref/x81.html or all?
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 01:13:01)
<derek> um where do you see 'all' :)
<derek> i would say the ones in the techref 'should' be implemented
<derek> but these are things that unless one of the developers are using them, probably are not getting properly regression tested
<Harald1> all are those in the VALIDTRIGGERS list
<derek> so the safe answer is in the source code you can get a list of what is there in code
<derek> then only by testing can you determine if they work
<Harald1> err no list
<derek> (bad answer i know)
<derek> but i would 'assume' that if its in the techref
<derek> its in the source and it SHOULD work
<derek> i.e. if you use one that is the tech ref and it doesnt work please file a bug against it
<Harald1> actually I am not using them at moment, but look at how they work/ are implemented
<derek> Harald1: i forget you wanting to 'develop' gnue tools
<derek> or use them
<nickr> dtm: I had rice and ramyun, not just rike by itself
Action: derek has bad memory so i apologize if i already asked
<derek> i like to know how people fit into the picture
<Harald1> derek: at the moment I'm far from "developing". I am trying to get an overview, and understand how certain things are done
<derek> i guess the real question was
<Harald1> and I looked at the technical reference and saw the sentence "We would like to increase the number of supported languages as time permits" in the trigger part, and now I try to understand how triggers work
<derek> 'do you plan on using gnue as an end user' or 'as a developer'
<Harald1> derek: mostly as a developer
<Harald1> because I still go to university. but I think will soon (in a few years) be a big option. So knowing it is not only interesting, but also useful :)

<nickr> what bug?
<Harald1> when I delete an object under windows, designer crashes and I am wondering if the same thing happens under linux
<nickr> ah hrm
<nickr> wonder if I have a working designer here
dsmith (firewall-u@cherry7.comerica.com) left irc: "later.."
<Harald1> would be great if you find one, I'm tracing this bug for hours, and I can't find the reason why it happens. And if its windows related this will reduce the possibilties. And despite that I could post it to dcl
<drochaid> I'm running designer under Win 2K ... and it doesn't crash when you delete an object here
<Harald1> drochaid: which version do you use? the exe release?
<drochaid> yep, the current packaged verion
<drochaid> *version
<Harald1> 0.1.1?
<drochaid> gimmie a mo
<drochaid> no
<drochaid> the build from the 3rd feb 2002
<Harald1> the about dialog in designer tells you which version it is
<drochaid> I using a build that was produced on the 3rd feb 2002 ... I don't know if they altered the version number or not, but it came after v0.1.1
<Harald1> but its not 0.2? I've got a release installed. It says 0.1.1 and doesn't crash, too
<Harald1> so maybe its a new bug or it has something to do with my installed python
<drochaid> which version is the one that crashes?
<Harald1> 0.2.0a from cvs
<drochaid> well, there's no packaged build for that version I'm aware of, so it'd not that I'm running
<Harald1> I've traced the bug so far, that it occurs if the LayoutEditor is notified, that the object has to be destroyed. But the strange thing is that it not happens, WHEN the object is destroyed, but sometime later

<dneighbo> hola
<dneighbo> was gone a tad longer than expected
<dneighbo> nickr: you have any idea when they will bundle xfree86 4.2?
<dneighbo> i was reading a thread and the main maintainer said hey im busy if you you want to pay my employer to do it maybe
<dneighbo> and i was thinking hey its worth 20 - 30 bucks to me
<dneighbo> maybe i would kick that down to his employer if it would help
<dneighbo> then later in same mail he was such 'as chilly would say 'cocksmoker''
<dneighbo> i was like no way
<dneighbo> shame really then i read on debian planet him being a bigger jerk and many people comment that many debian maintainers have gone this way :(
<nickr> heh Branden isn't such a bad guy, just has a short temper somettimes
<dneighbo> most unfortunate
<nickr> actually he's really a nice guy
<dneighbo> being a maintainer is surely a thankless job
<dneighbo> nickr: yeah i dont take it personally on him, just a shame that general consensus is that most of the maintainers were behaving this way :(
<dneighbo> and then i look at #debian and see the crap there
<nickr> I think he'd make a good DPL, he's a very good SPI treasurer
<dneighbo> and its like man... so sad
<dneighbo> anyway putting kids to be bed be back later
<nickr> his employer does pay him to work on debian, though, afaik
<nickr> he's busy with woody right now, so as soon as thats all done he said he'd work on 4.2
<nickr> I think he's mostly gotten a bad rep for a few incidents and many jokes
<dneighbo> yeah the one comment i thought was pretty bogus (not made by him)
<dneighbo> was that hey X is a big and important package so dont expect it right away
<dneighbo> my view is the bigger and MORE IMPORTANT the package the sooner it should be there (obviously like not day of release) but shouldnt straggle for long
<dneighbo> example...
<dneighbo> i would expect gnome2 stuff to be in sid as an option as SOON as possible after official release and quite possibly 'pre-official' release
<dneighbo> and i think X to be more vital than gnome (imho)
<nickr> X is certainly vital
<dneighbo> i.e. im not blaming him, it should not fall on a single persons shoulders (another opinion)
<nickr> but the point of debian releases is stability, and the version of X that will be released with woody is currently being trusted for stability
<nickr> tested
<nickr> for stability
<dneighbo> nickr: i agree, but im talking sid not woody
<dneighbo> and honestly X is a different beast to me somewhat because of 'hardware' support
<nickr> since he is the maintainer of the package and it is directly before a release, he has to concentrate on woody
<dneighbo> i view anything as being necessary for HARDWARE support as VITAL
<nickr> no one is thinking or doing anything for sid now
<dneighbo> as currently that is my #1 knock on windows
<dneighbo> er against linux in win vs lin
<dneighbo> and that is horrid hardware support
<dneighbo> now i realize its a battle
<dneighbo> i.e. linux developers dont get the hardware and the apis a year before they hit market like win developers
<dneighbo> and probably never get the apis
<dneighbo> but all the reason its more important to get newly supported stuff available asap
<dneighbo> perhaps in this case its a matter of not being pluggable enough?
<dneighbo> i.e. sound, video etc drivers should all be 'pluggable' so yuo shouldnt need the newest X or Kernel to get support of a device rather just the driver
<nickr> heh.
<nickr> welcome to derek's fantasy world...
<dneighbo> but i guess in case of some new architecture stuff you have to have a new X/kernel etc in order to deal with a driver that uses new features
<dneighbo> nickr: yeah i suppose
<dneighbo> i just want everyone to use gnu/linux
<dneighbo> and when cheap commodity hardware isnt well supported it makes it harder
<nickr> cheap commodity hardware IS well supported
<nickr> there are rare cases where that support isn't so god
<nickr> good
<dneighbo> i.e. if i can build a good fast computer for 400 bucks that runs windows but on linux i cant have sound or video 
<dneighbo> and the answer is buy off the 'list'
<dneighbo> then thats bad
<nickr> well do something to fix it rather than saying it 'should' be a certain way
<dneighbo> nickr: i have only had two machines out of about 10 to install linux that didnt have hardware problems
<dneighbo> laptop had to wait for new X before it ran right
<dneighbo> had to wait for new sound as well
<dneighbo> laptop before that no sound support
[20:17] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<dneighbo> etc etc
<dneighbo> usually was sound in past
<dneighbo> now lately its been video (which is odd)
<nickr> what you should be doing is nagging hardware vendors to release specs and check out hardware to developers
<nickr> you could alternatively put forth the effort to make a quick and dirty 4.2 package
<nickr> or convince someone else to do so
<nickr> or see if someone has already done so
<nickr> sometimes I sure wish I could kill the cd rom driver and reload it
<dneighbo> i somewhat scouted the net
<dneighbo> and what pisses me off is branden says he has ones partially done
<dneighbo> er in test state
<dneighbo> and he said he wouldnt post where because he was 'mad at the community'
<dneighbo> thats when i was like f it
<dneighbo> i'll just suffer
<nickr> heh
<nickr> he won't post them, probably, because then everyone would fucking complain endlessly and post bug reports
<nickr> must be really stressful maintaining the biggest and one of the most important packages
<dneighbo> yes agree
<dneighbo> hey galeon sucks lately
<dneighbo> i recall an email sent to me by debconf
<dneighbo> aobut what to do to prevent his
<dneighbo> this
<dneighbo> i thought i saved it but cant find it
<dneighbo> i tried a dpkg-reconfigure 
<dneighbo> and it didnt resend that message
<dneighbo> how can i find out what it said?
<nickr> its in ~root/mbox probably
<nickr> basically it said that if you had a previous version, it'll act funny until you whipe out all your settings and resetup it
<dneighbo> i removed .galeon
<dneighbo> and restarted and it still behaves like crap
<nickr> no no
<nickr> you have to do ..
<nickr> galeon-config-tool --clean
<dneighbo> must i do it as every user?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> sucks balls.
<nickr> but it uses teeth!
<nickr> yow.
<dneighbo>      Gconf daemon will be shutted down, so make sure you have no apps
<dneighbo>      depending on it running
<dneighbo> this is LAME
<dneighbo> it smells so much like the registry its sick
<nickr> gconf is sorta lame yea
<dneighbo> i.e. just deleting .galeon should have worked :
<dneighbo> )
<dneighbo> damn registry
<nickr> too bad galeon is like the best browser
<dneighbo> er gconf ;)
<dneighbo> yes galeon has kicked ass
<nickr> fie on you miguel!
<dneighbo> figures right when i make wife use it
<dneighbo> it has a 'registry' issue
<dneighbo> that makes her say 'this crashes as much as internet explorer'
<nickr> well if you didn't track unstable you'd be all set
<nickr> you could use konquerer instead ;)
<nickr> you know, galeon used to crash all the time for me
<nickr> but 1.1.3 has been like a rock since I got it working
<nickr> it has an uptime of like 2 weeks
<nickr> so far
<nickr> and I'm really mean to it, too
<dneighbo> yeah i was just thinking the other day
<dneighbo> i should have made this a WOODY box
<dneighbo> and just dropped to sid for stuff i couldnt find in woody
<dneighbo> as i forgot it can have issues at times
<nickr> well if you get galeon working it should be really stable
<nickr> I had a horrible time with gcof though
<nickr> the totally broke its ability to work with my nfs home directory
<dneighbo> well i had troubles iwht galeon initially on my rh6.2 box
<dneighbo> as i had to COMPILE it
<dneighbo> and gconf gave me fits
<dneighbo> never had issue on debian with it till now
<dneighbo> and it works its just highly 'unstable'
<dneighbo> hopefully that config-tool will fix things
<dneighbo> will see over next few days
<dneighbo> have you ever contacted someone about chaning their theme?
<nickr> theme?
<dneighbo> i really like this theme i just want it white instead of gray
<dneighbo> or like an 'opal' color
<dneighbo> but im too incompetent artisitcally to change it myself
<dneighbo> gtk theme
<dneighbo> i have a nasty fetish for the color red
<dneighbo> and i found a wicked theme that makes certain things red and i love it
<nickr> you could probably change individual colours in the theme
<dneighbo> but i dont like the 'dirty' grey they use for where its not red, i would rathe have it be 'opal' or 'white' of some color for a better 'contrast' to the red
<nickr> but I'w not user how exactly
<nickr> well what kind of theme is it?
<dneighbo> rage is the name
<dneighbo> i use crux for sawfish theme and it auto picks up the gtk theme base color so looks good
<nickr> yea
<nickr> hrm
<nickr> you could probably just edit the gtkrc associated with the theme
<dneighbo> you running gnome?
<nickr> yes
<dneighbo> wtf

<nickr> what an odd theme
<nickr> so you want this all opal instead of all grey?

<dtm> i'm sure that in the depths of your subconscious, nickr, you can approximate and assimilate it into something resembling a point.
<dtm> is my trust in this matter misplaced, sir?
<dtm> it is intellectuals such as we, who must band together on the "issues" that face our beloved channel.
<dtm> we must band together against the weirdos who challenge us.

<dneighbo> nickr: yes bright theme and yes odd
<dneighbo> but i have a red fetish and that theme suits it well
<chillywilly> wassat?
<nickr> I'd rather have something like Purplephilia with red instead
<chillywilly> what was the name of that  red theme?
<nickr> Rage
<dneighbo> i just really like the red they chose
Action: chillywilly is fond of AquaXen
<dneighbo> as my red fetish is particular
<nickr> chillywilly: you know Purplephilia, right?
<dneighbo> i only like a certain color of red
<chillywilly> yes
<nickr> chillywilly: imagine that with red instead of purple
<nickr> that would be sweet!
<chillywilly> ok
<nickr> Rage is more like a crappy aqua clone
<nickr> its horrible
<nickr> horrible!
<chillywilly> slow?
<chillywilly> I think I'll download it
<chillywilly> did you get it from themes.org?
Action: chillywilly could use a change of theme
<nickr> its not slow, its just too bright
<chillywilly> well this is an LCD display
<chillywilly> I get cheated out of the true color usually as stuff is brighter for the most part anyway
<chillywilly> (laptop)
<nickr> so you should go for darker/higher contrast
<nickr> for richness
<chillywilly> I think I personally like lighter themes
<chillywilly> as the dark ones depress me
<chillywilly> ;)
<nickr> I don't look at a lot of widgets
<nickr> except in galeon
<chillywilly> i don't either except for galeon and the panel
<chillywilly> gnome control center maybe
<chillywilly> the gimp
<nickr> cf http://nick.industrialmeats.com/data/pictures/screenshots/balam/balam-2002-03-14-1722.jpg
<nickr> I don't even look at my panel usually

<chillywilly> adjust volume with the volume applet now and then

<chillywilly> ah, I use gaim

<chillywilly> that's another widget app
<chillywilly> oh and of course xchat ;)
<chillywilly> (duh)
<nickr> I use gaim and galeon
<nickr> I see my panel about 3 times a day
<nickr> its always hiding under my windows
<chillywilly> you have it autohide?
<nickr> No, god no
<nickr> I have all wy windows fullscreen/borderless
<dneighbo> hmm i a loser
<dneighbo> i like rage :)
<dneighbo> sue me
<nickr> dneighbo: my lawyers will be contacting you
<dneighbo> i think opal everything with red where its red but all panels shoudl be red too
<dneighbo> themes is too slow to get purplephinalla 
<dneighbo> can one of you post it for me
<nickr> dneighbo: apt-get install gtk-engines-xenophilia
<dneighbo> hmm i have that already
<dneighbo> let me look at my installed themes :)
<dneighbo> ymmmy
<dneighbo> that would be good in red
<nickr> yea it would be very good in red
<nickr> and I think you can do it just by changing one file
<chillywilly> cool a new moz modern
<nickr> I'll investigate it later
<dneighbo> let me know if you get it to work
<dneighbo> though i am in a 'light' mood
<dneighbo> generally about every six months i switch
<dneighbo> that or i run diff machines with different types

<dtm> dneighbo: did you have an answer for my pgsql backup question up there, buddy?
<dneighbo> which one i didnt see it
<dtm> dneighbo: ok
<dtm> dneighbo: how do i back up pgsql in a way that'll be sure to get _all_ data, so as to restore it in identical state?
<dtm> i understand that there is some type of metainformation, such as BLOBs
<dneighbo> nick actually i think AquaXgen
<dneighbo> might be what i want
<dneighbo> only using red instead of their light blues (and probably same can be done by editing files)
<dneighbo> dtm: i asked the pro :)
<dneighbo> you want to do a pg_dump or pg_dumpall
<dtm> dneighbo: do i get everything by using 'pg_dump foo > foo.out' 
<nickr> wow, that was trivial
Action: nickr has ragephilia :)
<dtm> dneighbo: or do i need other options
<dneighbo> as in like 99.99% of cases this will suit you fine
<dneighbo> howwever you will also want to back up the 'data' directory as well
<dtm> dneighbo: ok  how does one deviate into the 0.01%?
<dneighbo> i.e. the file system
<chillywilly> where is rage?
<dneighbo> just in case
<dtm> dneighbo: mmhmm
<dtm> i'm sure this problem has been solved so i'll look it up
<dneighbo> dtm: in querying the pros no one has had to use other than pg_dump :)
<dtm> oh great
<dtm> dneighbo: and no options on pg_dump?
<dneighbo> um not sure what options (me forgets whats there really)
<dneighbo> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/Rage.tgz
<dtm> ok
<dtm> dneighbo: well it's good enough then.
<dneighbo> nickr: what was it you did
<nickr> http://nick.industrialmeats.com/data/themes/Ragephilia-Dark.tar.gz
<dtm> dneighbo: and i'm assuming that phpgw and dcl wouldn't require anything special anyway.
<nickr> gotta go offline for a bit
<chillywilly> never!
<dneighbo> nickr: wrong color red ":)
<dneighbo> but right thing

<Arturas> Hello
<dneighbo> hi Arturas 
<dneighbo> you read the log from the last day you were here
<dneighbo> where i said _UTF8 only workes on windows
<dneighbo> to try
<dneighbo> _SYSTEM
<dneighbo> or
<dneighbo> _DEFAULT 
<dneighbo> instead
<dneighbo> with the code snippet i left
<dneighbo> i tested and it worked here
<dneighbo> (ie designer/forms run fine) but i could not test to see if made difference for you test
<dneighbo>  widget.SetFont(wxFont(int(GConfig.get('pointSize')),wxMODERN,wxNORMA
<dneighbo> ,wxNORMAL,encoding=wxFONTENCODING_UTF8))
<dneighbo> would be
<dneighbo>  widget.SetFont(wxFont(int(GConfig.get('pointSize')),wxMODERN,wxNORMA
<dneighbo> ,wxNORMAL,encoding=wxFONTENCODING_SYSTEM))
<dneighbo> or _DEFAULT or you might try ROI8 i think for you
<dneighbo> er cryillic
<Arturas> hm
<Arturas> tried at home to run
<Arturas> encoding=wx...UTF8
<Arturas> and no good results
<Arturas> tried also with
<ra3vat> hello
<Arturas> Hi :)
<Arturas> system and default
<Arturas> also no results
<Arturas> but i start to believe
<ra3vat> Arturas: encoding in gnue.conf is for database encoding 
<Arturas> that's my linux configuration problem
<Arturas> [or python]
<Arturas> ra3vat: ?
<Arturas> ra3vat: don't use that now
<ra3vat> # Hack for db encoding
<ra3vat> Encoding=DEFAULT
<dneighbo> hey Arturas the code you pasted me for 'default/system' was wrong
<dneighbo> thats why i siad use what i gave you exactly :)
<dneighbo> if only everyone would just read/write/speak english ;)
Action: Arturas feels unhappy today - whole world kicks his ass :)
<Arturas> ok
<ra3vat> ********************************
<ra3vat> Anyone who care about i18n support please raise two commands
<ra3vat> at your python's prompt:
<ra3vat> import locale; locale.getdefaultlocale()
<ra3vat> import sys; sys.getdefaultencoding()
<ra3vat> and give output back here or to my email on ds@ics.elcom.ru
<ra3vat>  
<ra3vat> mine system gives the next:

<ra3vat>  
<ra3vat> Thanks
<ra3vat> ***************************************
<Arturas> can't do this now - sitting under windows ;(
<ra3vat> why not to do it under windows?
<ra3vat> if you have python there
<Arturas> in what way? here is no python
<ra3vat> binary snapshot?

<chillywilly> how is everyone?
Harald1 (Peter1234@pD95177DF.dip.t-dialin.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> hi Harald1
<Harald1> hi
<Harald1> is anybody here with an uptodate version (0.2.0a) of designer under linux, who can test if a bug occours under linux, too?
<chillywilly> I usually run it out of cvs
<chillywilly> is that the cvs version?
<Harald1> yes 
<Harald1> it's just that it does not occur with 0.1.1
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> do you need to have a working databse setup?
<chillywilly> in order to text what you are testing
<chillywilly> er, test
<Harald1> try making any object in designer, and delete it via the context menu
<Harald1> no, no database
<chillywilly> ok
Action: chillywilly waits for the cvs up to finish
<chillywilly> ho hum
<chillywilly> it si taking an awful long time
<chillywilly> s/si/is
<chillywilly> an unually long time too
<chillywilly> er, unusually
<Harald1> well a 2-3 days old version should do it, roo
<chillywilly> it is almost done
<chillywilly> I don't think I really have any updates to get anyway
<chillywilly>  cvs uped the yesterday
<chillywilly> er, I
<chillywilly> ah, a few patches
<chillywilly> ok
<Harald1> chillywilly: ok, then I know what I have to do later ... :)
<chillywilly> uh?
<chillywilly> I haven't tried it yet
<chillywilly> I just installed it again
<chillywilly> what sotta objetc should I put on there?
<chillywilly> anythingi fromt he toolbar?
<chillywilly> anything from the toolbar?
<Harald1> chillywilly: yes anything, button etc.
<chillywilly> right click and try to delete it right?
Action: chillywilly puts a button on there
<Harald1> chillywilly: with doing later I meant, doing an update myself
<Harald1> yes
<chillywilly> it crashed
<Harald1> ok, thank you
<chillywilly> danielb@obfuscation:~/bin$ ./gfdes 
<chillywilly> Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate image file in pixmap_path: "up.png" line 476

<chillywilly> hrrm
<chillywilly> line 16
<Harald1> that's pretty much the same as under windows
<chillywilly> bah, that's not very helpful
<chillywilly> (the line 16 crap)
<Harald1> I already tracked the bug so far down, that it happens, if LayoutDesigner's OnDelete is called
<chillywilly> ah but there is a core file
<Harald1> though it doesn't crash right in there, but sometime later
<chillywilly> no debugging symbols though
<chillywilly> ah
<chillywilly> you put some traces in there?
<Harald1> actually I worked with GDebug messages
<chillywilly> does it crash if you delete a widget a different way?
<Harald1> ?
<chillywilly> isn't there another wayt o delete a widget besides using the context menu?
<Harald1> it doesn't crash if I replace the Destroy() with Show(false) and designer works a expected. Just a waste of resources
<chillywilly> maybe not
<Harald1> chillywilly: I don't know, but the problem is the deletion itself, if you want, I can point you to the line numbers
<Harald1> chillywilly: why not?
<chillywilly> I don't know that code
<chillywilly> well I didn't see another way to delete a widget
<chillywilly> i dunno I haven't used designer and/or forms much myself...I hack the app server
<chillywilly> 2-tier is so yesterday ;)
Action: chillywilly waits for the 2-tier police to show up
<Harald1> chillywilly: I can't wait to see geas2 ...
<Harald1> I'm using 2-tier only, because one shouldn't use geas1
<chillywilly> true
<chillywilly> and if I was more motivated i would port some software of mine to a 2-tier solution for right now
<chillywilly> but I am just probably going to wait
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> as I am spending more of my time on the design of geasv2
<Harald1> you already started coding or still designing? Will it still use C?
<chillywilly> it will be in python
<chillywilly> we are defining the architecture and client API
<chillywilly> then we will code
<chillywilly> at least that's the plan
<chillywilly> i dunno I am at the mercy of the GEAS masta ;)
<chillywilly> (reinhard)
<chillywilly> what he says goes
<Harald1> yes, I know. Are any documents available about the design?
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> there's a whitepaper and api doc at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~reinhard/
<chillywilly> it is just a start, needs more work, imho
<chillywilly> (not to say that it is bad or anything like that just incomplete)
Action: chillywilly does not wish to anger anyone here
<Harald1> chillywilly: that's sometimes difficult, if English isn't your antive language, as one doesn't know, if a formulation is to harsh 
<Harald1> antive = native
<chillywilly> I don't follow you?
<chillywilly> s/?//
<chillywilly> what do you mean by a formulation?
<chillywilly> my point was that it is a very rough draft
<chillywilly> that's all
<chillywilly> nothing to do with english or anything like that
<Harald1> chillywilly: that's what I mean, I don't know the English word for the German one
<chillywilly> oh
<Harald1> and what I said was mainly directed at myself
<chillywilly> uhuh
<chillywilly> no worries
<chillywilly> :)
<Harald1> coming back to the bug: could you tell me which python version you're using?
<chillywilly> 2.1
<chillywilly> 2.1.2 to be more exact
<chillywilly> on debian unstable

<chillywilly> where do you work anyway?

<psu> we kept all the 8088 and 8086 base units

<dtm> nickr: hi
<psu> I was just the manager - stayed away from tech details

<psu> most bizzare thing was they rang the rifle range to check it would be OK

<nickr> yes, I was having trouble with the mobo, it was bad.

<dtm> Please, Chilly, don't hurt em.
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> how can you hurt the API?
<chillywilly> it's only a bab
<chillywilly> y
<javaguy> CW: List.conditions is a list of strings?
<chillywilly> er?
<chillywilly> I dunno
<chillywilly> javaguy: look in gnue/geas/doc/odmg.txt once and look at the metadata api there once
<chillywilly> i dunno why once would want a list of ibjects of a particular class when they can use a nice metadat api to find out info on objects
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> and thise 'conditions'
<chillywilly> can be OQL pedicates
<chillywilly> er, predicates
<chillywilly> (look at the collection interfaces)
<chillywilly> there's a Database interface that I have yet to document that lets you get a  'Module' object whith its schema() operation
<chillywilly> you get a graph of metadata object that describes the schema
<chillywilly> objects
<chillywilly> I think this is a lot nicer ;)
<javaguy> this is the interpolation referenced elsewhere?
