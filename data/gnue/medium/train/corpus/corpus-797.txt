<dtm> ok i'm here
<derek> well get to compiling that thing
<dtm> ah'm awn it
<dtm> as;jf
<derek> you compiling there dtm
<dtm> #@*%!
<derek> ?
<derek> getting no where fast?
<derek> ????
<derek> ....
<dtm> ok sorry i was in a christian chat
<dtm> just kinda fascinating to me to see people openly talking faithfully before complete strangers :)
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dtm> psu++
<psu> sorry, I only come in non-OO varieties ;-)
<dtm> yeah i gotcha
<dtm> well i hope you find your state sufficiently robust nontheless :>
<derek> dtm i need to go to bed
<psu> nite derek
<derek> let me know how it works out in the end
<dtm> i'm reading the man page for 'pg_dumpall';
<derek> you compile that program
<derek> and run it ok?
<derek> that is what i am most curious about
<dtm> so i only need to do 'pg_dumpall > db.out' and then run the other app we mentioned
<derek> can it compile and run
<dtm> it's compiled; it comes with pgslq
<dtm> pgsql
<derek> and does it let you get into the database
<derek> huh?
<derek> that pg_xlog thing came with it?
<dtm> pg_resetxlog, yeah
<dtm> it's in the 'contrib' dir
<derek> cool
<derek> and it compiled ok
<dtm> but 'pg_dumpall' requires that postmaster is running.
<derek> and you ran it out?
<dtm> well it came compiled
<dtm> but i can't back up first
<derek> and you can restart the postmaster?
<derek> no
<dtm> so should I run it first
<dtm> then back up?
<derek> you have to run that pg_resetxlog to fix your file
<derek> so you can restart postmaster
<dtm> then initdb, then do the restoration command?
<derek> then do a pg_dumpall
<dtm> ok stand bu
<dtm> by
<derek> and view the output
<derek> if it looks good you are done
<derek> if it looks funky
<derek> you will have to hand edit it and reload
<dtm> ah crap my db had recently crashed due to kernel panic
<dtm> ok it's reset
<derek> huh?
<derek> so its reset can you restart postmaster?
<dtm> not yet; now i'm getting permission problems
<dtm> filesystem perms
<derek> on a restart
<dtm> FATAL 2:  open(logfile 0 seg 2) failed: Permission denied
<dtm> yessir
<derek> um
<dtm> sorry to have delayed in resuming these operations, sir
<dtm> su -l postgres -s /bin/sh -c "/usr/bin/pg_ctl  -D /var/lib/pgsql/data -p /usr/bin/postmaster start  "
<dtm> that's what i ran
<derek> login a terminal as root
<derek> the do
<derek> su postgres
<derek> then
<derek> run that program
<dtm> oh yeah
<derek> then log out
<derek> and as just normal root run
<derek> /etc/init.d/postgres restart (debian) or /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgres restart (redhat)
<derek> or whatever you do to restart postgres
<dtm> it starts!
<derek> i would try this on my machine but i really dont want to reload my pg_control file:)
Action: derek does the happy dude dance
<dtm> you were right; i ran it as root rather than 'postgres'
<dtm> heheh yeah thanks anyway :>
<dtm> but i've shown you the importance of backing up that file too huh?:)
<derek> not too much
<dtm> so i think we've _all_ learned a little something here tonight.
<derek> as if you had good backup
<derek> probably easier to just initdb it
<derek> and reload data
<derek> however not all bad idea and good to know this exists
<derek> as most people (me included) only back up nightly
<derek> so if system freaked at 5pm
<dtm> so if i have my pg_dumpall output, then i dont need anything but a compatible pgsql installation, in order to fully restore and have identical operations, right?
<derek> this could save me from losing a days worth of data :)
<derek> right
<dtm> ok
<derek> pg_dump man page shoudl tell you how to reload it
<derek> but as stated its in there
<dtm> so in that case i wouldn't need my pg_control file or any other file, right?
<derek> so you SHOULD NOT have to reload it
<derek> UNLESS it looks corrupt
<dtm> well i dont know how to look except to click around in the GUI for my web apps
<derek> well i would do a pg_dump
<derek> REGARDLESS so you have a back up :)
<derek> but then look at the output make sure it doesnt look like any data is missing etc
<derek> you are probably fine as is 
Action: derek is currently listening to : 14-15=( artist - PAX217 - Prizm 15| 4:08 )15=14-
<dtm> hmm
<derek> but doing a dump and a restore wont 'fix anything'
<derek> you have to do a dump
<dtm> oh ok
<derek> then edit the dump to fix it 
<derek> then reload
<derek> but please do the dump :)
<derek> and do it nightly :)
<derek> and save it to another media source than that hard disk
<dtm> ok so if i only want to backup/mirror my working DCL database then i use 'pg_dump' to dump the entire db, copy the resulting file to the 2nd host, then use 'psql -f data.out dcl'  right?
<dtm> then my 2nd host has identical DCL operations?
<derek> not sure of syntax w/o looking but yes
<derek> but it will only have data as of last dump
<dtm> assuming the rest of the system is set up (apache, php, pgsql, linux username, and pgsql username/perms)
<derek> so its not a 'real time' mirror
<dtm> so that's it, right/
<dtm> correct
<derek> but rather mirror as of last 'sync'
<dtm> that's good enough for light usage
<derek> i call it an 'oh shit' mirror
<dtm> for a two person workgroup that would be pretty high tech
<dtm> yeah
<dtm> so is my perspective on backup/mirror correct?
<derek> yip
<dtm> i could then just failover to the 2nd host/
<derek> i would use rsync
<dtm> *elite*
<dtm> yes i will
<dtm> via rsa-auth ssh
<derek> yip
<dtm> wont be much data anyhow
<dtm> and i'll do it frequently
<dtm> multiple times per day
<derek> you can do as frequently as you see fit only limitation is time it takes :)
<derek> i.e. if it takes 10 minutes to execute the pg_dump
<dtm> DCL doesn't have a problem if the server it's running on, has a dynamic IP addr, right?
<dtm> yeah
<derek> most often you coudl do it is every 10 minutes :)
<dtm> and i dont have to stop the db in order to run 'pg_dump' right?
<derek> um i dont recall i do not think so 
<dtm> ok
<derek> it goes by name and you can set that to like ./
<derek> or something
<dtm> yeah
<derek> no you do NOT stop the db for pg_dump
Action: derek is currently listening to : 14-15=( FINE_YOUNG_CANNIBALS-She_Drives_Me_Crazy 15| 3:39 )15=14-
<derek> and it should work w/ people in the system
<dtm> but 'pg_dumpall' apparently tells the restore process to clobber all potential target data
<dtm> overlapping data, that is
<dtm> so if there's already a db called 'dcl' or whatever in the target pgsql installation, will the target db 'dcl' be totally erased and overwritten, resulting in an identical copy?
<derek> also verify tomorrow with jamest (he is postgres stud muffin)
<derek> if he uses this method for back up
<derek> i have in past as i had problem doing just the data files
<derek> but i believe pg_dump doesnt get partial indexes or something (not a huge deal)
<dtm> ok
<dtm> heheh
<dtm> doing what data files
<dtm> you mean backing it up from the filesystem?
<derek> dtm: i dont recall you can tell from the dump file
<derek> dtm: yeah
<dtm> yeah pg_dump doesn't get overall db objects
<dtm> only that which is directly inside a single db
<derek> right
<derek> pg
<derek> er
<derek> pg_dump for single db
<dtm> yeah
<derek> pg_dumpall all dbs plus shadow
<dtm> well ok you go to bed then
<dtm> derek: you are loved and admired by many
<derek> cool so you are set and back in business?

<derek> you back up the file system files?

<jamest> both
<derek> how do you normally restore from a failure?

<jamest> my backup run does the whole machine
<jamest> also I date stamp my pg_dumps 
<jamest> and keep the last few weeks worth
<derek> right but if your database gets toast
<derek> do you restore it from file system or a pg_dump?
<derek> or does it depend on the failure type

<Harald1> ok. is anything decided about how the merge will be executed? will only the db-structure of dcl stay?
<derek> Harald1: not fully decided
<derek> the first thing you will see is that dcl is getting more external development
<derek> as of today some rbac stuff was submitted as a patch
<derek> while it might not be the long term direction it solves some important issues immediately
<derek> also in the cvs head branch you will notice GNUe Forms (non web screens) for DCL being checked in
<derek> the contact management portion will be much much more robust in next DCL
<derek> and probably even further extened into real CRM in the GNUe CRM stuff
<derek> i have to run :(
<Harald1> bye. thank you.
<derek> will be back in an hour or so
<derek> btw: if the db structures change the upgrade path will handle
<derek> example we are gutting the contact stuff heavily on the db side
<derek> and main reason its not released is (we need more testing) and because we will have to write a 'program' to upgrade the database
<derek> instead of simply doing ALTER tables
<Harald1> but the GNUe forms are already in cvs?
<derek> yes
<derek> mostly maintainance ones
<derek> i have some others too that arent in cvs that need cleaning up

<SachaS> the people have different projects.
<SachaS> they are placed between computer science and business
<SachaS> they want to realise business solutions with computer science help
<SachaS> one big thing was all the time:
<SachaS> modelling
<SachaS> they want to have modelling tools.
<SachaS> like uml

<SachaS> in particular
<reinhard> yeah

<SachaS> only programmers can handle it
<SachaS> mostly
<SachaS> but if you have modelling tools
<reinhard> yeah
<SachaS> you can focus on a higher level
<SachaS> kind of.
<reinhard> that's what we are planning anyway
<reinhard> at least it was my understanding
<reinhard> to have a "designer" for geas
<SachaS> ok.
<reinhard> that will work on a high level
<reinhard> and save it into xml files and/or database
<SachaS> then there was another topic.
<SachaS> maybe you heard of BPML Business Process Modelling Language
<reinhard> never
<SachaS> :)
<SachaS> i "heard" about it.
<reinhard> what is it?
<reinhard> is it like our gcd language?
<SachaS> www.bpml.org
<SachaS> sorry i cant tell you. I did not read the specification. From my reading (around) I understand that it is more based on "MODELLING"
<SachaS> thats maybe not the best base for a discussion.
<SachaS> to get your brain working and model (draw) what is going on in the enterprise
<SachaS> I want to have a look at it tomorrow and come back tomorrow, to be prepared.
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> i'm downloading the spec now
<SachaS> :)
<reinhard> oh well
<SachaS> It seems, that with BPML you model the enterprise business.
<reinhard> i'd say I tried to
<SachaS> the next step is inter-enterprise business
<reinhard> server seems down or link broken or whatever
<SachaS> and there you can model with ebXML (electronic business XML).
<reinhard> i think i got that
<SachaS> ebXML focues heavily on inter enterprise business, called collaborations.
<SachaS> ok.
<SachaS> so problems are: enterprise wide you have BPML and inter-enterprise wide you have ebXML.
<SachaS> problem: you need some kind of mapping.
<reinhard> well BPML mention ebXML on their homepage
<reinhard> so i guess they are somehow related
<SachaS> i guess it is similar with programming languages. a server is written in c and a client in java. so you need a mapping. c does not have exceptions so you have to handle exceptions somehow.
<SachaS> and the somehow is the question. and there are probably many ways .
<SachaS> that what i wanted to tell you from sweden, more or less.
<reinhard> cool
<SachaS> did I say I study BPML for tomorrow ...... ahhh.
<SachaS> #@!)(1^!
<reinhard> have you already found what you need for your ebxml project?
<SachaS> good questions. i keep changing the topic. before was it the interface ebXML and ERP (or business application). The current topic is how to derive a Collaboration Protocol Agreement (CPA) from 2 Collaboration Protocol Profiles (CPP).
<reinhard> hehe
<SachaS> i found 2 supervisors! I need two. One knows XML the other electronic business.
<reinhard> cool
<SachaS> yes. how about you? did you get more time for GNUe?
<reinhard> not yet :(
<reinhard> silly customers keep buying my stuff
<reinhard> ;)
<SachaS> good.
<reinhard> it's weird
<reinhard> i do zero advertising
<SachaS> i read you talked about geas version 2 :)
<SachaS> maybe the just like it.
<reinhard> it's a 20 year old program basically that i support now
<SachaS> just like the support.
<SachaS> the must like the support
<reinhard> it dosn't run on win versions > ME
<reinhard> and i made 3 new installs within the last month
<SachaS> ???
<reinhard> all companies that saw the program at other companies
<SachaS> actually it must not run on ME to be better at all.
<reinhard> and asked them where they can get it
<reinhard> lol
<SachaS> good for you.
<reinhard> yeah of those 3 installs
<reinhard> 1 was GNU/Linux and 1 was FreeBSD
<SachaS> :) really?
<reinhard> yes
<SachaS> are you also in charge for backup, administration of the software?
<reinhard> seriously it's a zero administration system
<reinhard> i've got cumstomers i didn't hear from for years
<reinhard> but they still work with it every day
<SachaS> it must be like the vw combi year 1975 I use here!
<reinhard> :)
<SachaS> ok. i am off to bed. See you tomorrow. bye

<Harald1> I am just playing a bit around with designer and I am wondering how uptodate the BUGS file is?
Action: drochaid wonders if he should get some for dneighbo as well
<Harald1> because it describes that under win32 the "new" submenu do not work. But they work correctly here...
<Arturas> Hello Derek
<jamest> Harald1: just let us know and we'll fix the BUGS list
<jamest> do all the optoins work?
<Harald1> I didn't try every wizard, but "New->Form" creates a new window with an empty form, and "New->Wizard" creates a new window and starts a wizard
<dneighbo> no no no :)
<dneighbo> please please please
<dneighbo> use DCL to file any bugs
<dneighbo> soon the bugs file should be generated from there
<dneighbo> until then consider the bugs file out of date :)
<Harald1> ok. how exactly do I have to configure dcl, to submit bugs etc. to gnue?
<dneighbo> um go to 
<dneighbo> https://dcl.sourceforge.net/dclgw/
<dneighbo> i think there is a guest account
<dneighbo> and of course right now i dont recall it (grr that was on my list to add to the page)
<dneighbo> try guest guest
<dneighbo> VERY soon (as soon as on a weekend i can corral jamest)
<dneighbo> it will be as easy as submiting a bug to
<dneighbo> bugs@gnuenterprise.org
<dneighbo> to file a bug
<Harald1> but bugs still should be send to bugs@gnuenterprise.org?
<dneighbo> send it to info@gnue.org for now
<dneighbo> as im not sure who bugs would go to
<dneighbo> jamest: please note we need to get this stuff squared away...
<dneighbo> i will try to enter some tickets for it
<dneighbo> if i get a chance
<dneighbo> im drowning here though :(
<dneighbo> Harald1 it is guest & guest

Action: dneighbo is looking to make dcl better at some of this (bug tracking kind of stuff)
<dneighbo> in the help desk side of the fence
<Harald1> i'll look at it as soon as the page loads here
<Harald1> which port was https on?
<dneighbo> um 80 i think
<dneighbo> if you go to http://gnuenterprise.org/dclgw/
<dneighbo> it should redirect you to the https
<Harald1> no that gives me a 404
<dneighbo> hmm your browseer support https?
<Harald1> well i tried ie (*ducks) and lynx
<dneighbo> hmm
<dneighbo> try fully qualified
<dneighbo> https://www.gnuenterprise.org/dclgw/
<dneighbo> if that fails then try
<dneighbo> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/
<dneighbo> if that fails, make sure you can get out on the net in general from that machine
<Harald1> https://www.gnuenterprise.org/dclgw/ works
<dneighbo> cool
<Harald1> though that's useless for me at the moment, as I can't post anything, right?
<dneighbo> yeah
<dneighbo> you could see 'filed' tickets and 'work orders'
<dneighbo> etc
<dneighbo> if you want to file bugs (we would love it)

<linas> jamest: hi, also long time ... 
<linas> jamest: yes I understand, glade won't run on win or mac, that is not my concern.
<linas> I was thinking of something simple though:
<linas> <datasource table="inventory" name="inventory" database="devel"/> just like in forms today, and
Yurik_ (~yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) joined #gnuenterprise.
<linas> <glade gwidget="glade widget name" field="table.fieldname" >
<linas> of course its a bit more complicated, since you have to know what kind of glade widget
<linas> it is to poke date into it (or pull data out).
<linas> but hopefully, it wouldn't really be a whole lot more complicated ...
<linas> I would not want to modify glade *at all*
<linas> although you'd have this hassle of having to hand-write xml to match glade fields to db fields ...

<linas> you'd need to use xml parser to read the hookups
<btami> hi all
<Yurik> drochaid: thanks
<jamest> so glade would draw the form and gfclient would run it, is that what you are saying?
<btami> jamest: have you received my 1 line patch email?
<jamest> the icon size patch?
<btami> yes
<jamest> yes, I'll try and get it applied tonight
<btami> OK, thanks
<reinhard> jamest: is python 2 in woody
<reinhard> or in sid?
<jamest> woody has up to 2.2
<jamest> 2.1 IIRC is the default install now
<reinhard> i did
<reinhard> apt-get python
<reinhard> and it installed 1.5.2
Action: jamest blinks
<jamest> reinhard....a debian user?
Action: reinhard is a debian newbie
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> for 2 days now
<jamest> you running woody?
<reinhard> :)
<reinhard> yep
<btami> sorry, what IIRC means?
<jamest> If I Recall Correctly
<reinhard> suse 6.4 doesn't contain python 2
<reinhard> and i decided to not buy suse any more
<jamest> reinhard: you have woody lines in your /etc/apt/source.list 
<reinhard> out of ideological and technical reasons
<jamest> and no stable lines
<reinhard> um
<jamest> linas: if we do this what are we gaining?  I'm trying to figure out the angle you are comming from
<reinhard> jamest: all lines have the word stable in them
<reinhard> i guess that's not correct
<jamest> reinhard: that is potato
<reinhard> why does my woody cd do that?
<reinhard> um
<jamest> stable - potato
<reinhard> on the cd label it said woody
<reinhard> :)
<jamest> what I would do is 
<jamest> apt-get install netselect
<jamest> netselect-apt woody
<reinhard> thanks
<jamest> this will create a source.list file that contains fastest mirrors for your machine
<jamest> hand copy the lines over of copy over it
<jamest> then
<jamest> apt-get update
<jamest> apt-get -u dist-upgrade
<jamest> the -u lets you see what it's going to do and confirm the updates
<jamest> if you hit errors in the update typically you can do this...
<jamest> apt-get -u dist-upgrade
<jamest> <error occurs>
<jamest> apt-get -f install
<jamest> apt-get -u dist-upgrade
Action: jamest is off to spread joy amongst the users
<jamest> now where's my bat
<reinhard> seems like its netselect not netselect-apt
<reinhard> jamest: thanks a lot
<jamest> netselect-apt may be a command with woody's netselect package
<jamest> it produces the sources.list file automagically
<reinhard> i have no command netselct-apt
<reinhard> netselect-apt
<jamest> if you don't want to hand code then just replace the stable with woody in the existing file
<reinhard> ok
<jamest> you can also put testing in there but I don't recommned it
<jamest> as some day woody switches to stable and sid to testing
<reinhard> ok
<jamest> you don't catch the announcement and do a dist-upgrade and <blam> you are now running sid :)
Action: jamest speaks from experience on that one :)
<reinhard> what is the diff between upgrade and dist-upgrade
<reinhard> ?
<jamest> dist-upgrade trys to be intellegent about the updates
<jamest> it's upgrade with dependency checking
<jamest> man apt-get will explain it on the first page IIRC
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> thanks again
<reinhard> doing dist-upgrade now
<reinhard> looks good :)
yogurt2unge (~charlie@modem42-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<Harald1> just a quick question: should debug->run in designer work?
<linas> jamest: I've got to develop a pretty looking glade app; its gotta be pretty or they'll
<linas> make me code in VB. Ughh.  I'm using glade and some custom gtk widgets.
<linas> Its mostly data-driven: which means most of it is gnue-forms-like
<linas> so I'm scratching my head: what's the easiest way from here to there?
<linas> I could do it from scratch, I could enhance gnue-forms, I could try bond/bonddb
<btami> reinhard: take a look at http://archive.progeny.com/progeny/debian/doc
<btami> reinhard: there is a 400 page users guige (GPL now)

<Harald1> jamest: something serious? I did some quick changes and it does run forms now, though I am not sure if everything is correct
<btami> nothing
<linas> jamest: every half hour I change my mind. The from-scartch approach is to hack some xml
<linas> that hooks up odbc table.fields to libglade widget names.  Should be easy, but ...
<jamest> Harald1: nothing serious just we didn't fix is after a while
<linas> but it leaves me cold for a long-term strategy (reports, etc.)
<jamest> linas: can you define "pretty"
<Harald1> jamest: looked like it. as everything is there, you just have to make the connections
<linas> jamest: "pretty looking": mxiture of buttons, menus, radio/select, text areas with padding and glitz
<jamest> work on dynamic menus is in the works, buttons work, text areas work
<jamest> glitz i don't know about :)
<linas> jamest: I also have some custom scrolling strip-chart widgets and a satellite photo map underlay.

Chipaca (~john@modem42-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> StyXman: whassup
<linas> jamest: now I have to hook up a bunch of forms to a database thats the easy/hard part
<linas> jamest: easy but tedious; alternately, hard if I try to merge into gnue :-(  
<linas> spend a dollar to save a penny
<dneighbo> i dont have time to read back log
<dneighbo> linas glade support is a WASTE
<dneighbo> if you want glade use glade
<dneighbo> our designer IMHO is superior to glade at this point and cross platform
<dneighbo> i assume your "issues" are either
<dneighbo> a. lack  of 'cool' widget support
<dneighbo> or
<dneighbo> b. you desire native gtk
<dneighbo> if you want (a) forms really isnt too interested in that, i suggest just using glade
<dneighbo> if you desire native gtk simply write a UIgtk.py file
<dneighbo> i personally see glade as having nothing to do with forms
<jamest> linas: you may want to see about mixing and matching, using forms where it saves you time
<Chipaca> dneighbo: what's 'native' in this context? 
<jamest> as designer wizards make that part so easy
<dneighbo> a year ago, someone could convince me that perhaps glade could be retrofited to be our designer
<dneighbo> but honestly now our designer is there and it 'rocks'(tm)
<dneighbo> so i cant see going backwards :)
<jamest> but dropping to glade where you need the glitz
<dneighbo> if you just want easy databinding in glade
<dneighbo> there are lots of projects that are doing databinding for glade
<jamest> now it may be possible to extend the forms client to do more
<dneighbo> gnome-db being one of them
<jamest> ie: support widget plugins, but that's going to take work :)
<dneighbo> im not trying to be too harsh here, but we have hashed these in the past :)
<dneighbo> making gnue MORE complex isnt our goal :)
<dneighbo> Chipaca native in this context means no abstraction
<dneighbo> wx uses NATIVE widgets but doesn through an abstraction
<dneighbo> UIgtk.py would us pyGTK or something to natively talk to the gtk
<dneighbo> UIwxwindows.py talks to the wx api
<dneighbo> which then talks to gtk or win32 etc
<dneighbo> by authoring a UIgtk.py
<dneighbo> one is then removed of all wx dependencies
<dneighbo> and simply must have the gtk stuff
<dneighbo> if that makes sense
<dneighbo> i guess linas ran away.....
<dneighbo> and dangit i have a gnucash question

<drochaid> I got away from that when I stopped using Access '95
<Isomer> dneighbo: It doesn't matter which one is faster -- since what really matters is if you can index things.
<dneighbo> drochaid : everyone who says mysql fast (a year ago)
<drochaid> talk about the best way to screw useability of even a small 16 person db
<Isomer> mysql until recently couldn't index any column that wasn't NOT NULL.
<dneighbo> iw ould say ok write report that endlessly loops or does a nasty query that takes more than 5 minutes
<dneighbo> then have people do data entry at same time
<dneighbo> they woudl say 'it froze' mysql
<dneighbo> we cant enter data
<dneighbo> thats when i gave them teh genius award :)
<drochaid> Isomer, dneighbo ... is it still the case that MySQL does not handle UNION or other rather usefull statements?
<Isomer> where as on undernet we have an index on "lower(username);"
<Isomer> drochaid: I don't believe it does UNION, but it does do LEFT/RIGHT/OUTER joins
<Isomer> drochaid: but doesn't do subselects
<drochaid> so it's getting better then ;)
<drochaid> I heard you can *fudge* sub-selects .. not pretty tho

<dneighbo> make sure you document and close it out
<dneighbo> psu i will comment later on your report thing
<dneighbo> i think you might be overseeing the issue
<dneighbo> and how xslt and transformations might work
<dneighbo> i see two specifications
<dneighbo> one for how the format looks (the .grd)
<dneighbo> and one for how the data is spit back to me in file or stream
<psu> no problem
<dneighbo> i think jcater was trying to point that way engine works you need somethings in the layout (.grd)
<dneighbo> that muddy its readability
<dneighbo> and thus use xlnms for that
<dneighbo> and so the parser doesnt gag
<psu> a bit like you, I have a favourite proprietary reports package
<psu> that i'm hoping to sucker jcater into 
<dneighbo> btw: i need to reread his mail too
<psu> doing a free implemenation of ;-)
<psu> pref w/o too many donuts involved
<dneighbo> well i don tthink there is a package out there that does what i want :)
<dneighbo> and that is to uncouple the report query from the report
<psu> me neither actually
<psu> but I suppose we start from what we know + our own wishlist
<psu> jamest - any progress on getting me the stuff I need to become trainee webslave?
<psu> I have several jobs I've assigned myself in DCL
<psu> and should have some free time next week to do them
<psu> just need the relevant access
<psu> I may not be around much longer tonight 
<psu> but we can discuss via email if necessary
<jamest> um
<jamest> you're wanting to do web stuff?
<jamest> on the FSF site or gnue.org site?
<Harald1> dneighbo: no I did not post it to dcl
<linas> dneighbo: hi again walked away for a moment
<linas> dneighbo: read your comments, did I hit a nerve?
<Harald1> dneighbo: to dcl I posted, that a bug described in the BUGS file is obsolete
<jamest> linas: we constantly have to defend keeping the gfd simple :)
<linas> jamest: yeah, my biggest failing with gnucash was not policing it enough
<dtm> hi
<linas> its weird, you want to encourage contributors, so you don't want to piss people off,
<linas> but its hard to say "don't implement that its a bad idea" without pissing them off
<dtm> linas: are you a gnucash maintainer?
<linas> or accidentally specing something thats too grandioise for them to implement.
<dtm> i'm sensing senior gnucash staff here
<dneighbo> linas didnt mean to piss you off
<linas> dtm: it would be accurate to say, not much, not anymore 
<dneighbo> just saying that we have talked a lot in the past
<dneighbo> and im saying we disagree on philosphy
<dtm> linas: oh.  well gnucash seems to be a good thing, so thanks :)
<linas> but I wrote 90% for the first 50 or 100KLOCS
<dneighbo> as evidenced by somethign things in gnucash :)
<dtm> linas: i've never used it coz i couldn't figure out how to compile the bleeding edge libs it needed when i tried it about 2yrs ago :)
<dneighbo> im all for contributions
<dtm> linas: i need to use either that or the appgen.com stuff
<dtm> linas: Intuit is a non-option ;>
<dneighbo> im just saying what you are proposing doesnt make a lot of sense
<dneighbo> as iirc glade has some databinding capablities or so i hear
<linas> dneighbo: I sense hostility?  wazzup?
<dneighbo> in fact grib was even touting his own set
<dneighbo> not trying to be hostile
Action: dtm tosses dneighbo a couple of Scooby Snacks in the form of whole pizzas
<dneighbo> it is of course gpl software and you can do as you like
<dneighbo> and we would support you in it unless it was really whacked :)
<dtm> hey sometimes when designers/implementers disagree, they need to generate some proof-of-concept code.  :}  just a thought.

<dneighbo> hi jcater 
<dneighbo> how is life on the road?
<dneighbo> Lars_G this is a nice channel
<jcater> swell
<dneighbo> um jcater i will respond here
<dneighbo> becuase what im thinking and what legal documents need are SMART forms
<dneighbo> example
<dneighbo> you say this house belongs to:
<dneighbo> ::variable:: 
<dneighbo> but then you have to go ONE MORE STEP
<dneighbo> do you say
<dneighbo> man and wife
<dneighbo> single person
<dneighbo> etc
<dneighbo> actually that is bad example
<dneighbo> an example woudl be multiple borrowers
<dneighbo> or multi line addresses
<dneighbo> grr this is hard to explain as its been a while
<jcater> those are common reporting requirements
<jcater> I have to account for multiline addresses in a lot of our customer service reports
<jcater> that mail letters to customers
<dneighbo> no im talking i make a DEEDS document
<dneighbo> and i have a database field called relationship type
<dneighbo> 1 - married
<dneighbo> 2 - individual
<dneighbo> 3 - something else etcc
<dneighbo> and i have a lots of verbiage following that that is NOT in the database
<dneighbo> that is conditionally printed
<nickr> hrm. I have some work in that area put in.
<dneighbo> so if its type one the paragraph reads
<dneighbo> AS MARRIED COUPLE WHO BLAH BLAH BLAH
<dneighbo> and it varies by STATE
<dneighbo> so TX might be
<dneighbo> AS MARRIED COUPLE BAH FOO
<dneighbo> and OH
<dneighbo> AS MARRIED COUPLE yuck foo
<dneighbo> you wouldnt want to necessarily make a custom DEED for each state
<dtm> heh.
<dneighbo> but rather dynamically build the form based on some rules
<jcater> I do conditional reports all the time; that's a basic requirement as far as I'm concerned
<jcater> so I don't follow
<dneighbo> so its not a mater of printing data
<dneighbo> as long it will support a complex version of this fine
<dtm> what's all this shouting about marriage?!
<dneighbo> most reporting tools do not
<dtm> is gnue auctioning off your wives?
<dneighbo> build dynamic text that is not in the database
<dtm> dneighbo: aloha and stanx for the help last night
<jcater> dude
<jcater> for one
<jcater> it'll support triggers
<dneighbo> i the verbiage options would be in form
<dneighbo> yes like triggers
<dneighbo> if it supports triggers it will do what im thinking
<jcater> btw
<jcater> in my experience
<dneighbo> im still thinking this going direction that is good but not what i had originally hoped :) but thats ok i am not writing it
<jcater> stuff like that is exactly what you'd want in support tables
<jcater> just an observation
<dneighbo> jcater: its different beastie i promise
<dneighbo> until you have done mortgage lending documents
<dneighbo> thats why i think it might need to be a separate tool
<dneighbo> currently the only people i have seen that do this are vmp
<jcater> I think you are talking very specific/extreme case for one
<dneighbo> adn they make a killing
<dneighbo> jcater um doctors and lawyers need similar as well
<jcater> and I really don't see a justification for doing a separate tool
<jcater> as if a reporting package can't handle that
<dneighbo> my chiropractor is dying for something similar
<jcater> then it needs to be rethunk
<jcater> btw
<dneighbo> im not saying it has to be a spearate package
<jcater> I agree a lot of popular reporting packages DON'T do that
<jcater> but that doesn't mean they shouldn't
<dneighbo> im just saying if people say that the functionality is stupid and doesnt belong in reports (too specialized)
<dneighbo> then we should offere as a separate tool
<dneighbo> not saying i want it as a separate too
<dneighbo> l
<nickr> just make a separate document generator that can embed reports :)
<jcater> actually
<jcater> your argument for a separate "tool" is actually an argument FOR my use of namespaces
<jcater> as this "tool" more than likely would use the underlying reporting engine
<jcater> only with modified functionality
<jcater> so maybe I shouldn't argue against you :)
<nickr> hey, now theres an idea
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I scared him off
<dneighbo> im here
<dneighbo> i agree
<dneighbo> i like the namespace solution
