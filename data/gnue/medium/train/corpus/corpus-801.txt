<btami> Harald1: maybe these dirs are not used or dead
<reinhard> sorry back
<reinhard> had a long phone
<reinhard> they are dead yes
<reinhard> the dirs
<reinhard> where did you get those names from?
<reinhard> probably an outdated documentation or somehting like that
<Harald1> well you see them in the web interface
<Harald1> and they are in the cvs snapshots
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> which web interface do you use?
<reinhard> lxr/bonsay are heavy out of sync
<reinhard> AFAIK
<Harald1> http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/gnue/gnue/
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> that should be current
<Harald1> and in the snapshots here http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/snapshots/
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> those dirs are empty
<reinhard> or only contain other (empty) directories
<reinhard> they are obsoleted
<reinhard> and if you check out using -P then empty dirs are ignored

<reinhard> hi SachaS
<SachaS> hi Reinhard. how are you?
<reinhard> thanks fine
<SachaS> i had a look at BPML today. BPML is a meta language.
<SachaS> basically a xml vocabulary for business processes.
<reinhard> ah
<SachaS> (i still am not sure where to place it in connection with a erp system, though)
<SachaS> question what is a business process?
<SachaS> "A structure for action" ... according to some guy
<reinhard> hmmm
<reinhard> i would say it is
<reinhard> an algorithm for the business
<SachaS> so basically BPML has some tags which people can use to describe their business processes (as mentioned yesterday, mainly for enterprise business processes)
<SachaS> yeah is also good.
<SachaS> I cited the specification: "A process is a specific ordering of work activities across time and place, with a beginning, an end, and clearly defined inputs and outputs"
<SachaS> the main entities of the BPML vocabulary are: - messages, - participants, - activites, - rules, -transactions and - processes.
<SachaS> what are you doing when you analised your business processes and modelled/described them with BPML?
<SachaS> I guess there is no software out there yet which "simply" parses it and executes it and voila you have a system which handles your processes.
<SachaS> what i miss is a document, specification with the title: "How do I create a state-of-the-art Enterprise Resource Planning System"
<SachaS> maybe your work can result in such a document if there is none yet.

<Arturas> Hello Derek
<dneighbo> hey Arturas 
<dneighbo> how is i18n going?
<dneighbo> you get ra3vat to test things for you?
<Arturas> yes
<dneighbo> good news or bad news?
<Arturas> he said the strings even in source code were different [they should be the same]
<Arturas> :\
<Arturas> where in forms font is set up?
<Arturas> can't find it
<Arturas> know that on file ~/.gtkrc
<dneighbo> if set anywhere would be gnue.conf
<Arturas> depends only menu-fonts
<Arturas> no
<Arturas> there is font-size, width, but not font-name
<dneighbo> then its coming from your theme of either gnome/kde or windowmanager
<dneighbo> er maybe thats not correct
<Arturas> no :)
<Arturas> if that would be, everything would be fine :)
<dneighbo> as i think we use some fixed font
<Arturas> yes :)
<Arturas> in gnue.conf
<Arturas> but somewhere has to be
<Arturas> font name and font encoding
<ra3vat> Arturas: the test shows strings as one-byte character string, so no any i18n specific symbols
<Arturas> [at least default values]
<ra3vat> no unicode
<Arturas> ra3vat: the letter was encoded in utf8
<Arturas> ra3vat: could you maybe send the same letter back to me?
<Arturas> ra3vat: (dcc?)
<ra3vat> Arturas: yes the letter was. Saw it correctly in Outlook Express with specific symbols as you described in the message 
<ra3vat> and then what?

<dneighbo> outlok express.... shame on you dmitry
<Arturas> ra3vat: you have kde?
<Arturas> :)
<ra3vat> yes
<Arturas> better than me over telnet :)
<Arturas> ra3vat: can you open the same letter in kmail?
<Arturas> kde supports cut&paste with i18n
<Arturas> copy the source into file
<Arturas> chmod 777 :)
<Arturas> and run
<dneighbo> hey Arturas 
<dneighbo> # The next 2 options are only used by the wxPython clients
<dneighbo> # Normally, default font style and size is used, according to the active theme
<dneighbo> # Set this to 1 if you want fixed width fonts
<dneighbo> fixedWidthFont = 1
<dneighbo> # Font size if fixedWidthFont = 1 (ignored otherwise)
<dneighbo> pointSize = 14
<dneighbo> this tells me that the THEME font is used
<Arturas> eys
<Arturas> m
<Arturas> yes
<Arturas> ?
<dneighbo> so that is where you would get your font information
<Arturas> what is THEME?
<dneighbo> i dont use kde so dont know how it works
<dneighbo> in gnome
<Arturas> what it is in gnome?
<dneighbo> you can edit your 'theme' for gnome or your 'theme' for your windowmanager
<Arturas> we're back again
<dneighbo> in gnome if you go to settings:gnome control center
<Arturas> 1.
<Arturas> in kde i have the same control center
<dneighbo> then
<Arturas> 2.
<dneighbo> desktop->theme selector
<Arturas> all fonts are set up for iso10646-1 encoding
<Arturas> 3.
<dneighbo> it shows the themes
<dneighbo> and you can use a USER font instead of theme font there
<dneighbo> to override the 'theme'
<Arturas> all texts in kde are displayed [with i18n data] ok
<Arturas> 4.
<Arturas> if forms uses THEME
<Arturas> they should support  i18n data too
<ra3vat> Arturas: if i got the test source from your second message (from attachment) is not it the same? 
<Arturas> but it is not so
<dneighbo> an easy way to test
<Arturas> ra3vat: the same [at least should be :]
<dneighbo> change your theme to a really ODD and DISTINGUISHING FONT
<dneighbo> then open up forms
<dneighbo> if it has that same odd font you know its using the theme
<Arturas> what does it mean: odd, distinguish?
<dneighbo> if its font remains the same you know it is not
<dneighbo> means: something you would notice
<dneighbo> i.e. make font, big and bold or something
<Arturas> ok
<ra3vat> Arturas: in the source strings encoded as multybyte utf8 string but they displayed as one-byte lenght character strings on my system
<ra3vat> another source to get info about encoding is sys.getdefaultencoding() on python's startup
<Arturas> dneighbo: i'll (*@(*#%Q!#$&%#$@)!(#* you. Made my font size 48 and now can't cancell it - cancel button is below the screen :| and i can't reach it
<Arturas> :)
<dneighbo> ouch
<dneighbo> you dont have virtual desktops
<Arturas> ra3vat: don't know
<dneighbo> hey dont kill me
<dneighbo> jamest used to configure forms so that they were like 1000 times bigger than my video card could deal with
<dneighbo> thusly crashing X entirely
<Arturas> :)
<Arturas> have desktops
<Arturas> but windows don't extend
<Arturas> they stay in the same desktop 
<dneighbo> kde sux
<Arturas> :)
<Arturas> till NOW i WAS happy :)
<dneighbo> Arturas its problaby out in a .kde file somewhere
<Arturas> ra3vat: if i'm remembering good, defaultenc. is ascii 
davi (davi@80-25-136-215.uc.nombres.ttd.es) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ra3vat> Arturas: yes, and one need to change it to use forms with i18n strings 
<ra3vat> otherwise you 'll get 
<ra3vat> DB000: UnicodeError: ASCII encoding error: ordinal not in range(128)         
<Arturas> no, if i enforce strings as unicode
<Arturas> look:
<Arturas> sstring=('i18n data','utf8')
<Arturas> sstring2=str(sstring.encode('utf8'))
<Arturas> print sstring2
<Arturas> and you'll get nice i18n data
<Arturas> (you can try ;)
<Arturas> dneighbo: no changes in forms, although kde looked really awfully
<ra3vat> yes, but i'm saying about current forms codebase 
<Arturas> so the has to be font defined as iso88-something
<Arturas> and where is it??????
<Arturas> maybe i simple missed the line :(
Action: Arturas sometimes can be really big idiot :)
<Arturas> ra3vat: by the way
<Arturas> the same sstring2 in form won't be displayed with i18n data
<ra3vat> and even without .encode(..) strings there are enforced to behave as unicode strings and if correct encoding is not provided we'll get that exception
<Arturas> it will contain something like 'A[]"
<dneighbo> im an i18n idiot
<dneighbo> so im not much help
<dneighbo> Arturas i was under impression forms was not inflicting its own font
<dneighbo> i grepped the source and am not finding anything
<Arturas> dneighbo: you are the one who knows what is going on here 
<Arturas> that's the problem
<Arturas> ra3vat: ok, let's say we have python defaultencoding unicode
<Arturas> but i believe that i18n data in forms won't be displayed anyway
<jamest> um
<ra3vat> it displayed
<Arturas> Hello jamest :)
<jamest> the font encoding is in UIwxpython
<dneighbo> forms/src/uidrivers/wx/UIdriver.py:      self.splash.SetFont(wxFont(20,wxSWISS,wxNORMAL,wxBOLD))
<dneighbo> forms/src/uidrivers/wx/UIdriver.py:      self.splash.SetFont(wxFont(10,wxSWISS,wxNORMAL,wxBOLD))

<Arturas> jamest: where is it?
<jamest> derek:that sectoin only sets the splashscreen fonts

<dneighbo> Arturas my gut (but i could be way off)
<dneighbo> is in gnue.conf
<dneighbo> allow people to set the font
<dneighbo> like we do other font options
<dneighbo> and put what is in forms now as the 'default' there
<dneighbo> then just use GConfig
<dneighbo> to read that 
<dneighbo> should be example in init of GConfig
<dneighbo> for fixedfont variable and such
<dneighbo> line 85 - 9X on forms/src/uidrivers/wx/UIdriver.py
<dneighbo> def initFont(widget, affectsLayout=1):
<dneighbo>   if int(GConfig.get('fixedWidthFont')):
<dneighbo>     widget.SetFont(wxFont(int(GConfig.get('pointSize')),wxMODERN,wxNORMAL,wxNORMAL))
<dneighbo> you will need to read up on wxFont i think

<Arturas> dneighbo: checking that now [downloading wxFont docs]
<dneighbo> GConfig.get('font')

<dneighbo> in the gnue.conf file
<Arturas> dneighbo: no, i hope adding something like 'encoding="utf8"' should be enough

<Harald1> is anybody here using gfclient + mysql?
<nickr> this channel was highlighted but I can't find my name in backscroll
<jamest> Harald1: I'm not, jcater is not, but someone was at one time
Action: dneighbo was
<dneighbo> i test on mysql occasionally
<Harald1> dneighbo: should it work?
<dneighbo> i dont 'use' 'use' it but i make sure it works
<dneighbo> it was working at the 0.1.1 release or 0.1.2 (whatever last release was)
<dneighbo> what is your client platform and server platform
<dneighbo> my tests were with
<Harald1> I've got a problem under win 2000. when I want to login gfclient crashes
<Harald1> both win 2000
<dneighbo> debian (client) redhat (server) and
<dneighbo> win98 (client) redhat(server
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> using odbc driver or native mysql?
<Harald1> gfclient crashes with "TypeError: unsupported operand types for +: 'int' and 'NoneType'" 
<dneighbo> my win98 tests with mysql were using the odbc driver
<dneighbo> Harald1 ok you have a python problem :)
<Harald1> i use mysqldb and it seems that the error is in mysqldb
<dneighbo> you need python 2.x
<Harald1> I have 2.2
<dneighbo> ouch
<dneighbo> 2.2 you dont want
<dneighbo> drop to 2.1
<dneighbo> 2.2 is buggy
<Harald1> if i change the None in the source code of mysqldb to 0 it works...
<dneighbo> you can use it but you wont be able to save forms in designer because of a streamIO bug in unicode support w/ 2.2 (still unfixed even in last candidate release)
<dneighbo> ah
<dneighbo> well i would create a diff
<dneighbo> and send it to mysqld folks as a patch :)
<Harald1> dneighbo: well I am able to save forms in designer
<dneighbo> if you save them
<dneighbo> reopen them
<dneighbo> and save them
<dneighbo> can you reopen them?
<dneighbo> i was encountering this issue on linux w/ python and traced it back to a python2.2 bug
<Harald1> I'll contact the developers later/tomorrow
<dneighbo> jcater tried to put in a hack to work around it
<Harald1> i'll try...
<dneighbo> it seemed to not fix it for me
<dneighbo> BUT i was running python from pretty much cvs from right before 2.2 release :)
<dneighbo> so a newer official 2.2 might be ok as i noticed commits for unicode (just not stringIO) but as stated i think jcater put in a hack to maneuver around stringIO
<Harald1> streamIO bug is still present. python crashes
<dneighbo> well one thing you can do (painful)
<dneighbo> is open the form in a text editor
<dneighbo> and substitue ^@ for null
<dneighbo> and then the form will be ok
<dneighbo> but next time you save it it will save with the ^@'s
<Harald1> where are the ^@? at the end of lines?
<dneighbo> oh no
<dneighbo> after EVERY character
<dneighbo> so you get ^@o^@u^@t^@p^@u^@t^@ like that :)
<dneighbo> if you have someone one staff you want to 'joke' with
<dneighbo> this is one of thsoe good 'joke' bugs :)
<Harald1> should it be visible in an editor?
<dneighbo> um dependons on how cool an editor you use :)
<dneighbo> in emacs its visible
<dneighbo> but ^@ means its an escape char that most 'windows' editors wont show you like
<dneighbo> ^M
<Harald1> What should happen if I do save->exit->start->load?
<dneighbo> would crash designer
<dneighbo> iirc
<dneighbo> what happens is when you create a form no issue
<dneighbo> save a form no issue
<dneighbo> but when you OPEN a form it uses stringIO to read in the xml file
<dneighbo> and that is what converts it to unicode
<dneighbo> so then when you save it, it has that ^@ stuff in it
<Harald1> for me save->exit->start->load does not crash
<dneighbo> tainting it for next open or for reading by forms
<dneighbo> cool well then you might not have the bug
<Harald1> and no ^@ in gfd
<dneighbo> cool
<dneighbo> it might be a unix only problem too
<Harald1> but if i do save->load it crashes
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> is there way you can install python2.1 on that machine as well?
<dneighbo> or better yet just grab the 0.1.1 release
<dneighbo> it has all dependencies compiled in so to speak
<Harald1> I'll try it later/tomorrow
<dneighbo> adn try exactly same thing and tellme if it bomb
<Harald1> is 2.1 / 2.2 installation at the same time possible
<dneighbo> you can run them concurrently
<dneighbo> but for testing you can just get the release
<dneighbo> and windows puts everything in dlls
<dneighbo> that are much easier to download and install and remove
<jamest> Harald1: your running a python installed forms/designer
<jamest> ?
<jamest> that's cool, most people use the bins
<dneighbo> he is cooler than most :)
<dneighbo> as he actually submits bug reports :)
<jamest> lol
<jamest> i'm sure there'll be lots of them
<jamest> as I'm fighting w/ forms a bit at work on windows
<jamest> if i'd only get these !@#!@# web site accessibilty updates completed
<Harald1> jamest: yes, because I want to know what happens. and besides this the cvs has no bins...

<dneighbo> what ticks me off
<dneighbo> is that here:
<dneighbo> http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~zeitlin/wxWindows/docs/wxwin155.htm#wxfont
<dneighbo> it shows wxFONTENCODING_UTF8 as a valid wxFontEncode type
<dneighbo> wonder i my wx version is too old or something
<dneighbo> crap
<dneighbo> they are saying UTF8 is a 'microsoft' only encoding
<dneighbo> one option is we could put 
<ra3vat> hmm
<dneighbo> EncodingType=
<dneighbo> in gnue.conf
<dneighbo> and then you can set it
<dneighbo> i wish i could 'test' the SYSTEM one
<dneighbo> ra3vat can you change to last code i pasted in UIdriver.py
<dneighbo> for wx
<dneighbo> and tell me if arturas sample works?
<ra3vat> to _UTF8?
<dneighbo> um this
<dneighbo>  widget.SetFont(wxFont(int(GConfig.get('pointSize')),wxMODERN,wxN
<dneighbo>                ORMAL,wxNORMAL,encoding=wxFONTENCODING_SYSTEM))
<dneighbo> the _UTF8 wont work on linux
<dneighbo> you might try it on windows
<dneighbo> if that doesnt work you could try
<dneighbo>                ORMAL,wxNORMAL,encoding=wxFONTENCODING_KOI8))
<dneighbo> for cryillic stuff
<dneighbo> i can get things to run with these different option (cept UTF8)
<dneighbo> but i dont have other charsets to 'test' them with :)

<reinhard> oops
<dneighbo> clarify
<dneighbo> install new STOCK kernel (in apt)
<dneighbo> or compile a new kernel
<dneighbo> since debian has so many kernel choices i suggest staying away from a compiled kernel unless there is just something you are in dire need of that isnt in a stock kernel
<dneighbo> if its stock kernel its about a 10 minute process
<dneighbo> though i would wait for nickr to be around

<dneighbo> wow
<dneighbo> The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of the evil. We see before us a huge community of producers the members of which are unceasingly striving to deprive each other of the fruits of their collective labor?not by force, but on the whole in faithful compliance with legally established rules. In this respect, it is important to realize that the means of production?that is to say, the entire p
<dneighbo> oducing consumer goods as well as additional capital goods?may legally be, and for the most part are, the private property of individuals.
<nickr> er
<nickr> isn't that what capitalism is?
<nickr> the state allowing some people to rip off other people?
<nickr> comparing it to anarchy is false.
<dneighbo> what is amazing is that is written by Albert Einstein
<nickr> capitalism as we know it depends on laws
<nickr> hah
<nickr> cool
<nickr> I didn't know that Einstein was a filty commie
<nickr> I knew all those scientitsts were a bit fruity
<dneighbo> http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einst.htm
<dneighbo> yes he was it appears
<dneighbo> basically states capitalism erodes our sense of value to a society
<drochaid> I thought he was a Marxist?
<dneighbo> and makes us hostile towards one another
<reinhard> x5
<nickr> scientists are all the same... they SAY they are trying to help us, but what they're really doing is trying to RULE THE WORLD
<reinhard> argh
<dneighbo> well yes marxist veiw more
<nickr> theres a really good part of illuminatus that talks about capitalism

<drochaid> communism took marxism and remove the better points about it
<dneighbo> wow that essay is just incredible
<drochaid> the ideology behind marxism is fairly sound
<dneighbo> Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political s
<dneighbo> he described m$ and the trial in 1949
<nickr> Huh, thats pretty interesting
<dneighbo> This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevi
<dneighbo> the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.
<dneighbo> wowzers
<nickr> when was this written?
<nickr> hehe
<dneighbo> this BLOWS me away that this was authored in 1949
<nickr> its as true today as ever
<nickr> actually its more true today
<drochaid> tbh, it's been the same for hundreds of years .. he was simply recording what was the case then
<dneighbo> I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion.
<dneighbo> is his solution
<drochaid> the only thing that's changed is the extent a single person or company can control a market on a global basis
<dtm> dneighbo: good point; let's make an educational system which has goals!
<dtm> :)
<drochaid> wouldn't that be a contradiction in terms?
<drochaid> it would be in the UK
<nickr> the problem of a socialist state is that it moves privilage back into the hands of the state
<nickr> the key to true freedom is removwing privilage entirely
<drochaid> uhm
<drochaid> bollocks
<nickr> privilage is private law
<nickr> an economic system needs to have everyone on the level playing field
<drochaid> I don't believe that's possible
<nickr> Well, its possible to the extent that you remove thet state granting privilage
<drochaid> how?
<nickr> I don't know man, I didn't do it.
<drochaid> lol
<dneighbo> actually nickr he address your concern
<dneighbo> Nevertheless, it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is not yet socialism. A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual. The achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems: how is it possible, in view of the far-reaching centralization of political and economic power,
<dneighbo> to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and overweening? How can the rights of the individual be protected and therewith a democratic counterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured?
<dneighbo> Clarity about the aims and problems of socialism is of greatest significance in our age of transition. Since, under present circumstances, free and unhindered discussion of these problems has come under a powerful taboo, I consider the foundation of this magazine to be an important public service.
<drochaid> nah, still bollocks ;)

<chillywilly> one stone and it goes crashing down
<drochaid> glass can be a very strong material
<drochaid> can withstand many times it's weight
<chillywilly> in my experience the best way to crash windows is to install a network card
<drochaid> can be made resistant to fast moving projectiles
<chillywilly> ths makes it near impossible to use
<drochaid> and provides warmth and protection to it's users
<drochaid> then the ventilation shuts off and they all die :)

<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> a shitty bill that got renamed
<drochaid> ah
<chillywilly> says that all electronic devices must have copy-protection mechanisms
<drochaid> oh
<chillywilly> mandated by the federal gov't
<drochaid> that along the lines of the DMCA?
<chillywilly> (US federal gov't)
<chillywilly> it's worse than the DMCA
<drochaid> that's the thing you see,
<drochaid> DMCA has no effect on anyone outside the US
<drochaid> as it's been found illegal by international law
<chillywilly> well, don't think it's going to stay in the US and you can ignore it because I guarantee you America's disease will spread
<drochaid> indeed
<chillywilly> besides, nationalism is BS

<Harald1> should I post the complete results to dcl, as there were some more problems with the exe-releases
<Harald1> ?
<dneighbo> when you say same result
<dneighbo> which result :)
Action: dneighbo doesnt recall exactly what the problem was 
<dneighbo> the crashing after like save/reload
<Harald1> yes and that it only happens when gfdesigner is not exited
<dneighbo> where are you seeing designer 0.2.2a?
<Harald1> in the about dialog
<dneighbo> hmmm
<psu> cool
<dneighbo> guess im ill informed much anymore
<Harald1> 0.2.0a I mean
<dneighbo> ok that sounds slightly better :)\
<dneighbo> let me test here can you give me exact steps
<dneighbo> of what you are doing to make it crash
<Harald1> yes: open gfdesigner, load a file, save it, close the file (but not gfdesigner), load the file -> crash
<Harald1> but: open gfdesigner, load a file, save it, exit gfdesigner, open gfdesigner, load file -> no crash
<dneighbo> ok trying now
<dneighbo> hmmm i have different bug
<dneighbo> i open gfdesigner
<dneighbo> load a file
<dneighbo> save it
<dneighbo> close the file (But designer exits) insetad of closing
<dneighbo> never mind my stupidity
<Harald1> ?
<dneighbo> i forget that we dont do designer quite right :)
<dneighbo> i was doing designer file.gfd
<dneighbo> which is NOT the same as 
<dneighbo> designer
<dneighbo> then open the file
<dneighbo> so in my case close/exit behaved the same
<dneighbo> please file the bug
<dneighbo> it exists in windows as well
<dneighbo> er linux
<Harald1> to dcl?
<dneighbo> i.e. my current cvs does the exact same thing
<dneighbo> yeah to dcl
<Harald1> can you assist me? I'm not sure what priority, account, type I should add
<dneighbo> it appears as though even a debug level 50 gives no useful information on the crash so no need to submit anything
<dneighbo> what are options for priority
<dneighbo> it should be something like 'next patch release' or something
<Harald1> high, medium, low
<Harald1> no that's type
<dneighbo> let me look real quick
<dneighbo> you are contact
<dneighbo> account 'end user'
<Harald1> yes
<dneighbo> product gnue designer
<dneighbo> priority medium
<dneighbo> type next minor release
<dneighbo> btw: if every you arent sure guess what you feel is best and will change it if we dis agree :)
<Harald1> ok. I've got another thing:
<dneighbo> cool
Action: dneighbo loves that we have another bug hunter, i was feeling so lonely
<Harald1> there's a problem with the gfdesigner exe release. the normal release doesn't start, and the debug release has not /etc dir
<Harald1> not = no
<Harald1> so it wouldn't start either, it only displays for a second, that no gnue.conf is available
<Harald1> dneighbo: It seems that the saving bug is even worse. It crashes on other files, too, after one file was saved and closed
<Harald1> but it does not crash, when the first file is not closed

<superphreak> thats cause the UK gamers were inferior :)
<chillywilly> ah, nationalism
<psu> Low Ping Bastards
<psu> no UK broadband in those days
<chillywilly> how I love it so

<chillywilly> hey you're the one who couldn't get money out of the tyme machine the other day ;)
<chillywilly> true dat
<dneighbo> um Harald1 the .exe's assume you create gnue.conf and such
<dneighbo> i.e. on your system in like program files/gnue/etc
<superphreak> thats what I am saying...we work for Simplex, therefore we don't have much money
<chillywilly> superphreak: you mean tyco ;)
<dneighbo> or something
<chillywilly> simplex had the shit to gether for the most part
<superphreak> chillywilly: yeah, sorry TYCO
<dneighbo> there should be a samples.gnue.conf and samples.connections.conf
<dneighbo> just copy those and name the copy gnue.conf connections.conf
<dneighbo> then try designer again
<chillywilly> I bjust realized something
<chillywilly> I have no artistic talent

<chillywilly> it sucked
<superphreak> as a matter of fact, I ahve no talents what-so-ever
<superphreak> :(
<Harald1> dneighbo: no that's the problem with the exe release, there's no /etc and sample confs, I copied my normal ones and then the debug release worked
<dneighbo> hmmm the .exe release on win95 had them
<Harald1> 0.1.1?
<dneighbo> um yes i think so
<dneighbo> did you get official releases
<dneighbo> or nightlies of some sort
<ra3vat> dneighbo: can you give me account in dclgw?
<dneighbo> i dont have a windows box here so i cant confirm
<Harald1> dneighbo: I assume. They are from http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/designer/
<dneighbo> ra3vat: just need name (i dont remember how to spell it) dmitry sorvokin? and email ds@telcom.ics.ru ?
<dneighbo> yeah thats right place
<dneighbo> but its common that would do the etc file et al
<dneighbo> i.e. you didnt just get designer right
<dneighbo> you got common/forms/designer when you got 0.1.1
<ra3vat> dneighbo: (login name - dimas) dmitry sorokin ds@ics.elcom.ru
<Harald1> no, I just wanted to test the exe release, so just designer
<dneighbo> er actually i think designer should install common
<dneighbo> install forms and designer
<Harald1> and debug works when I copy my /etc 
<superphreak> chillywilly: did you die???

<dtm> yeah
<dtm> i really like RMS's essay involving that
<dtm> really enlightening
<dtm> it even helped my perspective on it
<chillywilly> if I make you a copy of a movie that is copyrighted then I am  as bad as someon attacking, raping, and pillaging a ship right?
<dtm> not that it clears my conscience
<chillywilly> hehe
<dtm> coz i still commit theft
<dtm> i wouldn't ever deny that.
<dtm> but it's that their definition of theft is _wrong_.
<dtm> so it's theft in the name of civil disobedience, mostly
<dtm> and yeah sometimes i do steal stuff that i coulda bought or rented
<dtm> like downloading an mpeg rather than making a $0.99 rental. 
<dtm> that would have been fair.
<chillywilly> snoogans
<dtm> so it kinda blurs off into the distance
<chillywilly> how about they let me download it for free
<chillywilly> then I can send the author money directly
<dtm> i'd pay to download it
<chillywilly> and not the copyright police bastards
<dtm> well in the case of hollywood movies, there are tons of big money involved
<chillywilly> the "content" providers
<dtm> so having a gray distribution mechanismis understandable
<dtm>  the people who provide lighting, cameras, food, etc
<dtm> moviemaking is an incredibly huge job none of us can estimate
<dtm> well , often it is.
<dtm> some movies are as simple as typical software engineering
<chillywilly> wel copyright isn't supposed to last forever it is basically a restriction on free speech
<chillywilly> there
<chillywilly> 's no compromise anymore
<chillywilly> look at mutha freakin' disney
<dtm> yeah
<dtm> hey i found out recently that the word 'patent' is rooted in the phrase "to make public"
<dtm> isn't that fascinating
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> well you do have to disclose the information
<dtm> i never knew that before just recently.
<dtm> yeha
<chillywilly> you see that they renamed the SSSCA?
<chillywilly> and now are trying to pass that POS
<dtm> no and i dont know what the SSSCA is
<dtm> well at least i know i'm not _personnally_ responsible directly for the destruction of civilization ;)
<dtm> i dont come up with this shit.
<dtm> ;>
<chillywilly> federal law mandating that all electronic devices must have copy protection mechanisms in them
<dtm> all that's needed is for "good men" to do nothing :)

<dtm> HDTV already was infested with things like that
<chillywilly> sucko
<dtm> copy and content controls

<chillywilly> dude this is like communist russia putting armed guards at copy mahcines
<dtm> i know HDTV is supposed to be a materially desirable consumer item but i'd just as soon smash it with Sledge O Matic(tm) as watch it if it had that stuff in it.
<dtm> yeah it is.
<chillywilly> but they do it with technology
<dtm> yep
<chillywilly> it's fascist
<dtm> and chilly, believe me, this stuff is _so_ important that i respect anyone who thinks this way about it
<dtm> i mean who prioritizes it this much
<dtm> and recognizes and analyzes it
<dtm> just think if everyone did that a _little_ bit.
<dtm> instead of having a few of us trying in futility to carry the rest
<dtm> but we still have to try.
<chillywilly> I think people are too busy being brainwashed by the PR and consumerism that is all too prevalent in america
<dtm> maybe something will happen such that we'lll not just slide slower down the slippery slope, but instead have some STRATEGIC advance.
<dtm> yeah
<chillywilly> so then the politicians and corporations get to pass the laws they want
<chillywilly> and no one says boo
<dtm> their self relationship is so screwed, they dont even know what choice _is_ let alone its value.
<chillywilly> because they are so apathetic
<dtm> yeah especially when it's marketed as a desirable consumable
<chillywilly> dude I am readying my protect sign once again
<chillywilly> er, protest
<dtm> what sign?
<chillywilly> the one I will make
<chillywilly> ;)
<dtm> heh
<chillywilly> right after I write my congressman
<dtm> gonna storm capitol hill?
<chillywilly> heck yea
<dtm> well shit dude
<dtm> think about it
<dtm> i heard that something like only TEN THOUSAND Americans wrote to the govt about the microsoft case.
<chillywilly> that's pathetic
<chillywilly> I don;t know who to be more pissed at
<dtm> if that's the case then not only do they surely have a filtering process for it reaching the desks of decisionmakers, but we could write a _GOOD_ one that'd get there.
<dtm> yeah i know
<chillywilly> the common americans aor the jag offs trying to screw them
<dtm> exctly
<dtm> well
<dtm> it wouldn't be possible unless it was a two part process
<dtm> it'd be different if the average American couldn't figure it out
<dtm> couldn't learn about it
<dtm> we may as well find already well written essays, put a quick cover letter on it, and forward it on.
<chillywilly> Free Software is an extreme and I recognize that, but I think it is only necessary if we are to win anything back for the people before it is too late
<dtm> see
<dtm> my personal problem is that i dont know my audience well
<dtm> so i have a writing style issue
<dtm> i dont know how specific or general to b
<dtm> e
<dtm> some of these people have never seen the inter-web
<dtm> i dont know if i should try cluing them in, or just casting a vote
<chillywilly> someone said that these guys doign this are clueless and they will leave a big mess for us to clean up
<chillywilly> (wrt to technology etc.)
<chillywilly> it's the old men who don't even know what the net is
<chillywilly> but guess whcih coporations(s) are behind that bill and basically bought it?
<chillywilly> disney, et. al.
<chillywilly> I'm never going to look at mickey mouse the same
<nickr>  the mouse is a huge, evil corporation, in the worst sense of the word
<chillywilly> nickr: do you think in the movie dogma that the whole mooby refernce is a poke at disney?
<nickr> probably
<nickr> iirc
<chillywilly> it'a a bit too similar
<chillywilly> er, it's
<chillywilly> crazymike is convinced that is the case

<dtm> @(*#)
<dtm> well i do like Disneyland though
<dtm> and i like a lot of Disney movies
<dtm> not all of em
<dtm> Disneyland is a model corporation in terms of operations and personnel.
<chillywilly> I'm on an all out disney boycott
<chillywilly> brb
<dtm> so there's a lot to learn from and emulate
<chillywilly> caorline is here
<chillywilly> er, caroline
<dtm> but that doesn't mean we have to patronize their stuff seriously
Action: chillywilly is away: I'm busy
<dtm> chillywilly: tlel her i said HIGH.
<dtm> some disney movies are quite inspiring and educational, even the recent ones
<dtm> i really liked Beauty and the Beast part 2
<dtm> and Hercules
<dtm> i especially liked watching them on a $1000 portable dvd player in a jet plane
<dtm> when i traveled often, i rented the dvd player for like $20-30 round trip plus 3 or 4 movies
<dtm> and two batteries
<dtm> that was grate
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 00:04:28)
<chillywilly> we're going to get pizza
<chillywilly> don't tell da masta

<derek> i want pizza
<Harald1> derek: well I've got no pizza, but a question:
<Harald1> which trigger events are implemented, just those from http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/techref/x81.html or all?
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 01:13:01)
<derek> um where do you see 'all' :)
<derek> i would say the ones in the techref 'should' be implemented
<derek> but these are things that unless one of the developers are using them, probably are not getting properly regression tested
<Harald1> all are those in the VALIDTRIGGERS list
<derek> so the safe answer is in the source code you can get a list of what is there in code
<derek> then only by testing can you determine if they work
<Harald1> err no list
<derek> (bad answer i know)
<derek> but i would 'assume' that if its in the techref
<derek> its in the source and it SHOULD work
<derek> i.e. if you use one that is the tech ref and it doesnt work please file a bug against it
<Harald1> actually I am not using them at moment, but look at how they work/ are implemented
<derek> Harald1: i forget you wanting to 'develop' gnue tools
<derek> or use them
<nickr> dtm: I had rice and ramyun, not just rike by itself
Action: derek has bad memory so i apologize if i already asked
<derek> i like to know how people fit into the picture
<Harald1> derek: at the moment I'm far from "developing". I am trying to get an overview, and understand how certain things are done
<derek> i guess the real question was
<Harald1> and I looked at the technical reference and saw the sentence "We would like to increase the number of supported languages as time permits" in the trigger part, and now I try to understand how triggers work
<derek> 'do you plan on using gnue as an end user' or 'as a developer'
<Harald1> derek: mostly as a developer
<Harald1> because I still go to university. but I think will soon (in a few years) be a big option. So knowing it is not only interesting, but also useful :)

<nickr> what bug?
<Harald1> when I delete an object under windows, designer crashes and I am wondering if the same thing happens under linux
<nickr> ah hrm
<nickr> wonder if I have a working designer here
dsmith (firewall-u@cherry7.comerica.com) left irc: "later.."
<Harald1> would be great if you find one, I'm tracing this bug for hours, and I can't find the reason why it happens. And if its windows related this will reduce the possibilties. And despite that I could post it to dcl
<drochaid> I'm running designer under Win 2K ... and it doesn't crash when you delete an object here
<Harald1> drochaid: which version do you use? the exe release?
<drochaid> yep, the current packaged verion
<drochaid> *version
<Harald1> 0.1.1?
<drochaid> gimmie a mo
<drochaid> no
<drochaid> the build from the 3rd feb 2002
<Harald1> the about dialog in designer tells you which version it is
<drochaid> I using a build that was produced on the 3rd feb 2002 ... I don't know if they altered the version number or not, but it came after v0.1.1
<Harald1> but its not 0.2? I've got a release installed. It says 0.1.1 and doesn't crash, too
<Harald1> so maybe its a new bug or it has something to do with my installed python
<drochaid> which version is the one that crashes?
<Harald1> 0.2.0a from cvs
<drochaid> well, there's no packaged build for that version I'm aware of, so it'd not that I'm running
<Harald1> I've traced the bug so far, that it occurs if the LayoutEditor is notified, that the object has to be destroyed. But the strange thing is that it not happens, WHEN the object is destroyed, but sometime later

<dneighbo> hola
<dneighbo> was gone a tad longer than expected
<dneighbo> nickr: you have any idea when they will bundle xfree86 4.2?
<dneighbo> i was reading a thread and the main maintainer said hey im busy if you you want to pay my employer to do it maybe
<dneighbo> and i was thinking hey its worth 20 - 30 bucks to me
<dneighbo> maybe i would kick that down to his employer if it would help
<dneighbo> then later in same mail he was such 'as chilly would say 'cocksmoker''
<dneighbo> i was like no way
<dneighbo> shame really then i read on debian planet him being a bigger jerk and many people comment that many debian maintainers have gone this way :(
<nickr> heh Branden isn't such a bad guy, just has a short temper somettimes
<dneighbo> most unfortunate
<nickr> actually he's really a nice guy
<dneighbo> being a maintainer is surely a thankless job
<dneighbo> nickr: yeah i dont take it personally on him, just a shame that general consensus is that most of the maintainers were behaving this way :(
<dneighbo> and then i look at #debian and see the crap there
<nickr> I think he'd make a good DPL, he's a very good SPI treasurer
<dneighbo> and its like man... so sad
<dneighbo> anyway putting kids to be bed be back later
<nickr> his employer does pay him to work on debian, though, afaik
<nickr> he's busy with woody right now, so as soon as thats all done he said he'd work on 4.2
<nickr> I think he's mostly gotten a bad rep for a few incidents and many jokes
<dneighbo> yeah the one comment i thought was pretty bogus (not made by him)
<dneighbo> was that hey X is a big and important package so dont expect it right away
<dneighbo> my view is the bigger and MORE IMPORTANT the package the sooner it should be there (obviously like not day of release) but shouldnt straggle for long
<dneighbo> example...
<dneighbo> i would expect gnome2 stuff to be in sid as an option as SOON as possible after official release and quite possibly 'pre-official' release
<dneighbo> and i think X to be more vital than gnome (imho)
<nickr> X is certainly vital
<dneighbo> i.e. im not blaming him, it should not fall on a single persons shoulders (another opinion)
<nickr> but the point of debian releases is stability, and the version of X that will be released with woody is currently being trusted for stability
<nickr> tested
<nickr> for stability
<dneighbo> nickr: i agree, but im talking sid not woody
<dneighbo> and honestly X is a different beast to me somewhat because of 'hardware' support
<nickr> since he is the maintainer of the package and it is directly before a release, he has to concentrate on woody
<dneighbo> i view anything as being necessary for HARDWARE support as VITAL
<nickr> no one is thinking or doing anything for sid now
<dneighbo> as currently that is my #1 knock on windows
<dneighbo> er against linux in win vs lin
<dneighbo> and that is horrid hardware support
<dneighbo> now i realize its a battle
<dneighbo> i.e. linux developers dont get the hardware and the apis a year before they hit market like win developers
<dneighbo> and probably never get the apis
<dneighbo> but all the reason its more important to get newly supported stuff available asap
<dneighbo> perhaps in this case its a matter of not being pluggable enough?
<dneighbo> i.e. sound, video etc drivers should all be 'pluggable' so yuo shouldnt need the newest X or Kernel to get support of a device rather just the driver
<nickr> heh.
<nickr> welcome to derek's fantasy world...
<dneighbo> but i guess in case of some new architecture stuff you have to have a new X/kernel etc in order to deal with a driver that uses new features
<dneighbo> nickr: yeah i suppose
<dneighbo> i just want everyone to use gnu/linux
<dneighbo> and when cheap commodity hardware isnt well supported it makes it harder
<nickr> cheap commodity hardware IS well supported
<nickr> there are rare cases where that support isn't so god
<nickr> good
<dneighbo> i.e. if i can build a good fast computer for 400 bucks that runs windows but on linux i cant have sound or video 
<dneighbo> and the answer is buy off the 'list'
<dneighbo> then thats bad
<nickr> well do something to fix it rather than saying it 'should' be a certain way
<dneighbo> nickr: i have only had two machines out of about 10 to install linux that didnt have hardware problems
<dneighbo> laptop had to wait for new X before it ran right

<dneighbo> etc etc
<dneighbo> usually was sound in past
<dneighbo> now lately its been video (which is odd)
<nickr> what you should be doing is nagging hardware vendors to release specs and check out hardware to developers
<nickr> you could alternatively put forth the effort to make a quick and dirty 4.2 package
<nickr> or convince someone else to do so
<nickr> or see if someone has already done so
<nickr> sometimes I sure wish I could kill the cd rom driver and reload it
<dneighbo> i somewhat scouted the net
<dneighbo> and what pisses me off is branden says he has ones partially done
<dneighbo> er in test state
<dneighbo> and he said he wouldnt post where because he was 'mad at the community'
<dneighbo> thats when i was like f it
<dneighbo> i'll just suffer
<nickr> heh
<nickr> he won't post them, probably, because then everyone would fucking complain endlessly and post bug reports
<nickr> must be really stressful maintaining the biggest and one of the most important packages
<dneighbo> yes agree
<dneighbo> hey galeon sucks lately
<dneighbo> i recall an email sent to me by debconf
<dneighbo> aobut what to do to prevent his
<dneighbo> this
<dneighbo> i thought i saved it but cant find it
<dneighbo> i tried a dpkg-reconfigure 
<dneighbo> and it didnt resend that message
<dneighbo> how can i find out what it said?
<nickr> its in ~root/mbox probably
<nickr> basically it said that if you had a previous version, it'll act funny until you whipe out all your settings and resetup it
<dneighbo> i removed .galeon
<dneighbo> and restarted and it still behaves like crap
<nickr> no no
<nickr> you have to do ..
<nickr> galeon-config-tool --clean
<dneighbo> must i do it as every user?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> sucks balls.
<nickr> but it uses teeth!
<nickr> yow.
<dneighbo>      Gconf daemon will be shutted down, so make sure you have no apps
<dneighbo>      depending on it running
<dneighbo> this is LAME
<dneighbo> it smells so much like the registry its sick
<nickr> gconf is sorta lame yea
<dneighbo> i.e. just deleting .galeon should have worked :
<dneighbo> )
<dneighbo> damn registry
<nickr> too bad galeon is like the best browser
<dneighbo> er gconf ;)
<dneighbo> yes galeon has kicked ass
<nickr> fie on you miguel!
<dneighbo> figures right when i make wife use it
<dneighbo> it has a 'registry' issue
<dneighbo> that makes her say 'this crashes as much as internet explorer'
<nickr> well if you didn't track unstable you'd be all set
<nickr> you could use konquerer instead ;)
<nickr> you know, galeon used to crash all the time for me
<nickr> but 1.1.3 has been like a rock since I got it working
<nickr> it has an uptime of like 2 weeks
<nickr> so far
<nickr> and I'm really mean to it, too
<dneighbo> yeah i was just thinking the other day
<dneighbo> i should have made this a WOODY box
<dneighbo> and just dropped to sid for stuff i couldnt find in woody
<dneighbo> as i forgot it can have issues at times
<nickr> well if you get galeon working it should be really stable
<nickr> I had a horrible time with gcof though
<nickr> the totally broke its ability to work with my nfs home directory
<dneighbo> well i had troubles iwht galeon initially on my rh6.2 box
<dneighbo> as i had to COMPILE it
<dneighbo> and gconf gave me fits
<dneighbo> never had issue on debian with it till now
<dneighbo> and it works its just highly 'unstable'
<dneighbo> hopefully that config-tool will fix things
<dneighbo> will see over next few days
<dneighbo> have you ever contacted someone about chaning their theme?
<nickr> theme?
<dneighbo> i really like this theme i just want it white instead of gray
<dneighbo> or like an 'opal' color
<dneighbo> but im too incompetent artisitcally to change it myself
<dneighbo> gtk theme
<dneighbo> i have a nasty fetish for the color red
<dneighbo> and i found a wicked theme that makes certain things red and i love it
<nickr> you could probably change individual colours in the theme
<dneighbo> but i dont like the 'dirty' grey they use for where its not red, i would rathe have it be 'opal' or 'white' of some color for a better 'contrast' to the red
<nickr> but I'w not user how exactly
<nickr> well what kind of theme is it?
<dneighbo> rage is the name
<dneighbo> i use crux for sawfish theme and it auto picks up the gtk theme base color so looks good
<nickr> yea
<nickr> hrm
<nickr> you could probably just edit the gtkrc associated with the theme
<dneighbo> you running gnome?
<nickr> yes
<dneighbo> wtf

<nickr> so you want this all opal instead of all grey?

<dtm> i'm sure that in the depths of your subconscious, nickr, you can approximate and assimilate it into something resembling a point.
<dtm> is my trust in this matter misplaced, sir?
<dtm> it is intellectuals such as we, who must band together on the "issues" that face our beloved channel.

<chillywilly> wassat?
<nickr> I'd rather have something like Purplephilia with red instead
<chillywilly> what was the name of that  red theme?
<nickr> Rage
<dneighbo> i just really like the red they chose
Action: chillywilly is fond of AquaXen
<dneighbo> as my red fetish is particular
<nickr> chillywilly: you know Purplephilia, right?
<dneighbo> i only like a certain color of red
<chillywilly> yes
<nickr> chillywilly: imagine that with red instead of purple
<nickr> that would be sweet!
<chillywilly> ok
<nickr> Rage is more like a crappy aqua clone
<nickr> its horrible
<nickr> horrible!
<chillywilly> slow?
<chillywilly> I think I'll download it
<chillywilly> did you get it from themes.org?
Action: chillywilly could use a change of theme
<nickr> its not slow, its just too bright
<chillywilly> well this is an LCD display
<chillywilly> I get cheated out of the true color usually as stuff is brighter for the most part anyway
<chillywilly> (laptop)
<nickr> so you should go for darker/higher contrast
<nickr> for richness
<chillywilly> I think I personally like lighter themes
<chillywilly> as the dark ones depress me
<chillywilly> ;)
<nickr> I don't look at a lot of widgets
<nickr> except in galeon

<chillywilly> the gimp
<nickr> cf http://nick.industrialmeats.com/data/pictures/screenshots/balam/balam-2002-03-14-1722.jpg
<nickr> I don't even look at my panel usually

<chillywilly> ah, I use gaim

<chillywilly> oh and of course xchat ;)
<chillywilly> (duh)
<nickr> I use gaim and galeon
<nickr> I see my panel about 3 times a day
<nickr> its always hiding under my windows
<chillywilly> you have it autohide?
<nickr> No, god no
<nickr> I have all wy windows fullscreen/borderless
<dneighbo> hmm i a loser
<dneighbo> i like rage :)
<dneighbo> sue me
<nickr> dneighbo: my lawyers will be contacting you
<dneighbo> i think opal everything with red where its red but all panels shoudl be red too
<dneighbo> themes is too slow to get purplephinalla 
<dneighbo> can one of you post it for me
<nickr> dneighbo: apt-get install gtk-engines-xenophilia
<dneighbo> hmm i have that already
<dneighbo> let me look at my installed themes :)
<dneighbo> ymmmy
<dneighbo> that would be good in red
<nickr> yea it would be very good in red
<nickr> and I think you can do it just by changing one file
<chillywilly> cool a new moz modern
<nickr> I'll investigate it later
<dneighbo> let me know if you get it to work
<dneighbo> though i am in a 'light' mood
<dneighbo> generally about every six months i switch
<dneighbo> that or i run diff machines with different types

<dtm> dneighbo: did you have an answer for my pgsql backup question up there, buddy?
<dneighbo> which one i didnt see it
<dtm> dneighbo: ok
<dtm> dneighbo: how do i back up pgsql in a way that'll be sure to get _all_ data, so as to restore it in identical state?
<dtm> i understand that there is some type of metainformation, such as BLOBs
<dneighbo> nick actually i think AquaXgen
<dneighbo> might be what i want
<dneighbo> only using red instead of their light blues (and probably same can be done by editing files)
<dneighbo> dtm: i asked the pro :)
<dneighbo> you want to do a pg_dump or pg_dumpall
<dtm> dneighbo: do i get everything by using 'pg_dump foo > foo.out' 
<nickr> wow, that was trivial
Action: nickr has ragephilia :)
<dtm> dneighbo: or do i need other options
<dneighbo> as in like 99.99% of cases this will suit you fine
<dneighbo> howwever you will also want to back up the 'data' directory as well
<dtm> dneighbo: ok  how does one deviate into the 0.01%?
<dneighbo> i.e. the file system
<chillywilly> where is rage?
<dneighbo> just in case
<dtm> dneighbo: mmhmm
<dtm> i'm sure this problem has been solved so i'll look it up
<dneighbo> dtm: in querying the pros no one has had to use other than pg_dump :)
<dtm> oh great
<dtm> dneighbo: and no options on pg_dump?
<dneighbo> um not sure what options (me forgets whats there really)
<dneighbo> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/Rage.tgz
<dtm> ok
<dtm> dneighbo: well it's good enough then.
<dneighbo> nickr: what was it you did
<nickr> http://nick.industrialmeats.com/data/themes/Ragephilia-Dark.tar.gz
<dtm> dneighbo: and i'm assuming that phpgw and dcl wouldn't require anything special anyway.
<nickr> gotta go offline for a bit
<chillywilly> never!
<dneighbo> nickr: wrong color red ":)
<dneighbo> but right thing
<dneighbo> you will have to show me the force nickr

<dneighbo> with the code snippet i left
<dneighbo> i tested and it worked here
<dneighbo> (ie designer/forms run fine) but i could not test to see if made difference for you test
<dneighbo>  widget.SetFont(wxFont(int(GConfig.get('pointSize')),wxMODERN,wxNORMA
<dneighbo> ,wxNORMAL,encoding=wxFONTENCODING_UTF8))
<dneighbo> would be
<dneighbo>  widget.SetFont(wxFont(int(GConfig.get('pointSize')),wxMODERN,wxNORMA
<dneighbo> ,wxNORMAL,encoding=wxFONTENCODING_SYSTEM))
<dneighbo> or _DEFAULT or you might try ROI8 i think for you
<dneighbo> er cryillic
<Arturas> hm
<Arturas> tried at home to run
<Arturas> encoding=wx...UTF8
<Arturas> and no good results
<Arturas> tried also with
<ra3vat> hello
<Arturas> Hi :)
<Arturas> system and default
<Arturas> also no results
<Arturas> but i start to believe
<ra3vat> Arturas: encoding in gnue.conf is for database encoding 
<Arturas> that's my linux configuration problem
<Arturas> [or python]
<Arturas> ra3vat: ?
<Arturas> ra3vat: don't use that now
<ra3vat> # Hack for db encoding
<ra3vat> Encoding=DEFAULT
<dneighbo> hey Arturas the code you pasted me for 'default/system' was wrong
<dneighbo> thats why i siad use what i gave you exactly :)
<dneighbo> if only everyone would just read/write/speak english ;)
Action: Arturas feels unhappy today - whole world kicks his ass :)
<Arturas> ok

<chillywilly> how is everyone?
Harald1 (Peter1234@pD95177DF.dip.t-dialin.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> hi Harald1
<Harald1> hi
<Harald1> is anybody here with an uptodate version (0.2.0a) of designer under linux, who can test if a bug occours under linux, too?
<chillywilly> I usually run it out of cvs
<chillywilly> is that the cvs version?
<Harald1> yes 
<Harald1> it's just that it does not occur with 0.1.1
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> do you need to have a working databse setup?
<chillywilly> in order to text what you are testing
<chillywilly> er, test
<Harald1> try making any object in designer, and delete it via the context menu
<Harald1> no, no database
<chillywilly> ok
Action: chillywilly waits for the cvs up to finish
<chillywilly> ho hum
<chillywilly> it si taking an awful long time
<chillywilly> s/si/is
<chillywilly> an unually long time too
<chillywilly> er, unusually
<Harald1> well a 2-3 days old version should do it, roo
<chillywilly> it is almost done
<chillywilly> I don't think I really have any updates to get anyway
<chillywilly>  cvs uped the yesterday
<chillywilly> er, I
<chillywilly> ah, a few patches
<chillywilly> ok
<Harald1> chillywilly: ok, then I know what I have to do later ... :)
<chillywilly> uh?
<chillywilly> I haven't tried it yet
<chillywilly> I just installed it again
<chillywilly> what sotta objetc should I put on there?
<chillywilly> anythingi fromt he toolbar?
<chillywilly> anything from the toolbar?
<Harald1> chillywilly: yes anything, button etc.
<chillywilly> right click and try to delete it right?
Action: chillywilly puts a button on there
<Harald1> chillywilly: with doing later I meant, doing an update myself
<Harald1> yes
<chillywilly> it crashed
<Harald1> ok, thank you
<chillywilly> danielb@obfuscation:~/bin$ ./gfdes 
<chillywilly> Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate image file in pixmap_path: "up.png" line 476

<chillywilly> hrrm
<chillywilly> line 16
<Harald1> that's pretty much the same as under windows
<chillywilly> bah, that's not very helpful
<chillywilly> (the line 16 crap)
<Harald1> I already tracked the bug so far down, that it happens, if LayoutDesigner's OnDelete is called
<chillywilly> ah but there is a core file
<Harald1> though it doesn't crash right in there, but sometime later
<chillywilly> no debugging symbols though
<chillywilly> ah
<chillywilly> you put some traces in there?
<Harald1> actually I worked with GDebug messages
<chillywilly> does it crash if you delete a widget a different way?
<Harald1> ?
<chillywilly> isn't there another wayt o delete a widget besides using the context menu?
<Harald1> it doesn't crash if I replace the Destroy() with Show(false) and designer works a expected. Just a waste of resources
<chillywilly> maybe not
<Harald1> chillywilly: I don't know, but the problem is the deletion itself, if you want, I can point you to the line numbers
<Harald1> chillywilly: why not?
<chillywilly> I don't know that code
<chillywilly> well I didn't see another way to delete a widget
<chillywilly> i dunno I haven't used designer and/or forms much myself...I hack the app server
<chillywilly> 2-tier is so yesterday ;)
Action: chillywilly waits for the 2-tier police to show up
<Harald1> chillywilly: I can't wait to see geas2 ...
<Harald1> I'm using 2-tier only, because one shouldn't use geas1
<chillywilly> true
<chillywilly> and if I was more motivated i would port some software of mine to a 2-tier solution for right now
<chillywilly> but I am just probably going to wait
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> as I am spending more of my time on the design of geasv2
<Harald1> you already started coding or still designing? Will it still use C?
<chillywilly> it will be in python
<chillywilly> we are defining the architecture and client API
<chillywilly> then we will code
<chillywilly> at least that's the plan
<chillywilly> i dunno I am at the mercy of the GEAS masta ;)
<chillywilly> (reinhard)
<chillywilly> what he says goes
<Harald1> yes, I know. Are any documents available about the design?
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> there's a whitepaper and api doc at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~reinhard/
<chillywilly> it is just a start, needs more work, imho
<chillywilly> (not to say that it is bad or anything like that just incomplete)
Action: chillywilly does not wish to anger anyone here
<Harald1> chillywilly: that's sometimes difficult, if English isn't your antive language, as one doesn't know, if a formulation is to harsh 
<Harald1> antive = native
<chillywilly> I don't follow you?
<chillywilly> s/?//
<chillywilly> what do you mean by a formulation?
<chillywilly> my point was that it is a very rough draft
<chillywilly> that's all
<chillywilly> nothing to do with english or anything like that
<Harald1> chillywilly: that's what I mean, I don't know the English word for the German one
<chillywilly> oh
<Harald1> and what I said was mainly directed at myself
<chillywilly> uhuh
<chillywilly> no worries
<chillywilly> :)
<Harald1> coming back to the bug: could you tell me which python version you're using?
<chillywilly> 2.1
<chillywilly> 2.1.2 to be more exact
<chillywilly> on debian unstable

<chillywilly> where do you work anyway?
<psu> (this was some years ago)
<psu> we kept all the 8088 and 8086 base units 
<psu> 'just in case'
<psu> actually did end up using one as a print server

<psu> chillywilly: to put it in perspective, I couldn't have installed linux on them even if I'd wanted to
<psu> intel distribs are 386 and above only IIRC
<chillywilly> but they would make great toasters

<chillywilly> well nickr took a shovel to one of his mobos
<chillywilly> and beat the thing to death
<nickr> I sure did

<dtm> nickr: hi
<psu> I was just the manager - stayed away from tech details
<psu> anyway
<dtm> psu: well good for you!

<psu> most bizzare thing was they rang the rifle range to check it would be OK

<dtm> psu: were they doing it at the rifle range?
<psu> and they said "yes, but our policy is you must remove the monitor"

<chillywilly> i dunno why once would want a list of ibjects of a particular class when they can use a nice metadat api to find out info on objects
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> and thise 'conditions'
<chillywilly> can be OQL pedicates
<chillywilly> er, predicates
<chillywilly> (look at the collection interfaces)
<chillywilly> there's a Database interface that I have yet to document that lets you get a  'Module' object whith its schema() operation
<chillywilly> you get a graph of metadata object that describes the schema
<chillywilly> objects
<chillywilly> I think this is a lot nicer ;)
<javaguy> this is the interpolation referenced elsewhere?

<javaguy> welcome back derek
<chillywilly> javaguy: it is part if the ODMG standard
<derek> thanks
<chillywilly> sup masta
<chillywilly> javaguy: what I mean by graph is jist interconnected web of objects like in any OO program (although in the ODMG world they are connected via 'relationships')
<chillywilly> er, just
<dtm> derek: welcome.
<chillywilly> the relationships are for retaining referential integrity wrt persistent objects

<crazymike> yup, I was in bed at 8
<chillywilly> wuss
<crazymike> but then Tanya called and I needed to take her a cd with some pictures she scanned 
<crazymike> i just haven't been very energetic since the other night
<crazymike> i dunno, thinking about all the shiot makes me tired
<chillywilly> don't sweat it you guys will be free before you know it
<chillywilly> ;)
<crazymike> except probably in Chicago

<chillywilly> er, him
<crazymike> I don't HAVE to, but she thinks she HAS to
<chillywilly> unless he puts a hit out on you with the russian mafia ;)
<crazymike> so she's probably gonna go w/o me for a while
<crazymike> after she graduates, that is
<chillywilly> then you will have to go far far away
<chillywilly> bah
<crazymike> I am not really sure
<chillywilly> women
<crazymike> I don't want to leave Milwaukee

<crazymike> i dunno
<crazymike> my linux is bitched again
<chillywilly> you just need to put your foot down ;)
<chillywilly> how so?
<crazymike> I need to learn to leave shit around
<crazymike> I can't boot it
<chillywilly> what are you using then?
<crazymike> I had to boot it w/ the slow boot disk
<chillywilly> what did you do?
<crazymike> I was fucking around with the grub shit
<chillywilly> heheh
<crazymike> and none of them work now...
<chillywilly> why?
<crazymike> I didn't even fuck with the single-user one
<chillywilly> why did you mess with it?
<crazymike> but it doesn't work
<crazymike> I DUNNO...I AM STUPID!!!
<jcater> ok
<chillywilly> lemme login and fix it then
<crazymike> i have to mess with things
<crazymike> go for iut
<crazymike> iut=it
<chillywilly> I see you changed it to boot the 2.5.x kernel
<crazymike> yeah
<crazymike> but I didn't get it to compile right
<chillywilly> the othe entries don't work because they don't load initrd
<crazymike> they never did
<crazymike> and they worked before
<crazymike> thats what I don't get
<crazymike> but ok
<chillywilly> the stick image rewuires you to load it
<chillywilly> er, stock
<chillywilly> requires
<crazymike> alright
<crazymike> well, I am off to bed
<crazymike> I am tired as hell
<chillywilly> if it doesn't compile
<chillywilly> you shouldn;t try to boot it
<chillywilly> it's not there
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> lemme send you the updated howto
<chillywilly> you can play tomorrow
<chillywilly> g'night dude
<crazymike> i know that
<crazymike> but I figured I would get it working eventually
<crazymike> so i put it in there
<crazymike> i thought the other entries were gonna work
<crazymike> but they didn't
<chillywilly> why didn't you make its own entry then and leave the default one
<crazymike> I dunno
<chillywilly> then you could play
<crazymike> cause I am not that smart

<NetTantra> hi all
<NetTantra> Newbie to GNUe sphere :)
<ra3vat> hi
<NetTantra> But very eager to implement
<NetTantra> Well is it really stable? is the question I put to you people first?
<ra3vat> tools (forms, designer) are useful enough for 2-tier mode
<NetTantra> And what all modules you have said to be downloadble will work for sure without bugs?
<ra3vat> none :)
<NetTantra> ra3vat: You mean to say nothing is ready yet?
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<NetTantra> hi psu
<ra3vat> tools (forms, designer) are ready to give a try
<psu> hi NetTantra
<NetTantra> so ra3vat- I have to use forms, designer and create modules and implement???
<ra3vat> i mean none is without bugs :)
<NetTantra> OKKKKKK Sounds Just great!
<NetTantra> Now the question is Customising them
<NetTantra> Do I need to have strong XML and Python knowledge to do them or I can do it with the IDE itself?
<ra3vat> NetTantra: yes for 2-tier GEAS (application server) is not ready  
reinhard (~rm@62.47.45.104) joined #gnuenterprise.
<NetTantra> hi reinhard
<NetTantra> Do I need to have strong XML and Python knowledge to do them or I can do it with the IDE itself?
<reinhard> morning
<NetTantra> reinhard: I was asking ra3vat about the ease of customization of gnue modules
<NetTantra> what do you feel?
<NetTantra> Is it too early to say anything about it?
<ra3vat> NetTantra: you can use designer and then customize them without strong XML knowledge
<NetTantra> That sounds really great!
<ra3vat> them - forms (.gfd files)
<NetTantra> ra3vat: Do you feel it is enough stable to be implemented onsite?
<ra3vat> you need python knowledge to make triggers
<NetTantra> ok
<NetTantra> What all module do you really say "Reliable"?
<ra3vat> modules (like accounting, ...) are not ready
<NetTantra> Financials, Supplychain Mgt., HR, CRM, Stores...?
<ra3vat> not yet
<NetTantra> How about Double Choco Latte?
<ra3vat> they were designed to be used with application server and now application server is in rewrite stage
<NetTantra> oH!
<ra3vat> dcl is in the way from separate php-application to something that would use gnue architecture
<NetTantra> ra3vat: Are you one among those who are rewriting GEAS?
<ra3vat> few guys working on that
<NetTantra> The Thing is, I wanted to know how long it would take to redeem the rewrite process? (Just very curious)
<nickr> geas is still in the proposal and design stage
<ra3vat> no, you should contact with reinhard, neilt, chiliwilly, jamest, jcater
<ra3vat> and others :)
<NetTantra> reinhard: Back to you :)
<NetTantra> I Want to implement GNUe in my office right now. How do I go about.. is it possible?
<psu> The team are all volunteers at the moment, so we work w/o deadlines
<nickr> in 2-tier you can do it
<ra3vat> is your office all under gnu/linux ?
<psu> as no-one can tell how much time they will have 
<NetTantra> ra3vat: We have two Linux servers.... rest or on MS
<psu> NetTantra - you can certainly use the GNUe tools in 2-tier to write apps yourself
<psu> If you're looking for "shrink-wrap" install and go Financials, HR, etc
<psu> we're not there yet
<psu> and to be honest 
<psu> we need to get the n-tier tools written & working 
<ra3vat> NetTantra: you can try bynary snapshot for MS (it is single .exe to get forms working)
<psu> before we start there.
<NetTantra> ra3vat: Come again - I did'nt get it? How do I do it with MS?
<psu> NetTantra: the official release is a few months old, you can either use that 
<psu> or the nightly CVS snapshots
<psu> I'll dig out some URLs for you
<NetTantra> psu: But how about the backend?
<NetTantra> geas with 2 tier should I stick to till geas n-tier appear?
<ra3vat> NetTantra: many well known from free to commercial
<psu> NetTantra - for the database back-end, use your choice of database
<NetTantra> ok
<psu> for the app-server backend, we have an Application Server 
<psu> that a company kindly contributed
<psu> but which needs an extensive re-write
<psu> which is just starting
<psu> On databases, we currently support loads of free and non-free choices
<NetTantra> I understand... I will try it out with PgSQL as of now... and wait for Geas to be rewritten. I hope and wish it happens at the earliest :)
<psu> including ODBC (i.e. pretty much anything that has an ODBC driver)
<psu> free: postgresql, mysql, SAP
<psu> non-free: Oracle, DB2
<NetTantra> k
<psu> Even today, 2-tier is a good framework for those sorts of little projects
<psu> that you start in MS Access before you realise you actually need something bigger ;-)
<ra3vat> NetTantra: http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/snapshots/win32/
<NetTantra> But will existing geas allows me to use Postgresql?
<ra3vat> NetTantra: then you can get your forms working from MS to postgresql on linux side
<psu> NetTantra - geas is the application server = n-tier
<psu> the guys have decided to re-write this bit
<NetTantra> ra3vat: I am planning to use psql on linux
<ra3vat> NetTantra: good
<psu> For 2-tier you just need Forms, Designer and your preferred d/b
<ra3vat> NetTantra: where are you from ? (as i do some testing for i18n)
<NetTantra> In that case how do I execute the forms in MS world?
<NetTantra> (I am from India)
<ra3vat> NetTantra: forms based on cross-platforms tools like python, wxpython and do 
<NetTantra> Can this be web enabled and can be accessed using native webbrowsers like IE or Netscape?
<psu> NetTantra - we are looking at providing mutliple client access, including HTML
<psu> there was a guy working on a pure HTML client - not sure where that got to 
<psu> we also had someone working on a PHP client 
<ra3vat> NetTantra: are you ready to run two commands from your python prompt right now?
<psu> which I think made more preogress 
<psu> It's certainly an aim to support web-based
Yurik_ (~yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) joined #gnuenterprise.
<psu> In practice, I would expect that using complicated forms via web would be quite painful
<NetTantra> ra3vat: I am on a MS machine!
<psu> so power-users would probably always want to use a proper Forms client
Yurik (yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) left irc: No route to host
<psu> but for occasional users, web is probably fine 
<psu> Some of our project team are big web-application haters - 
<ra3vat> NetTantra: ok, may be later (but python is available for MS machine too)
<NetTantra> yeah I agee with you psu
<psu> but if you look at DCL, that is exclusively web-based at the moment 
<psu> so go figure ;-)
<NetTantra> ra3vat: Unfortunate thing is I do not have it on the machine I am working... tell what if I have?
<NetTantra> ra3vat: I have got a prompt
<ra3vat> NetTantra: we have few guys from India one of them did support for some native encodings

<ra3vat> reinhard: de_AT seems more correct for a name of locale
<Isomer> I don't have a "de_AT@euro" 
<Isomer> but I do have en@quot
<Isomer> and a few others
<Isomer> reinhard: do you have a /usr/share/locale/de_AT@euro directory?
<reinhard> i believe the de_AT@euro differs from de_AT by the character set
<reinhard> de_AT@euro chooses a charset that has an euro symbol
<Isomer> one would assume that de_AT has a euro char in it somewhere
<Isomer> hmm
<reinhard> de_AT is much older than the euro :)
<Isomer> try "de_AT.euro" for your charset
<reinhard> iso 8859-1 doesn't have an euro symbol iirc
<Isomer> reinhard: er, sorry, I ment de_AT@euro has a euro char in it somewhere
<Isomer> doh
<Isomer> bah, ykwim
<reinhard> and iso 8859-15 (or something like that) is very much the same but with euro symbol

<Harald1> hi
<Arturas> Hello
<ra3vat> Harald1: hi
<dneighbo> Harald1 hopefully my email explained the testing situation
<dneighbo> i.e. we believe strongly in a test suite and regression testing
<dneighbo> but while we have good working code that is highly useful
<dneighbo> its not yet 1.0 kind of stuff with a huge user base demanding that type of testing
<dneighbo> and since we are resource sensitive currently its hard to justify large time expenditures to a testing suite when demands elsewhere are so large
<dneighbo> hopefully that makes due sense
<Harald1> dneighbo: yes, it explained everything. I was just curious. But don't you think that using a test suite later will lead to a lot of boring work? If it is done as soon as possible after the implementation, it won't be that much work at once.
Action: jcater is back (gone 01:12:11)
<Harald1> And the developer still known what he/she has done
<jcater> Harald1: you would not believe how little time we developers have
<Harald1> s/known/knows/
<jcater> while that sounds reasonable, it is even tough to get our docs done in synch w/our changes
<Harald1> jcater: I can imagine, but if it's not done know, do you believe anyone wants to do it in a year or two?
<Harald1> s/know/now/
<jcater> no more so than they want to do it now :)

<markoi> NoClue Begginners Question: Has anybody any clue huw much time must a begginner invest to setup 2 tier general ledger with gnue forms and postgres on linux? Actualy two ledgers one for a little bussiness and the other for family use. :-/
<dneighbo> for ever
<dneighbo> markoi currently we have a framework but not the 'shrink wrap' applications
<dneighbo> so you could download and install the framework to use with postgres in probably under 4 hours
<dneighbo> on debian if you are experienced linux user w/ postgres running probably take you about 10 minutes
<dneighbo> we do a have a general ledger specification
<markoi> But homepage claims it is working on several real systems
<dneighbo> markoi it is
<dneighbo> but not a general ledger
<dneighbo> the places that have it running are doing
<dneighbo> 'invoicing'
<dneighbo> 'inventory'
<dneighbo> 'call center'
Arturas (artkri@fmgs-01.vtu.lt) left irc: 
<dneighbo> the issue is that these places that are running it also paid consultants or in house staff to write the applicatiosn with the framework as 'custom' applications
<dneighbo> so they didnt give htem back to the community
<dneighbo> if you provided requirements
<dneighbo> im sure it wouldnt be too difficult to get you something completely custom running
<dneighbo> but its not something that would happen in 24hours
<dneighbo> but shouldnt drag you out endless years or anything :)
<dneighbo> what kind of business?
<dneighbo> and what 'pieces' are you looking for?
<markoi> I do use debian. I have some SAP in house consulting experience in Finances
<dneighbo> if you just want a 'ledger' you might be able to use gnucash or sqlledger
<psu> I once wrote a quick hack GL in M$ Access (oh the shame of it) in an afternoon 
<dneighbo> if you want more than that i think gnue is right for you if you are willing to put some work into building what you need
<psu> only thing I never quite got working was the balanced journal check 
<dneighbo> that said a mix match might be acceptable as well
<psu> doing something similar in GNUe probably would be as quick
<dneighbo> using sqlledger for the gl and building your other components in gnue around it
<markoi> I want to use doble sided accounting. And I do find gnue very interesting platform so I am prepared to leave some time here. In the reasonable limits to get usable results...
<dneighbo> we are looking for people willing to build/use applications :)
<dneighbo> the problem is we ahve limited people resources
<dneighbo> and most of the resources are making the tools better
<dneighbo> if they stop to build official applications the tools suffer
<dneighbo> so we are rough spot
<dneighbo> more hands help :)
<dneighbo> in fact people that are less engineer and more consulting type are what we need most :)
<markoi> I am not shure what I am more / less, but I hope to build more consulting side of me in the future
<markoi> Is gnue packaded for debian working at the moment or not? I saw some notes about some problems on KC
irs (marko@h126n2fls21o825.telia.com) left irc: "Leaving"
<dneighbo> its packaged but isnt done well
<dneighbo> i would get from cvs probably opposed to from debian packages
<dneighbo> we have some people looking into cleaning up the debian packages so they install better
<psu> i'm looking for a couple of apps I know "must" exist
<psu> on debian somewhere
<psu> a) an html validator (pref. very strict)
<markoi> Where can I find sqlledger ? It looks like sqllledger is not spelled right. No hits on deja news,...
<psu> b) something to walk through some php pages and do all the "includes" 
<nickr> psu: tidy does samething like validation, but it also cleans up html and such. Probably not what you want
<psu> to spit out normal HTML?
<nickr> psu: validator.w3c.org is what you actually want
<psu> nickr: I always reckon "my" HTML is better than any machines ;-)
<nickr> psu: as far as the php is concerned thats eay .:)
<nickr> tidy is WAY cool
<nickr> try it just for fun
<psu> nickr: yep. I will  prob have to use w3c.org - was hoping for something local
<nickr> but anyway, all the php you need to know is <?PHP include('file'); ?>
<psu> tidy will probably do - if nothing else, I can pipe the output, diff it & see 
<psu> where I disagree ;-)
<markoi> I used on DEBIAN weblint as html validator a couple of times
<nickr> you can completely crontrol how it munges the output
<nickr> its pretty serious about fixing common erros and stuff
<nickr> its a validator/fixer/indent for html
<jamest> i'm jumping in w/o reading backlog
<jamest> but seems you are talking about html tools
<jamest> anyone know of a good tool like linbot that is currently being maintained
<nickr> jamest: whats linbot do?
<jamest> you run the bot over your site and it
<jamest>   link checks
<nickr> oh
<nickr> hrm
<jamest>   slow page analyze(looks at pics, size ,etc)
<jamest>   site maps

<psu> problem to me is that a 2-tier gl doesn't go anywhere
<dneighbo> i for example would say you and i probably really arent really hot on tuning up GEAS
<dneighbo> as its not our 'domain'
<psu> as we scrap it the day we have geas v2
<dneighbo> so if people like us time is spent as
<dneighbo> 'do nothing but fondle selves'
<dneighbo> or
<psu> & a gl w/o ap, ar etc is a bit like a bikini

<psu> the very first ledget I every used 
<jcater> ToyMan_mobile: howdy
<dneighbo> hi ToyMan_mobile you on a mobile device?
<psu> had a reporting tool called "DEKE" 
Action: ToyMan_mobile is checking out his new laptop
<dneighbo> ah
<psu> co-incidence?
<dneighbo> i dont mind being called 'deke'
<psu> Was an old ICL tool
<jcater> psu: was it useful?
<ToyMan_mobile> compaq armada w/ freebsd
<dneighbo> in fact all family and friends i grew up with call me that
<jcater> if so, the namesake doesn't fit
<dneighbo> so its not something i get irrated by
<psu> jcater:  it was sort of 1970s mainframe meets 1980s SQL 
<ToyMan_mobile> what's up with the transfer possibliliteis
<ToyMan_mobile> ?
<dneighbo> if you want to tease me
<dneighbo> call me 'dekey dan'
<psu> i think that counts as a "no"
<dneighbo> as thats what mommy calls me
<dneighbo> as my initials spell out DAN
<ToyMan_mobile> so dneighbo: any win4lin yet?
<dneighbo> not yet
<dneighbo> though my machine is seeming pretty stable and getting all tools installed
<dneighbo> im hoping win4lin wont take more than a day to install
<dneighbo> hopefullly can do this week
<dneighbo> then its 'toy time'
<dneighbo> doo dit dit doo.... 'toy time'
<dneighbo> sung to the mchammer 'hammer time' music
<dneighbo> go toyman go toyman go
[14:17] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<ToyMan_mobile> ok
<ToyMan_mobile> i'm ready
Action: dneighbo recalls your image from the tradeshow
<ToyMan_mobile> my ecom site is really starting to cook
<dneighbo> and the thought of you dancing in hammer clothes dancing brings a humorous image :)
<ToyMan_mobile> gimme some big gold chains
<dneighbo> rofl
<ToyMan_mobile> and lots 'o rings
<dneighbo> yeah big gold chains can cover up anything
<dneighbo> vanilla ice is proof of that
<ToyMan_mobile> is there any way to pull down gnumeric with out taking all of gnome along for the ride?
<dneighbo> not really
<dneighbo> you using debian?
<dneighbo> you might try openoffice instead
<dneighbo> its a bit more of a pig as its all the tools
<dneighbo> BUT
<ToyMan_mobile> freebsd
<dneighbo> i dont think it requires gnome
<ToyMan_mobile> openoffice port is borked for bsd right now
<dneighbo> not only that i have found its much better for ms office compatiablity
<dneighbo> than abiword/gnumeric
<ToyMan_mobile> well, I need tables in my wp, so no abiword yet
<dneighbo> you should be able to get gnumeric kind of stripped down
<ToyMan_mobile> maybe with just gtk
<dneighbo> yes
<dneighbo> and bonobo
<dneighbo> and some other packages
<ToyMan_mobile> mebbe
<dneighbo> but probably dont need WHOLE gnome desktop
<ToyMan_mobile> hope not
<dneighbo> nickr how do you look at a deb package?
<dneighbo> to show what it depends on vs recommends 
<dneighbo> etc
<ToyMan_mobile> the laptop is just a PII 266
<ToyMan_mobile> and I like fluxbox
<nickr> dneighbo: apt-cache show 
<Mr_You> re
<nickr> gnumeric drags a LOT of libraries with it
<nickr> Depends: bonobo (>= 1.0.19), gdk-imlib1, libart2 (>= 1.2.13-5), libaudiofile0 (>= 0.2.3-4), libbonobo2 (>= 1.0.19), libc6 (>= 2.2.4-4), libdb3 (>= 3.2.9-1), libesd0 (>= 0.2.23-1) | libesd-alsa0 (>= 0.2.23-1), libfreetype6, libgal19 (>= 0.19), libgdk-pixbuf-gnome2 (>= 0.16.0-1), libgdk-pixbuf2 (>= 0.16.0-1), libglade-gnome0, libglade0, libglib1.2 (>= 1.2.0), libgnome32 (>= 1.2.13-5), libgnomeprint15 (>= 0.29-1), libgnomesupport0 (>= 1.2.13-5), 
<nickr> Suggests: gnumeric-doc, gnumeric-python, eog, guppi-gnumeric, evolution
<dneighbo> nickr :)
<dneighbo> thats what i was just ready to paste :)
<ToyMan_mobile> hmmm.
<dneighbo> most are libraries though
<nickr> all are actually
<nickr> probably a good percentage of those are optional
<dneighbo> nickr i want to know why on earth gnumeric suggests EVOLUTION
<dneighbo> is that just ximian peddling evolution or what?
<ToyMan_mobile> heh, no thanx to evol
<nickr> dneighbo: Hrm. Maybe it has some sort of funky bindings to use it or integrate scheduling or something.
<ToyMan_mobile> they *never* got the bsd ver. working on that
<dsmith> ximian wants sawfish now anyway
<psu> nickr: just like the old UNIX legend that mail used a routine in one of the games 
<psu> just to stop sysadmins removing them
<nickr> Heh
<nickr> what about gnu hello having a mailreader in it?
<dsmith> THat actually happend in nt
<dsmith> The os/2 hpfs was in some game dll
<Mr_You> unprofessional
<Mr_You> IMO
<nickr> hah
<Mr_You> so are easter eggs IMO
<nickr> hrm.

<dneighbo> beuno dias senor Chipaca 
<dneighbo> i thought you guys disappeared and were not coming back
<Chipaca> buenos días to you too, dneighbo 
<Chipaca> nope, we're just doing the ERD right now, so it's mostly sit-at-the-blackboard-and-draw
<nickr> thats my favorite stage
<Chipaca> I hope not _too_ many argentinisms get into the ERD, so that you guys can use it also
<jcater> ERD?
<dneighbo> enity relationship diagram?
<dneighbo> er entity
<drochaid> enitrely relative datagram :)
<Chipaca> yeap, although we call it the DER :)
<jcater> I was hoping for "Entirely Relational Databases"
<dneighbo> i thought it was the red spanard dance
<dneighbo> Espanol Rojo Danco
Action: Chipaca holds his putative head
<dneighbo> i.e. we are just doing the erd...
Action: dneighbo thinks they are on to something with the concept of the siesta
<dneighbo> maybe this ERD is good too?
<dneighbo> ;)
<Chipaca> you want the dotty diagram of what we've done sofar?
<dneighbo> sure
<dneighbo> what tool you using to create it?
Action: Chipaca tries to remember /dcc
<dneighbo> send it to info@gnue.org
<dneighbo> or post on the web somewhere
<dneighbo> as dcc fails for most of us
<Chipaca> dneighbo: oh, ok. it's WIP, so not much use outside of a casual chat :)
<dneighbo> gotcha
<dneighbo> go ahead and send when more complete
<dneighbo> glad to see you stopping by
<dneighbo> was worried you decided gnue wasnt right tool for the job
<Chipaca> it is, or it will be, we're not sure on that yet :)
<Chipaca> if what you advertise on www.gnue.org were correct, we'd be out of a job 
<Chipaca> :)
<dneighbo> i just encourage you to remember if it doesnt fit exactly 
<dneighbo> with a little work it probably could :)
<Chipaca> I'm pretty sure it'll fit, and the framework certainly is the right one.
<dneighbo> i was thinking based on the #debian-support channel
<dneighbo> of doing a promotional
<dneighbo> free tacos for every gnue commit that gets approved
<dneighbo> on 'developer days'
<jcater> oooooooo
<dneighbo> jcater: dont worry this would be 'locale' based
<jcater> that include my commits?
<dneighbo> so for you it oculd be 'pulled pork bbq sandwich' or something
Action: Chipaca would rather something like 'free harddrive'
<jcater> nah, donuts, dude
<dneighbo> yeah but donuts dnot match the locale
<jcater> hmmmm
<jcater> southern US
<dneighbo> btw: one of my youth guys works for krispy kreme now
<jcater> greasy, fatty food
<jcater> seems like a match to me
<dneighbo> so we get 4 dozen krispy kreme for free every sunday :)
<jcater> wow
<jcater> I wonder if that's too far a commute for me to go to church
<dneighbo> well we plan on doing virtual church soon
<dneighbo> via streaming video
<jcater> with virtual food?
<dneighbo> but not sure how we can stream the donuts
<Chipaca> you marshall them into XML, of course
<Chipaca> that'll be the first GUI DTD
<dneighbo> hmm i like your thinking Chipaca 
<dneighbo> jcater you ever chow on mexican food?
Action: Chipaca blushes
Action: dneighbo thinks you would like fried icecream
<dneighbo> and churros
Action: dneighbo wonders what argentinian food is most like
<dneighbo> being on the coast probably lots of seafood
<dneighbo> more like spain than mexico
<Mr_You> heh
Action: jcater loves mexican food
<jcater> or at least the Americanized version we have here in Memphis
<dneighbo> jcater: im dissapointed i thought you were truly non foodist like me
<dneighbo> and just loved food
<jcater> I love all food
<dneighbo> regardless of race, religion or color :)
<jcater> I do
<dneighbo> whew
<dneighbo> what is the saying
<dneighbo> the only kind of food i dont like
<dneighbo> is the kind thats not in front of me
<jcater> hehe
Action: Mr_You does not like pecan pies or coconut cake.
<jcater> ya freak
Action: Chipaca rsynced his debian mirror against nfs:/home instead of against /dev/hda2 by mistake
<Chipaca> :(
<Chipaca> pronotti is going to have my guts fer garters
<Chipaca> it was on /home/pronotti/src before I noticed :(
<Mr_You> doh! ;-)
<Mr_You> its looking like AMDs SledgeHammer (scheduled for June 2003) is gonna rock
<Chipaca> mséh

<chillywilly> jcater: you there?
<btami> hi all
<psu> hi btami
<dneighbo> chillywilly bad tact
<dneighbo> it should go like this
<chillywilly> did you see the bug in designer where deleting a widget causes a segfault?
<dneighbo> wow, i think i bought more donuts than i can eat
<chillywilly> heheh
<dneighbo> if only jcater were here to share them with
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> woweee, zowee
<btami> sorry, what lol means?
<chillywilly> I have too many krispy kremes in this box
<chillywilly> I can't possibly consume them all
<chillywilly> if only jcater were here....*sigh*
<chillywilly> lol == laugh out loud
<chillywilly> er, laughing
<btami> thanks
<jcater> chillywilly: here
<jcater> chillywilly: that's a known issue w/cvs
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> it's part of our UI reorganization in forms
<chillywilly> the degfault is a designed faeture ;)?
Action: jcater has had 0 time to look at designer since then :(
<chillywilly> er, segfault
<jcater> um, yeah... that's it
<jcater> think of it as "copy protection"
<chillywilly> it's not a bug damnit
<chillywilly> it's a feature
<jcater> as we know you are trying to knock off some ERP package
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> ouch
<chillywilly> I am mortally wounded by that statement
<chillywilly> how dare you accuse me of such vile things
<chillywilly> ;)
<btami> hi jcater, do you want some bugreports right now?
<jcater> btami: not really
<jcater> but I'll take them

<chillywilly> er, savannah
<jcater> ok
<btami> trying
<jcater> I'll update their setup scripts to not require pyxml
<btami> ok
<jcater> that's a fairly new development :)
<btami> i see :9
<btami> :)
<chillywilly> what's a new development?
<jcater> us not requiring PyXML as a dependency
<chillywilly> why did it go away?
crazymike (~crazymike@mke-65-31-133-230.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> uh oh
<chillywilly> here's trouble
<jcater> python 2.0+ has similar xml support built-in
<chillywilly> I see
<jcater> but when we wrote the parser code, we were using python 1.5.2
<chillywilly> uhuh
<crazymike> chillywilly: bite me mofo
<crazymike> :)
<chillywilly> cool , so one less dependency
<chillywilly> dependency
<jcater> yip
<chillywilly> doh, I spelled that right to beign with
<chillywilly> er, begin
<crazymike> I tried to get "mozilla-composer"
<crazymike> but there ain't no shit like that
<chillywilly> it is called something else then
<chillywilly> figure it out
<crazymike> I am bout to
<crazymike> damn
<chillywilly> apt-cache search foo
<chillywilly> phreak
<chillywilly> apt-get install mozilla may get them all
<chillywilly> maybe not
<dneighbo> please do not use savannah for bugs but rather DCL
<chillywilly> type, mozilla -compose
<dneighbo> chillywilly where did you paste that forom
<dneighbo> from
<dneighbo> can you change that?
<chillywilly> that is from gnue/common/BUGS
<dneighbo> jamest or jcater we need to get bugs@gnuenterprise.org setup
<jcater> what should it do?
<dneighbo> and someone needs to be avaliable for questions
<chillywilly> btw, the DCL link off the main site didn't work for me
<dneighbo> so i can get the email gateweay for dcl up
<dneighbo> jcater i believe it would be a local spool
<dneighbo> and the gateway would read that and create tickets directly form it
<dneighbo> er from
<dneighbo> i am looking into an easy 'create' an account as well
<dneighbo> so users can create own accounts
<chillywilly> how do you access the dcl thing?
<dneighbo> magic
<chillywilly> dcl.gnue.org?
<crazymike> LoadPlugin: failed to initialize shared library /usr/local/j2re1.3.1/plugin/i386

<dneighbo> gnuenterprise.org/dclgw/
<dneighbo> crazymike stop using java
<dneighbo> problem solved :)
<chillywilly> heheh
<crazymike> what did I do...i don't have java
<dneighbo> j2re1.3.1
<crazymike> if i do it doesn't work
<dneighbo> thats jjava
<crazymike> I know thats what it says
<crazymike> but...whatever
<chillywilly> don't sweat it
<chillywilly> it is just complaining
<dneighbo> we jused to auto kick java folks
<crazymike> fine then kick me
<dneighbo> but we have learned to stop worrying and love the java
<chillywilly> dneighbo: what does that have to do with his browser wanting to load the lpugin?
<chillywilly> er, plugin
<dneighbo> man i give the guy a hard time
<dneighbo> and you two go nuts :)
<crazymike> you said to type mozilla -compose...that is the mail composer
<chillywilly> oops
<crazymike> not that it comes up anyways
<crazymike> but it is
<chillywilly> well just  start moz and click the composer button
<crazymike> i don't have a composer button :)
<chillywilly> I can't see if there's an option anywhere
<chillywilly> yes you do
<chillywilly> it looks like a pencil and paper
<chillywilly> or something
<crazymike> nevermind i found it
<crazymike> i don't have a button
<crazymike> but I found it
<btami> dneighbo: how can i use DCL? (login,passw)
<chillywilly> oh dude
<chillywilly> mozilla -edit
<dneighbo> btami /msg me your email and first,last name
<dneighbo> and i will set you up right now :)
<chillywilly> that's the ticket
<chillywilly> what about eh?
<chillywilly> er me
<jcater> dneighbo: were you asking me to set up a bugs account? 
<jcater> or was that a general musing?
<dneighbo> not directly
Action: jcater is on heavy prescriptions
<dneighbo> saying i will need you or jamest around in next day or two when i hvae time to look at dcl gateway for email
<jcater> so you'll have to ask directly to get anything from me this week :)
<btami> dneighbo: btami@freemail.hu Bajusz Tamás
<jcater> ah
<jcater> ok
<dneighbo> as i believe it requires a 'default' account to get mail from
<jcater> unlike last week, I'm here this week :)
<chillywilly> now do bugs come in as work orders or what?
<chillywilly> can I have an account please?
<chillywilly> I want to play with it
<chillywilly> or do i already have one?
<crazymike>  well, i got to run for a bit
<crazymike> bye
<chillywilly> bye
Nick change: crazymike -> crazymike_dead
<dneighbo> jcater: i need to check at home
<dneighbo> but i think we can do multi stylesheets
<dneighbo> for xslt
<dneighbo> or use entities probably
<dneighbo> so the .xsl file that does the transformation
<dneighbo> can be variable via entities or another style sheet
<dneighbo> so one stylesheet (transformation)
<jcater> cool
<dneighbo> might have <img> persay
<jcater> so you get what I was thinking
<dneighbo> er
<dneighbo> <img location="somepath">
<dneighbo> and instead have
<dneighbo> <img location=&logo;>
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> and &logo is an entity defined in
<jcater> that's not exactly what I was thinking
<jcater> but it's a start
<dneighbo> i think it is im just not explaining it well
<dneighbo> and used bad example
<dneighbo> im thinking merged style sheets would be best
<dneighbo> worse case we use one .xsl file that is the template
<dneighbo> and you merely change it
<dneighbo> but as you stated then if we change ours you have to 'manage' your custom one
<dneighbo> where if we 'abstract' some things
<dneighbo> then we can change the base transformation and you dont have to modify your custom ones

<jcater> you recommend any books?

jamest (~jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) left #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> dneighbo: should I be asking questions like those on the "Dev" mailing list or the "Discuss" mailing list?
Action: jcater is never sure
<chillywilly> I thought we don't really have a discuss list anymore
<chillywilly> as gnue.org lists went to gnu.org
<jcater> we have gnue@gnu.org (general discussion)
<chillywilly> I think it's a design decision
<jcater> gnue-dev@gnu.org (development)
<jcater> gnue-announce@gnu.org (announcements only)
<chillywilly> so gnue-dev would be more appropriate
<jcater> ok
<chillywilly> but that's MHO
<jcater> I'd tend to agree
<jcater> but was wanting someone else's feedback :)
<Harald1> did anybody answer chillywilly's savannah vs. dcl question?
<jcater> we tend to ignore chillywilly
<Harald1> chillywilly: btw. I add the bug to dcl, and jcater already gave feedback
<dneighbo> jcater: dev list
<dneighbo> dcl not savannah Harald1 
<chillywilly> :P
Action: chillywilly sobs in his beer'
<dneighbo> jcater main reason i want on the developers list
<dneighbo> is i dont want everyone and their brother who doesnt actually use gnue or isnt willing to help
<dneighbo> losing us in a quagmire of debates
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> what about their mother?
<chillywilly> we don't want that bitch tripping us up either ;)

<jcater> thx
<dneighbo> just sent you a reply i didnt want to :)
<dneighbo> as im so afraid you will like the product too much and i abhor its parent company :)
<jcater> eh?
<jcater> I didn't think ReportLabs was free
<jcater> only their PDF creation library
<jcater> btw, I have looked at kugar
<jcater> it's not quite what I envision
<jcater> Gnue reports to be
<jcater> s/quite/
<dneighbo> being so tied to kparts immediately kills it for me :)
<jcater> yeah
<dneighbo> but the general concept was what i had wanted as a QUICK dirty start :)
<dneighbo> but i think we are beyond that now
<dneighbo> as we have a start for 'server'
<dneighbo> and honestly our markup engine ithink is more flexible :)
<dneighbo> and with xslt we will kick some butt when we have a standard
<dneighbo> but mostly i think (maybe naively so)
<jcater> my only concern for our route is the speed of transformations
<dneighbo> that since we are talking xml here that our current designer wont need too much to have visual designer :)
<jcater> but, we'll see :)
<dneighbo> jcater i expect them to be slow on bigger reports until everything is streamed
<dneighbo> however in my world i think it will be huge performance INCREASE
<jcater> lol
<dneighbo> as currently they build printed reports
<dneighbo> then build html reports
<dneighbo> then build pdf reports
<dneighbo> every time doing requeries
<dneighbo> here you would do 1 query to get the datafile
<dneighbo> then 3 tranformations
<dneighbo> so while the transformation might be marginally slower
<dneighbo> not having to requery to get a dataset each time is a huge performance boost and resource boost
<dneighbo> a ton of reports never even get 'viewed' so are drawn in vain
<dneighbo> you could do a caching sequence
<dneighbo> so say every report for month end for every department gets its .xml data file built
<jcater> yip
<dneighbo> but not until someone goes to VIEW the friggin report does it do the transformation
<dneighbo> and then it 'caches' it so the next person doesnt need to rerun the transformation
<dneighbo> even if transformation slower this does two things
<dneighbo> a. it does transform unless used (big savigns)
<dneighbo> b. it distributes the transformation to the user
<dneighbo> so instead of a report taking an hour (month end financials for all departments)
<dneighbo> it might take 15 minutes up front
<dneighbo> then each user seeing report for first time has a small (minute or two)
<dneighbo> tranformation time
<dneighbo> i hope this makes sense
<dneighbo> but in a LARGE enivornment this is where i can see us just kicking ass all over crystal reports and friends
Action: dneighbo must have lost them all :)
<jcater> I agree
Action: jcater detests crystal reports, btw
<dneighbo> i havent used in a long time
<dneighbo> i hear its much better
<dneighbo> but on principle alone i dont like it :)
<dneighbo> only thing more evil was a custom report system i maintained at one time in Mumps (M)
<dneighbo> btw M is pretty cool language
<dneighbo> chilly you would like it 
<dneighbo> its considered 'post relational'
<dneighbo> its not really objects but it is
<dneighbo> its heirarchial data structures
<dneighbo> http://www.intersystems.com/
<dneighbo> :)
<dneighbo> http://www.intersystems.com/testimonials/success/omega.html was old employer too funny they are on there
<dneighbo> Cach? also plays the leading role in Omega's latest growth activity. "Cach? has been instrumental in the development of our GUI Windows product, and we're finding it to be very well-accepted in the marketplace as an open database that has very high levels of performance," said Omega's president, Pat Stoner.
<dneighbo> thats funny
<dneighbo> the gui was written in delphi
<dneighbo> we couldnt even use thier activex components cause they were so bad
<dneighbo> we wrote our own
<jcater> lol

<javaguy> jcater: you the only one here?
<javaguy> care to field some questions?
<jcater> I can try
<jcater> depends on the topic
<javaguy> Well, I was looking over the GComm/GNU-RPC code
<javaguy> looks like it might handle what I'm looking for (distributed computing using SOAP)
<javaguy> firstly, does the soaplib library handle transport, or just serialization/de-serialization and request/response?
<jcater> um
<jcater> I think the latter
<jcater> I've only minimally looked into soaplib
<javaguy> Ok.  Then, I would need to attach it to a transport vehicle of some sort, such as Apache?
<jcater> you might want to look at medusa
<jcater> with is an asynchronous transport server written in python
<jcater> that's what I'll be using for the transport in gnurpc
<javaguy> Ah...Ok
Action: javaguy updates his todo list
<javaguy> so, GNU-RPC is seperate from GComm?
crazymike (~crazymike@mke-65-31-133-230.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> well
<javaguy> hello crazymike
Action: jcater tries to remember what GComm refers to
<jcater> are you referring to "GNue-Common" 
<jcater> or the gcomm drivers
<crazymike> javaguy: hi
<jcater> if the latter, then gcomm was the "working" name for gnu-rpc
<jcater> hence the directory structure :)
<javaguy> the gcomm drivers.  The SOAP driver is the one I'm interested in specifically
<javaguy> Ok.  And the SOAP driver for GNU-RPC incorporates/will incorporate this medusa transport?
<jcater> yes
drochaid (drochaid@pc2-kirk2-0-cust175.ren.cable.ntl.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jcater> however, the soap driver isn't very far along
<jcater> my first "Test" case was xml-rpc because of its simplicity
<jcater> my thinking was that as soon as I had a working xml-rpc
<jcater> soap would be a small jump away
<javaguy> what sort of timeframe are you looking at before GEAS is ready for alpha testing w/ SOAP?
<chillywilly> crazymike: whirrred
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> javaguy: we just started looking at reimplementing geas using gnue-common
<jcater> there has been no code to that effect
<jcater> so that's a tough question
<chillywilly> real soon now (tm)
<crazymike> chillywilly: ???
<jcater> I honestly don't expect there to be much to geas
<javaguy> heya, CW
<chillywilly> crazymike: I said wassup my nick-a
<crazymike> chillywilly: ahhhh
<jcater> as much of its functionality will come from stuff in gnue-common
<jcater> but it's real hard to say
<crazymike> whats with the (tm)???
<chillywilly> a joke
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> I was talking about geas
<chillywilly> d00d
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> sup javaguy
<javaguy> CW: you are running the GEAS re-write?
<chillywilly> um, no
<chillywilly> reinhard is the official geas masta
<chillywilly> I got some idears I have been working on
<chillywilly> ;)
<crazymike> wow...cute
<jcater> chillywilly just hangs around
<jcater> he doesn't actually do anything
<jcater> :D
Action: jcater ducks from flying trout
<chillywilly> whatever
<javaguy> Is there anything I could do speed the process along?
<javaguy> I would even be willing to write python code...
<crazymike> d00d, no offense, but it needs alot
<chillywilly> try /msg fool
<jcater> someone needs to jumpstart the recoding process
<crazymike> ???
<chillywilly> and I know it needs actual 'content'
<chillywilly> I hate html
<crazymike> why /msg???
<chillywilly> because I only feel like talking to you
<chillywilly> on that issue
<crazymike> ahhh
<chillywilly> that's what friggin /msg was invented for
<jcater> javaguy: what kind of timeframe are you needing?
<javaguy> no hard-and-fast timeline.  This isn't for production, or anything
<javaguy> just me getting my hands dirty with SOAP
<jcater> ah
<jcater> that sounds backwards
<jcater> "getting my hands dirty with SOAP"
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> heheh
<crazymike> dpkg: `start-stop-daemon' not found on PATH.

<jcater> um
<jcater> trying to second-guess debian's install program
<jcater> installing from debian potato cd
<jcater> and on first reboot (before performing install of rest of programs)
<chillywilly> well this is an already running sid syste, he's got
<chillywilly> er, system
<jcater> changing my /etc/apt/sources.list to point to woody
<jcater> I ended up having to copy those 2 scripts from another debian machione
<jcater> and doing an apt-get dist-upgrade
<chillywilly> heh
<jcater> or an apt-get -f install 
<jcater> I forget which
<jcater> I think it was the latter, come to think of it

<chillywilly> er, our
<chillywilly> your
<crazymike> i have no clue
<jcater> did it ask you
<chillywilly> what the?
<jcater> "Doing this will really screw up your system
<chillywilly> Unpacking cupsys (from .../cupsys_1.1.14-3_i386.deb) ...

<chillywilly> heh

<crazymike> i dunno
<crazymike> i suck, i guess
<chillywilly> error messages
<chillywilly> it's all about the error messages
<chillywilly> you su'd over to root to try and install cupsys?
<crazymike> no
<chillywilly> what did you do then?
<crazymike> i opened my root terminal to try and install cupsys
<chillywilly> well dude
<chillywilly> that -p option
<chillywilly> tells it tto use your environment variables
<chillywilly> and you obviously do not have /sbin, etc. in your path
<chillywilly> that's all
<chillywilly> change it by right clicking
<chillywilly> then remove that switch
<chillywilly> or
<chillywilly> add thise to your path'
<chillywilly> those dirs it didn't like
<crazymike> take out the "-p"
<chillywilly> yep
<crazymike> gnome-terminal -e "su -p" -t "Root" 
<chillywilly> or add those dirs to your path
Action: chillywilly has the latter
<chillywilly> just copy
<crazymike> gnome-terminal -e "su" -t "Root" 
<chillywilly> /home/danielb/.bash* to your home dir
<chillywilly> and you'll have those system dirs in your path and you can leave the -p
<chillywilly> PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/Acrobat4/bin:/usr/X11/bin:./:/usr/lib/postgresql/bin:$PATH
<chillywilly> that's in my .bash_profile on your box
<chillywilly> (my account on your box that is)
<crazymike> yeah
<crazymike> how do I get to cups now???
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> you open http://localhost:634 in galeon
<chillywilly> (not 100% sure about the port number)
<chillywilly> configure that sucer
<chillywilly> as I already installed it
<chillywilly> er, sucker
<crazymike> that connection was refused
<chillywilly> then the number is wrong
<chillywilly> you might need to open that port though
<chillywilly> lemme look at my stuff
<chillywilly> oh cool new injet drivers
<chillywilly> hp inkjets work perfectly now as of 3/22
<chillywilly> groovy
<chillywilly> I can't fidn the damn port number
<chillywilly> this is annoying
<crazymike> sorry
<chillywilly> just help me look ;)
<crazymike> where in the hell am I supposed to look???
<chillywilly> anywhere
<chillywilly> there's a damn documentation package but I can't recall the name
<chillywilly> bah, I'll try google
<crazymike> http://www.cups.org/documentation.html
<chillywilly> finally
<chillywilly> http://localhost:631
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> I need to write that down in my notes
<chillywilly> I always forget it
<chillywilly> done
<chillywilly> but you need samba setup first if you're going to share your dad's printer

<nickr> chillywilly: what you need to do is remember that cups impliments the IPP standard, therefore you can grep /etc/services for it
<crazymike> chillywilly: I dunno, i might not get there til 7:30
<chillywilly> doh
<crazymike> I dunno, depends on when I wake up

<derek> since it was a print of same thing it likely will stall as well
<derek> its odd i dont hear the machine chugging away but nothing is printing
<jcater> what was it?
Action: derek slaps it a few times (with a smelly trout of course)
<jcater> if the pr0n had a lot of gradients, that could cause a lot of processing
<derek> jcater: a calendar
<derek> yes lots of gradients
<derek> picture of a nice color train

<jcater> how high?
<mdean> some might think so
<Maniac> how's work?
<mdean> sux
<Maniac> really?
<mdean> not working with linux, so yeah
<Maniac> ah
<derek> wassup
<derek> mdean liked your FSF response
<derek> i plan on calling brad as its really ticking me off
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> good response
<derek> 3 times i have specifically said we will do what it takes to make our stuff work for you
<mdean> the latest one?
<derek> ys
<derek> yes
<derek> we said we would build to SPEC
<derek> we were told no you dont do emacs
<derek> now they use something that doesnt use emacs either
<chillywilly> what are you dudes talking about
<chillywilly> ?
<derek> on contact manager i told them we will build to SPEC
<mdean> I almost told him it reminded me of a company choosing a proprietary software package over a Free one because the proprietary one had all the features
Action: Maniac seconds chillywilly
<derek> then voila im told they are writing something in house
<derek> from scratch
<derek> i went nuts
<derek> mdean: that was SUPPOSED to be the point of my email
<derek> RMS says who cares if prop software has all the features live w/o them for freedom
<Maniac> mailing list emails?
<derek> but when it comes to own packages
<derek> ditch at first site of package with MORE features
<derek> sigh
<derek> psu for the record everything from mdean talking to now please do not put in the kernel cousin for political reasons
<derek> i have no shame in saying it but dont want to air dirty laundry more publicly than necessary
<jcater> woohoo
<jcater> I plugged us on wx-dev
<jcater> :)
<derek> chillywilly: talking about internal FSF politics
Action: jcater is trying to get into that habit
<derek> you are learning well young jedi knight
<jcater> wx is getting very bloated though
<jcater> they have wxDB, wxDBTables, ...
<derek> yeah i see that
<derek> they need to go to Delphi module
<chillywilly> heh
<derek> make lightweight components
<jcater> sigh
<derek> and let 'third party' do the rest
<jcater> that's your solution to everything
<jcater> "marriage problems?"
<derek> i.e. i dont want 15 different fricken nutty widgets
<derek> give me base widgets
<jcater> "hey, use the delphi model of lightweight communication"
<derek> and add in the others 
<derek> jcater: rofl
<derek> i think delphi is a good tool in some areas on in others
<chillywilly> delphi shmelphi
<derek> i think its VCL is best component model i have seen to date
<Maniac> delphi r0x0rs my b0x0rs
<derek> and their approach of go light and let other users contribute the rest via bring in at own necessity was a good one
Action: chillywilly watches derek stroke off to delphi
<derek> it would be like us demanding we load ALL dbdrivers in common
<derek> even if you only use one
<derek> i much rather like the plug what you need approach

<javaguy> thanx, CW
<javaguy> Is GEAS/GNUe going to be using WSDL?  If so, I could put together some docs for the core business objects...
<jcater> WSDL?
<javaguy> Web Service Description Language
<jcater> ack
<chillywilly> dotgnu will
<chillywilly> most likely
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> I'm not familiar w/that
<javaguy> I can pull the URL for the spec, if you like
<jcater> sure
<javaguy> dotgnu is FSF's implementation of .NET?
<jcater> soemthing like that
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> I am sure some dotgnu + gnue interfacing will happen some day
<chillywilly> I dunno when though
<jcater> that's easy
<jcater> as soon as someone contribs it
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> hehe ;P
<chillywilly> fuck I am tired
<chillywilly> need caffiebe
<chillywilly> er, caffiene
<javaguy> here it is: http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl
<chillywilly> is it an xml thingy?
<chillywilly> anyone know where there's a nice little graphic of the liberty bell?
<javaguy> WSDL is not specific to .NET.  It's main use is to document the interface used by a SOAP-accessible service, but there's nothing preventing it from being used by other services
<chillywilly> I guess it is in xml ;)
<javaguy> Yes, it is an XML thingy ;)
<chillywilly> hrrrm, so to describe a corba service, or xml-rpc, or whatever?
<chillywilly> http?
<jcater> I describe all my interfaces
<jcater> they are labeled "enter at your own risk"
<chillywilly> hey dude this sounds nifty
<chillywilly> maybe we should use it in gnurpc
<javaguy> Yes.  Seeing as SOAP is a direct descendant of XML-RPC, it should rather easy to use WSDL in conjunction with XML-RPC
<chillywilly> well they talk about using http get/post and mime to
<chillywilly> too
Action: chillywilly wants an irc interface to geas ;)
<jcater> gack
<chillywilly> that would be fun
<javaguy> not sure what changes (if any) would need to be made IOT support CORBA
<jcater>  /msg geas give me a all the rows from objec txxxx
<jcater> <geas> Does not compute. No object txxxx
<chillywilly>  /msg geas select s from Professors where s.name == "billyboy"
<chillywilly> (OQL queries)
<chillywilly> I dunno
<jcater> OQL uses select statements?
<chillywilly> yes, it is VERY SQL-like
<jcater> is there a python OQL parser?
<chillywilly> no, but we shoudl write one
<chillywilly> ;)
dneighbo (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<javaguy> not sure about, WSDL, but SOAP can be used over pretty much any communications protocols
<chillywilly> there's some sample grammar
<jcater> run!
<chillywilly> it returns collections like basg or sets of objects
<chillywilly> er, bags
<chillywilly> also
<javaguy> The book I'm studying right now discusses using http(s), MIME w/ attachments, JMS (Java Messaging Service)
<chillywilly> statements to creta an object
<chillywilly> er, create
<javaguy> Probably a few others I've missed
<chillywilly> supports a lot of SQLisms too, for completeness
<javaguy> All you have to be able to do is send and receive XML messages
<chillywilly> OQL is very clsoe to SQL-92 (says it in my book ;) )
<chillywilly> er, close
<chillywilly> extensions concern object-oriented notions like complex objects, object identity, path expressions, polymorphism, operation invocation, and late binding
<chillywilly> blah blah
<jcater> bah
<chillywilly> you can clal object methods with it
Action: jcater goes back to gnue-reports coding
<chillywilly> er, call
<chillywilly> and you can even refer to parent objects and hve the instances it pulls be derived form those and it doesn't make a difference
<javaguy> CW: The only reference I could find for ODMG was a pitch to buy a book.  Is there anything open?
<jcater> bah
<jcater> you young object wippersnapers
<chillywilly> I bought the book
<chillywilly> jcater: I like SQL
<jcater> you should make a pin-on button
<jcater> like "I like Ike"
<chillywilly> uh, sure dude
<chillywilly> javaguy: I would look at Java Data Objects thing, but the Java binding is lame, imho and it has some really shitty EULA on it
<chillywilly> I dunno how they can put an EULA on a spec
<chillywilly> it's stupid
<chillywilly> the ODMG's answer for java is to use some outside property files to express what fields/attributes of an object are 'persistent'....it is just lame
<chillywilly> the smalltalk binding qwould probably be geared more towards how one would do it in python
<chillywilly> sine they are loosely typed langauges
<chillywilly> javaguy: btw, that odmg.txt file is my notes on the standard ;)
<javaguy> Cool.  I'll take a look at it.  There are Java interfaces available off odmg.org, so I'm not flying completely blind... ;)
<chillywilly> yea, I downloaded those
<chillywilly> they help
<chillywilly> escpecially the 2.0 one
<chillywilly> imho
<chillywilly> the 3.0 binding is stupid
<javaguy> Yeah.  JDO looked like something we could probably live without...
<javaguy> hmm...I think I got the 3.0 bindings.  I'll see if I can't find the 2.0 bindings
<chillywilly> I am trying to incorporate the standard somewhat into our overall architecture
<javaguy> Of course, this will all be implemented under the covers by the python guys, so I don't need to be too knowledgable
<chillywilly> I read the whole book already
<javaguy> do I?
<jcater> python guys?
<chillywilly> I don't know of anyone else implementing it
<jcater> we have python guys?
<chillywilly> we are probably going to implement it
<chillywilly> (I hope)
<chillywilly> we'll see
<javaguy> that'd be you, jcater ;)
<chillywilly> heh, geas people == python guys now
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> sigh
<chillywilly> the current app server is going bye bye
<dneighbo> i vote the button (i like ike)
<dneighbo> s
<jcater> actually, I'm ready to get the ball rolling w/geas
<dneighbo> as
<dneighbo> "I give a Poop about OOP"
<jcater> rofl
<dneighbo> or like woody the owl says
<chillywilly> hehe
<dneighbo> give a poop
<dneighbo> use oop
<jcater> I get my Kix
<jcater> using WX
<chillywilly> jcater: hack on gnurpc some more den ;)
<jcater> gnurpc isn't the geas hangup, dude
<jcater> we need a file format
<chillywilly> odl!
<dneighbo> jcater: lets use the kiss anthem 'lets put the X in wx'
<chillywilly> :P
<jcater> :)
Action: chillywilly os obssessed with ODMG
<jcater> fwiw
<chillywilly> muuuwahahahah
<jcater> I think we need an "appserver" directory in cvs
<jcater> under gnue/
<dneighbo> we had one
<chillywilly> 10-4 that good buddy
<jcater> to house the new appserver :)
<dneighbo> it got renamed geas
<chillywilly> I agree
<jcater> why?
<chillywilly> heheh
<jcater> oh, why?
<dneighbo> um why did the old dir used to be called gnuef?
<chillywilly> well reinhard said that's what he wanted to name it
<chillywilly> it was called objectserver
<chillywilly> not appserver ;)
<chillywilly> I saw it
<dneighbo> chillywilly: ah yes you are correct it was object server not app server
<jcater> I just don't think 'geas' fits with the naming scheme
<jcater> "GNUe GEAS?"
<jcater> but, whatever :)
<jcater> I was thinking we'd leave the existing tree there
<jcater> for reference
<javaguy> So, are we going forward with the WSDL?
<jcater> eh?
<jcater> I'd imagine gnurpc would eventually expose that
<chillywilly> is WDSL like a common way to describe what operations are exposed?
<jcater> dudes!
<chillywilly> bah, I should just read it when I geta chance
<jcater> I already got a private email response
<dneighbo> yeah ted
<chillywilly> about what?
<jcater> from my post to the wx-dev group
<chillywilly> uh?
<chillywilly> oooh, nifty
<dneighbo> sorry 'bill and ted's excellent adventure flash backs'
<dneighbo> so share the response man
<jcater> Hi Jason,
<jcater> I saw your post on wx-dev. I wasn't aware of GNUe or that it was done in
<jcater> wxPython. Do you contribute to wxPython or subscribe to the wx-python users
<jcater> list? 
<javaguy> The way I've seen it used is mainly as a convenience for SOAP, but I see no reason why it can't be used in conjunction with other RPC mechanisms
<jcater> he's from the PythonCard project
<dneighbo> why does pythoncard sound familiar?
<chillywilly> javaguy: well they have other bindings there http, mime, etc. they say you can use any protocol right?
<chillywilly> I dunno, I'll let jcater worry abot it ;P
<javaguy> yes.  So long as you can transmit and receive XML docs
<chillywilly> me is just trying to immerse himself in odmg land
<chillywilly> woops
<chillywilly> me == /me
<jcater> ah
<jcater> so our report definitions could be SOAP
<chillywilly> funky-butt-lovin
<jcater> they could just be an encapsulated SOAP command
Action: jcater ducks from flying curses
<chillywilly> I have yet to get myself into the whole xml, soap, w3c craziness
<chillywilly> it's on my TODO
<javaguy> come on CW, it's fun! ;)
<chillywilly> I am sure it is
<chillywilly> I read the w3schools titorials
<chillywilly> some of them
<chillywilly> but if I don;t use it
<chillywilly> out the window it goes
<chillywilly> I forget it
<javaguy> The XP work group seems to be the most active.  I would start there
<chillywilly> XPath?
<javaguy> Lotsa cool stuff to read: XML Schema, XSLT, XML-RPC
<javaguy> XML Protocol
<chillywilly> yea, I want to read some of that stuff soon
<chillywilly> but I was in c++ land for a while
<chillywilly> and now odmg land
Action: chillywilly contributed some patched to gnu common c++
<chillywilly> er, patches
<chillywilly> the DOM looks interesting too
<javaguy> Oh, there's also a spec for using SOAP over NNTP...
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> you could also do SOAP over IIOAP via CORBA
<chillywilly> er, IIOP
<javaguy> yeah, I've heard they're working on a CORBA-SOAP bridge
<chillywilly> javaguy: you look at SOUP?
<chillywilly> gnome's SOAP thingy
<javaguy> No.  I haven't done too much w/ GNU Windows^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^HGNOME since I moved over to XFCE
<chillywilly> and KDE is not windows-like?
<nickr> ugh, xfce
<chillywilly> I think they are both a bit windowsish
<chillywilly> but then again windows didn't even invent the desktop idea
<chillywilly> they stole it
<chillywilly> so maybe we are all Xerox-like
<javaguy> didn't say it wasn't.  They're both rather bloated, but hey people must like them, or else they wouldn't be in active development
<chillywilly> the days of me using onyl a wm are over
<chillywilly> I just like my Gnoem
<chillywilly> er Gnome
<chillywilly> xfce is a desktop too isn't it?
<javaguy> I guess.  Depends on how you define 'desktop'
<javaguy> It has it's own file manager, and it has event sounds
<javaguy> It looks to be a CDE clone, if you've ever used Solaris
<chillywilly> KDE was/is supposed to be a CDE look-a-like
<chillywilly> or something
<javaguy> Not any version of CDE I've used
<javaguy> As you say, it looks more like windows
<nickr> xfce is faicrly similar to CDE
<chillywilly> well I dunno wtf CDE looks like
<chillywilly> solaris is going to Gnome anyway ;)
<javaguy> I'm running 2.7 at work.  Haven't seen 9.  Is it shipping w/ GNOME?
<chillywilly> I dunno when they are going to ship Gnome with it
<chillywilly> they are supposed to be switching to Gnome
<javaguy> Didn't they say that like a year ago?
<chillywilly> yea, but they are slow
<chillywilly> and Gnome 2 is late
<chillywilly> maybe they are waiting for Gnome 2
<chillywilly> who knows
<chillywilly> they are hacking on the ATK I think
<chillywilly> accessibility toolkit
<chillywilly> I think Sun is doing that
<nickr> yea
<nickr> Gnome 2 looks sweet
<chillywilly> so I hear
<chillywilly> I wish they would make some debs so I could try it out
<chillywilly> I don't have the space to compile it
<chillywilly> oh well it will just be that much more fun when it actually gets into debian
<nickr> wait for woody+1
<chillywilly> when do you think they will release woody?
<chillywilly> os that the release of woody you are talking about?
<chillywilly> s/os/id
<chillywilly> er, is
<nickr> I have no idea when woody will released
<nickr> probably in a few months
<chillywilly> what is woody+1?
<nickr> once woody is released a lot of new software wil go into sid I think.
<chillywilly> ok

<jcater> I tested that with several forms

<jamest> try it w/ helloworld.gfd

<jcater> but I swear I tested it w/several forms

<dneighbo> Bonjour mon amis
<jbailey> Bonjour - Ca va?
<dneighbo> comment t'allez vous?
<dneighbo> comme ci comme ca 
<jcater> se habla gnue?
<dneighbo> oui
<dneighbo> je parle gnue
<dneighbo> GNUe est tres chic.
<jcater> GNUe est tres headache.
<dneighbo> Il vous donnera un grand penis!
<jbailey> Le gnue-viagra-a-l'herbe!
<SachaS> headache = mal à la tete
<dneighbo> parce que c'est si bon
<SachaS> GNUe c'est commme une voiture sans moteur
<SachaS> sorry guys
<dneighbo> merde a la tete explains gnue developers eh :)
<jbailey> dneighbo: Et l'alcool pour le sens..  (How do you spell blood again?)
<jbailey> sengs?
<jbailey> Hmm
<jbailey> Ca fait trop long depuis que j'ecris.
<dneighbo> its been so long since i spoke/wrote french 
<dneighbo> i shoudl start more often
<dneighbo> er practice
<dneighbo> les femmes aiment les hommes qui utilisent le gnue
<dneighbo> jcater that should be our 'pitch'
<dneighbo> women love men that use gnue :)
<SachaS> sorry guys about my comment. according to the homepage of gnue it is an erp system with which you can do hr, finance, supply chain management etc etc but there is so much missing.... it will take much more time.
<dneighbo> years
<SachaS> thanks dneighbo and i though i am mean :)
<jbailey> SachaS: "erp".
<jbailey> Like when you try to use it, your tend to yell erp, and throw your computer out the window?
<dneighbo> i think your statement was a lie though
<dneighbo> didnt it say
<dneighbo> its like a car with out a motor?
<SachaS> yes.
<dneighbo> it should read its like a motor w/o a car
<SachaS> :)
<dneighbo> what exactly are you looking for SachaS ?
<dneighbo> i.e. i really really want to get some gnue apps out the door
<dneighbo> even if they are not the 'official' n-tier spec
<dneighbo> i have a commitment to getting some stuff done for ToyMan 
<dneighbo> and i have some stuff im doing for client of mine
<dneighbo> and we might have some contact manager stuff coming down the road
<dneighbo> and i have lots of todos for DCL/GNUe
<dneighbo> but 
<dneighbo> i really am willing to start and try to coddle things people need
<dneighbo> that are willing to participate
<dneighbo> i.e. test and actually use in production
<dneighbo> all i can is last night
<SachaS> dneighbo: i wanted to use it for some simple tests.
<dneighbo> forms over 'ssh tunnel' saved me countless hours and was an utter god send
<dneighbo> it just ROCKS
<SachaS> dneighbo: i tried to install it on debian testing without success because of python stuff. I guess i got the designer running but did not try to create pages. MUST give it another try.
<SachaS> dneighbo: finance. simple account with add and minux (activa and passiva). i guess it just gets bloody compilcated fast ...
<dneighbo> SachaS are you looking to use this or just want to play?
<dneighbo> installing on debian testing shoudl be really quick
<dneighbo> what was the hang up ?
<SachaS> dneighbo: Primarly play, i guess. python-orb or python-something. was about 2 months ago.
<dneighbo> i think you just
<dneighbo> apt-get install libwxgtk2.2-python (wehre 2.2 is what ever version in testing)
<dneighbo> it will install python for you
<dneighbo> and other dependencies
<dneighbo> since you no longer need pyxml
<dneighbo> thats it
<dneighbo> then just get cvs tree
<dneighbo> and from root of cvs tree run
<dneighbo> ./setup-cvs (or something)
<dneighbo> its only setup file there
<dneighbo> and voila you are done (w/o db access)
<dneighbo> if you want db access
<dneighbo> apt-get install postgres (whatever the name is)
<dneighbo> apt-get install psycopg
<SachaS> :)
<dneighbo> and edit your config file and done
<SachaS> i know it is all easy :)
<SachaS> its 01.30 am here so I will not do it now. another day.
<SachaS> to run an erp system would be bloody great! 
<SachaS> dneighbo: i wrote a report about ebxml and mentioned gnue in there. if you want you can have a look at it at ttp://www.openebxml.org/information/papers/papers.html (Student paper by Sascha)
<SachaS> http://www.openebxml.org/information/papers/papers.html

<javaguy> hey jbailey.  Long time no see
<jbailey> Heya javaguy!
<javaguy> K4rbonk|0: I know GNUe's been used in production in quite a few different environments
<javaguy> Not sure what sort of point-of-sales support has been developed (or even what would be required)
<K4rbonk|0> javaguy: you mean big business... can you suggest me something for a little shop?
<javaguy> mainly small to midsized business, in place of Access/QuickBooks/Peachtree
<javaguy> most of the big shops tend to stick with the commercial ERP systems (so far...)
<dtm> hi all
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: it is intended to be fully scalable like javaguy says
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: also there is a company called http://appgen.com if you need something more specific which gnue may not have completed yet.
<K4rbonk|0> okay thanks to all :)
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: i suggest them because they use open standards such as SQL and java, so we can interoperate with them eventually :)
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: but you should stick around and ask the gnue experts
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: dont leave without fully investigating it
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: or email info@gnue.org with your specs
<K4rbonk|0> oh this is a great idea!
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: gnue's team is willing to adjust priorities to users' needs
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: so i encourage you to know your specs and features that you need, in any case, and send them to the gnue core team and see how much is already complete, or if there's a short term common interest.
<K4rbonk|0> okay i'll surely do it.. i think this project is very interesting... .NET? bbuuuaaahh!!! :))
<dtm> hahah
<dtm> agreed
<K4rbonk|0> :)
<dtm> yes and gnue has a sufficiently mature core that it's being used in production already
<dtm> the designers are quite wizardly
<K4rbonk|0> great! i'm a proud linux user!
<dtm> so it's not like it's _onlY_ set to be used by a specific audience
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: yes , so are we!  glad to meet you :)
<K4rbonk|0> me too!!! yeah!!!! :) f#ck m$!!!
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: you'll wanna talk to people like chillywilly, derek (aka dneighbo), mdean, jamest, nickr, etc
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: hahaha
<dtm> there are those who would say that ;>
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: info@gnue.org will surely reach everyone
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: derek is the project manager
<dtm> the head one, anyway
