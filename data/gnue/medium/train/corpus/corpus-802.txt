<btami> Harald1: maybe these dirs are not used or dead
<reinhard> sorry back
<reinhard> had a long phone
<reinhard> they are dead yes
<reinhard> the dirs
<reinhard> where did you get those names from?
<reinhard> probably an outdated documentation or somehting like that
<Harald1> well you see them in the web interface
<Harald1> and they are in the cvs snapshots
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> which web interface do you use?
<reinhard> lxr/bonsay are heavy out of sync
<reinhard> AFAIK
<Harald1> http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/gnue/gnue/
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> that should be current
<Harald1> and in the snapshots here http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/snapshots/
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> those dirs are empty
<reinhard> or only contain other (empty) directories
<reinhard> they are obsoleted
<reinhard> and if you check out using -P then empty dirs are ignored

<reinhard> hi SachaS
<SachaS> hi Reinhard. how are you?
<reinhard> thanks fine
<SachaS> i had a look at BPML today. BPML is a meta language.
<SachaS> basically a xml vocabulary for business processes.
<reinhard> ah
<SachaS> (i still am not sure where to place it in connection with a erp system, though)
<SachaS> question what is a business process?
<SachaS> "A structure for action" ... according to some guy
<reinhard> hmmm
<reinhard> i would say it is
<reinhard> an algorithm for the business
<SachaS> so basically BPML has some tags which people can use to describe their business processes (as mentioned yesterday, mainly for enterprise business processes)
<SachaS> yeah is also good.
<SachaS> I cited the specification: "A process is a specific ordering of work activities across time and place, with a beginning, an end, and clearly defined inputs and outputs"
<SachaS> the main entities of the BPML vocabulary are: - messages, - participants, - activites, - rules, -transactions and - processes.
<SachaS> what are you doing when you analised your business processes and modelled/described them with BPML?
<SachaS> I guess there is no software out there yet which "simply" parses it and executes it and voila you have a system which handles your processes.
<SachaS> what i miss is a document, specification with the title: "How do I create a state-of-the-art Enterprise Resource Planning System"
<SachaS> maybe your work can result in such a document if there is none yet.

<Arturas> Hello Derek
<dneighbo> hey Arturas 
<dneighbo> how is i18n going?
<dneighbo> you get ra3vat to test things for you?
<Arturas> yes
<dneighbo> good news or bad news?
<Arturas> he said the strings even in source code were different [they should be the same]
<Arturas> :\
<Arturas> where in forms font is set up?
<Arturas> can't find it
<Arturas> know that on file ~/.gtkrc
<dneighbo> if set anywhere would be gnue.conf
<Arturas> depends only menu-fonts
<Arturas> no
<Arturas> there is font-size, width, but not font-name
<dneighbo> then its coming from your theme of either gnome/kde or windowmanager
<dneighbo> er maybe thats not correct
<Arturas> no :)
<Arturas> if that would be, everything would be fine :)
<dneighbo> as i think we use some fixed font
<Arturas> yes :)
<Arturas> in gnue.conf
<Arturas> but somewhere has to be
<Arturas> font name and font encoding
<ra3vat> Arturas: the test shows strings as one-byte character string, so no any i18n specific symbols
<Arturas> [at least default values]
<ra3vat> no unicode
<Arturas> ra3vat: the letter was encoded in utf8
<Arturas> ra3vat: could you maybe send the same letter back to me?
<Arturas> ra3vat: (dcc?)
<ra3vat> Arturas: yes the letter was. Saw it correctly in Outlook Express with specific symbols as you described in the message 
<ra3vat> and then what?

<dneighbo> outlok express.... shame on you dmitry
<Arturas> ra3vat: you have kde?
<Arturas> :)
<ra3vat> yes
<Arturas> better than me over telnet :)
<Arturas> ra3vat: can you open the same letter in kmail?
<Arturas> kde supports cut&paste with i18n
<Arturas> copy the source into file
<Arturas> chmod 777 :)
<Arturas> and run
<dneighbo> hey Arturas 
<dneighbo> # The next 2 options are only used by the wxPython clients
<dneighbo> # Normally, default font style and size is used, according to the active theme
<dneighbo> # Set this to 1 if you want fixed width fonts
<dneighbo> fixedWidthFont = 1
<dneighbo> # Font size if fixedWidthFont = 1 (ignored otherwise)
<dneighbo> pointSize = 14
<dneighbo> this tells me that the THEME font is used
<Arturas> eys
<Arturas> m
<Arturas> yes
<Arturas> ?
<dneighbo> so that is where you would get your font information
<Arturas> what is THEME?
<dneighbo> i dont use kde so dont know how it works
<dneighbo> in gnome
<Arturas> what it is in gnome?
<dneighbo> you can edit your 'theme' for gnome or your 'theme' for your windowmanager
<Arturas> we're back again
<dneighbo> in gnome if you go to settings:gnome control center
<Arturas> 1.
<Arturas> in kde i have the same control center
<dneighbo> then
<Arturas> 2.
<dneighbo> desktop->theme selector
<Arturas> all fonts are set up for iso10646-1 encoding
<Arturas> 3.
<dneighbo> it shows the themes
<dneighbo> and you can use a USER font instead of theme font there
<dneighbo> to override the 'theme'
<Arturas> all texts in kde are displayed [with i18n data] ok
<Arturas> 4.
<Arturas> if forms uses THEME
<Arturas> they should support  i18n data too
<ra3vat> Arturas: if i got the test source from your second message (from attachment) is not it the same? 
<Arturas> but it is not so
<dneighbo> an easy way to test
<Arturas> ra3vat: the same [at least should be :]
<dneighbo> change your theme to a really ODD and DISTINGUISHING FONT
<dneighbo> then open up forms
<dneighbo> if it has that same odd font you know its using the theme
<Arturas> what does it mean: odd, distinguish?
<dneighbo> if its font remains the same you know it is not
<dneighbo> means: something you would notice
<dneighbo> i.e. make font, big and bold or something
<Arturas> ok
<ra3vat> Arturas: in the source strings encoded as multybyte utf8 string but they displayed as one-byte lenght character strings on my system
<ra3vat> another source to get info about encoding is sys.getdefaultencoding() on python's startup
<Arturas> dneighbo: i'll (*@(*#%Q!#$&%#$@)!(#* you. Made my font size 48 and now can't cancell it - cancel button is below the screen :| and i can't reach it
<Arturas> :)
<dneighbo> ouch
<dneighbo> you dont have virtual desktops
<Arturas> ra3vat: don't know
<dneighbo> hey dont kill me
<dneighbo> jamest used to configure forms so that they were like 1000 times bigger than my video card could deal with
<dneighbo> thusly crashing X entirely
<Arturas> :)
<Arturas> have desktops
<Arturas> but windows don't extend
<Arturas> they stay in the same desktop 
<dneighbo> kde sux
<Arturas> :)
<Arturas> till NOW i WAS happy :)
<dneighbo> Arturas its problaby out in a .kde file somewhere
<Arturas> ra3vat: if i'm remembering good, defaultenc. is ascii 
davi (davi@80-25-136-215.uc.nombres.ttd.es) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ra3vat> Arturas: yes, and one need to change it to use forms with i18n strings 
<ra3vat> otherwise you 'll get 
<ra3vat> DB000: UnicodeError: ASCII encoding error: ordinal not in range(128)         
<Arturas> no, if i enforce strings as unicode
<Arturas> look:
<Arturas> sstring=('i18n data','utf8')
<Arturas> sstring2=str(sstring.encode('utf8'))
<Arturas> print sstring2
<Arturas> and you'll get nice i18n data
<Arturas> (you can try ;)
<Arturas> dneighbo: no changes in forms, although kde looked really awfully
<ra3vat> yes, but i'm saying about current forms codebase 
<Arturas> so the has to be font defined as iso88-something
<Arturas> and where is it??????
<Arturas> maybe i simple missed the line :(
Action: Arturas sometimes can be really big idiot :)
<Arturas> ra3vat: by the way
<Arturas> the same sstring2 in form won't be displayed with i18n data
<ra3vat> and even without .encode(..) strings there are enforced to behave as unicode strings and if correct encoding is not provided we'll get that exception
<Arturas> it will contain something like 'A[]"
<dneighbo> im an i18n idiot
<dneighbo> so im not much help
<dneighbo> Arturas i was under impression forms was not inflicting its own font
<dneighbo> i grepped the source and am not finding anything
<Arturas> dneighbo: you are the one who knows what is going on here 
<Arturas> that's the problem
<Arturas> ra3vat: ok, let's say we have python defaultencoding unicode
<Arturas> but i believe that i18n data in forms won't be displayed anyway
<jamest> um
<ra3vat> it displayed
<Arturas> Hello jamest :)
<jamest> the font encoding is in UIwxpython
<dneighbo> forms/src/uidrivers/wx/UIdriver.py:      self.splash.SetFont(wxFont(20,wxSWISS,wxNORMAL,wxBOLD))
<dneighbo> forms/src/uidrivers/wx/UIdriver.py:      self.splash.SetFont(wxFont(10,wxSWISS,wxNORMAL,wxBOLD))

<Arturas> jamest: where is it?
<jamest> derek:that sectoin only sets the splashscreen fonts

<dneighbo> Arturas my gut (but i could be way off)
<dneighbo> is in gnue.conf
<dneighbo> allow people to set the font
<dneighbo> like we do other font options
<dneighbo> and put what is in forms now as the 'default' there
<dneighbo> then just use GConfig
<dneighbo> to read that 
<dneighbo> should be example in init of GConfig
<dneighbo> for fixedfont variable and such
<dneighbo> line 85 - 9X on forms/src/uidrivers/wx/UIdriver.py
<dneighbo> def initFont(widget, affectsLayout=1):
<dneighbo>   if int(GConfig.get('fixedWidthFont')):
<dneighbo>     widget.SetFont(wxFont(int(GConfig.get('pointSize')),wxMODERN,wxNORMAL,wxNORMAL))
<dneighbo> you will need to read up on wxFont i think

<Arturas> dneighbo: checking that now [downloading wxFont docs]
<dneighbo> GConfig.get('font')

<dneighbo> in the gnue.conf file
<Arturas> dneighbo: no, i hope adding something like 'encoding="utf8"' should be enough

<Harald1> is anybody here using gfclient + mysql?
<nickr> this channel was highlighted but I can't find my name in backscroll
<jamest> Harald1: I'm not, jcater is not, but someone was at one time
Action: dneighbo was
<dneighbo> i test on mysql occasionally
<Harald1> dneighbo: should it work?
<dneighbo> i dont 'use' 'use' it but i make sure it works
<dneighbo> it was working at the 0.1.1 release or 0.1.2 (whatever last release was)
<dneighbo> what is your client platform and server platform
<dneighbo> my tests were with
<Harald1> I've got a problem under win 2000. when I want to login gfclient crashes
<Harald1> both win 2000
<dneighbo> debian (client) redhat (server) and
<dneighbo> win98 (client) redhat(server
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> using odbc driver or native mysql?
<Harald1> gfclient crashes with "TypeError: unsupported operand types for +: 'int' and 'NoneType'" 
<dneighbo> my win98 tests with mysql were using the odbc driver
<dneighbo> Harald1 ok you have a python problem :)
<Harald1> i use mysqldb and it seems that the error is in mysqldb
<dneighbo> you need python 2.x
<Harald1> I have 2.2
<dneighbo> ouch
<dneighbo> 2.2 you dont want
<dneighbo> drop to 2.1
<dneighbo> 2.2 is buggy
<Harald1> if i change the None in the source code of mysqldb to 0 it works...
<dneighbo> you can use it but you wont be able to save forms in designer because of a streamIO bug in unicode support w/ 2.2 (still unfixed even in last candidate release)
<dneighbo> ah
<dneighbo> well i would create a diff
<dneighbo> and send it to mysqld folks as a patch :)
<Harald1> dneighbo: well I am able to save forms in designer
<dneighbo> if you save them
<dneighbo> reopen them
<dneighbo> and save them
<dneighbo> can you reopen them?
<dneighbo> i was encountering this issue on linux w/ python and traced it back to a python2.2 bug
<Harald1> I'll contact the developers later/tomorrow
<dneighbo> jcater tried to put in a hack to work around it
<Harald1> i'll try...
<dneighbo> it seemed to not fix it for me
<dneighbo> BUT i was running python from pretty much cvs from right before 2.2 release :)
<dneighbo> so a newer official 2.2 might be ok as i noticed commits for unicode (just not stringIO) but as stated i think jcater put in a hack to maneuver around stringIO
<Harald1> streamIO bug is still present. python crashes
<dneighbo> well one thing you can do (painful)
<dneighbo> is open the form in a text editor
<dneighbo> and substitue ^@ for null
<dneighbo> and then the form will be ok
<dneighbo> but next time you save it it will save with the ^@'s
<Harald1> where are the ^@? at the end of lines?
<dneighbo> oh no
<dneighbo> after EVERY character
<dneighbo> so you get ^@o^@u^@t^@p^@u^@t^@ like that :)
<dneighbo> if you have someone one staff you want to 'joke' with
<dneighbo> this is one of thsoe good 'joke' bugs :)
<Harald1> should it be visible in an editor?
<dneighbo> um dependons on how cool an editor you use :)
<dneighbo> in emacs its visible
<dneighbo> but ^@ means its an escape char that most 'windows' editors wont show you like
<dneighbo> ^M
<Harald1> What should happen if I do save->exit->start->load?
<dneighbo> would crash designer
<dneighbo> iirc
<dneighbo> what happens is when you create a form no issue
<dneighbo> save a form no issue
<dneighbo> but when you OPEN a form it uses stringIO to read in the xml file
<dneighbo> and that is what converts it to unicode
<dneighbo> so then when you save it, it has that ^@ stuff in it
<Harald1> for me save->exit->start->load does not crash
<dneighbo> tainting it for next open or for reading by forms
<dneighbo> cool well then you might not have the bug
<Harald1> and no ^@ in gfd
<dneighbo> cool
<dneighbo> it might be a unix only problem too
<Harald1> but if i do save->load it crashes
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> is there way you can install python2.1 on that machine as well?
<dneighbo> or better yet just grab the 0.1.1 release
<dneighbo> it has all dependencies compiled in so to speak
<Harald1> I'll try it later/tomorrow
<dneighbo> adn try exactly same thing and tellme if it bomb
<Harald1> is 2.1 / 2.2 installation at the same time possible
<dneighbo> you can run them concurrently
<dneighbo> but for testing you can just get the release
<dneighbo> and windows puts everything in dlls
<dneighbo> that are much easier to download and install and remove
<jamest> Harald1: your running a python installed forms/designer
<jamest> ?
<jamest> that's cool, most people use the bins
<dneighbo> he is cooler than most :)
<dneighbo> as he actually submits bug reports :)
<jamest> lol
<jamest> i'm sure there'll be lots of them
<jamest> as I'm fighting w/ forms a bit at work on windows
<jamest> if i'd only get these !@#!@# web site accessibilty updates completed
<Harald1> jamest: yes, because I want to know what happens. and besides this the cvs has no bins...

<dneighbo> what ticks me off
<dneighbo> is that here:
<dneighbo> http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~zeitlin/wxWindows/docs/wxwin155.htm#wxfont
<dneighbo> it shows wxFONTENCODING_UTF8 as a valid wxFontEncode type
<dneighbo> wonder i my wx version is too old or something
<dneighbo> crap
<dneighbo> they are saying UTF8 is a 'microsoft' only encoding
<dneighbo> one option is we could put 
<ra3vat> hmm
<dneighbo> EncodingType=
<dneighbo> in gnue.conf
<dneighbo> and then you can set it
<dneighbo> i wish i could 'test' the SYSTEM one
<dneighbo> ra3vat can you change to last code i pasted in UIdriver.py
<dneighbo> for wx
<dneighbo> and tell me if arturas sample works?
<ra3vat> to _UTF8?
<dneighbo> um this
<dneighbo>  widget.SetFont(wxFont(int(GConfig.get('pointSize')),wxMODERN,wxN
<dneighbo>                ORMAL,wxNORMAL,encoding=wxFONTENCODING_SYSTEM))
<dneighbo> the _UTF8 wont work on linux
<dneighbo> you might try it on windows
<dneighbo> if that doesnt work you could try
<dneighbo>                ORMAL,wxNORMAL,encoding=wxFONTENCODING_KOI8))
<dneighbo> for cryillic stuff
<dneighbo> i can get things to run with these different option (cept UTF8)
<dneighbo> but i dont have other charsets to 'test' them with :)

<reinhard> oops
<dneighbo> clarify
<dneighbo> install new STOCK kernel (in apt)
<dneighbo> or compile a new kernel
<dneighbo> since debian has so many kernel choices i suggest staying away from a compiled kernel unless there is just something you are in dire need of that isnt in a stock kernel
<dneighbo> if its stock kernel its about a 10 minute process
<dneighbo> though i would wait for nickr to be around

<dneighbo> wow
<dneighbo> The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of the evil. We see before us a huge community of producers the members of which are unceasingly striving to deprive each other of the fruits of their collective labor?not by force, but on the whole in faithful compliance with legally established rules. In this respect, it is important to realize that the means of production?that is to say, the entire p
<dneighbo> oducing consumer goods as well as additional capital goods?may legally be, and for the most part are, the private property of individuals.
<nickr> er
<nickr> isn't that what capitalism is?
<nickr> the state allowing some people to rip off other people?
<nickr> comparing it to anarchy is false.
<dneighbo> what is amazing is that is written by Albert Einstein
<nickr> capitalism as we know it depends on laws
<nickr> hah
<nickr> cool
<nickr> I didn't know that Einstein was a filty commie
<nickr> I knew all those scientitsts were a bit fruity
<dneighbo> http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einst.htm
<dneighbo> yes he was it appears
<dneighbo> basically states capitalism erodes our sense of value to a society
<drochaid> I thought he was a Marxist?
<dneighbo> and makes us hostile towards one another
<reinhard> x5
<nickr> scientists are all the same... they SAY they are trying to help us, but what they're really doing is trying to RULE THE WORLD
<reinhard> argh
<dneighbo> well yes marxist veiw more
<nickr> theres a really good part of illuminatus that talks about capitalism

<drochaid> communism took marxism and remove the better points about it
<dneighbo> wow that essay is just incredible
<drochaid> the ideology behind marxism is fairly sound
<dneighbo> Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political s
<dneighbo> he described m$ and the trial in 1949
<nickr> Huh, thats pretty interesting
<dneighbo> This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevi
<dneighbo> the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.
<dneighbo> wowzers
<nickr> when was this written?
<nickr> hehe
<dneighbo> this BLOWS me away that this was authored in 1949
<nickr> its as true today as ever
<nickr> actually its more true today
<drochaid> tbh, it's been the same for hundreds of years .. he was simply recording what was the case then
<dneighbo> I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion.
<dneighbo> is his solution
<drochaid> the only thing that's changed is the extent a single person or company can control a market on a global basis
<dtm> dneighbo: good point; let's make an educational system which has goals!
<dtm> :)
<drochaid> wouldn't that be a contradiction in terms?
<drochaid> it would be in the UK
<nickr> the problem of a socialist state is that it moves privilage back into the hands of the state
<nickr> the key to true freedom is removwing privilage entirely
<drochaid> uhm
<drochaid> bollocks
<nickr> privilage is private law
<nickr> an economic system needs to have everyone on the level playing field
<drochaid> I don't believe that's possible
<nickr> Well, its possible to the extent that you remove thet state granting privilage
<drochaid> how?
<nickr> I don't know man, I didn't do it.
<drochaid> lol
<dneighbo> actually nickr he address your concern
<dneighbo> Nevertheless, it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is not yet socialism. A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual. The achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems: how is it possible, in view of the far-reaching centralization of political and economic power,
<dneighbo> to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and overweening? How can the rights of the individual be protected and therewith a democratic counterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured?
<dneighbo> Clarity about the aims and problems of socialism is of greatest significance in our age of transition. Since, under present circumstances, free and unhindered discussion of these problems has come under a powerful taboo, I consider the foundation of this magazine to be an important public service.
<drochaid> nah, still bollocks ;)

<chillywilly> one stone and it goes crashing down
<drochaid> glass can be a very strong material
<drochaid> can withstand many times it's weight
<chillywilly> in my experience the best way to crash windows is to install a network card
<drochaid> can be made resistant to fast moving projectiles
<chillywilly> ths makes it near impossible to use
<drochaid> and provides warmth and protection to it's users
<drochaid> then the ventilation shuts off and they all die :)

<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> a shitty bill that got renamed
<drochaid> ah
<chillywilly> says that all electronic devices must have copy-protection mechanisms
<drochaid> oh
<chillywilly> mandated by the federal gov't
<drochaid> that along the lines of the DMCA?
<chillywilly> (US federal gov't)
<chillywilly> it's worse than the DMCA
<drochaid> that's the thing you see,
<drochaid> DMCA has no effect on anyone outside the US
<drochaid> as it's been found illegal by international law
<chillywilly> well, don't think it's going to stay in the US and you can ignore it because I guarantee you America's disease will spread
<drochaid> indeed
<chillywilly> besides, nationalism is BS

<Harald1> should I post the complete results to dcl, as there were some more problems with the exe-releases
<Harald1> ?
<dneighbo> when you say same result
<dneighbo> which result :)
Action: dneighbo doesnt recall exactly what the problem was 
<dneighbo> the crashing after like save/reload
<Harald1> yes and that it only happens when gfdesigner is not exited
<dneighbo> where are you seeing designer 0.2.2a?
<Harald1> in the about dialog
<dneighbo> hmmm
<psu> cool
<dneighbo> guess im ill informed much anymore
<Harald1> 0.2.0a I mean
<dneighbo> ok that sounds slightly better :)\
<dneighbo> let me test here can you give me exact steps
<dneighbo> of what you are doing to make it crash
<Harald1> yes: open gfdesigner, load a file, save it, close the file (but not gfdesigner), load the file -> crash
<Harald1> but: open gfdesigner, load a file, save it, exit gfdesigner, open gfdesigner, load file -> no crash
<dneighbo> ok trying now
<dneighbo> hmmm i have different bug
<dneighbo> i open gfdesigner
<dneighbo> load a file
<dneighbo> save it
<dneighbo> close the file (But designer exits) insetad of closing
<dneighbo> never mind my stupidity
<Harald1> ?
<dneighbo> i forget that we dont do designer quite right :)
<dneighbo> i was doing designer file.gfd
<dneighbo> which is NOT the same as 
<dneighbo> designer
<dneighbo> then open the file
<dneighbo> so in my case close/exit behaved the same
<dneighbo> please file the bug
<dneighbo> it exists in windows as well
<dneighbo> er linux
<Harald1> to dcl?
<dneighbo> i.e. my current cvs does the exact same thing
<dneighbo> yeah to dcl
<Harald1> can you assist me? I'm not sure what priority, account, type I should add
<dneighbo> it appears as though even a debug level 50 gives no useful information on the crash so no need to submit anything
<dneighbo> what are options for priority
<dneighbo> it should be something like 'next patch release' or something
<Harald1> high, medium, low
<Harald1> no that's type
<dneighbo> let me look real quick
<dneighbo> you are contact
<dneighbo> account 'end user'
<Harald1> yes
<dneighbo> product gnue designer
<dneighbo> priority medium
<dneighbo> type next minor release
<dneighbo> btw: if every you arent sure guess what you feel is best and will change it if we dis agree :)
<Harald1> ok. I've got another thing:
<dneighbo> cool
Action: dneighbo loves that we have another bug hunter, i was feeling so lonely
<Harald1> there's a problem with the gfdesigner exe release. the normal release doesn't start, and the debug release has not /etc dir
<Harald1> not = no
<Harald1> so it wouldn't start either, it only displays for a second, that no gnue.conf is available
<Harald1> dneighbo: It seems that the saving bug is even worse. It crashes on other files, too, after one file was saved and closed
<Harald1> but it does not crash, when the first file is not closed

<superphreak> thats cause the UK gamers were inferior :)
<chillywilly> ah, nationalism
<psu> Low Ping Bastards
<psu> no UK broadband in those days
<chillywilly> how I love it so

<chillywilly> hey you're the one who couldn't get money out of the tyme machine the other day ;)
<chillywilly> true dat
<dneighbo> um Harald1 the .exe's assume you create gnue.conf and such
<dneighbo> i.e. on your system in like program files/gnue/etc
<superphreak> thats what I am saying...we work for Simplex, therefore we don't have much money
<chillywilly> superphreak: you mean tyco ;)
<dneighbo> or something
<chillywilly> simplex had the shit to gether for the most part
<superphreak> chillywilly: yeah, sorry TYCO
<dneighbo> there should be a samples.gnue.conf and samples.connections.conf
<dneighbo> just copy those and name the copy gnue.conf connections.conf
<dneighbo> then try designer again
<chillywilly> I bjust realized something
<chillywilly> I have no artistic talent

<chillywilly> it sucked
<superphreak> as a matter of fact, I ahve no talents what-so-ever
<superphreak> :(
<Harald1> dneighbo: no that's the problem with the exe release, there's no /etc and sample confs, I copied my normal ones and then the debug release worked
<dneighbo> hmmm the .exe release on win95 had them
<Harald1> 0.1.1?
<dneighbo> um yes i think so
<dneighbo> did you get official releases
<dneighbo> or nightlies of some sort
<ra3vat> dneighbo: can you give me account in dclgw?
<dneighbo> i dont have a windows box here so i cant confirm
<Harald1> dneighbo: I assume. They are from http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/designer/
<dneighbo> ra3vat: just need name (i dont remember how to spell it) dmitry sorvokin? and email ds@telcom.ics.ru ?
<dneighbo> yeah thats right place
<dneighbo> but its common that would do the etc file et al
<dneighbo> i.e. you didnt just get designer right
<dneighbo> you got common/forms/designer when you got 0.1.1
<ra3vat> dneighbo: (login name - dimas) dmitry sorokin ds@ics.elcom.ru
<Harald1> no, I just wanted to test the exe release, so just designer
<dneighbo> er actually i think designer should install common
<dneighbo> install forms and designer
<Harald1> and debug works when I copy my /etc 
<superphreak> chillywilly: did you die???

<dtm> yeah
<dtm> i really like RMS's essay involving that
<dtm> really enlightening
<dtm> it even helped my perspective on it
<chillywilly> if I make you a copy of a movie that is copyrighted then I am  as bad as someon attacking, raping, and pillaging a ship right?
<dtm> not that it clears my conscience
<chillywilly> hehe
<dtm> coz i still commit theft
<dtm> i wouldn't ever deny that.
<dtm> but it's that their definition of theft is _wrong_.
<dtm> so it's theft in the name of civil disobedience, mostly
<dtm> and yeah sometimes i do steal stuff that i coulda bought or rented
<dtm> like downloading an mpeg rather than making a $0.99 rental. 
<dtm> that would have been fair.
<chillywilly> snoogans
<dtm> so it kinda blurs off into the distance
<chillywilly> how about they let me download it for free
<chillywilly> then I can send the author money directly
<dtm> i'd pay to download it
<chillywilly> and not the copyright police bastards
<dtm> well in the case of hollywood movies, there are tons of big money involved
<chillywilly> the "content" providers
<dtm> so having a gray distribution mechanismis understandable
<dtm>  the people who provide lighting, cameras, food, etc
<dtm> moviemaking is an incredibly huge job none of us can estimate
<dtm> well , often it is.
<dtm> some movies are as simple as typical software engineering
<chillywilly> wel copyright isn't supposed to last forever it is basically a restriction on free speech
<chillywilly> there
<chillywilly> 's no compromise anymore
<chillywilly> look at mutha freakin' disney
<dtm> yeah
<dtm> hey i found out recently that the word 'patent' is rooted in the phrase "to make public"
<dtm> isn't that fascinating
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> well you do have to disclose the information
<dtm> i never knew that before just recently.
<dtm> yeha
<chillywilly> you see that they renamed the SSSCA?
<chillywilly> and now are trying to pass that POS
<dtm> no and i dont know what the SSSCA is
<dtm> well at least i know i'm not _personnally_ responsible directly for the destruction of civilization ;)
<dtm> i dont come up with this shit.
<dtm> ;>
<chillywilly> federal law mandating that all electronic devices must have copy protection mechanisms in them
<dtm> all that's needed is for "good men" to do nothing :)

<dtm> HDTV already was infested with things like that
<chillywilly> sucko
<dtm> copy and content controls

<chillywilly> dude this is like communist russia putting armed guards at copy mahcines
<dtm> i know HDTV is supposed to be a materially desirable consumer item but i'd just as soon smash it with Sledge O Matic(tm) as watch it if it had that stuff in it.
<dtm> yeah it is.
<chillywilly> but they do it with technology
<dtm> yep
<chillywilly> it's fascist
<dtm> and chilly, believe me, this stuff is _so_ important that i respect anyone who thinks this way about it
<dtm> i mean who prioritizes it this much
<dtm> and recognizes and analyzes it
<dtm> just think if everyone did that a _little_ bit.
<dtm> instead of having a few of us trying in futility to carry the rest
<dtm> but we still have to try.
<chillywilly> I think people are too busy being brainwashed by the PR and consumerism that is all too prevalent in america
<dtm> maybe something will happen such that we'lll not just slide slower down the slippery slope, but instead have some STRATEGIC advance.
<dtm> yeah
<chillywilly> so then the politicians and corporations get to pass the laws they want
<chillywilly> and no one says boo
<dtm> their self relationship is so screwed, they dont even know what choice _is_ let alone its value.
<chillywilly> because they are so apathetic
<dtm> yeah especially when it's marketed as a desirable consumable
<chillywilly> dude I am readying my protect sign once again
<chillywilly> er, protest
<dtm> what sign?
<chillywilly> the one I will make
<chillywilly> ;)
<dtm> heh
<chillywilly> right after I write my congressman
<dtm> gonna storm capitol hill?
<chillywilly> heck yea
<dtm> well shit dude
<dtm> think about it
<dtm> i heard that something like only TEN THOUSAND Americans wrote to the govt about the microsoft case.
<chillywilly> that's pathetic
<chillywilly> I don;t know who to be more pissed at
<dtm> if that's the case then not only do they surely have a filtering process for it reaching the desks of decisionmakers, but we could write a _GOOD_ one that'd get there.
<dtm> yeah i know
<chillywilly> the common americans aor the jag offs trying to screw them
<dtm> exctly
<dtm> well
<dtm> it wouldn't be possible unless it was a two part process
<dtm> it'd be different if the average American couldn't figure it out
<dtm> couldn't learn about it
<dtm> we may as well find already well written essays, put a quick cover letter on it, and forward it on.
<chillywilly> Free Software is an extreme and I recognize that, but I think it is only necessary if we are to win anything back for the people before it is too late
<dtm> see
<dtm> my personal problem is that i dont know my audience well
<dtm> so i have a writing style issue
<dtm> i dont know how specific or general to b
<dtm> e
<dtm> some of these people have never seen the inter-web
<dtm> i dont know if i should try cluing them in, or just casting a vote
<chillywilly> someone said that these guys doign this are clueless and they will leave a big mess for us to clean up
<chillywilly> (wrt to technology etc.)
<chillywilly> it's the old men who don't even know what the net is
<chillywilly> but guess whcih coporations(s) are behind that bill and basically bought it?
<chillywilly> disney, et. al.
<chillywilly> I'm never going to look at mickey mouse the same
<nickr>  the mouse is a huge, evil corporation, in the worst sense of the word
<chillywilly> nickr: do you think in the movie dogma that the whole mooby refernce is a poke at disney?
<nickr> probably
<nickr> iirc
<chillywilly> it'a a bit too similar
<chillywilly> er, it's
<chillywilly> crazymike is convinced that is the case

<dtm> well i do like Disneyland though
<dtm> and i like a lot of Disney movies
<dtm> not all of em
<dtm> Disneyland is a model corporation in terms of operations and personnel.
<chillywilly> I'm on an all out disney boycott
<chillywilly> brb
<dtm> so there's a lot to learn from and emulate
<chillywilly> caorline is here
<chillywilly> er, caroline
<dtm> but that doesn't mean we have to patronize their stuff seriously
Action: chillywilly is away: I'm busy
<dtm> chillywilly: tlel her i said HIGH.
<dtm> some disney movies are quite inspiring and educational, even the recent ones
<dtm> i really liked Beauty and the Beast part 2
<dtm> and Hercules
<dtm> i especially liked watching them on a $1000 portable dvd player in a jet plane
<dtm> when i traveled often, i rented the dvd player for like $20-30 round trip plus 3 or 4 movies
<dtm> and two batteries
<dtm> that was grate
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 00:04:28)
<chillywilly> we're going to get pizza
<chillywilly> don't tell da masta
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: chillywilly is away: dinner

<derek> i want pizza
<Harald1> derek: well I've got no pizza, but a question:
<Harald1> which trigger events are implemented, just those from http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/techref/x81.html or all?
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 01:13:01)
<derek> um where do you see 'all' :)
<derek> i would say the ones in the techref 'should' be implemented
<derek> but these are things that unless one of the developers are using them, probably are not getting properly regression tested
<Harald1> all are those in the VALIDTRIGGERS list
<derek> so the safe answer is in the source code you can get a list of what is there in code
<derek> then only by testing can you determine if they work
<Harald1> err no list
<derek> (bad answer i know)
<derek> but i would 'assume' that if its in the techref
<derek> its in the source and it SHOULD work
<derek> i.e. if you use one that is the tech ref and it doesnt work please file a bug against it
<Harald1> actually I am not using them at moment, but look at how they work/ are implemented
<derek> Harald1: i forget you wanting to 'develop' gnue tools
<derek> or use them
<nickr> dtm: I had rice and ramyun, not just rike by itself
Action: derek has bad memory so i apologize if i already asked
<derek> i like to know how people fit into the picture
<Harald1> derek: at the moment I'm far from "developing". I am trying to get an overview, and understand how certain things are done
<derek> i guess the real question was
<Harald1> and I looked at the technical reference and saw the sentence "We would like to increase the number of supported languages as time permits" in the trigger part, and now I try to understand how triggers work
<derek> 'do you plan on using gnue as an end user' or 'as a developer'
<Harald1> derek: mostly as a developer
<Harald1> because I still go to university. but I think will soon (in a few years) be a big option. So knowing it is not only interesting, but also useful :)
