<chillywilly> scotty is also a super ohreak
<chillywilly> er, phreak

<chillywilly> I could go for one of those
<superphreak> i'll brb...got to go take my test
<chillywilly> good luck phreak
<dneighbo> Harald1: im here
<Harald1> dneighbo: I completed the tests: same result for Python 2.2 and gfdesigner 0.2.2a, gfdesigner 0.1.1 (exe) and Python 2.1.2 and gfdesigner 0.2.2a
alexey (~alexey@195.151.214.34) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Harald1> should I post the complete results to dcl, as there were some more problems with the exe-releases
<Harald1> ?
<dneighbo> when you say same result
<dneighbo> which result :)
Action: dneighbo doesnt recall exactly what the problem was 
<dneighbo> the crashing after like save/reload
<Harald1> yes and that it only happens when gfdesigner is not exited
<dneighbo> where are you seeing designer 0.2.2a?
<Harald1> in the about dialog
<dneighbo> hmmm
<psu> cool
<dneighbo> guess im ill informed much anymore
<Harald1> 0.2.0a I mean
<dneighbo> ok that sounds slightly better :)\
<dneighbo> let me test here can you give me exact steps
<dneighbo> of what you are doing to make it crash
<Harald1> yes: open gfdesigner, load a file, save it, close the file (but not gfdesigner), load the file -> crash
<Harald1> but: open gfdesigner, load a file, save it, exit gfdesigner, open gfdesigner, load file -> no crash
<dneighbo> ok trying now
<dneighbo> hmmm i have different bug
<dneighbo> i open gfdesigner
<dneighbo> load a file
<dneighbo> save it
<dneighbo> close the file (But designer exits) insetad of closing
<dneighbo> never mind my stupidity
<Harald1> ?
<dneighbo> i forget that we dont do designer quite right :)
<dneighbo> i was doing designer file.gfd
<dneighbo> which is NOT the same as 
<dneighbo> designer
<dneighbo> then open the file
<dneighbo> so in my case close/exit behaved the same
<dneighbo> please file the bug
<dneighbo> it exists in windows as well
<dneighbo> er linux
<Harald1> to dcl?
<dneighbo> i.e. my current cvs does the exact same thing
<dneighbo> yeah to dcl
<Harald1> can you assist me? I'm not sure what priority, account, type I should add
<dneighbo> it appears as though even a debug level 50 gives no useful information on the crash so no need to submit anything
<dneighbo> what are options for priority
<dneighbo> it should be something like 'next patch release' or something
<Harald1> high, medium, low
<Harald1> no that's type
<dneighbo> let me look real quick
<dneighbo> you are contact
<dneighbo> account 'end user'
<Harald1> yes
<dneighbo> product gnue designer
<dneighbo> priority medium
<dneighbo> type next minor release
<dneighbo> btw: if every you arent sure guess what you feel is best and will change it if we dis agree :)
<Harald1> ok. I've got another thing:
<dneighbo> cool
Action: dneighbo loves that we have another bug hunter, i was feeling so lonely
<Harald1> there's a problem with the gfdesigner exe release. the normal release doesn't start, and the debug release has not /etc dir
<Harald1> not = no
<Harald1> so it wouldn't start either, it only displays for a second, that no gnue.conf is available
<Harald1> dneighbo: It seems that the saving bug is even worse. It crashes on other files, too, after one file was saved and closed
<Harald1> but it does not crash, when the first file is not closed

<dneighbo> i.e. on your system in like program files/gnue/etc
<superphreak> thats what I am saying...we work for Simplex, therefore we don't have much money
<chillywilly> superphreak: you mean tyco ;)
<dneighbo> or something
<chillywilly> simplex had the shit to gether for the most part

<dneighbo> did you get official releases
<dneighbo> or nightlies of some sort
<ra3vat> dneighbo: can you give me account in dclgw?

<dneighbo> you got common/forms/designer when you got 0.1.1
<ra3vat> dneighbo: (login name - dimas) dmitry sorokin ds@ics.elcom.ru
<Harald1> no, I just wanted to test the exe release, so just designer
<dneighbo> er actually i think designer should install common
<dneighbo> install forms and designer

<dtm> yeah
<dtm> i really like RMS's essay involving that
<dtm> really enlightening
<dtm> it even helped my perspective on it
<chillywilly> if I make you a copy of a movie that is copyrighted then I am  as bad as someon attacking, raping, and pillaging a ship right?
<dtm> not that it clears my conscience
<chillywilly> hehe
<dtm> coz i still commit theft
<dtm> i wouldn't ever deny that.
<dtm> but it's that their definition of theft is _wrong_.
<dtm> so it's theft in the name of civil disobedience, mostly
<dtm> and yeah sometimes i do steal stuff that i coulda bought or rented
<dtm> like downloading an mpeg rather than making a $0.99 rental. 
<dtm> that would have been fair.
<chillywilly> snoogans
<dtm> so it kinda blurs off into the distance
<chillywilly> how about they let me download it for free
<chillywilly> then I can send the author money directly
<dtm> i'd pay to download it
<chillywilly> and not the copyright police bastards
<dtm> well in the case of hollywood movies, there are tons of big money involved
<chillywilly> the "content" providers
<dtm> so having a gray distribution mechanismis understandable
<dtm>  the people who provide lighting, cameras, food, etc
<dtm> moviemaking is an incredibly huge job none of us can estimate
<dtm> well , often it is.
<dtm> some movies are as simple as typical software engineering
<chillywilly> wel copyright isn't supposed to last forever it is basically a restriction on free speech
<chillywilly> there
<chillywilly> 's no compromise anymore
<chillywilly> look at mutha freakin' disney
<dtm> yeah
<dtm> hey i found out recently that the word 'patent' is rooted in the phrase "to make public"
<dtm> isn't that fascinating
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> well you do have to disclose the information
<dtm> i never knew that before just recently.
<dtm> yeha
<chillywilly> you see that they renamed the SSSCA?
<chillywilly> and now are trying to pass that POS
<dtm> no and i dont know what the SSSCA is
<dtm> well at least i know i'm not _personnally_ responsible directly for the destruction of civilization ;)
<dtm> i dont come up with this shit.
<dtm> ;>
<chillywilly> federal law mandating that all electronic devices must have copy protection mechanisms in them
<dtm> all that's needed is for "good men" to do nothing :)
<dtm> i wrote to the library of congress about the mpaa and riaa

<dtm> HDTV already was infested with things like that
<chillywilly> sucko
<dtm> copy and content controls
<dtm> censorship
<chillywilly> dude this is like communist russia putting armed guards at copy mahcines
<dtm> i know HDTV is supposed to be a materially desirable consumer item but i'd just as soon smash it with Sledge O Matic(tm) as watch it if it had that stuff in it.
<dtm> yeah it is.
<chillywilly> but they do it with technology
<dtm> yep
<chillywilly> it's fascist
<dtm> and chilly, believe me, this stuff is _so_ important that i respect anyone who thinks this way about it
<dtm> i mean who prioritizes it this much
<dtm> and recognizes and analyzes it
<dtm> just think if everyone did that a _little_ bit.
<dtm> instead of having a few of us trying in futility to carry the rest
<dtm> but we still have to try.
<chillywilly> I think people are too busy being brainwashed by the PR and consumerism that is all too prevalent in america
<dtm> maybe something will happen such that we'lll not just slide slower down the slippery slope, but instead have some STRATEGIC advance.
<dtm> yeah
<chillywilly> so then the politicians and corporations get to pass the laws they want
<chillywilly> and no one says boo
<dtm> their self relationship is so screwed, they dont even know what choice _is_ let alone its value.
<chillywilly> because they are so apathetic
<dtm> yeah especially when it's marketed as a desirable consumable
<chillywilly> dude I am readying my protect sign once again
<chillywilly> er, protest
<dtm> what sign?
<chillywilly> the one I will make
<chillywilly> ;)
<dtm> heh
<chillywilly> right after I write my congressman
<dtm> gonna storm capitol hill?
<chillywilly> heck yea
<dtm> well shit dude
<dtm> think about it
<dtm> i heard that something like only TEN THOUSAND Americans wrote to the govt about the microsoft case.
<chillywilly> that's pathetic
<chillywilly> I don;t know who to be more pissed at
<dtm> if that's the case then not only do they surely have a filtering process for it reaching the desks of decisionmakers, but we could write a _GOOD_ one that'd get there.
<dtm> yeah i know
<chillywilly> the common americans aor the jag offs trying to screw them
<dtm> exctly
<dtm> well
<dtm> it wouldn't be possible unless it was a two part process
<dtm> it'd be different if the average American couldn't figure it out
<dtm> couldn't learn about it
<dtm> we may as well find already well written essays, put a quick cover letter on it, and forward it on.
<chillywilly> Free Software is an extreme and I recognize that, but I think it is only necessary if we are to win anything back for the people before it is too late
<dtm> see
<dtm> my personal problem is that i dont know my audience well
<dtm> so i have a writing style issue
<dtm> i dont know how specific or general to b
<dtm> e
<dtm> some of these people have never seen the inter-web
<dtm> i dont know if i should try cluing them in, or just casting a vote
<chillywilly> someone said that these guys doign this are clueless and they will leave a big mess for us to clean up
<chillywilly> (wrt to technology etc.)
<chillywilly> it's the old men who don't even know what the net is
<chillywilly> but guess whcih coporations(s) are behind that bill and basically bought it?
<chillywilly> disney, et. al.
<chillywilly> I'm never going to look at mickey mouse the same
<nickr>  the mouse is a huge, evil corporation, in the worst sense of the word
<chillywilly> nickr: do you think in the movie dogma that the whole mooby refernce is a poke at disney?
<nickr> probably
<nickr> iirc
<chillywilly> it'a a bit too similar
<chillywilly> er, it's
<chillywilly> crazymike is convinced that is the case
<chillywilly> galeon 1.2 crashes too much
<jbailey> chillywilly: I like Robin Williams comments about Mickey mouse:
<jbailey> "Remember that to your 3 year old, it's not a cute little mouse, it's a 6 foot fucking rat!"
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> robin williams rules
<chillywilly> I saw his stand-up show the other day
<chillywilly> when he came down here
<chillywilly> er, up
<chillywilly> whatever

<chillywilly> you know even if I have a bootlegged mpeg
<dtm> @#(*)
<chillywilly> if I like the movie that much
<chillywilly> I would probabyl buy the VHS tape
btami (btami@dialin75-isdn1.emitel.hu) left irc: 
<chillywilly> or DVD
<dtm> @(*#)
<dtm> well i do like Disneyland though
<dtm> and i like a lot of Disney movies
<dtm> not all of em
<dtm> Disneyland is a model corporation in terms of operations and personnel.
<chillywilly> I'm on an all out disney boycott
<chillywilly> brb
<dtm> so there's a lot to learn from and emulate
<chillywilly> caorline is here
<chillywilly> er, caroline
<dtm> but that doesn't mean we have to patronize their stuff seriously
Action: chillywilly is away: I'm busy
<dtm> chillywilly: tlel her i said HIGH.
<dtm> some disney movies are quite inspiring and educational, even the recent ones
<dtm> i really liked Beauty and the Beast part 2
<dtm> and Hercules
<dtm> i especially liked watching them on a $1000 portable dvd player in a jet plane
<dtm> when i traveled often, i rented the dvd player for like $20-30 round trip plus 3 or 4 movies
<dtm> and two batteries
<dtm> that was grate
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 00:04:28)
<chillywilly> we're going to get pizza
<chillywilly> don't tell da masta
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: chillywilly is away: dinner
<dtm> PIZZAS#(
<dtm> I WNAT L[IZZAS.
<dtm> i'm going to make pizza tonight.
<dtm> chilly sealed it
<dtm> @#(*)
<nickr> I was gonna order pizza
<nickr> but at the momentI realized that I had the money to, I was already cooking rice
<dtm> rice is healthier
<dtm> i ate rice last night
<dtm> you eat rice tonight and i'll eat pizza, ok?

<derek> i want pizza
<Harald1> derek: well I've got no pizza, but a question:
<Harald1> which trigger events are implemented, just those from http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/techref/x81.html or all?
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 01:13:01)
<derek> um where do you see 'all' :)
<derek> i would say the ones in the techref 'should' be implemented
<derek> but these are things that unless one of the developers are using them, probably are not getting properly regression tested
<Harald1> all are those in the VALIDTRIGGERS list
<derek> so the safe answer is in the source code you can get a list of what is there in code
<derek> then only by testing can you determine if they work
<Harald1> err no list
<derek> (bad answer i know)
<derek> but i would 'assume' that if its in the techref
<derek> its in the source and it SHOULD work
<derek> i.e. if you use one that is the tech ref and it doesnt work please file a bug against it
<Harald1> actually I am not using them at moment, but look at how they work/ are implemented
<derek> Harald1: i forget you wanting to 'develop' gnue tools
<derek> or use them
<nickr> dtm: I had rice and ramyun, not just rike by itself
Action: derek has bad memory so i apologize if i already asked
<derek> i like to know how people fit into the picture
<Harald1> derek: at the moment I'm far from "developing". I am trying to get an overview, and understand how certain things are done
<derek> i guess the real question was
<Harald1> and I looked at the technical reference and saw the sentence "We would like to increase the number of supported languages as time permits" in the trigger part, and now I try to understand how triggers work
<derek> 'do you plan on using gnue as an end user' or 'as a developer'
<Harald1> derek: mostly as a developer
<Harald1> because I still go to university. but I think will soon (in a few years) be a big option. So knowing it is not only interesting, but also useful :)
