<NetTantra> hi all
<NetTantra> Newbie to GNUe sphere :)
<ra3vat> hi
<NetTantra> But very eager to implement
<NetTantra> Well is it really stable? is the question I put to you people first?
<ra3vat> tools (forms, designer) are useful enough for 2-tier mode
<NetTantra> And what all modules you have said to be downloadble will work for sure without bugs?
<ra3vat> none :)
<NetTantra> ra3vat: You mean to say nothing is ready yet?
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<NetTantra> hi psu
<ra3vat> tools (forms, designer) are ready to give a try
<psu> hi NetTantra
<NetTantra> so ra3vat- I have to use forms, designer and create modules and implement???
<ra3vat> i mean none is without bugs :)
<NetTantra> OKKKKKK Sounds Just great!
<NetTantra> Now the question is Customising them
<NetTantra> Do I need to have strong XML and Python knowledge to do them or I can do it with the IDE itself?
<ra3vat> NetTantra: yes for 2-tier GEAS (application server) is not ready  
reinhard (~rm@62.47.45.104) joined #gnuenterprise.
<NetTantra> hi reinhard
<NetTantra> Do I need to have strong XML and Python knowledge to do them or I can do it with the IDE itself?
<reinhard> morning
<NetTantra> reinhard: I was asking ra3vat about the ease of customization of gnue modules
<NetTantra> what do you feel?
<NetTantra> Is it too early to say anything about it?
<ra3vat> NetTantra: you can use designer and then customize them without strong XML knowledge
<NetTantra> That sounds really great!
<ra3vat> them - forms (.gfd files)
<NetTantra> ra3vat: Do you feel it is enough stable to be implemented onsite?
<ra3vat> you need python knowledge to make triggers
<NetTantra> ok
<NetTantra> What all module do you really say "Reliable"?
<ra3vat> modules (like accounting, ...) are not ready
<NetTantra> Financials, Supplychain Mgt., HR, CRM, Stores...?
<ra3vat> not yet
<NetTantra> How about Double Choco Latte?
<ra3vat> they were designed to be used with application server and now application server is in rewrite stage
<NetTantra> oH!
<ra3vat> dcl is in the way from separate php-application to something that would use gnue architecture
<NetTantra> ra3vat: Are you one among those who are rewriting GEAS?
<ra3vat> few guys working on that
<NetTantra> The Thing is, I wanted to know how long it would take to redeem the rewrite process? (Just very curious)
<nickr> geas is still in the proposal and design stage
<ra3vat> no, you should contact with reinhard, neilt, chiliwilly, jamest, jcater
<ra3vat> and others :)
<NetTantra> reinhard: Back to you :)
<NetTantra> I Want to implement GNUe in my office right now. How do I go about.. is it possible?
<psu> The team are all volunteers at the moment, so we work w/o deadlines
<nickr> in 2-tier you can do it
<ra3vat> is your office all under gnu/linux ?
<psu> as no-one can tell how much time they will have 
<NetTantra> ra3vat: We have two Linux servers.... rest or on MS
<psu> NetTantra - you can certainly use the GNUe tools in 2-tier to write apps yourself
<psu> If you're looking for "shrink-wrap" install and go Financials, HR, etc
<psu> we're not there yet
<psu> and to be honest 
<psu> we need to get the n-tier tools written & working 
<ra3vat> NetTantra: you can try bynary snapshot for MS (it is single .exe to get forms working)
<psu> before we start there.
<NetTantra> ra3vat: Come again - I did'nt get it? How do I do it with MS?
<psu> NetTantra: the official release is a few months old, you can either use that 
<psu> or the nightly CVS snapshots
<psu> I'll dig out some URLs for you
<NetTantra> psu: But how about the backend?
<NetTantra> geas with 2 tier should I stick to till geas n-tier appear?
<ra3vat> NetTantra: many well known from free to commercial
<psu> NetTantra - for the database back-end, use your choice of database
<NetTantra> ok
<psu> for the app-server backend, we have an Application Server 
<psu> that a company kindly contributed
<psu> but which needs an extensive re-write
<psu> which is just starting
<psu> On databases, we currently support loads of free and non-free choices
<NetTantra> I understand... I will try it out with PgSQL as of now... and wait for Geas to be rewritten. I hope and wish it happens at the earliest :)
<psu> including ODBC (i.e. pretty much anything that has an ODBC driver)
<psu> free: postgresql, mysql, SAP
<psu> non-free: Oracle, DB2
<NetTantra> k
<psu> Even today, 2-tier is a good framework for those sorts of little projects
<psu> that you start in MS Access before you realise you actually need something bigger ;-)
<ra3vat> NetTantra: http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/snapshots/win32/
<NetTantra> But will existing geas allows me to use Postgresql?
<ra3vat> NetTantra: then you can get your forms working from MS to postgresql on linux side
<psu> NetTantra - geas is the application server = n-tier
<psu> the guys have decided to re-write this bit
<NetTantra> ra3vat: I am planning to use psql on linux
<ra3vat> NetTantra: good
<psu> For 2-tier you just need Forms, Designer and your preferred d/b
<ra3vat> NetTantra: where are you from ? (as i do some testing for i18n)
<NetTantra> In that case how do I execute the forms in MS world?
<NetTantra> (I am from India)
<ra3vat> NetTantra: forms based on cross-platforms tools like python, wxpython and do 
<NetTantra> Can this be web enabled and can be accessed using native webbrowsers like IE or Netscape?
<psu> NetTantra - we are looking at providing mutliple client access, including HTML
<psu> there was a guy working on a pure HTML client - not sure where that got to 
<psu> we also had someone working on a PHP client 
<ra3vat> NetTantra: are you ready to run two commands from your python prompt right now?
<psu> which I think made more preogress 
<psu> It's certainly an aim to support web-based
Yurik_ (~yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) joined #gnuenterprise.
<psu> In practice, I would expect that using complicated forms via web would be quite painful
<NetTantra> ra3vat: I am on a MS machine!
<psu> so power-users would probably always want to use a proper Forms client
Yurik (yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) left irc: No route to host
<psu> but for occasional users, web is probably fine 
<psu> Some of our project team are big web-application haters - 
<ra3vat> NetTantra: ok, may be later (but python is available for MS machine too)
<NetTantra> yeah I agee with you psu
<psu> but if you look at DCL, that is exclusively web-based at the moment 
<psu> so go figure ;-)
<NetTantra> ra3vat: Unfortunate thing is I do not have it on the machine I am working... tell what if I have?
<NetTantra> ra3vat: I have got a prompt
<ra3vat> NetTantra: we have few guys from India one of them did support for some native encodings

<Arturas> Hello
<ra3vat> Harald1: hi
<dneighbo> Harald1 hopefully my email explained the testing situation
<dneighbo> i.e. we believe strongly in a test suite and regression testing
<dneighbo> but while we have good working code that is highly useful
<dneighbo> its not yet 1.0 kind of stuff with a huge user base demanding that type of testing
<dneighbo> and since we are resource sensitive currently its hard to justify large time expenditures to a testing suite when demands elsewhere are so large
<dneighbo> hopefully that makes due sense
<Harald1> dneighbo: yes, it explained everything. I was just curious. But don't you think that using a test suite later will lead to a lot of boring work? If it is done as soon as possible after the implementation, it won't be that much work at once.
Action: jcater is back (gone 01:12:11)
<Harald1> And the developer still known what he/she has done
<jcater> Harald1: you would not believe how little time we developers have
<Harald1> s/known/knows/
<jcater> while that sounds reasonable, it is even tough to get our docs done in synch w/our changes
<Harald1> jcater: I can imagine, but if it's not done know, do you believe anyone wants to do it in a year or two?
<Harald1> s/know/now/
<jcater> no more so than they want to do it now :)
<jcater> I think it would be a waste of time given our current state
ToyMan_mobile (~stuq@65.167.123.51) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Harald1> jcater: hmm ok. I just think that'll take more time, if its done later. Though I understand your arguments and the stability of the code I tested proves you right
<Harald1> jcater: did you already receive my reply to ticket #8 ?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> but I don't have time to look at it further at the moment
<Harald1> jcater: ok.

<markoi> NoClue Begginners Question: Has anybody any clue huw much time must a begginner invest to setup 2 tier general ledger with gnue forms and postgres on linux? Actualy two ledgers one for a little bussiness and the other for family use. :-/
<dneighbo> for ever
<dneighbo> markoi currently we have a framework but not the 'shrink wrap' applications
<dneighbo> so you could download and install the framework to use with postgres in probably under 4 hours
<dneighbo> on debian if you are experienced linux user w/ postgres running probably take you about 10 minutes
<dneighbo> we do a have a general ledger specification
<markoi> But homepage claims it is working on several real systems
<dneighbo> markoi it is
<dneighbo> but not a general ledger
<dneighbo> the places that have it running are doing
<dneighbo> 'invoicing'
<dneighbo> 'inventory'
<dneighbo> 'call center'
Arturas (artkri@fmgs-01.vtu.lt) left irc: 
<dneighbo> the issue is that these places that are running it also paid consultants or in house staff to write the applicatiosn with the framework as 'custom' applications
<dneighbo> so they didnt give htem back to the community
<dneighbo> if you provided requirements
<dneighbo> im sure it wouldnt be too difficult to get you something completely custom running
<dneighbo> but its not something that would happen in 24hours
<dneighbo> but shouldnt drag you out endless years or anything :)
<dneighbo> what kind of business?
<dneighbo> and what 'pieces' are you looking for?
<markoi> I do use debian. I have some SAP in house consulting experience in Finances
<dneighbo> if you just want a 'ledger' you might be able to use gnucash or sqlledger
<psu> I once wrote a quick hack GL in M$ Access (oh the shame of it) in an afternoon 
<dneighbo> if you want more than that i think gnue is right for you if you are willing to put some work into building what you need
<psu> only thing I never quite got working was the balanced journal check 
<dneighbo> that said a mix match might be acceptable as well
<psu> doing something similar in GNUe probably would be as quick
<dneighbo> using sqlledger for the gl and building your other components in gnue around it
<markoi> I want to use doble sided accounting. And I do find gnue very interesting platform so I am prepared to leave some time here. In the reasonable limits to get usable results...
<dneighbo> we are looking for people willing to build/use applications :)
<dneighbo> the problem is we ahve limited people resources
<dneighbo> and most of the resources are making the tools better
<dneighbo> if they stop to build official applications the tools suffer
<dneighbo> so we are rough spot
<dneighbo> more hands help :)
<dneighbo> in fact people that are less engineer and more consulting type are what we need most :)
<markoi> I am not shure what I am more / less, but I hope to build more consulting side of me in the future
<markoi> Is gnue packaded for debian working at the moment or not? I saw some notes about some problems on KC
irs (marko@h126n2fls21o825.telia.com) left irc: "Leaving"
<dneighbo> its packaged but isnt done well
<dneighbo> i would get from cvs probably opposed to from debian packages
<dneighbo> we have some people looking into cleaning up the debian packages so they install better
<psu> i'm looking for a couple of apps I know "must" exist
<psu> on debian somewhere
<psu> a) an html validator (pref. very strict)
<markoi> Where can I find sqlledger ? It looks like sqllledger is not spelled right. No hits on deja news,...
<psu> b) something to walk through some php pages and do all the "includes" 
<nickr> psu: tidy does samething like validation, but it also cleans up html and such. Probably not what you want
<psu> to spit out normal HTML?
<nickr> psu: validator.w3c.org is what you actually want
<psu> nickr: I always reckon "my" HTML is better than any machines ;-)
<nickr> psu: as far as the php is concerned thats eay .:)
<nickr> tidy is WAY cool
<nickr> try it just for fun
<psu> nickr: yep. I will  prob have to use w3c.org - was hoping for something local
<nickr> but anyway, all the php you need to know is <?PHP include('file'); ?>
<psu> tidy will probably do - if nothing else, I can pipe the output, diff it & see 
<psu> where I disagree ;-)
<markoi> I used on DEBIAN weblint as html validator a couple of times
<nickr> you can completely crontrol how it munges the output
<nickr> its pretty serious about fixing common erros and stuff
<nickr> its a validator/fixer/indent for html
<jamest> i'm jumping in w/o reading backlog
<jamest> but seems you are talking about html tools
<jamest> anyone know of a good tool like linbot that is currently being maintained
<nickr> jamest: whats linbot do?
<jamest> you run the bot over your site and it
<jamest>   link checks
<nickr> oh
<nickr> hrm
<jamest>   slow page analyze(looks at pics, size ,etc)
<jamest>   site maps
<jamest>   old page listing
<nickr> htcheck
<dneighbo> wright:/home/dneighbo# apt-cache search ledger
<dneighbo> odontolinux - Dental office management software (PHP4 + PostgreSQL)
<dneighbo> wright:/home/dneighbo# 
<nickr> well, it checks for dead links at least
<dneighbo> interesting
<dneighbo> http://www.sql-ledger.com
<dneighbo> markoi 
Action: dneighbo cringes that we end up turning folks away
<jamest> http://www.math.ksu.edu/grad/linbot/
<jamest> is a sample you might be able to see...if I'm not blocking at apache level that is :)
<nickr> dneighbo: ?
<nickr> jamest: maybe you should take on maintainance of it Q:)

<markoi> Thanks for the link. I'll try that http://www.sql-ledger.com
<dneighbo> im sorry
<dneighbo> i really dont want to point you there would MUCH rather have you use gnue
<dneighbo> but if it fits your needs better so be it :(
<markoi> As I said i do like gnue
<dneighbo> im so sick of having to point people there
<dneighbo> if i get a free weekend soon
<markoi> but I am probably not so hardcore hacker.
<dneighbo> i will probably use their structures and just build gnue front ends to it
<dneighbo> so that i dont have to utter the url any longer
Action: dneighbo sulks back into his corner
<psu> from memory, the class defintions for GL were fairly simple 
<psu> could easily be written as normal SQL tables
<psu> question is - do we want a 2-tier GL at this point?
<dneighbo> psu i so cool
<dneighbo> he is constantly volunteering for stuff
Action: dneighbo loves you man
<psu> or does it simply divert us from geas?
<markoi> I would be happy to help if there is expected real timeschedule. Like a week or a couple of them...
<dneighbo> psu: its a toss up
<psu> problem to me is that a 2-tier gl doesn't go anywhere
<dneighbo> i for example would say you and i probably really arent really hot on tuning up GEAS
<dneighbo> as its not our 'domain'
<psu> as we scrap it the day we have geas v2
<dneighbo> so if people like us time is spent as
<dneighbo> 'do nothing but fondle selves'
<dneighbo> or
<psu> & a gl w/o ap, ar etc is a bit like a bikini
<dneighbo> 'write two tier stuff'
<psu> i.e. what it reveals is interesting
<dneighbo> i would say its advisable to write stuff :)
<psu> but what it conceals is vital

<nickr> thats why I love you guys.
<dneighbo> the new legacy is my sisters are a bit older than i, by about a decade
<dneighbo> so their children were born when i was still living at home
<dneighbo> and they like most new families used grandma and grandpa a lot for babysitting
<dneighbo> so i would torture my nieces and nephews
<dneighbo> the magic word that I made them say was
<dneighbo> 'please stop uncle deke'
<dneighbo> to this day i have cousins in hawaii and california that i have seen like only once or twice and never 'played' with
<dneighbo> and they when tortured by parents or siblings shout
Action: jcater 's gonna start calling dneighbo 'deke'
<dneighbo> 'please stop uncle deke'
<jcater> yo, masta deke 
<ToyMan_mobile> hey dneighbo
<jcater> hmm
<dneighbo> which i find hilarious
<ToyMan_mobile> hi all
<jcater> has a cool ring to it
<psu> the very first ledget I every used 
<jcater> ToyMan_mobile: howdy
<dneighbo> hi ToyMan_mobile you on a mobile device?
<psu> had a reporting tool called "DEKE" 
Action: ToyMan_mobile is checking out his new laptop
<dneighbo> ah
<psu> co-incidence?
<dneighbo> i dont mind being called 'deke'
<psu> Was an old ICL tool
<jcater> psu: was it useful?
<ToyMan_mobile> compaq armada w/ freebsd
<dneighbo> in fact all family and friends i grew up with call me that
<jcater> if so, the namesake doesn't fit
<dneighbo> so its not something i get irrated by
<psu> jcater:  it was sort of 1970s mainframe meets 1980s SQL 
<ToyMan_mobile> what's up with the transfer possibliliteis
<ToyMan_mobile> ?
<dneighbo> if you want to tease me
<dneighbo> call me 'dekey dan'
<psu> i think that counts as a "no"
<dneighbo> as thats what mommy calls me

<dneighbo> rofl
<ToyMan_mobile> and lots 'o rings
<dneighbo> yeah big gold chains can cover up anything
<dneighbo> vanilla ice is proof of that
<ToyMan_mobile> is there any way to pull down gnumeric with out taking all of gnome along for the ride?
<dneighbo> not really
<dneighbo> you using debian?
<dneighbo> you might try openoffice instead
<dneighbo> its a bit more of a pig as its all the tools
<dneighbo> BUT
<ToyMan_mobile> freebsd
<dneighbo> i dont think it requires gnome
<ToyMan_mobile> openoffice port is borked for bsd right now
<dneighbo> not only that i have found its much better for ms office compatiablity
<dneighbo> than abiword/gnumeric
<ToyMan_mobile> well, I need tables in my wp, so no abiword yet
<dneighbo> you should be able to get gnumeric kind of stripped down
<ToyMan_mobile> maybe with just gtk
<dneighbo> yes
<dneighbo> and bonobo
<dneighbo> and some other packages
<ToyMan_mobile> mebbe
<dneighbo> but probably dont need WHOLE gnome desktop
<ToyMan_mobile> hope not
<dneighbo> nickr how do you look at a deb package?
<dneighbo> to show what it depends on vs recommends 
<dneighbo> etc
<ToyMan_mobile> the laptop is just a PII 266
<ToyMan_mobile> and I like fluxbox
<nickr> dneighbo: apt-cache show

<dneighbo> nickr :)
<dneighbo> thats what i was just ready to paste :)
<ToyMan_mobile> hmmm.
<dneighbo> most are libraries though
<nickr> all are actually
<nickr> probably a good percentage of those are optional
<dneighbo> nickr i want to know why on earth gnumeric suggests EVOLUTION
<dneighbo> is that just ximian peddling evolution or what?
<ToyMan_mobile> heh, no thanx to evol
<nickr> dneighbo: Hrm. Maybe it has some sort of funky bindings to use it or integrate scheduling or something.
<ToyMan_mobile> they *never* got the bsd ver. working on that

<Chipaca> nope, we're just doing the ERD right now, so it's mostly sit-at-the-blackboard-and-draw
<nickr> thats my favorite stage
<Chipaca> I hope not _too_ many argentinisms get into the ERD, so that you guys can use it also
<jcater> ERD?
<dneighbo> enity relationship diagram?

<dneighbo> sure
<dneighbo> what tool you using to create it?

<dneighbo> send it to info@gnue.org
<dneighbo> or post on the web somewhere
<dneighbo> as dcc fails for most of us
<Chipaca> dneighbo: oh, ok. it's WIP, so not much use outside of a casual chat :)
<dneighbo> gotcha
<dneighbo> go ahead and send when more complete
<dneighbo> glad to see you stopping by
<dneighbo> was worried you decided gnue wasnt right tool for the job
<Chipaca> it is, or it will be, we're not sure on that yet :)
<Chipaca> if what you advertise on www.gnue.org were correct, we'd be out of a job 
<Chipaca> :)
<dneighbo> i just encourage you to remember if it doesnt fit exactly 
<dneighbo> with a little work it probably could :)
<Chipaca> I'm pretty sure it'll fit, and the framework certainly is the right one.

<jcater> oooooooo
<dneighbo> jcater: dont worry this would be 'locale' based
<jcater> that include my commits?

<dneighbo> chillywilly where did you paste that forom
<dneighbo> from
<dneighbo> can you change that?
<chillywilly> that is from gnue/common/BUGS
<dneighbo> jamest or jcater we need to get bugs@gnuenterprise.org setup
<jcater> what should it do?
<dneighbo> and someone needs to be avaliable for questions
<chillywilly> btw, the DCL link off the main site didn't work for me
<dneighbo> so i can get the email gateweay for dcl up
<dneighbo> jcater i believe it would be a local spool
<dneighbo> and the gateway would read that and create tickets directly form it

<crazymike> what did I do...i don't have java
<dneighbo> j2re1.3.1
<crazymike> if i do it doesn't work
<dneighbo> thats jjava
<crazymike> I know thats what it says
<crazymike> but...whatever
<chillywilly> don't sweat it
<chillywilly> it is just complaining
<dneighbo> we jused to auto kick java folks
<crazymike> fine then kick me
<dneighbo> but we have learned to stop worrying and love the java
<chillywilly> dneighbo: what does that have to do with his browser wanting to load the lpugin?
<chillywilly> er, plugin
<dneighbo> man i give the guy a hard time
<dneighbo> and you two go nuts :)
<crazymike> you said to type mozilla -compose...that is the mail composer
<chillywilly> oops
<crazymike> not that it comes up anyways
<crazymike> but it is
<chillywilly> well just  start moz and click the composer button
<crazymike> i don't have a composer button :)
<chillywilly> I can't see if there's an option anywhere
<chillywilly> yes you do
<chillywilly> it looks like a pencil and paper

<chillywilly> oh dude

<dneighbo> and i will set you up right now :)
<chillywilly> that's the ticket
<chillywilly> what about eh?
<chillywilly> er me
<jcater> dneighbo: were you asking me to set up a bugs account? 
<jcater> or was that a general musing?
<dneighbo> not directly
Action: jcater is on heavy prescriptions
<dneighbo> saying i will need you or jamest around in next day or two when i hvae time to look at dcl gateway for email

<jcater> ah
<jcater> ok
<dneighbo> as i believe it requires a 'default' account to get mail from

<chillywilly> now do bugs come in as work orders or what?
<chillywilly> can I have an account please?
<chillywilly> I want to play with it

Nick change: crazymike -> crazymike_dead
<dneighbo> jcater: i need to check at home
<dneighbo> but i think we can do multi stylesheets
<dneighbo> for xslt
<dneighbo> or use entities probably
<dneighbo> so the .xsl file that does the transformation
<dneighbo> can be variable via entities or another style sheet
<dneighbo> so one stylesheet (transformation)
<jcater> cool
<dneighbo> might have <img> persay
<jcater> so you get what I was thinking
<dneighbo> er
<dneighbo> <img location="somepath">
<dneighbo> and instead have
<dneighbo> <img location=&logo;>
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> and &logo is an entity defined in
<jcater> that's not exactly what I was thinking
<jcater> but it's a start
<dneighbo> i think it is im just not explaining it well
<dneighbo> and used bad example
<dneighbo> im thinking merged style sheets would be best
<dneighbo> worse case we use one .xsl file that is the template
<dneighbo> and you merely change it
<dneighbo> but as you stated then if we change ours you have to 'manage' your custom one
<dneighbo> where if we 'abstract' some things
<dneighbo> then we can change the base transformation and you dont have to modify your custom ones

Action: jcater is never sure
<chillywilly> I thought we don't really have a discuss list anymore
<chillywilly> as gnue.org lists went to gnu.org
<jcater> we have gnue@gnu.org (general discussion)
<chillywilly> I think it's a design decision
<jcater> gnue-dev@gnu.org (development)
<jcater> gnue-announce@gnu.org (announcements only)
<chillywilly> so gnue-dev would be more appropriate
<jcater> ok

<jcater> I'd tend to agree
<jcater> but was wanting someone else's feedback :)
<Harald1> did anybody answer chillywilly's savannah vs. dcl question?

<jcater> thx
<dneighbo> just sent you a reply i didnt want to :)
<dneighbo> as im so afraid you will like the product too much and i abhor its parent company :)
<jcater> eh?
<jcater> I didn't think ReportLabs was free
<jcater> only their PDF creation library
<jcater> btw, I have looked at kugar
<jcater> it's not quite what I envision
<jcater> Gnue reports to be
<jcater> s/quite/
<dneighbo> being so tied to kparts immediately kills it for me :)
<jcater> yeah
<dneighbo> but the general concept was what i had wanted as a QUICK dirty start :)
<dneighbo> but i think we are beyond that now
<dneighbo> as we have a start for 'server'
<dneighbo> and honestly our markup engine ithink is more flexible :)
<dneighbo> and with xslt we will kick some butt when we have a standard
<dneighbo> but mostly i think (maybe naively so)
<jcater> my only concern for our route is the speed of transformations
<dneighbo> that since we are talking xml here that our current designer wont need too much to have visual designer :)
<jcater> but, we'll see :)
<dneighbo> jcater i expect them to be slow on bigger reports until everything is streamed
<dneighbo> however in my world i think it will be huge performance INCREASE
<jcater> lol
<dneighbo> as currently they build printed reports
<dneighbo> then build html reports
<dneighbo> then build pdf reports
<dneighbo> every time doing requeries
<dneighbo> here you would do 1 query to get the datafile
<dneighbo> then 3 tranformations
<dneighbo> so while the transformation might be marginally slower
<dneighbo> not having to requery to get a dataset each time is a huge performance boost and resource boost
<dneighbo> a ton of reports never even get 'viewed' so are drawn in vain
<dneighbo> you could do a caching sequence
<dneighbo> so say every report for month end for every department gets its .xml data file built
<jcater> yip
<dneighbo> but not until someone goes to VIEW the friggin report does it do the transformation
<dneighbo> and then it 'caches' it so the next person doesnt need to rerun the transformation
<dneighbo> even if transformation slower this does two things
<dneighbo> a. it does transform unless used (big savigns)
<dneighbo> b. it distributes the transformation to the user
<dneighbo> so instead of a report taking an hour (month end financials for all departments)
<dneighbo> it might take 15 minutes up front
<dneighbo> then each user seeing report for first time has a small (minute or two)
<dneighbo> tranformation time
<dneighbo> i hope this makes sense
<dneighbo> but in a LARGE enivornment this is where i can see us just kicking ass all over crystal reports and friends
Action: dneighbo must have lost them all :)
<jcater> I agree
Action: jcater detests crystal reports, btw
<dneighbo> i havent used in a long time
<dneighbo> i hear its much better
<dneighbo> but on principle alone i dont like it :)
<dneighbo> only thing more evil was a custom report system i maintained at one time in Mumps (M)
<dneighbo> btw M is pretty cool language
<dneighbo> chilly you would like it 
<dneighbo> its considered 'post relational'
<dneighbo> its not really objects but it is
<dneighbo> its heirarchial data structures

<javaguy> care to field some questions?
<jcater> I can try
<jcater> depends on the topic
<javaguy> Well, I was looking over the GComm/GNU-RPC code
<javaguy> looks like it might handle what I'm looking for (distributed computing using SOAP)
<javaguy> firstly, does the soaplib library handle transport, or just serialization/de-serialization and request/response?
<jcater> um
<jcater> I think the latter
<jcater> I've only minimally looked into soaplib
<javaguy> Ok.  Then, I would need to attach it to a transport vehicle of some sort, such as Apache?
<jcater> you might want to look at medusa
<jcater> with is an asynchronous transport server written in python
<jcater> that's what I'll be using for the transport in gnurpc
<javaguy> Ah...Ok
Action: javaguy updates his todo list
<javaguy> so, GNU-RPC is seperate from GComm?
crazymike (~crazymike@mke-65-31-133-230.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> well
<javaguy> hello crazymike
Action: jcater tries to remember what GComm refers to
<jcater> are you referring to "GNue-Common" 
<jcater> or the gcomm drivers
<crazymike> javaguy: hi
<jcater> if the latter, then gcomm was the "working" name for gnu-rpc
<jcater> hence the directory structure :)
<javaguy> the gcomm drivers.  The SOAP driver is the one I'm interested in specifically
<javaguy> Ok.  And the SOAP driver for GNU-RPC incorporates/will incorporate this medusa transport?
<jcater> yes
drochaid (drochaid@pc2-kirk2-0-cust175.ren.cable.ntl.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jcater> however, the soap driver isn't very far along
<jcater> my first "Test" case was xml-rpc because of its simplicity
<jcater> my thinking was that as soon as I had a working xml-rpc
<jcater> soap would be a small jump away
<javaguy> what sort of timeframe are you looking at before GEAS is ready for alpha testing w/ SOAP?
<chillywilly> crazymike: whirrred
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> javaguy: we just started looking at reimplementing geas using gnue-common
<jcater> there has been no code to that effect
<jcater> so that's a tough question
<chillywilly> real soon now (tm)
<crazymike> chillywilly: ???
<jcater> I honestly don't expect there to be much to geas
<javaguy> heya, CW
<chillywilly> crazymike: I said wassup my nick-a
<crazymike> chillywilly: ahhhh
<jcater> as much of its functionality will come from stuff in gnue-common
<jcater> but it's real hard to say
<crazymike> whats with the (tm)???

<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> I was talking about geas

<javaguy> Is there anything I could do speed the process along?
<javaguy> I would even be willing to write python code...
<crazymike> d00d, no offense, but it needs alot
<chillywilly> try /msg fool
<jcater> someone needs to jumpstart the recoding process

<jcater> javaguy: what kind of timeframe are you needing?
<javaguy> no hard-and-fast timeline.  This isn't for production, or anything

chillywilly (danielb@d10.as8.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) left irc: Killed (NickServ (Ghost: chillywilly_!~danielb@d65.as28.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net))
Nick change: chillywilly_ -> chillywilly
<jcater> as sometimes a hung job never fully releases lpd
<derek> lpd or lprng
<jcater> err, lprng
Action: derek needs a faster print server :)
<derek> restarted and it actived next job
<derek> but still nothing prints
<derek> since it was a print of same thing it likely will stall as well
<derek> its odd i dont hear the machine chugging away but nothing is printing
<jcater> what was it?
Action: derek slaps it a few times (with a smelly trout of course)
<jcater> if the pr0n had a lot of gradients, that could cause a lot of processing
<derek> jcater: a calendar
<derek> yes lots of gradients
<derek> picture of a nice color train
<derek> then the calendar portion
<derek> still says active but nothing
<derek> im gonna kill it
<derek> grr must you restart lprng after every deleted item in the queue?
<derek> seems awful mundane
<derek> ok same thing with last job it seems....
<derek> http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/
<derek> very simple to print
<derek> wtf
<derek> grrrr
<derek> forgot brittanys friend knocked over server when playing Xmen the other day
<derek> it jostled parallel cable loose
<derek> now it prints fine
Action: derek wonders why it doesnt give some indication it couldnt find printer
<Maniac> does mdean ever pop in (not JUST his IRC client)
<Maniac> ?
<Maniac> lp mdean
<mdean> :-P
<Maniac> aha!
<Maniac> howdee!
<jcater> wassup mdean
<Maniac> mdippity dawg!
<mdean> high
<Maniac> your high?
<jcater> how high?
<mdean> some might think so
<Maniac> how's work?
<mdean> sux
<Maniac> really?
<mdean> not working with linux, so yeah
<Maniac> ah
<derek> wassup
<derek> mdean liked your FSF response
<derek> i plan on calling brad as its really ticking me off
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> good response
<derek> 3 times i have specifically said we will do what it takes to make our stuff work for you
<mdean> the latest one?
<derek> ys
<derek> yes
<derek> we said we would build to SPEC
<derek> we were told no you dont do emacs
<derek> now they use something that doesnt use emacs either
<chillywilly> what are you dudes talking about
<chillywilly> ?
<derek> on contact manager i told them we will build to SPEC
<mdean> I almost told him it reminded me of a company choosing a proprietary software package over a Free one because the proprietary one had all the features
Action: Maniac seconds chillywilly
<derek> then voila im told they are writing something in house
<derek> from scratch
<derek> i went nuts
<derek> mdean: that was SUPPOSED to be the point of my email
<derek> RMS says who cares if prop software has all the features live w/o them for freedom
<Maniac> mailing list emails?
<derek> but when it comes to own packages
<derek> ditch at first site of package with MORE features
<derek> sigh
<derek> psu for the record everything from mdean talking to now please do not put in the kernel cousin for political reasons
<derek> i have no shame in saying it but dont want to air dirty laundry more publicly than necessary
<jcater> woohoo
<jcater> I plugged us on wx-dev
<jcater> :)
<derek> chillywilly: talking about internal FSF politics
Action: jcater is trying to get into that habit
<derek> you are learning well young jedi knight
<jcater> wx is getting very bloated though
<jcater> they have wxDB, wxDBTables, ...
<derek> yeah i see that
<derek> they need to go to Delphi module
<chillywilly> heh
<derek> make lightweight components
<jcater> sigh
<derek> and let 'third party' do the rest
<jcater> that's your solution to everything
<jcater> "marriage problems?"
<derek> i.e. i dont want 15 different fricken nutty widgets
<derek> give me base widgets
<jcater> "hey, use the delphi model of lightweight communication"
<derek> and add in the others 
<derek> jcater: rofl
<derek> i think delphi is a good tool in some areas on in others
<chillywilly> delphi shmelphi
<derek> i think its VCL is best component model i have seen to date
<Maniac> delphi r0x0rs my b0x0rs
<derek> and their approach of go light and let other users contribute the rest via bring in at own necessity was a good one
Action: chillywilly watches derek stroke off to delphi
<derek> it would be like us demanding we load ALL dbdrivers in common
<derek> even if you only use one
<derek> i much rather like the plug what you need approach
<derek> grrr be back in a minute (not having vts sucks)

Nick change: jgDinner -> javaguy
<chillywilly> wb javaguy
<javaguy> thanx, CW
<javaguy> Is GEAS/GNUe going to be using WSDL?  If so, I could put together some docs for the core business objects...
<jcater> WSDL?
<javaguy> Web Service Description Language
<jcater> ack
<chillywilly> dotgnu will
<chillywilly> most likely
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> I'm not familiar w/that
<javaguy> I can pull the URL for the spec, if you like
<jcater> sure
<javaguy> dotgnu is FSF's implementation of .NET?
<jcater> soemthing like that
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> I am sure some dotgnu + gnue interfacing will happen some day
<chillywilly> I dunno when though
<jcater> that's easy
<jcater> as soon as someone contribs it
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> hehe ;P
<chillywilly> fuck I am tired
<chillywilly> need caffiebe
<chillywilly> er, caffiene
<javaguy> here it is: http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl
<chillywilly> is it an xml thingy?
<chillywilly> anyone know where there's a nice little graphic of the liberty bell?
<javaguy> WSDL is not specific to .NET.  It's main use is to document the interface used by a SOAP-accessible service, but there's nothing preventing it from being used by other services
<chillywilly> I guess it is in xml ;)
<javaguy> Yes, it is an XML thingy ;)
<chillywilly> hrrrm, so to describe a corba service, or xml-rpc, or whatever?
<chillywilly> http?
<jcater> I describe all my interfaces
<jcater> they are labeled "enter at your own risk"
<chillywilly> hey dude this sounds nifty
<chillywilly> maybe we should use it in gnurpc
<javaguy> Yes.  Seeing as SOAP is a direct descendant of XML-RPC, it should rather easy to use WSDL in conjunction with XML-RPC
<chillywilly> well they talk about using http get/post and mime to
<chillywilly> too
Action: chillywilly wants an irc interface to geas ;)
<jcater> gack
<chillywilly> that would be fun
<javaguy> not sure what changes (if any) would need to be made IOT support CORBA
<jcater>  /msg geas give me a all the rows from objec txxxx
<jcater> <geas> Does not compute. No object txxxx
<chillywilly>  /msg geas select s from Professors where s.name == "billyboy"
<chillywilly> (OQL queries)
<chillywilly> I dunno
<jcater> OQL uses select statements?
<chillywilly> yes, it is VERY SQL-like
<jcater> is there a python OQL parser?
<chillywilly> no, but we shoudl write one
<chillywilly> ;)
dneighbo (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<javaguy> not sure about, WSDL, but SOAP can be used over pretty much any communications protocols
<chillywilly> there's some sample grammar
<jcater> run!
<chillywilly> it returns collections like basg or sets of objects
<chillywilly> er, bags
<chillywilly> also
<javaguy> The book I'm studying right now discusses using http(s), MIME w/ attachments, JMS (Java Messaging Service)
<chillywilly> statements to creta an object
<chillywilly> er, create
<javaguy> Probably a few others I've missed
<chillywilly> supports a lot of SQLisms too, for completeness
<javaguy> All you have to be able to do is send and receive XML messages
<chillywilly> OQL is very clsoe to SQL-92 (says it in my book ;) )
<chillywilly> er, close
<chillywilly> extensions concern object-oriented notions like complex objects, object identity, path expressions, polymorphism, operation invocation, and late binding
<chillywilly> blah blah
<jcater> bah
<chillywilly> you can clal object methods with it
Action: jcater goes back to gnue-reports coding
<chillywilly> er, call
<chillywilly> and you can even refer to parent objects and hve the instances it pulls be derived form those and it doesn't make a difference
<javaguy> CW: The only reference I could find for ODMG was a pitch to buy a book.  Is there anything open?
<jcater> bah
<jcater> you young object wippersnapers
<chillywilly> I bought the book
<chillywilly> jcater: I like SQL
<jcater> you should make a pin-on button
<jcater> like "I like Ike"
<chillywilly> uh, sure dude
<chillywilly> javaguy: I would look at Java Data Objects thing, but the Java binding is lame, imho and it has some really shitty EULA on it
<chillywilly> I dunno how they can put an EULA on a spec
<chillywilly> it's stupid
<chillywilly> the ODMG's answer for java is to use some outside property files to express what fields/attributes of an object are 'persistent'....it is just lame
<chillywilly> the smalltalk binding qwould probably be geared more towards how one would do it in python
<chillywilly> sine they are loosely typed langauges
<chillywilly> javaguy: btw, that odmg.txt file is my notes on the standard ;)
<javaguy> Cool.  I'll take a look at it.  There are Java interfaces available off odmg.org, so I'm not flying completely blind... ;)
<chillywilly> yea, I downloaded those
<chillywilly> they help
<chillywilly> escpecially the 2.0 one
<chillywilly> imho
<chillywilly> the 3.0 binding is stupid
<javaguy> Yeah.  JDO looked like something we could probably live without...
<javaguy> hmm...I think I got the 3.0 bindings.  I'll see if I can't find the 2.0 bindings
<chillywilly> I am trying to incorporate the standard somewhat into our overall architecture
<javaguy> Of course, this will all be implemented under the covers by the python guys, so I don't need to be too knowledgable
<chillywilly> I read the whole book already
<javaguy> do I?
<jcater> python guys?
<chillywilly> I don't know of anyone else implementing it
<jcater> we have python guys?
<chillywilly> we are probably going to implement it
<chillywilly> (I hope)
<chillywilly> we'll see
<javaguy> that'd be you, jcater ;)
<chillywilly> heh, geas people == python guys now
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> sigh
<chillywilly> the current app server is going bye bye
<dneighbo> i vote the button (i like ike)
<dneighbo> s
<jcater> actually, I'm ready to get the ball rolling w/geas
<dneighbo> as
<dneighbo> "I give a Poop about OOP"
<jcater> rofl
<dneighbo> or like woody the owl says
<chillywilly> hehe
<dneighbo> give a poop
<dneighbo> use oop
<jcater> I get my Kix
<jcater> using WX
<chillywilly> jcater: hack on gnurpc some more den ;)
<jcater> gnurpc isn't the geas hangup, dude
<jcater> we need a file format
<chillywilly> odl!
<dneighbo> jcater: lets use the kiss anthem 'lets put the X in wx'
<chillywilly> :P
<jcater> :)
Action: chillywilly os obssessed with ODMG
<jcater> fwiw
<chillywilly> muuuwahahahah
<jcater> I think we need an "appserver" directory in cvs
<jcater> under gnue/
<dneighbo> we had one
<chillywilly> 10-4 that good buddy
<jcater> to house the new appserver :)
<dneighbo> it got renamed geas
<chillywilly> I agree
<jcater> why?
<chillywilly> heheh
<jcater> oh, why?
<dneighbo> um why did the old dir used to be called gnuef?
<chillywilly> well reinhard said that's what he wanted to name it
<chillywilly> it was called objectserver
<chillywilly> not appserver ;)
<chillywilly> I saw it
<dneighbo> chillywilly: ah yes you are correct it was object server not app server
<jcater> I just don't think 'geas' fits with the naming scheme
<jcater> "GNUe GEAS?"
<jcater> but, whatever :)
<jcater> I was thinking we'd leave the existing tree there
<jcater> for reference
<javaguy> So, are we going forward with the WSDL?
<jcater> eh?
<jcater> I'd imagine gnurpc would eventually expose that
<chillywilly> is WDSL like a common way to describe what operations are exposed?
<jcater> dudes!
<chillywilly> bah, I should just read it when I geta chance
<jcater> I already got a private email response
<dneighbo> yeah ted
<chillywilly> about what?
<jcater> from my post to the wx-dev group
<chillywilly> uh?
<chillywilly> oooh, nifty
<dneighbo> sorry 'bill and ted's excellent adventure flash backs'
<dneighbo> so share the response man
<jcater> Hi Jason,
<jcater> I saw your post on wx-dev. I wasn't aware of GNUe or that it was done in
<jcater> wxPython. Do you contribute to wxPython or subscribe to the wx-python users
<jcater> list? 
<javaguy> The way I've seen it used is mainly as a convenience for SOAP, but I see no reason why it can't be used in conjunction with other RPC mechanisms
<jcater> he's from the PythonCard project
<dneighbo> why does pythoncard sound familiar?
<chillywilly> javaguy: well they have other bindings there http, mime, etc. they say you can use any protocol right?
<chillywilly> I dunno, I'll let jcater worry abot it ;P
<javaguy> yes.  So long as you can transmit and receive XML docs
<chillywilly> me is just trying to immerse himself in odmg land
<chillywilly> woops
<chillywilly> me == /me
<jcater> ah
<jcater> so our report definitions could be SOAP
<chillywilly> funky-butt-lovin
<jcater> they could just be an encapsulated SOAP command
Action: jcater ducks from flying curses
<chillywilly> I have yet to get myself into the whole xml, soap, w3c craziness
<chillywilly> it's on my TODO
<javaguy> come on CW, it's fun! ;)
<chillywilly> I am sure it is
<chillywilly> I read the w3schools titorials
<chillywilly> some of them
<chillywilly> but if I don;t use it
<chillywilly> out the window it goes
<chillywilly> I forget it
<javaguy> The XP work group seems to be the most active.  I would start there
<chillywilly> XPath?
<javaguy> Lotsa cool stuff to read: XML Schema, XSLT, XML-RPC
<javaguy> XML Protocol
<chillywilly> yea, I want to read some of that stuff soon
<chillywilly> but I was in c++ land for a while
<chillywilly> and now odmg land
Action: chillywilly contributed some patched to gnu common c++
<chillywilly> er, patches
<chillywilly> the DOM looks interesting too
<javaguy> Oh, there's also a spec for using SOAP over NNTP...
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> you could also do SOAP over IIOAP via CORBA
<chillywilly> er, IIOP
<javaguy> yeah, I've heard they're working on a CORBA-SOAP bridge
<chillywilly> javaguy: you look at SOUP?
<chillywilly> gnome's SOAP thingy
<javaguy> No.  I haven't done too much w/ GNU Windows^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^HGNOME since I moved over to XFCE
<chillywilly> and KDE is not windows-like?
<nickr> ugh, xfce
<chillywilly> I think they are both a bit windowsish
<chillywilly> but then again windows didn't even invent the desktop idea
<chillywilly> they stole it
<chillywilly> so maybe we are all Xerox-like
<javaguy> didn't say it wasn't.  They're both rather bloated, but hey people must like them, or else they wouldn't be in active development
<chillywilly> the days of me using onyl a wm are over
<chillywilly> I just like my Gnoem
<chillywilly> er Gnome
<chillywilly> xfce is a desktop too isn't it?
<javaguy> I guess.  Depends on how you define 'desktop'
<javaguy> It has it's own file manager, and it has event sounds
<javaguy> It looks to be a CDE clone, if you've ever used Solaris
<chillywilly> KDE was/is supposed to be a CDE look-a-like
<chillywilly> or something
<javaguy> Not any version of CDE I've used
<javaguy> As you say, it looks more like windows
<nickr> xfce is faicrly similar to CDE
<chillywilly> well I dunno wtf CDE looks like
<chillywilly> solaris is going to Gnome anyway ;)
<javaguy> I'm running 2.7 at work.  Haven't seen 9.  Is it shipping w/ GNOME?
<chillywilly> I dunno when they are going to ship Gnome with it
<chillywilly> they are supposed to be switching to Gnome
<javaguy> Didn't they say that like a year ago?
<chillywilly> yea, but they are slow
<chillywilly> and Gnome 2 is late
<chillywilly> maybe they are waiting for Gnome 2
<chillywilly> who knows
<chillywilly> they are hacking on the ATK I think
<chillywilly> accessibility toolkit
<chillywilly> I think Sun is doing that
<nickr> yea
<nickr> Gnome 2 looks sweet
<chillywilly> so I hear
<chillywilly> I wish they would make some debs so I could try it out
<chillywilly> I don't have the space to compile it
<chillywilly> oh well it will just be that much more fun when it actually gets into debian
<nickr> wait for woody+1
<chillywilly> when do you think they will release woody?
<chillywilly> os that the release of woody you are talking about?
<chillywilly> s/os/id
<chillywilly> er, is
<nickr> I have no idea when woody will released
<nickr> probably in a few months
<chillywilly> what is woody+1?
<nickr> once woody is released a lot of new software wil go into sid I think.
<chillywilly> ok
<Mr_You> re
<Mr_You> for some reason my postgresql debian install won't do the encoding part
<Mr_You> g_encoding: undefined symbol: pg_char_to_encoding
<Mr_You> initdb: pg_encoding failed
<chillywilly> interesting
<Mr_You> any guesses?  
<Mr_You> g_encoding: undefined symbol: pg_char_to_encoding
<Mr_You>  /usr/lib/postgresql/bin/pg_encoding: relocation error: /usr/lib/postgresql/bin/p
<Mr_You> uggh
<Mr_You> in the reverse order
<Mr_You> I've tried different encoding specs and locales.. which only en_US and C are available for locale
<Mr_You> I'm assuming everyone elses has worked fine.. in fact, I use to have postgresql installed on this box.. not sure why I removed it

<ra3vat> jamest: hello
<jamest> hello
<ra3vat> jamest: how to downgrade cvs copy to say two days ago stage?
<ra3vat> forms stopped working with last (yesterday?) updates
<jamest> um
<jamest> forms updates?
Action: jamest hasn't checked his gnue mail in a week
<ra3vat> yes my copy of forms worked yesterday and not after today's update
<jamest> let me update here real quick
Action: jamest deperately wants to gnue again
<ra3vat> DB000:   File "/home/ds/cvs/gnue/gnue/forms/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/common/GParser.py", line 297, in characters
<ra3vat> DB000:     if isinstance(self.xmlStack[0],self.xmlMasqueradeNamespaceElements):
<ra3vat> DB000: TypeError: second argument must be a class
<jamest> sigh
<ra3vat> what?
<jamest> it's broke :)
<jamest> I'm commiting a fix
<jamest> ok, update and it should work
<jamest> seems some new feature used by reports isn't in forms yet so I added a simple check 
<jamest> not sure that the overall effect will be but "it works for me"
<ra3vat> checking out
<ra3vat> yes, now it works for me too
<nickr> ugh, its too early

<jcater> broked tha parser?
<jcater> "it works for me"
<dneighbo> must go
dneighbo (dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<ra3vat> jcater: works for me only after jamest's fix
<jamest> jcater: there is a ref to a self.xmlMasqueradeNamespaceElements that is only assigned in reports code
<jamest> so it bombed in forms
<jcater> how odd
<jcater> I tested that with several forms
<jcater> not sure when it broke
<jamest> try it w/ helloworld.gfd
<jamest> it's pretty easy to spot via glimpse
<ra3vat> i did with simple/form.gfd
<jamest> /home/jamest/cvs/gnue/common/src/GParser.py:     self.xmlMasqueradeNamespaceElements = None
<jamest> /home/jamest/cvs/gnue/common/src/GParser.py:     elif self.xmlMasqueradeNamespaceElements:
<jamest> /home/jamest/cvs/gnue/common/src/GParser.py:       object = self.xmlMasqueradeNamespaceElements(self.xmlStack[0])
<jamest> /home/jamest/cvs/gnue/common/src/GParser.py:       if self.xmlMasqueradeNamespaceElements and isinstance(self.xmlStack[0],self.xmlMasqueradeNamespaceElements):
<jamest> /home/jamest/cvs/gnue/reports/src/GRParser.py:     self.xmlMasqueradeNamespaceElements = GRLayout.GRPassThru
<jamest> in GRParser.py it's being assigned a class, nothing in GFParser did the same so the isinstance() failed as the second arg was set to None
<jcater> ok, I believe you :)
<jcater> but I swear I tested it w/several forms
<jcater> I must've rewritten that one if statement after testing
<jcater> I dunno
<jamest> i just wanted to you know what I did as I have no idea if i did the right thing

<dneighbo> Bonjour mon amis
<jbailey> Bonjour - Ca va?
<dneighbo> comment t'allez vous?
<dneighbo> comme ci comme ca 
<jcater> se habla gnue?
<dneighbo> oui
<dneighbo> je parle gnue
<dneighbo> GNUe est tres chic.
<jcater> GNUe est tres headache.
<dneighbo> Il vous donnera un grand penis!
<jbailey> Le gnue-viagra-a-l'herbe!
<SachaS> headache = mal à la tete
<dneighbo> parce que c'est si bon
<SachaS> GNUe c'est commme une voiture sans moteur
<SachaS> sorry guys
<dneighbo> merde a la tete explains gnue developers eh :)
<jbailey> dneighbo: Et l'alcool pour le sens..  (How do you spell blood again?)
<jbailey> sengs?
<jbailey> Hmm
<jbailey> Ca fait trop long depuis que j'ecris.
<dneighbo> its been so long since i spoke/wrote french 
<dneighbo> i shoudl start more often
<dneighbo> er practice
<dneighbo> les femmes aiment les hommes qui utilisent le gnue
<dneighbo> jcater that should be our 'pitch'
<dneighbo> women love men that use gnue :)
<SachaS> sorry guys about my comment. according to the homepage of gnue it is an erp system with which you can do hr, finance, supply chain management etc etc but there is so much missing.... it will take much more time.
<dneighbo> years
<SachaS> thanks dneighbo and i though i am mean :)
<jbailey> SachaS: "erp".
<jbailey> Like when you try to use it, your tend to yell erp, and throw your computer out the window?
<dneighbo> i think your statement was a lie though
<dneighbo> didnt it say
<dneighbo> its like a car with out a motor?
<SachaS> yes.
<dneighbo> it should read its like a motor w/o a car
<SachaS> :)
<dneighbo> what exactly are you looking for SachaS ?
<dneighbo> i.e. i really really want to get some gnue apps out the door
<dneighbo> even if they are not the 'official' n-tier spec
<dneighbo> i have a commitment to getting some stuff done for ToyMan 
<dneighbo> and i have some stuff im doing for client of mine
<dneighbo> and we might have some contact manager stuff coming down the road
<dneighbo> and i have lots of todos for DCL/GNUe
<dneighbo> but 
<dneighbo> i really am willing to start and try to coddle things people need
<dneighbo> that are willing to participate
<dneighbo> i.e. test and actually use in production
<dneighbo> all i can is last night
<SachaS> dneighbo: i wanted to use it for some simple tests.
<dneighbo> forms over 'ssh tunnel' saved me countless hours and was an utter god send
<dneighbo> it just ROCKS
<SachaS> dneighbo: i tried to install it on debian testing without success because of python stuff. I guess i got the designer running but did not try to create pages. MUST give it another try.
<SachaS> dneighbo: finance. simple account with add and minux (activa and passiva). i guess it just gets bloody compilcated fast ...
<dneighbo> SachaS are you looking to use this or just want to play?
<dneighbo> installing on debian testing shoudl be really quick
<dneighbo> what was the hang up ?
<SachaS> dneighbo: Primarly play, i guess. python-orb or python-something. was about 2 months ago.
<dneighbo> i think you just
<dneighbo> apt-get install libwxgtk2.2-python (wehre 2.2 is what ever version in testing)
<dneighbo> it will install python for you
<dneighbo> and other dependencies
<dneighbo> since you no longer need pyxml
<dneighbo> thats it
<dneighbo> then just get cvs tree
<dneighbo> and from root of cvs tree run
<dneighbo> ./setup-cvs (or something)
<dneighbo> its only setup file there
<dneighbo> and voila you are done (w/o db access)
<dneighbo> if you want db access
<dneighbo> apt-get install postgres (whatever the name is)
<dneighbo> apt-get install psycopg
<SachaS> :)
<dneighbo> and edit your config file and done
<SachaS> i know it is all easy :)
<SachaS> its 01.30 am here so I will not do it now. another day.
<SachaS> to run an erp system would be bloody great! 
<SachaS> dneighbo: i wrote a report about ebxml and mentioned gnue in there. if you want you can have a look at it at ttp://www.openebxml.org/information/papers/papers.html (Student paper by Sascha)
<SachaS> http://www.openebxml.org/information/papers/papers.html 
<SachaS> good night.

<dneighbo> jcater you here?
<dneighbo> actually anyone have an idea for a new poll?
<jbailey> "spoon" "fork" ?
<dneighbo> fork
<dneighbo> spoons are obsolete
<dneighbo> i REALLY do not understand the concept of a spoon
<dneighbo> if its so liquid that you cant use fork
<dneighbo> drink it from the container (duh)

<javaguy> hey jbailey.  Long time no see
<jbailey> Heya javaguy!
<javaguy> K4rbonk|0: I know GNUe's been used in production in quite a few different environments
<javaguy> Not sure what sort of point-of-sales support has been developed (or even what would be required)
<K4rbonk|0> javaguy: you mean big business... can you suggest me something for a little shop?
<javaguy> mainly small to midsized business, in place of Access/QuickBooks/Peachtree
<javaguy> most of the big shops tend to stick with the commercial ERP systems (so far...)
<dtm> hi all
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: it is intended to be fully scalable like javaguy says
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: also there is a company called http://appgen.com if you need something more specific which gnue may not have completed yet.
<K4rbonk|0> okay thanks to all :)
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: i suggest them because they use open standards such as SQL and java, so we can interoperate with them eventually :)
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: but you should stick around and ask the gnue experts
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: dont leave without fully investigating it
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: or email info@gnue.org with your specs
<K4rbonk|0> oh this is a great idea!
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: gnue's team is willing to adjust priorities to users' needs
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: so i encourage you to know your specs and features that you need, in any case, and send them to the gnue core team and see how much is already complete, or if there's a short term common interest.
<K4rbonk|0> okay i'll surely do it.. i think this project is very interesting... .NET? bbuuuaaahh!!! :))
<dtm> hahah
<dtm> agreed
<K4rbonk|0> :)
<dtm> yes and gnue has a sufficiently mature core that it's being used in production already
<dtm> the designers are quite wizardly
<K4rbonk|0> great! i'm a proud linux user!
<dtm> so it's not like it's _onlY_ set to be used by a specific audience
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: yes , so are we!  glad to meet you :)
<K4rbonk|0> me too!!! yeah!!!! :) f#ck m$!!!
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: you'll wanna talk to people like chillywilly, derek (aka dneighbo), mdean, jamest, nickr, etc
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: hahaha
<dtm> there are those who would say that ;>
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: info@gnue.org will surely reach everyone
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: derek is the project manager
<dtm> the head one, anyway
<K4rbonk|0> f#ck every rubbish .dll .vxd file in my pc years ago!
