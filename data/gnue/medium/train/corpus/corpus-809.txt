<dtm> dneighbo: dude.  i'm getting a glimpse from your conversation here, of a problme you're having with FSF
<dtm> dneighbo: am I correct in understanding that there is some need internal to FSF operations for which gnue is or could be suitable for, and they won't use it?  or is that one related to your workplace?

<ra3vat> jamest: how to downgrade cvs copy to say two days ago stage?
<ra3vat> forms stopped working with last (yesterday?) updates
<jamest> um
<jamest> forms updates?
Action: jamest hasn't checked his gnue mail in a week
<ra3vat> yes my copy of forms worked yesterday and not after today's update
<jamest> let me update here real quick
Action: jamest deperately wants to gnue again
<ra3vat> DB000:   File "/home/ds/cvs/gnue/gnue/forms/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/common/GParser.py", line 297, in characters
<ra3vat> DB000:     if isinstance(self.xmlStack[0],self.xmlMasqueradeNamespaceElements):
<ra3vat> DB000: TypeError: second argument must be a class
<jamest> sigh
<ra3vat> what?
<jamest> it's broke :)
<jamest> I'm commiting a fix
<jamest> ok, update and it should work
<jamest> seems some new feature used by reports isn't in forms yet so I added a simple check 
<jamest> not sure that the overall effect will be but "it works for me"
<ra3vat> checking out
<ra3vat> yes, now it works for me too
<nickr> ugh, its too early

<dneighbo> its jcaters fault he broke the parser
<dneighbo> at least thats what junior says
<jcater> broked tha parser?
<jcater> "it works for me"
<dneighbo> must go
dneighbo (dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<ra3vat> jcater: works for me only after jamest's fix
<jamest> jcater: there is a ref to a self.xmlMasqueradeNamespaceElements that is only assigned in reports code
<jamest> so it bombed in forms
<jcater> how odd
<jcater> I tested that with several forms
<jcater> not sure when it broke
<jamest> try it w/ helloworld.gfd
<jamest> it's pretty easy to spot via glimpse
<ra3vat> i did with simple/form.gfd
<jamest> /home/jamest/cvs/gnue/common/src/GParser.py:     self.xmlMasqueradeNamespaceElements = None
<jamest> /home/jamest/cvs/gnue/common/src/GParser.py:     elif self.xmlMasqueradeNamespaceElements:

<jamest> /home/jamest/cvs/gnue/common/src/GParser.py:       if self.xmlMasqueradeNamespaceElements and isinstance(self.xmlStack[0],self.xmlMasqueradeNamespaceElements):
<jamest> /home/jamest/cvs/gnue/reports/src/GRParser.py:     self.xmlMasqueradeNamespaceElements = GRLayout.GRPassThru
<jamest> in GRParser.py it's being assigned a class, nothing in GFParser did the same so the isinstance() failed as the second arg was set to None
<jcater> ok, I believe you :)
<jcater> but I swear I tested it w/several forms
<jcater> I must've rewritten that one if statement after testing
<jcater> I dunno
<jamest> i just wanted to you know what I did as I have no idea if i did the right thing

<dneighbo> Bonjour mon amis
<jbailey> Bonjour - Ca va?
<dneighbo> comment t'allez vous?
<dneighbo> comme ci comme ca 
<jcater> se habla gnue?
<dneighbo> oui
<dneighbo> je parle gnue
<dneighbo> GNUe est tres chic.
<jcater> GNUe est tres headache.
<dneighbo> Il vous donnera un grand penis!
<jbailey> Le gnue-viagra-a-l'herbe!
<SachaS> headache = mal à la tete
<dneighbo> parce que c'est si bon
<SachaS> GNUe c'est commme une voiture sans moteur
<SachaS> sorry guys
<dneighbo> merde a la tete explains gnue developers eh :)
<jbailey> dneighbo: Et l'alcool pour le sens..  (How do you spell blood again?)
<jbailey> sengs?
<jbailey> Hmm
<jbailey> Ca fait trop long depuis que j'ecris.
<dneighbo> its been so long since i spoke/wrote french 
<dneighbo> i shoudl start more often
<dneighbo> er practice
<dneighbo> les femmes aiment les hommes qui utilisent le gnue
<dneighbo> jcater that should be our 'pitch'
<dneighbo> women love men that use gnue :)
<SachaS> sorry guys about my comment. according to the homepage of gnue it is an erp system with which you can do hr, finance, supply chain management etc etc but there is so much missing.... it will take much more time.
<dneighbo> years
<SachaS> thanks dneighbo and i though i am mean :)
<jbailey> SachaS: "erp".
<jbailey> Like when you try to use it, your tend to yell erp, and throw your computer out the window?
<dneighbo> i think your statement was a lie though
<dneighbo> didnt it say
<dneighbo> its like a car with out a motor?
<SachaS> yes.
<dneighbo> it should read its like a motor w/o a car
<SachaS> :)
<dneighbo> what exactly are you looking for SachaS ?
<dneighbo> i.e. i really really want to get some gnue apps out the door
<dneighbo> even if they are not the 'official' n-tier spec
<dneighbo> i have a commitment to getting some stuff done for ToyMan 
<dneighbo> and i have some stuff im doing for client of mine
<dneighbo> and we might have some contact manager stuff coming down the road
<dneighbo> and i have lots of todos for DCL/GNUe
<dneighbo> but 
<dneighbo> i really am willing to start and try to coddle things people need
<dneighbo> that are willing to participate
<dneighbo> i.e. test and actually use in production
<dneighbo> all i can is last night
<SachaS> dneighbo: i wanted to use it for some simple tests.
<dneighbo> forms over 'ssh tunnel' saved me countless hours and was an utter god send
<dneighbo> it just ROCKS
<SachaS> dneighbo: i tried to install it on debian testing without success because of python stuff. I guess i got the designer running but did not try to create pages. MUST give it another try.
<SachaS> dneighbo: finance. simple account with add and minux (activa and passiva). i guess it just gets bloody compilcated fast ...
<dneighbo> SachaS are you looking to use this or just want to play?
<dneighbo> installing on debian testing shoudl be really quick
<dneighbo> what was the hang up ?
<SachaS> dneighbo: Primarly play, i guess. python-orb or python-something. was about 2 months ago.
<dneighbo> i think you just
<dneighbo> apt-get install libwxgtk2.2-python (wehre 2.2 is what ever version in testing)
<dneighbo> it will install python for you
<dneighbo> and other dependencies
<dneighbo> since you no longer need pyxml
<dneighbo> thats it
<dneighbo> then just get cvs tree
<dneighbo> and from root of cvs tree run
<dneighbo> ./setup-cvs (or something)
<dneighbo> its only setup file there
<dneighbo> and voila you are done (w/o db access)
<dneighbo> if you want db access
<dneighbo> apt-get install postgres (whatever the name is)
<dneighbo> apt-get install psycopg
<SachaS> :)
<dneighbo> and edit your config file and done
<SachaS> i know it is all easy :)
<SachaS> its 01.30 am here so I will not do it now. another day.
<SachaS> to run an erp system would be bloody great! 
<SachaS> dneighbo: i wrote a report about ebxml and mentioned gnue in there. if you want you can have a look at it at ttp://www.openebxml.org/information/papers/papers.html (Student paper by Sascha)
<SachaS> http://www.openebxml.org/information/papers/papers.html 
<SachaS> good night.

<dneighbo> jcater you here?
<dneighbo> actually anyone have an idea for a new poll?
<jbailey> "spoon" "fork" ?
<dneighbo> fork
<dneighbo> spoons are obsolete
<dneighbo> i REALLY do not understand the concept of a spoon
<dneighbo> if its so liquid that you cant use fork
<dneighbo> drink it from the container (duh)

<K4rbonk|0> please, do you know if gnue can be implemented in a small shop? does it interact with a cash register?
<javaguy> CW: you know who's in charge of the various packages (e.g., Base, Supply Chain, etc) ?

<javaguy> hey jbailey.  Long time no see
<jbailey> Heya javaguy!
<javaguy> K4rbonk|0: I know GNUe's been used in production in quite a few different environments
<javaguy> Not sure what sort of point-of-sales support has been developed (or even what would be required)
<K4rbonk|0> javaguy: you mean big business... can you suggest me something for a little shop?
<javaguy> mainly small to midsized business, in place of Access/QuickBooks/Peachtree
<javaguy> most of the big shops tend to stick with the commercial ERP systems (so far...)
<dtm> hi all
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: it is intended to be fully scalable like javaguy says
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: also there is a company called http://appgen.com if you need something more specific which gnue may not have completed yet.
<K4rbonk|0> okay thanks to all :)
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: i suggest them because they use open standards such as SQL and java, so we can interoperate with them eventually :)
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: but you should stick around and ask the gnue experts
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: dont leave without fully investigating it
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: or email info@gnue.org with your specs
<K4rbonk|0> oh this is a great idea!
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: gnue's team is willing to adjust priorities to users' needs
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: so i encourage you to know your specs and features that you need, in any case, and send them to the gnue core team and see how much is already complete, or if there's a short term common interest.
<K4rbonk|0> okay i'll surely do it.. i think this project is very interesting... .NET? bbuuuaaahh!!! :))
<dtm> hahah
<dtm> agreed
<K4rbonk|0> :)
<dtm> yes and gnue has a sufficiently mature core that it's being used in production already
<dtm> the designers are quite wizardly
<K4rbonk|0> great! i'm a proud linux user!
<dtm> so it's not like it's _onlY_ set to be used by a specific audience
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: yes , so are we!  glad to meet you :)
<K4rbonk|0> me too!!! yeah!!!! :) f#ck m$!!!
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: you'll wanna talk to people like chillywilly, derek (aka dneighbo), mdean, jamest, nickr, etc
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: hahaha
<dtm> there are those who would say that ;>
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: info@gnue.org will surely reach everyone
<dtm> K4rbonk|0: derek is the project manager
<dtm> the head one, anyway
<K4rbonk|0> f#ck every rubbish .dll .vxd file in my pc years ago!
<dtm> hehehe
<dtm> sounds like you're devoted.
<K4rbonk|0> an dnow the penguin is on my iMac... Mac Os X? microkernel thing.... bad..
