<reinhard> derek: is it possible to remove geas tarballs from the download section?
<nickr> reinhard: the second scariest of all #gnue people
<reinhard> nickr: lol
<derek> um yeah it would be possible
<reinhard> nickr: who is #1 ?
<derek> would be nice to get it out of cvs some how too
<nickr> that'd be chillywilly
<derek> well i would like to keep it in cvs just somewhere where it doesnt get downloaded with cvs update or cvs co of gnue
<derek> only to lessen the bloat of cvs (i would like to have docs be separate module as well)

<reinhard> derek: for now i added some comments to README and autogen.sh that one shouldn't try to build this program
<reinhard> my concern is not primarly bloat of cvs but the regular questions about libuuid we get on the gnue-dev list
<derek> correct

<Chipaca> jcater or jamest: which one of you (i forget) worked on conditions?
StyXman (~mdione@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<StyXman> whatever suits you, a good one of those
<StyXman> how do I 'connect' to 'hear' for an event?
<StyXman> e.g., I want to know when the result-sets change.
<StyXman> halo?
<yogurt2unge> hello StyXman
<StyXman> hi yog.
<yogurt2unge> all people are sleeping.... same to me
<StyXman> yo!
<StyXman> shite. ok gone to study, anyways.
<Chipaca> anyone here?
<jamest> I'm here
<jamest> sorta
<jamest> anyone here now that is non-US location?
<jamest> s/is/is at a/
<jamest> could you visit https://www.math.ksu.edu at check the security settings
<jamest> and let me know if it's a 128 Cert or if it downgrades to 40bit?
<jamest> StyXman: i swear there is a registerListener method
<jamest> i'll have to dig in to check that though
<Chipaca> jamest: i'll check
<Chipaca> jamest: however mozilla does 128 (supposdly)
<Chipaca> jamest: it fell back to the http version
<Chipaca> i.e. no encryption
<jcater> Chipaca: can you try https://www.math.ksu.edu/main/
<jcater> (he has a redirect on the link he gave you)
<Chipaca> jcater: checking
<Chipaca> jcater: the images aren't on the https server
<Chipaca> or something isn't
<Chipaca> (got the warning thing)
<Chipaca> I get 'Security level: Broken', whatever that means :)
<jamest> ok
<jamest> thanks
<jamest> checking my ssl cert to see how it handled non-US encryption
<Chipaca> but it's 128 encryption
<Chipaca> s/8/8-bit/
<jamest> broken 128-bit encryption even :)
<jamest> that's one l33t h@x0r rig you have there to auto-break it 
<Chipaca> is there a 'cleaner' way to query the value of a field in the current recordset other than <datasource>._object._currentResultSet.current.getField('<field>')
<Chipaca> ?
<Chipaca> yeap
<jamest> via a trigger?
<Chipaca> no, it says broken because some content isn't encrypted i.e. the base html is, but some of the stuff in the age isn't
<Chipaca> jamest: yes, in a trigger
<Chipaca> i mean there are too many _'s in that
<jamest> not that I recall
<jamest> but
<Chipaca> "You have requested an encrypted page that contains some unencrypted information. Information that you see or enter on this page could easily be read by a third party"
<Chipaca> that's the 'broken' bit
<jamest> it would be easy to extend the trigger namespace
<jamest> and I did add a simpleQuery() to it 
<Chipaca> jamest: what's simpleQuery() for, what are its semantics i mean, and is there an equivalent of (yadda yadda).setField()
<jamest> that returns a a list of dictionaries
Action: Chipaca is hacking a button to behave like a checkbox
<jamest> based upon a query mask
<jamest> we need to just fix the !@#!@ checkboxes :)
<jamest> biggest problem there is how to handle queries
<Chipaca> jamest: in checkboxes?
<jamest> as a checkbox needs three states in a query
<Chipaca> checked/unchecked/dunno?
<Chipaca> would it help if it weren't a <entry>?
<Chipaca> also, checkboxes work in the query part, it seems to be the UI<=>data bid that fais
<Chipaca> I mean, it displays whether the database has a 'y' or 'n' correctly with a check or no check
<Chipaca> and I can change it from checked to unchecked no problem
<Chipaca> it's that checkin/unchecking that never reaches the data
<Chipaca> i don't know where to look for that :(
<Chipaca> StyXman would probably know...
<Chipaca> nope, he doesn't

<Chipaca> dneighbo: that probably didn't help his hacker skills
<Chipaca> ouch
<dneighbo> and within an hour his son had another siezure

<Chipaca> I thought maybe it'd mean something to somebody :)

<Chipaca> if it were *my* work, I wouldn't let the boss bully me into doing [:], either
<Chipaca> :)

<dneighbo> Chipaca but : is a slice
<dneighbo> i will gladly let the boss 'slice' my work into pieces (as long as i dont have to pick them all up) ;)

<Chipaca> ROTFL, here she is
Action: Chipaca pokes at it
<Chipaca> why does a click on a checkbox call setValue *twice* ?
<dneighbo> um  why complain?  we dont chare per setValue ;)
<dneighbo> s/chare/charge
<Chipaca> dneighbo: because it's unnecessary flicker?
<Chipaca> dneighbo: slows down stuff pointlessly?
<Chipaca> dneighbo: doesn't let me just toggle the thing in the setvalue every time sbody clicks?
<Chipaca> :)
<jamest> because sometimes a checkbox is stubborn and we have to double up the smackdowns to keep it in line?
<jamest> sounds like a bug to me
<Chipaca> in fact, AFAICT, setValue is called twice on all things
<Chipaca> well, at least updateEntry is called twice
