Action: chillywilly just recently learned that the company he worksd for that the senior corporate counsel stole $35 million and another Board member stole $20 million and the CEO resigned and is being investigated
<siesel> quite well, just that appserver makes me headakes
<chillywilly> why?
<chillywilly> what do you think about doing an ml markup of ODL?
<chillywilly> er, xml
<siesel> hmmm, I don't think thats necessary.
<chillywilly> so just use straight ODL?
<siesel> is it a standart ? 
<chillywilly> yea
<siesel> so why not use it :)
<chillywilly> Object Definition Language
<siesel> I think we should take the things we need to create our own XML format
<chillywilly> why our own format?
<ariel_> hi siesel
<chillywilly> well I think we should support ODL and ODLML
<siesel> because .... 
<siesel> ODLML?
<chillywilly> markup lang
<chillywilly> XML
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> because mr. mueller wants to have a non-xml format, IIRC
<chillywilly> also
<siesel> mr. r. mueller?
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> that be the guy
<chillywilly> ;)
<siesel> I just think that it is easier (for the first step) to have an own XML format, which is quite similar to the internal appserver structures
<chillywilly> what internak appserver structures?
<chillywilly> internal
<siesel> the (still has to come) class definitions
<chillywilly> HEH
<siesel> the (still has to come) method definitions
<chillywilly> how do you base your own format on something that does not exist?

<ariel_> i proposed to reinhard a document to serve as base for discussion on this matter
Action: chillywilly hacks on the sol called architecture document
<chillywilly> s/sol/so
<ariel_> it does a comparison of features to put in appserver in :
<ariel_> 1. "old" gfd
<ariel_> 2. xml
<chillywilly> gcd you mean?
<ariel_> 3. what actually is in the DB
<jcater> where is this document?
<chillywilly> we already have 3
<ariel_> 4. representation in DIA/UML
<chillywilly> and we had 1
<ariel_> i did just half and emaled to reinhard, waiting for his response if to go on

<chillywilly> I don't have much time to poke back through things again as I am madly hacking away at some gnu common c++ stuff...I have to get something released soon or die trying
<dneighbo> sigh im never here for good converstations
<dneighbo> i think it should be mandatory our gcd is xml
<siesel> :)
<dneighbo> as from xml we can make it ANYTHING else easily
<chillywilly> XSLT is cool
<chillywilly> I was playign with it the other for a change
<chillywilly> other day
<ariel_> dneighbo:i pointed yet to reinhard that some kind of sinchronization 
<siesel> yes, the basic format for the new 'gcd's should be XML, the big negative point of odl and the old gcd format is that the method code has to be separatly defined
<ariel_> between the new (say xml) and the old gcd can be useful
<siesel> cw: am I right about odl?
<chillywilly> right about what?
<ariel_> since it is possible to write some kind of gcd2xml tool
<ariel_> and save all the neil work
<chillywilly> well I don't think his work will be lost just because we switched formats
<dneighbo> well i still go back to fact that remote methods(triggers) and normal db 
<dneighbo> wuold be HUGE
<dneighbo> to start with
<chillywilly> someone (me?) would be willing to convert it
<dneighbo> and if you look at current 'gcd' they are not method code
<dneighbo> but basically property code
<siesel> not quite right: there is ONE full coded method in there ;)
<chillywilly> so the idea is to include the method code in the object description?
<chillywilly> does this rule out supporting other languages in a decent way?
<siesel> I would prefer that
<jcater> I think the idea is to just get method code out there
<jcater> regardless of an object description :)
<dneighbo> currently i say object isnt part of the picture
<dneighbo> again i cant stress enough
<dneighbo> how useful REMOTE TRIGGER code would be
<dneighbo> not bound to any data structure
<dneighbo> read no object
<chillywilly> so basically pull triggers out of db (or forms in our case)
<dneighbo> yes 
<chillywilly> ok
<dneighbo> that was one of the MAIN requirements i had listed
<dneighbo> basically what that gives us is xplatform db triggers
<siesel> dneighbo: but this triggers, at which time would they be triggered?
<chillywilly> when th form fires them
<dneighbo> im not against object to relational mappers in any way shape or form, but i want best bang for buck
<chillywilly> I would think
<dneighbo> siesel forms fires them or they fire each other
<chillywilly> oh you want the appserver to work in a non OO way also?
<dneighbo> i.e. a form/report/navigator can initiate a trigger
<dneighbo> or a trigger can navigate a trigger
<ariel_> i think that an object method description most contain only the method signature and eventually a pointer to the code
<chillywilly> I agree that objects do add complexity
<ariel_> the code is elsewhere
<chillywilly> so I see what you mean mr. cater even if you like to poke fun at me
<dneighbo> im talking speed of implementation and bang for buck
<dneighbo> if we do remote triggers/ remote db
<dneighbo> we are n-tier as advertised
<dneighbo> and gain the benefits from there
<dneighbo> er that
<siesel> dneighbo: so you think about a table appserver.triggers which can be called by forms.
<dneighbo> i still think there is immense value to object/relational mapping and such
<chillywilly> that would be putting the triggers in the db
<chillywilly> a 2-tier deal
<chillywilly> imho
<dneighbo> siesel im not sure what table appserver.triggers means?
<dneighbo> triggers should not be bound to tables
<dneighbo> i havent thought too hard on implementation
<siesel> I mean all triggers are stored in a datastructure (i.e. in the database, i.e. in a table)
<chillywilly> i see what you mean though dneighbo, you want to pull the logic into a middle layer
<siesel> and if a form wants to call a trigger it calls it
<chillywilly> right?
<siesel> I just think, that if you want a trigger bound to a special event like table person-setField(name) we can directly handle that table as an object and make that setField a method 
<chillywilly> so basically appserver would need to know something about the forms definition right? assuming you keep the trigger declarations in the gfd

ariel_ (~ariel@ppp-217-133-243-122.dialup.tiscali.it) left #gnuenterprise ("Uscita dal client").
<jcater> chillywilly: but you wouldn't have the triggers in the gfd at that point
<jcater> if I understand correctly
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> err, the triggers wouldn't be defined there
<chillywilly> so the form would use the exposed services of grpc?
<jcater> the form would access triggers via the common "appserver" driver
<jcater> which would use grpc
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> a gfd wouldn't use grpc
<chillywilly> I get it
<dneighbo> im thinking that in a form, report, navigator you could define 'modules' 
<^chewie> ugh
<^chewie> can't get triggers to do anything w/release 0.3
<siesel> jcater, dneighbo: to ask again: you mean, that the trigger in appserver should do the same as triggers in postgres f.e., right?

<chillywilly> some day I will freakin
<chillywilly> convert an app to use forms
<chillywilly> I need 36 hour days
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<siesel> ok, i.e. using an XML db table/trigger definition like the one in the DCL tree, it should be possible to create A) postgres tables (with postgres triggers) B) appserver + triggers + tables in any kind of supported database

<jcater> that I typed in the wrong window
<jcater> yeah, that's it
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> can't be as entertaining as some of andrewm's comments in the old geas
<siesel> jcater: how do you think, that trigger should work in appserver (if they shouldn't be db-level triggers), can you give an example?
<chillywilly> ;)
<siesel> you should look into the python adapter code of entity (www.entity.cx)
<dneighbo> siesel i meant trigger replace db trigger concept
<siesel> ... <Slow> py_enode_mapping_ass_subscript(PyEnodeObject *self, PyObject *key, ...
<dneighbo> not be db level triggers
<dneighbo> im thinking in the client you define 'trigger' spaces to import
<dneighbo> or include
<dneighbo> then you can call triggers in those spaces
<dneighbo> so say i have string manipulation methods i have in strings.py
<dneighbo> or such
<dneighbo> er string.xml
<dneighbo> lets be more practical
<dneighbo> i have bank account methods
^chewie (~chewie@flemingi.dsl.visi.com) left irc: "leaving"
<dneighbo> so i ahve accounts.xml (gcd) whatever
<dneighbo> and i have a trigger
<dneighbo> isValid(AccountNumber)
<dneighbo> or such in it
<dneighbo> in forms or what not some import/include exists to name that i want to use accounts
<dneighbo> then i can call this trigger by accounts.isValid
<dneighbo> sigh i dont communicate this kind of stuff well over irc
<siesel> i.e. if you have access to the gfd, or the forms client source code you can switch off triggers and directly write to the db, right?
<dneighbo> ???
<dneighbo> i dont think triggers should be tied to db at all
<dneighbo> i should be able to have a gfd that doesnt access a database
<dneighbo> that can use remote triggers
<dneighbo> actually just nix my comments on the subject
<dneighbo> i think im confusing you guys more than im helping
<dneighbo> i know what i want, but havent thought through the implementation :)
<siesel> I meant, if you seperate data and triggers on appserver level then you control the data flow on forms level by remote triggers which are called on forms level. 
<siesel> i.e. if you manipulate forms, the data flow isn't controlled anymore. i.e. not good.
<siesel> but this is an other problem.
Chipaca (~john@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> hi all
<siesel> if I understand you right you want to collect a heap of "methods" in a library which is stored remote, i.e. in the appserver
<dneighbo> personally i see data going remotely too
<siesel> btw. Heideger said that confusing helps understanding :)
<dneighbo> this was part of my problems with putting data functionality in blocks
<dneighbo> as my long term goal was that you would have 
<dneighbo> local datasources or remote datasources
<dneighbo> so in an n-tier application you would point your datasource to a remote datasource 
<jcater> as opposed to?
<nickr> a huge, ever growing brain at the center of the universe.
<siesel> ok, but if you have local and remote triggers, then in case of remote triggers you should distinguish between data bound triggers and gui bound triggers
<jcater> nickr: /me tries not to think of himself as the center of the universe
<jcater> wife thinks that's unhealthy
Action: siesel remebers reading something about the number of virtual calculation (on electron spin level)  done since the begin of univers
<nickr> teehee
<siesel> jcater: really, I feel quite well ;)
<nickr> http://www.angryflower.com/bobthe.gif
<nickr> jcater the robogalactic megabrain
<siesel> the databound ones should be invisible for the forms client, while the gui ones can be raised+executed localy or raised localy and executed remote
<chillywilly> heideger eh?
<chillywilly> the German existentialist?
<jcater> siesel: I'd tend to agree
<jcater> not sure if I'd call the latter "GUI" tho
