<drochaid> cool
<drochaid> I'm still waiting for aptitude to be fixed in woody :(
Action: chillywilly installs Open Office 1.0 ;)
<drochaid> YAY!!!!!
<drochaid> I'm doing a demo for some senior partners of a law firm on Thurs
<drochaid> phpGW and OOo
<chillywilly> no GNUe solution?
<chillywilly> ;)
<drochaid> if only!!
<chillywilly> that's probably going to be my first GNUe gig is writing some CRM software for a law firm
<chillywilly> my mom works for a law firm
<drochaid> give me a cash accounting solution certified to UK Solicitor requirements ... 
<drochaid> they're about to pay £10k [about $14k] for a software update plus £2k [$3k] a year maintenance
<chillywilly> give us some time ;)
<drochaid> they have till sept before their current maintenance agreement runs out
<drochaid> will a week be enough for you? ;)
<chillywilly> HEH
<chillywilly> 4 words
<chillywilly> show me the money ;)
<drochaid> hmm .. does ";)" count as a word? ;)
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> it's a facial expression via IRC ;P
<drochaid> seriously tho .. the UK has some *very* strict laws on cash accounting for solicitors ... a few companies have the market sewn up, and charge phenominal fees
<drochaid> even a GPL solution could make a LOT of money from the consultancy and support side and still provide a mamoth cost benefit to the user
<drochaid> so just the same as everything else GNUe will compete against ;)
<chillywilly> bummer deal dude
<chillywilly> IBM dropped their Linux support for thinkpads project
<drochaid> :o
<drochaid> feck, that's going to affect some of my friends still at IBM

<jcater> not I

Action: jcater is a little surprised that they have names for wildfires
<jcater> but I guess I shouldn't be

<dneighbo> 468sq miles
<dneighbo> if you figure a city block is 1mile square
<dneighbo> thats a darn big ass fire

<dneighbo> isnt that what i said
<dneighbo> divide acre by 640
