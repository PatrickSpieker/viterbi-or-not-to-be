<chillywilly> run the wizard
<chillywilly> choose that datasource it should make a couple widgets by default
<chillywilly> save the form

<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> sorry
<dneighbo> no introspection

<dneighbo> you can create forms by hand (ala no wizard)
<dneighbo> or 
<dneighbo> wait for mysql driver to be fixed
<dneighbo> or 
<chillywilly> with some modification
<dneighbo> install from source
<dneighbo> or
<dneighbo> switch db's
<dneighbo> there are lots of samples in forms/samples/
<chillywilly> http://frell.dyndns.org/my-first-form.gfd
<dneighbo> i would probably take one of those and just modify the .sql files to work with mysql
<dneighbo> and give them a whirl
<dneighbo> or use chilly's first form

<chillywilly> you just have to speak the lingo

<dneighbo> what is the problem?
Chipaca (~john@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<StyXman> uh, perlhead signed it. but it had my name.
<Chipaca> how do I get a tooltip?

<dneighbo> <option>

<dneighbo>         <options>
<dneighbo>           <option name="tip" value="This is the tip for the first text box"/>
<dneighbo>         </options>
<StyXman> we have a similar contract, but is signed by stallman instead of bradley kuhn
<dneighbo> in context
<StyXman> will this work, or should I ask for a new copy?
<dneighbo>       <entry name="text2" x="1" y="5" width="10">

<dneighbo>       </entry>
<dneighbo> im not sure i understand StyXman 
<Gedanken> uhm
<dneighbo> i think perlhead had one for your entire organization
<Gedanken> I think you guys abuse the whole attribute thing
<StyXman> ok, GNU fundation sent us a contract with our names on it, one per person.
<dneighbo> the ones you all got were individual
<Chipaca> dneighbo: I find that doesn't work
<dneighbo> we like to have both
<dneighbo> because then if you ever leave where you are working you can continue to work on gnue w/o signing no new paperwork
<StyXman> yes, but perlhead signed the one with my name.
<dneighbo> well smack him :)
<dneighbo> did he return it?
<dneighbo> the one with your name simply sign it as well
<dneighbo> if he hasnt returned it and all should be well
<StyXman> I would do so if he wasn't my cousin.
<dneighbo> Chipaca what kind of errors do you get
<Chipaca> dneighbo: none. no tooltip, either
<StyXman> but I don't have a signed one.
<dneighbo> Gedanken we abuse attributes yes, but we torture coders as well
<dneighbo> StyXman ?
<StyXman> I mean, I didn't signed anything because mine is spoiled.
<dneighbo> its not spoiled
<dneighbo> just cross out his name and sign yours
<dneighbo> i think it will be ok
<StyXman> has ph's sign and name
<StyXman> ah, sure?
<dneighbo> if not they can send you a new one
<dneighbo> i think it will be ok though
<dneighbo> as long as you signature is there
<StyXman> ho do I ask for a new one?
<dneighbo> in small print beside it just put
<dneighbo> <---- dumb cousin signed here on accident
<dneighbo> ;)
<dneighbo> j/k

<Chipaca> how current is the documentation? I mean wrt it mentioning "tooltip" as an attr of entries, whereas it isn't reckognized as such by GFParser
<Chipaca> i mean is it TODO or deprecated?
<dneighbo> not sure jcater or jamest would know
<dneighbo> it USED to work 
<dneighbo> a long time ago
<dneighbo> so either something new broke it or its been deprecated
<dneighbo> i assume its just broked and no one has reported it yet
<Chipaca> dneighbo: the tips as an option work, btw. my bad.
<stbain> dneighbo: the .sql scripts in that tarball... are they pgsql or the original mysql ones?
<dneighbo> ah if options work
<dneighbo> pgsql
<dneighbo> im converting to our xml markup
<stbain> pgsql conversions of the original mysql? or do I need to convert these back into mysql?
<dneighbo> so we can support any db
<dneighbo> yes pgsql conversion iirc
<stbain> ok... so I'll try the original MySQL sql scripts and give it a whirl
<dneighbo> if you do please add a GL account and let me know if you have problems
<dneighbo> i couldnt do that this morning
<dneighbo> but think some of the issues were pgsql issues
<dneighbo> but it will be nice to have someone with mysql able to test things :)
<stbain> ok
<dneighbo> Chipaca if options work then attr of entity is probably deprecated
<stbain> downloading the noguska stable tarball now... I'll fire it up and let you knwo

<drochaid> I've got a very very simple db I'm trying to GNUe up
<drochaid> just 7 tables
<dneighbo> i dont have a current cvs with me
<dneighbo> you have designer open
<drochaid> I can in a mo
<dneighbo> basically lets say you have 
<dneighbo> tableFoo
<dneighbo>  fooid
<dneighbo>   foodesc
<dneighbo>   foovalue
<dneighbo> and
<dneighbo> tableBar
<dneighbo>   barid
<dneighbo>   bardesc
<dneighbo>   fooid
<drochaid> ok
<dneighbo> its likely you are displaying tableBar
<dneighbo> and you want a dropdown box
<dneighbo> that shows you fooDesc from tableFoo
Action: Chipaca returns from the void
<dneighbo> and when you select it, it populates tableBar.fooid with tableFoo.fooid value
<dneighbo> no?
<Chipaca> che, has anyone seen jcater ?
<drochaid> yep
<drochaid> exactly that .. but with different names ;)
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> do you have a form currently that displays tableBar?
<dneighbo> if so open it up with designer
<drochaid> there
<dneighbo> if not use designer to run a wizard against it to make one
<drochaid> very basic so far
<dneighbo> go to field tableBar.fooid
<drochaid> one datasource, one field
<Chipaca> jcater: we need to speak to you.
<dneighbo> then go to property inspector 
<dneighbo> and go up and highlight datasources
<dneighbo> then right mouse click and chhoose add new datasource
<dneighbo> fill in its propertys
<dneighbo> database = whatever your connections file name for db is
<dneighbo> table = tableFoo
<dneighbo> then go to tableBar.fooid entry
<dneighbo> and open up property inspector change its type(style) to dropdown
<dneighbo> then go up to foreign key seciont
stbain (GunAndGiz@ip68-10-44-170.rn.hr.cox.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> in foreign key data source put name of datasource you just made
<dneighbo> in lookup/key put fooid
<dneighbo> in fk description put foodesc
<nickr> foood
<jcater> Chipaca: wassup?
<dneighbo> and that should be it
<jcater> not sure I'll be here for long
<dneighbo> all done
<jcater> but we can try
<dneighbo> sorry not giving better names, but dont have current cvs with new names
<Chipaca> jcater: we're needing a datasource that accesses multiple tables
Action: jcater gets nervous when ppl say "we need to talk"
aprono (~aprono@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> jcater: have you thought about that? if so, what?\
<dneighbo> as lookups used to only have two fields not three
<dneighbo> was before
<dneighbo> key = dtsrcName.fieldname
<dneighbo> desc = fieldname
<dneighbo> now it should be
<Chipaca> jcater: not a master-slave relation, it's a 1:1
Action: StyXman stays silent
<dneighbo> datasource = dtsrcName
<Chipaca> (inheritance)
<dneighbo> desc = fieldname
<dneighbo> key = fieldname
<jcater> Chipaca: yes and no
<dneighbo> drochaid hopefully i havent completely lost you
<jcater> yes, I've thought about it
<jcater> no, I don't have a solution yet
<jcater> argh!!!
<jcater> brb
<StyXman> shite
<Chipaca> jcater: we'll wait
<drochaid> dneighbo: I can't find lookup/key
<dneighbo> you are in dropdown entry property box?
<drochaid> yep
<dneighbo> should be fields named foreign_key....
<dneighbo> or fk....
<Chipaca> jcater: we're willing and able to do it, but you're the boss on that, if you could point us in any direction, else we'll just do it and run the risk of you not liking it
<drochaid> yep
<dneighbo> can you list all the properties that are foreign something for me?
<drochaid> just Foreign Key and Foreign Key D[that's all that shows of it]
<dneighbo> ok maybe he didnt make the changes
<dneighbo> what version are you running?
<dneighbo> 0.3.0?
<dneighbo> or cvs (and if cvs from when)
<dneighbo> in foreign key put dtsrName.fooid (where dtsrName is name of datasource you just created)
<drochaid> 0.3.0
<dneighbo> then in foreign_key_desc put foodesc
<dneighbo> and you should be good to go
<dneighbo> btw: 0.3.0 does it the old way (Which im used to) only cvs has new way (i thought you were using cvs) :)
<drochaid> k, done .. 
<drochaid> now to try
<dneighbo> WAIT
<dneighbo> go back to that datasource
<dneighbo> and make sure prequery is set to true
<drochaid> heh, I've still never found out how to work CVS ;)
<dneighbo> on datasource you just created :)
<drochaid> it is now
<drochaid> anything else?
<dneighbo> cool now let me know if it works
<drochaid> okies
<dneighbo> nope its really rather simple (just needs to be step by step documented)
<dneighbo> jcater: i got a cool fixture donated for our booth
<dneighbo> like 20x10 plexiglass picture frame holder that stands on its own with a brochure holder attached
Action: dneighbo needs to revisit our marketing guide
Action: jcater started to misread that
<dneighbo> and make trifolds again
Action: jcater read it as "like 20x10 plexiglass picture frame holder..." with a picture of dneighbo in it
<dneighbo> and then get something slick for the insert
<dneighbo> roflmao
Action: jcater was relieved to read the rest of that sentence
<jcater> Chipaca: give me a second
<jcater> I'm having an idea
Action: dneighbo gets nervous when he hears
<dneighbo> jcater we need to talk and jcaters reply is 'i have an idea'
<dneighbo> ;)
<drochaid> dneighbo: looks like it may work ... but I haven't setup all the fields that are needed to commit it yet :)
<drochaid> DOH!!!
<drochaid> just hashing them up as well
<dneighbo> but you get the desired result in the dropdown box?
<dneighbo> i.e. its populated as expected?
<Chipaca> jcater: ok
<jcater> ok
<jcater> I have two ideas
<jcater> <datasource type="join" name="dts1" table="table1,table2">
<jcater>   <condition>
<jcater>     <eq>
<jcater>       <field table="table1" name="pk1"/>
<jcater>       <field table="table2" name="pk2"/>
<jcater>     </eq>
<jcater>   </condition>
<jcater> </datasource>
<jcater> or perhaps
<jcater> <datasource type="join" name="dts1">
<dneighbo> hm isnt that called 'double vision'
<jcater>   <dtstable name="table1"/>
<jcater>   <dtstable name="table2"/>
<jcater>   <condition>
<jcater>     <eq>
<jcater>       <field table="table1" name="pk1"/>
<jcater>       <field table="table2" name="pk2"/>
<jcater>     </eq>
<jcater>   </condition>
<jcater> </datasource>
<jcater> those are the directions i'm leaning in
<jcater> dneighbo: what are your thoughts
<jcater> (and don't say "the app server will handle that")
<StyXman> jcater: well, we thought something similar to the first one, but without the type thing.
<dneighbo> i dont like the syntax
<Chipaca> jcater: we thought we wouldn't need the type
<Chipaca> because the name ("table1,table2") is easily reckognizable by a split
<jcater> dneighbo: in which way?
<dneighbo> why not do this in the db?
<dneighbo> why not make a 'view' or such
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> then use the view
<jcater> I have to do this in reporting all the time
<jcater> and to do a view each time is a biotch
<dneighbo> ok you sold me there
<jcater> and it's always slightly different
<drochaid> dneighbo: I love you!!! [take it any way you like ;P]
<Chipaca> dneighbo: views suck, didn't you know?
<dneighbo> Chipaca: depends on your point of views ;)
<StyXman> you can't ort views to all the db's
<StyXman> s/ort/port/
<dneighbo> jcater let me chew on the sytanx for a second
<dneighbo> i like the idea
<dneighbo> im not liking how tables are represented
<dneighbo> in the xml though
<jcater> dneighbo: nor am I
<jcater> but I'm trying to think of a better way and can't
<dneighbo> ok
<jcater> using conditions makes sense to me, though
<jcater> as sometimes the joins can be complex
<dneighbo> give me a second
<jcater> (i.e., not necessarily 1:1 field names)
<StyXman> I agree
<jcater> Chipaca: you are probably right that type="join" isn't necessary
<drochaid> dneighbo: any objection if I write that up as a noddy guide pending approval?
<Chipaca> we're just thinking natural joins here
<Chipaca> i.e. select foo from bar, baz where bar.id=bar.bar
<jcater> yip
yogurt2unge (~charlie@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> which maps nicely onto making the table a comma-separated thing, and conditions
<StyXman> jcater: do you think other kind of joins is right?
<StyXman> hi, yog
<dneighbo> drochaid works for me
<drochaid> cool
<yogurt2unge> hi StyXman
<dneighbo> ok was looking and i think i like your second sample better
<dneighbo> though i think i woudl just use table instead of dtstable
<dneighbo> for the name
<jcater> my only concern is, will any tools ever have a "table" tag?
<jcater> if you are satisfied they won't, then <table> is fine w/me
Action: jcater isn't decided yet
<stbain> dneighbo
<stbain> my Nola is up and running
Action: StyXman is spectant
<stbain> what is it you wanted me to do?
<dneighbo> st add a new gl account
<dneighbo> General LEdger -> Edit Accounts
<stbain> The requested URL /misc/glacctupd.php was not found on this server.
<Chipaca> jcater: if they do, then it probably means they explicitely don't support more than one table, no?
Action: psu is back
<stbain> but http://127.0.0.1/gl/glacctupd.php works
<jcater> Chipaca: I'm not sure which question you are answering ??
<stbain> might want to check the link on the main gl page
<Chipaca> jcater: "my only concern is..."
<dneighbo> stbain it works for me, so i think it must be a winders thign
<stbain> bad link
<stbain> points to misc and should point to gl
<stbain> anyhow
<stbain> I'm at the edit accounts screen
<dneighbo> jcater: point well taken maybe we avoid table HOWEVER if anything else is used with our xml wouldnt namespaces be used?
<dneighbo> at which point if we both had something called table would it matter?
<jcater> um
<Chipaca> jcater: if not, it would have to be <datasource><join bla bla/><table .../><table/></></>

<psu> KC is written in English English
<dneighbo> more i look at it i kind of like the first example for brevity but really dis like attribs with commas
<psu> as that's my native lang
<dneighbo> sigh i hate these kinds of choices
<dneighbo> we will be cruxified regardless :)
<dneighbo> psu :)
<jcater> dneighbo: I dislike the commas too
<jcater> from the standpoint that those limit us
<jcater> (i.e., with the other approach, inner joins, outer joins, etc could be hacked in using similar elements)
<jcater> but then again, they would be easy to implement
<Chipaca> jcater: ok, well do it this way:
<Chipaca> jcater: we'll use the commas for now, but ISAW that we'll be able to replace them with constructs such as above
<Chipaca> ok?\
<jcater> I'm ok with that
<jcater> that's been our approach in the past :)
<jcater> get something working
<jcater> then make it "proper" later on :)
<Chipaca> ok

<dneighbo> it shoudl give you a good idea
Action: jcater prefers not to think of dneighbo's ass falling off of him while he's rolling on the floor
<dneighbo> if you would like just convert a single table and run it through the processor or give to me and i will run though
<dneighbo> er through
<dneighbo> and we can go from there

<stbain> or not, as the case may be
Chipaca (~john@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> i thought it best we make the .sql stuff our custom xml that creates .sql for multi db's with xslt
<dneighbo> which means we have to make xml version of the create scripts and such
<stbain> ok
<dneighbo> i was pointing you to a sample xml script
<stbain> ahhh
<stbain> I understand now
<dneighbo> to use as 'documentation' on what to do :)
<chillywilly> do we have xml schema description language?
<stbain> however... it might be the filldata script, not the actual schema
<chillywilly> and if so where is it?
<dneighbo> was thinking if you converted a single table i would run it through xslt for you and we could see if were on right track
<dneighbo> chillywilly : yes we do its in dcl cvs
<chillywilly> oh, well a lot good it does there ;)
<chillywilly> j/k
<dneighbo> i think jan was moving it to common
<dneighbo> stbain only issue i see is its not table defs that probably are hurting you righ tnow, but rather the data
<dneighbo> and i dont think we have xml based 'insert' scripts
<dneighbo> jcater: you here
<dneighbo> on the nola stuff did you change any table structures for menus or just change the data in the tables
<stbain> dneighbo: select link from menufunction; gives me filename.php, not dir/filename.php
aprono (~aprono@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<dneighbo> i havent seen nola cvs
<dneighbo> does it separate table creation from data insertion?
<stbain> yes
<dneighbo> i.e. does it have more than one .sql file
<dneighbo> ok
<stbain> there's a database.sql and a filldata.sql
<dneighbo> drop the database
<dneighbo> create the database with nola script
<stbain> fill it w/ your filldata script?
<dneighbo> then use the data insertion script from acclite and see if that works
<stbain> ok
Action: dneighbo promises nothing, but i think 'inserts' are fairly standard so it should work
<chillywilly> insert is standard SQL
<stbain> yah... no error msgs 
<stbain> looks like it all took OK
<stbain> ahhhhhhhh
<stbain> much better
<dneighbo> wooooo
<stbain> and the icons showed up too

<Chipaca> nickr: did you try with yesterday's CVS?
<siesel> dneighbo: two questions: what about putting the xslt into common/utils/xml2sql/ ?
<siesel> and how should we solve xml2filldatasql ?
<siesel> should that sample data / default data for the tables added to the xml file? or should it be in a seperate file?
<dneighbo> hold up a minute i will answer
<dneighbo> stbain you still here?
<dneighbo> siesel : im not sure best place to put this stuff
<dneighbo> siesel jcater might be better one for that
<dneighbo> basically we have the python script that wraps the xslt processor (though any xslt processor could be used)
<dneighbo> then we have the .xsl files
<dneighbo> it all needs to go in common with a nice little doc
<dneighbo> i dont really care too much where
<dneighbo> stbain here is an example

<yogurt2unge> jcater: is cvs right? I'm downloading 0.3 version
<jcater> ?
<jcater> CVS head is marked as 0.4.0-devel
<chillywilly> oooooh
<yogurt2unge> jcater: there is a lot of error like "is no longer in the repository" 
<yogurt2unge> I need the stable sources
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> how are you downloading the stable?
<yogurt2unge> I follow the instruction of your mail to gnue-devel
<jcater> ah
<yogurt2unge> gnue-dev@gnu.org
<yogurt2unge> in June 15
<jcater> at which point are you getting these error messages?
siesel (jan@dial-213-168-95-60.netcologne.de) left irc: "Night"
<yogurt2unge> when I changed to common direcctory and executed cvs update .......
<jcater> ok
<jcater> I see it now
<jcater> cvs server: utils/xml2sql/build.py is no longer in the repository
<jcater> cvs server: utils/xml2sql/display.psp is no longer in the repository
<jcater> cvs server: utils/xml2sql/display.xsl is no longer in the repository
<jcater> cvs server: utils/xml2sql/mssql.xsl is no longer in the repository
<jcater> cvs server: utils/xml2sql/mysql.xsl is no longer in the repository
<jcater> cvs server: utils/xml2sql/pgsql.xsl is no longer in the repository
<jcater> cvs server: utils/xml2sql/strip.command.xsl is no longer in the repository
<jcater> cvs server: utils/xml2sql/sybase.xsl is no longer in the repository
<jcater> that stuff?
<jcater> those are files that siesel just added to CVS head
<yogurt2unge> Yes 
<jcater> shouldn't affect the branch release
<jcater> basically, you checked out head, then updated that checkout to be 0.3.0
<jcater> so in the original checkout, it retrieved files it didn't need
<jcater> and the update to 0.3.0 is telling you that those files weren't in 0.3.0
<jcater> you can just ignore those messages
<jcater> at least, I think
<yogurt2unge> I don have problem with the normal branch
<yogurt2unge> s/don/don't/
<jcater> that's because he just added those to the normal branch
<jcater> I think you can safely ignore those errors
Action: jcater isn't a cvs expert, though
<yogurt2unge> Ok, I'll test 0.3.0 branch with the new version of PAPO and I tell you the problems later 
Action: yogurt2unge I read all documentation of cvs last week, but I never be a cvs expert

<^chewie> mmm, very cool
<^chewie> anyone ever check out PyDO?
<^chewie> http://skunkweb.sourceforge.net/PyDO/PyDO.html
<chillywilly> http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/debian-security-announce-2002/msg00045.html
<^chewie> there's a neat script there for generating Python scripts based on what it finds in the database
<^chewie> asks a few questions about linking and method names
<^chewie> it looks pretty cool
<yogurt2unge> \quit home
yogurt2unge (~charlie@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) left irc: "home"
<^chewie> heh
<chillywilly> looks like something similar to our GDataObject
<dneighbo> um re the html
<dneighbo> i said no images :)
<dneighbo> <dneighbo> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/glaccount.html
<dneighbo> <dneighbo> is conversion w/o images
Action: ^chewie needs to dig into the GDataObject
<^chewie> dneighbo: doesn't quite rendure correctly in mozilla for some reason
<^chewie> oh, it's JavaScript
<^chewie> how cute ;-)
<dneighbo> um works fine in 3 verson of mozilla for me
<dneighbo> stbain how is acclite working?
Action: dneighbo is curious how works under mysql
<dneighbo> and how you like the dir structure changes and such
<^chewie> dneighbo: I never actually moved the mouse over the table names
<dneighbo> ah
<^chewie> dneighbo: I just assumed that was all there was
<dneighbo> yeah you have to click them
Action: ^chewie found that out after looking at the source of the page
<dneighbo> its nice when there are a TON of tables like
<dneighbo> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/fsf/datadictionary.html
Action: ^chewie nods
<^chewie> well, I need to take off
<^chewie> later people
<dneighbo> bye bye

SachaS_away (~Sacha@dialup-196-161.wasp.net.au) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<dneighbo> drochaid how that form going?
<dneighbo> get it working?
<drochaid> dneighbo: yep:)
<drochaid> and thanks for your help on it
<drochaid> once I've run up all the forms I need, I'll get all the records for Mycerinus entered
<ajmitch_> dneighbo: funnily nuff, designer seems to hate me
<ajmitch_> none of the text widgets seem editable, so i can't change labels, names, etc :)
<ajmitch_> (this only on winXP, on a decent OS it works fine)
<ajmitch_> i might try & setup so i can use CVS
<dneighbo> no no no :)
<dneighbo> take your property editor
<dneighbo> move it to upper left corner of your desktop
<dneighbo> then make it big enough that all scrollbars disappear
<dneighbo> then tell me if you can edit properties
Action: dneighbo is going to guess you will be able to
<dneighbo> btw: if that fixes it, even decent OS's see this problem though not as consistently as windoze
<ajmitch_> dneighbo: umm interesting
<dneighbo> did that fix it?
<dneighbo> ........................
<ajmitch_> it fixed that part of it, but the entry widgets down the bottom of the main screen still don't like me
<dneighbo> why use those?
<dneighbo> :)
<dneighbo> what are they doing that they dont like you
<dneighbo> generally you ahve to enter values then hit enter for them to take
<dneighbo> also you can change label names by simply
<dneighbo> double clicking the lable
<dneighbo> er label
<dneighbo> and then edit its name inline
<ajmitch_> ok
<dneighbo> hope that helps
<ajmitch_> yeah
<ajmitch_> now i have to setup a working DB connection
<dneighbo> its far from perfect, but once you learn the quirks it can make you pretty darn productive :)
<dneighbo> well im off to home
