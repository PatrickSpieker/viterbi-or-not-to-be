<reinhard> jbailey: thanks for the debs
<jbailey> Glad to do it!
<jbailey> Maybe this week, I'll try to finish getting #gnue-commits setup, BTW.
<jbailey> Right now CVS commits all go to #commits with all the other projects, so it's vanity stuff, not terribly useful.
<jbailey> I've also submitted navigator and appserver.  The ftpmasters are slowly processing things, but I don't know when it'll go it.
<jbailey> I saw some stuff appear today that went in a couple weeks ago.
<jbailey> (And that was core stuff for glibc, which would get priority)
<jbailey> reinhard: I did have to work around one bug, though.
<jbailey> clean::
<jbailey>         find . -name \*pyc -exec rm '{}' \;
<jbailey> It seems that you've got some extra module that distutils calls or something like that.
<jbailey> The problem is that python then creates a .pyc file, which Debian then tries to throw into the .diff.
<jbailey> (and can't, because it's a binary)
<jbailey> I only looked at it enough to get the packages into the archive properly - so I've got this solution now.
<jbailey> But mayeb this week or next, I'll get you more information so we can solve it properly.

<reinhard> jbailey: this does regard to setupext/*.pyc and is only in common, right?
<jbailey> I think it happened in all of them.
<jbailey> I don't have my notes handy (I'm working on something else atm.)

<jbailey> *sigh* I wish SQL weren't so.. crude.
<jbailey> It just seems like python/php/perl/etc, ought to have a better abstraction than having to construct SQL statements and then parse out arrays to get the responses.
<reinhard> off for today
<reinhard> bye

<chillywilly> there's an html UI driver for forms?

<chillywilly> where?

<chillywilly> I thought I had gnue checked out on this machine
<ajmitch> I see stuff in gnue/gnue-appserver/extensions/webfrontend
<dtm> hi guys.
<chillywilly> I thought that was a webfrontend to control appserver
<ajmitch> see the README
<chillywilly> not a forms ui driver
<ajmitch> it seems to be a web forms client
