<siesel> morning
<siesel> btami: the win32 ui don't work because of a dll loading problem.
<btami> hi siesel
<btami> what error you get?
<siesel> something like : dll can't be loaded

<siesel> in chinese
<btami> :)
<siesel> it seems to find the dll, but has problems with dll format.
<btami> can you try it on another (US) win98 ?
<btami> i'v tried i on win98 SE hun, and it worked well
<siesel> ok. I'll try. 
<siesel> I hope I have some win98 US first edition around here.
<siesel> But I will first try to update win98 chinese to second edition (hope that windows update still works)

<siesel> btami: I probably found the error. win32all ver. 159 can be installed. I had to install development version 161 instead.
<siesel> btw. which win32all version did you use to build the exe?
<btami> 159
Action: btami is downloading 161 now
Nick change: SachaS -> SachaAway
<siesel> btami: forms works with 161 on windows 98
<btami> great
<btami> is it chinese?
<siesel> yep.
<btami> and a win32 ui?
<siesel> seems like just 159 had some problems with this system
<siesel> yes win32ui. I just tested the intro form, but I think the rest will be ok too.

<btami> can you type chinese input too?
<siesel> ok, now I understand. no, its english on chin. win. 
<btami> :(
<siesel> but I'll try to make a chinese one ... with screenshot :)
<btami> :)
<btami> i'v tried it with gtk2, and got some chinese labels, but
<btami> was no luck with input
<btami> tried unicode
<btami> then i'v tried unicode wx
<btami> but it asked for a good font, and i don't know what gtk2 used
<btami> so got no good chinese labels with wx
<btami> i'v added utf-8 to encodings dict in wx's common.py
<btami> don't know how win32 ui will works with utf-8/unicode...
<siesel> it should :)
<btami> i hope:)
<dcmwai> btami: I know good fonts for gtk2 :)
<dcmwai> under linux.. :)
<btami> dcmwai: gtk2 find good fonts in win32, just it doesn't tells me
<btami> what was that
<dcmwai> oh... I see
<dcmwai> But in linux there ask for it right?
<dcmwai> s/there/they
Action: dcmwai is away: dinner
<btami> on win32 wx doesn't knows autamatice which font to use, and
<btami> it asked me to chese one, but i don't know what font to chose
<btami> gtk2 is clever than wx
<siesel> :)
<btami> or cleverer ? :)

Action: btami ducks
<siesel> yeah, trying out unicode/chinese with win32/wx uidrivers
<siesel> First try (-u win32)http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jan/chinese_win32.png
<btami> wow
<siesel> this is using default locale, i.e. converting unicode to default locale (= gb2312) here
<dcmwai> how come so many ???
<dcmwai> I see
<dcmwai> siesel: Anyway to just use unicode? (Not usine unicode...)
<siesel> I used output= unicode_string.encode('gb2312','replace')
<dcmwai> Er Not user locale (BG/Gb)
<dcmwai> I see...
<siesel> that means to use wx-unicode build (for wx) or some magic win32 function (for win32 ui)

<btami> siesel: sorry, but what is the difference to the prior try
<btami> ?
<dcmwai> siesel: This is a lot more better :)
<btami> maybe the problem i can't understand chinese :)
<siesel> btami: no question marks anymore. 
<dcmwai> prior try is about UTF8-->locacle code (big5, gb2312)
<dcmwai> btami: due to to the lack of fonts/code in gb2312/big5... They turn to be "?"
<dcmwai> so you midd informated
<dcmwai> s/midd/miss
<siesel> btami: gb2312 (=simpl. chinese) is just a subset of unicode, i.e traditional chinese didn't work, german umlauts not work
<btami> i see
<dcmwai> siesel: You are keying Your Zhung Zhi inside? :)
<dcmwai> siesel: Do you know that someone say the Utf-8 --> big5 conveter in Unicode is wrong?
<dcmwai> (under the unicode.org)

<dcmwai> This might solve the Utf8<=>big5 problem
<siesel> dcmwai: thx. I try.
<siesel> yes, zhuzibaijia are all in my local database.
<siesel> Its quite useful :)
<dcmwai> siesel: Nice try :)
<dcmwai> siesel: For the test as well :)
<siesel> :)
<dcmwai> siesel: about the code utf-8<==>big5 did think that is usefull
<dcmwai> ?
<siesel> its quite useful.
<siesel> In which code region are the big5 chars? Is it that undefined (eten space)?
<siesel> sorry, have to look for crying children + dinner, bbl.
<Vee> they're over here, siesel
<dcmwai> siesel: Unsure, maybe unicode.org stete that. But it certainly have got the wrong code.

<dcmwai> siesel, are you free somehow?
<dcmwai> I'm trying to get FPDF working with unicode Fonts...

<siesel> what is FPDF?
mcuria (~maxy@29-185-89-200.fibertel.com.ar) left irc: Connection reset by peer
<siesel> ok, found it: fpdf.org
<siesel> dcmwai: so  you don't want to use gnue-reports? ;)
<dcmwai> siesel, It is just too hard to get gnue-report to be in place.
jbailey (~jbailey@atlas.fundserv.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dcmwai> to be franke, I would really love to.. Cause using Gnue-report I'can have xml,html,ps,pdf,cvx and all format that you support with it easily.
<dcmwai> but the intregation/interfacing/link/connection is way too Hard.
<dcmwai> and it will be harder when I want to make it multiplatfrom.
<siesel> dcmwai: no problem
Action: siesel really has to have another look at the gnue-reports-server
<jcater> dcmwai: with all due respect
<dcmwai> siesel, Oh yes and please..
<jcater> if you can get the ISP to let you run a gnue-reports-server
<jcater> then why couldn't he let you exec gnue-reports?
<dcmwai> jcater, Sure, but how if it is a windows machine?
<Vee> that seems like a trivial issue
<siesel> reports runs on windows too.
<Vee> if there is some difference in how you execute it, perhaps due to a path involved or something, you can easily handle that in the code 
<dcmwai> ok.
<dcmwai> So did gnue-report-server run on all platfrom (from *nix,windows,Mac and etc)
<siesel> yes.
<dcmwai> cause it is not the report machine, it is actually the whole aria Main report system, I'll take out all html report and etc and replace with it. 
Action: dcmwai is checkingout cvs
<dcmwai> jcater, So the soultion will be issuing an exec(command ) and then have it send back?
<siesel> dcmwai: the report server would be called via GNU RPC (i.e. XMLRPC) but until all functionalty is implemented the exec(gnue-reports) trick has to be used.
<dcmwai> siesel, may I ask how the gnu rpc being called?
<jcater> yes, long term, what siesel describes is the plan
<jcater> but I wouldn't depend on that for anything you're wanting in the near future
thierry (~thierry@marseille-2-a7-62-147-61-141.dial.proxad.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> actually, gnue-reports is the reason I started on gnue rpc :)
<dcmwai> ooh..
<siesel> jcater: do you have some minutes to discuss further report server design?
<jcater> um
<jcater> in my mind
<jcater> reports server is a very, very low priority for me
<dcmwai> why?
<jcater> but I honestly don't have time to spend any time on gnue at the moment
<dcmwai> isn't that the main presentation came out
Action: jcater is in the middle of a bad time crunch at work
<siesel> dcmwai: quite easy from php, just have a look gnue-common/src/rpc/test/client.php
<dcmwai> siesel, Ok... 
<siesel> jcater: I wondered why the db driver development stalled. Now I know.
<dcmwai> jcater, What happen in the crunch
<siesel> jcater: good luck with work stuff.
mcuria (~maxy@29-185-89-200.fibertel.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
Action: dcmwai wounder how to include gnue-report and the rpc in arias in packaging.. 
<jcater> siesel: yeah, it sucks
Action: jcater really wants to get the dbdriver stuff in the main CVS
<jcater> as every day I don't get it in, the more outdated my branch becomes
<jcater> and I really like my branch
<jcater> but I'm biased :)
<dcmwai> siesel, I don't have that files.. are you sure it is in the cvs server?
<siesel> Don't worry, every day you are not  logged in, the cvs commit log is quite empty
<Vee> dcmwai: it's the end of the month so many companies face an end of the month crunch to try and get everything or as much as possible finished before the month ends
<dcmwai> Vee, Oh.. I see That is something I don't know.
<siesel> Don't worry, every day you are not logged in, the cvs commit log is quite empty
Action: siesel is repeating himself.
<dcmwai> haha
<dcmwai> siesel, I don't have this files even it is the cvs version. gnue-common/src/rpc/test/client.php
<siesel> dcmwai: ok, I'll check.
<siesel> http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/gnue/gnue-common/src/rpc/test/client.php
<dcmwai> why it is not in my cvs even if it is update? hum have to checkout again
<siesel> dunno, probably you have a tagged release.
<dcmwai> siesel, Not easy to read all :)
Action: dcmwai think may be it is time to re-checkout all gnue
<siesel> you can try: cvs -t HEAD update 
<dcmwai> siesel, do you have any simple command
<dcmwai> because gnue modules is sperated across all the DIR
<siesel> just do a "for i in gnue*;do cd $i;cvs update; cd ..; done
<dcmwai> siesel, Har... how come you all people got this kind of simple solution one...
Action: dcmwai really cannot catch up with *nix people...
thierry (~thierry@marseille-2-a7-62-147-61-141.dial.proxad.net) left irc: "Client exiting"
<siesel> dcmwai: the client.php code is a bit old and uses a bad xmlrpc abstraction layer.
<siesel> you should check out gnue-phpforms/src/gcomm.php
<siesel> in the end, its just a "import xmlrpcstuff;" + "xmlrpc->exectue(host,"startreport",reportname)"
<siesel> jbailey: is the #gnue-commits feed broken?
<jbailey> siesel: Looks like the CIA user isn't in there.
<Vee> I guess we gotta tell cia to join everytime it pings out or something
<jbailey> I don't have time to troubleshoot it right now.  If someone does, the problem is that the CIA bot can apparently only connect to so many channels at once.
<jbailey> And the freenode people need to let it connect to more.
<jbailey> The guy who runs #commits has a note about it in his channel.
<siesel> ok, I will look there. thx :)
<dcmwai> CIA?

<Vee2d2> I think we're going to move to using subversions or something else instead of cvs, at work
<Vee2d2> any of you using an alternative versioning system than cvs in production somewhere?
<R45> what's wrong with cvs?
<jbailey> R45: It sucks rocks.
<jbailey> Vee2d2: I'km using subversion, but I'm still new at it.
<R45> anything specific? :P
<jcater> we're looking to move to subversions too
<jcater> still very new at it
<jcater> R45: lack of atomicity
<jcater> lack of directory versioning
<jbailey> R45: Expensive branch, painful merging.
<jcater> lack of file relocation functions
<jbailey> Incapable of tracking renames.
<R45> I agree the branching and merging is a PITA
<R45> ah well
<Vee2d2> well, the main guy doesnt like it for a few reasons.. the one I recall him stating is that he thinks cvs wasnt really written for multiple developers to use
<Vee2d2> it's all coming to surface though becuase we tried to move our repositories to a new server and havent been able to get it working in the new location (weird weird problems)
<jbailey> Vee2d2: It wasn't really.  It's just RCS with a wrapper.
<R45> I've never tried subversion though..
Action: R45 checks it out
<Vee2d2> seems like there's a number of alternative systems out there.. 
<jbailey> Vee2d2: If you need CVS repo help, I could probably help you.  We can negotiate something to make it worth my while.
<jbailey> Vee2d2: Bitkeeper (non-free).  Arch (Tom Lord's an ass, but it's GNU now).  and Subversion (Generally well liked and seen as the next big CVS by alot of communities)
<Vee2d2> jbailey: I've stumped google and #cvs with it
<Vee2d2> what about mcvs?
<jbailey> Vee2d2: Ah?  Weird.  I haven't found anythign that stumps be, but there's always a first.
<jbailey> Gotta do an upgrade, bbiab.

<dneighbo> pgaccess sucks
<dneighbo> never looked at it before
<dneighbo> saw it in apt and figured i would look... egads
<jamest> unless it's changed you'll find some nice new tables in your db too
<dneighbo> yes thats what im freaking on
<jamest> owned and only accessable by the first user of pgaccess
<dneighbo> freaking added like 10 freaking pga_* tables
<dneighbo> not happy camper
<jamest> which fuxorz any other users unlucky enough to need to use it
<dneighbo> doh
<jamest> oh yeah
<jamest> try loading a big table
<jamest> it has to load every record before responding
<jamest> at least it used to
<jamest> absolutely brutal on response times
<dneighbo> i already uninstalled it
<jamest> and system resources
<dneighbo> i was wanting a quick visual way to look at some tables another app (kmusicdb) installed

<dneighbo> will be heading out there in a couple of days
<dneighbo> might be able to get you a free lunch or two ;)
<dneighbo> but was curious to get your opinion of current dining there (if you have eaten there)
<jcater> dneighbo: I'm not sure jamest eats anything but taco bell
<dneighbo> taco bell has chicken fingers now?
<dneighbo> oh wait.. you are one with chicken limitations :)
Action: dneighbo really has been away too long
<jamest> i eat everywhere
<jamest> even taco bell
<jamest> but haven't ate at holidome in years

<jamest> of course I'm running 0.27 and 0.32 is out so maybe those issues are resolved

<dtm> neat.
<Vee> gonna try to 'move' the repository to this machine for kicks to see if I can get it working here or spot the cause of problems happening there.. 
<dtm> oic
<Vee> got my ssh'idness all worked out.. 
Action: Vee hearts keychain
<dtm> Vee: huh. 
<dtm> glad to hear it.
<Vee> you? what you been upta? 
<dtm> Oh man.
<dtm> i dont even wanna think about it.
<dtm> working nonstop as always
<dtm> gave chillywi1ly a primer on interchange last night
<dtm> he's become quite the ecommerce hacker
<Vee> I've looked at that a time or two
<dtm> and such
<dtm> you should again.
<dtm> OR BE DESTROYED
<Vee> ;)
<dtm> learn interchange.  it *just* might mean your life.
<dtm> i would call up anyone on the phone right now to evangelize interchange.
<dtm> BRING IT ON
Action: dtm 4
<Vee> it has been a while.. maybe 1.5-2 years I'd guess
<dtm> whoa.
<dtm> was it versoin 4.8?
<dtm> or earlir
<Vee> earlier I think
<dtm> i started with 4.8
<dtm> i dabbled with it when it was called minivend in about 1998
<Vee> yea
<dtm> didn't get it to work then.
<dtm> that utterly maxed out my skill level at the time
<Vee> I was just going to say it's funny to think that's what it use to be
<Vee> no resemblence to minivend now
<dtm> huh.
<dtm> pretty much, other than the variable names!
<dtm> minivend is to interchange as openstep is to macos
<dtm> there's a lot of variables starting with "NS" in macos now :)
<dtm> due to NeXTSTEP
<dtm> coincidentally, probably the same with mozilla.
<dtm> "NS"
<dtm> Vee: do you have any possible interest in it now?
<Vee> I think I'm still on for writing my own thing actually..
<Vee> it's way out there on the todo list though
Action: dtm explodes
<dtm> yeah?  so you have a special section of your todo list labeled "impossible tasks"
<dtm> ?
<Vee> I have a system about 60-70% written somewhere in my archives.. 
<dtm> or "grandeural delusions" perhaps
<dtm> that sounds more fancy
Action: ajmitch has one of those sorta lists
<dtm> Vee: yeah.  sure you do.  :)
<dtm> ajmitch: cool
<ajmitch> including such tasks as learn how to write 'hello world'
<Vee> stopped working on it when I decided to base things off gnue
<dtm> i dont know.  i think i might.  i dont know if i wrote those particular ones down ye.t
<dtm> ajmitch: eh?
<dtm> ajmitch: you can write 'hello world'.
<dtm> u sille
<ajmitch> in INTERCAL!! ;)
Action: ajmitch shudders
<dtm> what's that?! 
<ajmitch> eeevil
<dtm> yay, evil
<Vee> so my priorities have switched from getting an ecommerce system up and running, to getting myself using gnue-sb, then getting an ecommerce system running which interfaces with that..
<dtm> Vee: and if you have the slightest shred of intelligence, common sense, self respect, and human decency, that system shall be Interchange.
<dtm> ;)
<Vee> heh
Action: dtm hands Vee the prized interchange hot dog
Action: ajmitch sees dtm spaketh the words of doom
<Vee> I dont claim to have any of that
<dtm> Vee: :-/
Action: dtm plots Vee's destruction
<dtm> I warned ya!
Action: Vee is not human, afterall.
