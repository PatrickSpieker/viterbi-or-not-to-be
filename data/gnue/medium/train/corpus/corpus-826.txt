<reinhard> wow
<mdupont> at least extracted the sql from them
<dtm> mdupont: you were satisfied with your extraction of IC data?
<mdupont> from those, i have to say that Compier and SqlLedger are pretty good with database design
<dtm> heheh "weberp"   that sounds like a rude noise sometimes followed by mild regurgitation.
<mdupont> and interchange has the best support
<dtm> a tad of the ol' antiperistalsis, as it were
<mdupont> :)
<dtm> interchange support community is THROUGH THE ROOF, Y'ALL
btami (~tamas@ip102-205.ktv.tiszanet.hu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<mdupont> I aslo think that Compier is not really free software
<dtm> mdupont: :/
<btami> good morning
<mdupont> because you need a non-free case tool to work on it, so the database model is not source
<mdupont> but object code
<dtm> mdupont: hey!  i found out today that Appgen went out of business, and had all their source code in escrow to be open sourced.  that's currently under debate.
<mdupont> according to the gpl, you need to provider the source code in the preferred means of editing
<mdupont> well they do, those are the models from some case tool
<dtm> hmmm.
<mdupont> but those models are only readable by this case tool
<mdupont> and it is not free
<mdupont> you can edit the oracle scripts, but then someone will have to edit the model 
<mdupont> and that someone is this J?rgen guy
<mdupont> so it might technically be gpled,
<dtm> mdupont: it's not Jeurgen(sp?) originally from VA, is it?
<mdupont> but realisticly, it is a closed package for any real changes
<dtm> mdupont: coz VA bought Compiere or something about it
<mdupont> Juergen from oracle, and unisis
<dtm> ok
<dtm> i worked with a Juergen at VA
<dtm> in the IT dept.  he was a temp
<mdupont> juergen janke
<dtm> Hm.
<mdupont> there are lots of j?rgens out there :)
<dtm> yeah.
<dtm> but only ONE of MY JUERGEN.
<mdupont> I think compier is really well designed

<dcmwai> siesel:  ... :)
<dcmwai> I've read your post
<dcmwai> get gnue-report-server up and the gcomm.php to the somewhere it need...
<dcmwai> so I'm trying to use the test.php that located on /gnue-reports/samples/php_client/test.php It turn to be some error I don't really understand..
<dcmwai> 6. process the report (can take longer)
<dcmwai> XML error: not well-formed (invalid token) at line 20The server returned an error (2): Invalid return payload: enabling debugging to examine incoming payload
<siesel> what kind of errorﬂ
<siesel> hmmm.
<dcmwai> accordinft o the files line 20 is sctually $repServ = $link->request("GReportServer");
<dcmwai> print ("<p>6. process the report (can take longer)<br>");
<dcmwai> $engine->execute("processReport",array("Passives_WeiSuoX_SXW.grd", array(), 0, 0, 0));
<dcmwai> I'm not sure about this "Passives_WeiSuoX_SXW.grd" array
<siesel> Passives_... is the report you want to process.
<dcmwai> OOp.
<siesel> the line 20 means the line in the returned XML file.
<dcmwai> siesel: For simeple testing. What shall I give him.
<siesel> ehhmm, do you have tried out reports before?
<dcmwai> siesel: Frankly NO :(
<dcmwai> but I've try the /gnue/gnue-reports/samples/foobulations/ and it seem to be working.
<siesel> ok, so you should go in that directory and start the reports server there
<siesel> then pass the name of the foobulations sample to the server
<dcmwai> siesel: have to start the report server on the Particular die?
<dcmwai> s/die/dir
<dcmwai> I import the foobulations sample SQL into gnue (at postgresql)
<siesel> yes, there is no path name manipulation now,
<dcmwai> and I run grcvs monthly.grd subtitle="April 2002" begin="04/01/2002" end="04/30/2002" on the dir is this right?
<dcmwai> ok let try again.
<siesel> the best way is to first run grcvs, and check if everything works.
<siesel> then startup the gnue-reportserver in that same directory and try running gnue-reports with the same parameters as before but an additional -S option.
<siesel> if you pass the -Z option to the gnue-reports-server you can see what happens and take the values to write you php script
<dcmwai> siesel: OK I've start gsdcvs on the foobulations dir, Now what command should I issue?
<siesel> first: "grcvs -S monthly.grd subtitle="April 2002" begin="04/01/2002" end="04/30/2002""
<dcmwai> siesel:  DB000:     raise apply(Fault, (), self._stack[0])
<dcmwai> DB000: xmlrpclib.Fault: <Fault 1: "exceptions.IOError:Default destination '-' is not supported by reports server">
<dcmwai> default destination - is not supported?
<siesel> oh, sorry. you have to pass an additional -d /tmp/test
<siesel> Its not a good idea to send report's output to the server side console, so I disabled "-" 
<dcmwai> siesel: this additional is on the grdcvs or grcvs?
<dcmwai> ah is grcvs :)
<dcmwai> siesel: DB000: xml.parsers.expat.ExpatError: not well-formed (invalid token): line 20, column 12
<dcmwai>  ?
<siesel> oops.
<siesel> do you use pw_xmlrpc or xmlrpc rpc-drivers?
<siesel> I'll try to get that error here too.
<dcmwai> Not really using them... but I think pw_xmlrpc is defined on gnue.conf
<dcmwai> it is define on the appserv
<dcmwai> I don't really use it and can be disable.
<md-work> dcmwai: hey
<dcmwai> hello md-work :)
Nick change: md-work -> mdupont
<mdupont> back for lunch
<siesel> hi mdupont
<mdupont> hi siesel
<siesel> dcmwai: I'll check how to enable extensive debbuging output :)
<siesel> mdupont: great idea to compare the different schema tables.
<dcmwai> siesel: I've the debug level 20 and have a log files on grdcvs :) you want it?
<siesel> there is only one app you missed: fibusql
<dcmwai> fibusql?
<dcmwai> what is that for
<mdupont> dcmwai: thanks
<siesel> http://www.piware.de/projects.shtml, very simple double accounting solution
<mdupont> ok, let me get it

<dcmwai> but compiere is running on oracle, which is much much faster then mysql (But not postgreSQL)
<dcmwai> siesel: What do you want me to do with this fibusql?
<mdupont> yes, well I am going to just take the table definitions and compare them against each othre
<mdupont> and find out what can be used to defined the gnu packages as specified
<mdupont> given of course a priority list of todos
<mdupont> i dont want to use the tables as they are

<dcmwai> mdupont: remember to normalizzed them :)
<dcmwai> I think aria DB wasn't normalized, causing it unexpandable and unresonable.
<mdupont> yes
<mdupont> to be honest
<mdupont>  i want to make a real  OO UMl Model of them
<dcmwai> UM1 :) ha
<siesel> dcmwai: the hint to fibusql was for mdupont, as he is collection schemata
<mdupont> fibusql has exactly 4 tables
<siesel> oh, that sound like a complicated system which fits business applications ;)
<mdupont>  accounts journal  repeated balances
<mdupont> the idea is to make a clean repository of the schema
<mdupont> using the gnuenterprise classdefs
<mdupont> but expanded to model all the needed parts
<mdupont> ok the food is burning
<mdupont> gotta go
Nick change: mdupont -> mdupont-lunch
<mdupont-lunch> thanks for the link siesel
<mdupont-lunch> more later
<siesel> ok, cu.
<siesel> I would propose to convert the schemata in gnue-schema format, as it will allow to import the schemata in gnue-appserver easy.
<siesel> (when that part has written :) )
<siesel> Which is quite easy to do with gnue-designer, but more about later. Guten Hunger.

<siesel> yes, I got a /tmp/test file :)
<dcmwai> Hum Have to check the grdcvs...
<siesel> so it seems to be serverbased.
<dcmwai> anyway know where went wrong?
<siesel> do you started grdcvs with the -Z option?
<dcmwai> No but I do start with --debug :)
<siesel> seems you have, but I don't remember.
<siesel> dunno, but for me I have to pass the -Z option, because if not, all output goes into nirwana
<dcmwai> nirwana ?
<dcmwai> DB000: socket.error: (111, '\xb3s\xbdu\xb3Q\xa9\xda\xb5\xb4')

<dcmwai> This is with -Z
<siesel> you're running on win32 or linux?
<dcmwai> Linux :)
<dcmwai> siesel: can I have a look on the report-filters.conf
<siesel> ok, one moment
<siesel> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jan/report-filters.conf
<dcmwai> siesel: about the php xmlrpc, we just need one files right? The xmlrpc.inc
<siesel> yep.
Action: dcmwai wounder why don't add that in ...
<dcmwai> siesel: that is very different then the one in cvs :)
ToyMan (~stuq@65.167.123.238) left irc: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)
<siesel> We can add it, but I'm not shure about the license
ToyMan (~stuq@65.167.123.238) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dcmwai> siesel: something is wrong with -Z it ask for a password and If I press enter... the server don't run :(
<siesel> strange.
<siesel> can you try to pass the password and username via command line?
<dcmwai> VERY STRANGE
<dcmwai> only password... Not username
Action: dcmwai wounder what password it is asking...
Action: dcmwai know that it is asking ... I've sudo infromt ;(
<siesel> do you have to enter username and password for grcvs?
<dcmwai> Joker...
<dcmwai> YEs
<dcmwai>  xmlrpclib.Fault: <Fault 1: "exceptions.AttributeError:'NoneType' object has no attribute 'getLogin'">
<siesel> ok, if I remove my .netrc file I get ... exactly
Action: dcmwai wounder if he is still transporting files to siesel places :)
<siesel> one second. I 'll update the authentication code.
<dcmwai> siesel: because the grcvs this time just halt there... O_O
<dcmwai> siesel: ah I've got my report... but gcvs halt there...
<siesel> grcvs halts?
<dcmwai> Not to say halts.. Just Stop and stay still ;)
<dcmwai> This time no more /tmp/test :(
<dcmwai> siesel: Now I see why.. multiple grdcvs running..
<siesel> ok, so after a killall python2.3, you can startup grdcvs -Z
<siesel> btw. you should do a cvs update , as I fixed the password and username parameters
<dcmwai> siesel: I think we will have to continuate this later  about 2 hours or more, is that Ok for you?
<dcmwai> and then I'll be a different machine... Different problem might be there ;)
<siesel> I don't know if I'll have time then.
<dcmwai> siesel: If I want to distribue gnue-report-server. What should I have?
<dcmwai> as the cvs version sometime... :(
<dcmwai> so better kept a Stable version :)
<siesel> The normal reports package and gnue-common.
<siesel> i.e. two tarballs :)
<dcmwai> siesel: then the setting? gnue.conf and connection.conf?
<dcmwai> Haha 2 ball.
<siesel> :)
<dcmwai> I think the setting is the most things that make things happen differnetly..
<siesel> you can provide sample or base settings
<siesel> or probably create a custom connection.conf with PHP out of the database settings of arias.
<dcmwai> Good idea ;)
<siesel> Vice versa would probably be better. Use connections.conf for ARIAS :)
<dcmwai> so siesel, I still need that ...
<dcmwai> conf... hum.. have to config a conf files again...
<dcmwai> xmlrpclib.Fault: <Fault 1: "exceptions.AttributeError:'NoneType' object has no attribute 'getLogin'">
<dcmwai> So this problem is about the login cvs you just commited.
<siesel> yep. you have to pass password and username
<dcmwai> siesel: Yes IT is done :)
<dcmwai> yes yes ;)
Action: dcmwai think so now what...
<siesel> you can test it and tell me what you need improved.
Nick change: mdupont-lunch -> md-work
<md-work> la8ter
<dcmwai> siesel: I still get this on the php xml-rpc

<dcmwai> siesel, I wounder why the -Z must be there?
<siesel> it prevents the server from going in daemon mode.

<Ogart> Greetings...I'm thinking about contributing to this project by documenting and testing. (I'm a rather poor coder). Do you guys mind if I "hang out" and listen? I belive in the project, just a bit overwhelmed by what I may be getting myself into...
<dcmwai> this one is strange...
<jcater> Ogart: we would *love* someone who's interested in documenting :)
<dcmwai> Thank you Ogart 
<siesel> Ogart: your welcome.
<Ogart> I'm ten times the writer than I am a coder. I have NO problem saying that. 
<Ogart> I've signed the copyright assignment too,....
Action: dsmith wishes he could write
<Vee> rock!
<jamest> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jamest/apis
<Vee> the channel pen is all yours, Ogart
<jamest> i'd like to add epydoc support to our setup system 
<jamest> if people think it would be usefull to have docs like that
<jcater> I think so
<siesel> jamest: good idea
<dcmwai> siesel, I've kill it now what. :)
<jcater> the main thing I like is it shows inherited methods
<jamest> we'd need to switch to python docstrings to really make it shine
<jamest> yes
<jamest> it's inspired by javadoc
<jamest> which i know is evil
<Ogart> Is there a "status" page or something that says what docss are written, what need writing, etc?
<jamest> but I really like javadoc and went searching for a python equiv
<siesel> jamest: what about the pythondoc stuff. It's more like javadoc and use its own parser
<dcmwai> Ogart, unluckily there isn't any.. maybe it is all written in the irc log :)
<siesel> So you can have the documentation in comments rather than in python doc strings.
<jamest> it hasn't been updated in 3 years
<dcmwai> 3 Years...
<Ogart> Is GNUe in Python or C++? 
<jcater> Python
<Ogart> Phew. More easily learned than C++ from a VBasic person's perspective. 
<siesel> The One And Only :)
<siesel> dcmwai: imho, the socket error should be gone now.
<dcmwai> siesel, har why?
<dcmwai> any cvs update ?
<siesel> jamest: http://effbot.org/zone/pythondoc.htm
<siesel> dcmwai: no, I just think that the socket error is connected to another running instance of grdcvs
<dcmwai> siesel, I only got one grdcvs that is running...
<jamest> siesel: i'll try it out a bit later
<jamest> google was way off on that one :)
<jamest> at it was at 0.7
<jamest> but the question remains, do we want these docs in checked into cvs?
<siesel> jamest: I just read about it in the last Dr. Dobbs Python URL :)
<siesel> It would be convinient but it takes a lot space, so I'm unshure
<jamest> fwiw
<jamest> http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/index.html
<jamest> is the one I'd found last night
<jamest> it does have some issues though
<jcater> I'd almost rather see it updated on ash nightly
<jcater> instead of checked into cvs
<jcater> but that's just me
<jamest> that would work for me too
Action: jcater already checks out the source to do nightly tarballs
Action: siesel likes that.
<jcater> although....
<siesel> jcater, could you do this for DTDs too?
<jcater> I bet those stopped working when we split out separate modules
<jcater> =)
<dcmwai> siesel, strange.. the 1st connection have problem the 2nd dont...
<dcmwai> maybe python don't get the port yet...
<siesel> As I would like to include a DTD ref. into all gfd's grd's etc.
<siesel> dcmwai: Probably the connection timeout is too long, or ...  :)
<siesel> dcmwai: have you tried it with the php client?
<dcmwai> siesel, Not yet
<dcmwai> will try now
<jcater> siesel: probably
<dcmwai> siesel, still the same XML error: not well-formed (invalid token) at line 16The server returned an error (2): Invalid return payload: enabling debugging to examine incoming payload
<siesel> ok, I 'll check how to enable debugging.
<dcmwai> siesel, sany gdf files that is there can be easily use?
<dcmwai> where is Passives_WeiSuoX_SXW.grd ?
<dcmwai> Not any under gnue...
<siesel> hmm, sorry, that was some private file to edit classical chinese passiv sentences , uhmm...
<dcmwai> siesel, it is your files right :)
<siesel> can you replace it with monthly.grd?
rm-away (~reinhard@M1264P004.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: "Don't contradict a woman -- wait until she does herself."
<dcmwai> siesel, where is this files... DB000: gnue.reports.base.GRExceptions.ReportUnreadable: Unable to read the requested report definition
<dcmwai> oop :0
<siesel> you have to try with -Z and run the server in the foobulations directory
<dcmwai> ok
<siesel> there is a setDebug(0) in gcomm.php, can you set it to setDebug(1)?
<dcmwai> sure
<dcmwai> siesel, about the monthly.grd.. did I need to put the full path?
<siesel> that would be the best.
Action: siesel needs to update PHP as the debian/unstable version is badly broken :(#
<dcmwai> siesel, what you want to see... there is bunch of code..
<dcmwai> and the error code is what we have saw...
<dcmwai> <member>

<dcmwai> 				</member>
<dcmwai> wait something wrong.. that is not full path
<siesel> puuh, I allready thought, that there is no more help. (°	û’)
<dcmwai> siesel, This time it work
<dcmwai> :)
<dcmwai> 	¶’
<siesel> great. 
<dcmwai> either fullpath or just the files name work..
<dcmwai> so still -Z...
<dcmwai> killing..
<siesel> Today experince teachs me, that gnue-report needs a base path for grd files.
<dcmwai> siesel, demon mode need Full path
<dcmwai> if not it will not work..
<dcmwai> Wah that is killing :)
<dcmwai> So now good.. gnue-report work.. time for me to work...
<siesel> :)
<dcmwai> siesel, btw, what we saw all the time is xml about pdf how to make it work?
<siesel> just use a different filter.
Action: dcmwai think program without documenataion will just make the programer more busy answring question :)
<siesel> do you got the "Dispatching:  [4025be5496f8314b0f2dc384055bb4b70f7471f4].setFilter ['raw', '']"
<siesel> messages on server side?
<dcmwai> 705c3518c96d1fc49de771d4fbc86ceea8515dc0
<dcmwai> got ths
<dcmwai> it is always different number...
<siesel> after you have a working pdf creation, then you can just copy these settings seen on server side into you php script.
<siesel> I.e. no need to check which parameters has to be at which place. 
<siesel> the different number is the object identifier, as every report engine is a new dynamic object.
<dcmwai> Oh I see.
Action: siesel is searching for pdf creation examples.
<dcmwai> something a bit confuse... gnue-report get Data from the DB engine and process them? can I just pass raw data to them as ask it to process.. Like xml?
<siesel> ok, first an pdf creation example: grcvs --filter pdf -d /tmp/test.pdf monthly.grd subtitle="April 2002" begin="04/01/2002" end="04/30/2002"
<siesel> dcmwai: no, gnue reports just loads data from databases.
<dcmwai> siesel, oh... I see
<siesel> but you can pass parameters, (begin, end ...) and you can use different types of stylessheets to process the xml output yourself.
<dcmwai> siesel, So If I want to print a PO, I would require to put all the query statement into it?
<dcmwai> so as long as it is xml at the end it will accpet it?
<dcmwai> DB000:   File "/share/gnue/gnue-common/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/reports/adapters/filters/SimpleTabulation/tabulator/formatters/pdf.py", line 38, in ?
<dcmwai> DB000:     raise "Unable to load reportlab"
<dcmwai> DB000: Unable to load reportlab
<siesel> using SQL directly would be so good. But you can define a <condition> with parameters.
<siesel> apt-get install python-reportlab :)
<dcmwai> That is a Deep Chapter.. any Doc :)
<dcmwai> siesel, hello ... 
<dcmwai> I'm at a redhat :)
<siesel> ok, sorry I mean:
Action: mdupont looks intro parsing oracle with perls SQL::Translator::Parser::Oracle
<siesel> rpm-apt-get apt-get install python-reportlab
<dcmwai> siesel, Just wounder who provided python-reportlab (web site0
<siesel> mdupont: if you have oracle running, what about creating the database and use gnue-desinger to import it into a schema file :)
<mdupont> i dont have oracle running
<mdupont>  :)
<dcmwai> mdupont, You can download them on the oricale site :)
<mdupont> and I dont want to get any grey hairs installing it :(
<siesel> or ask jcater (you NEED donuts) to do it for you :)
<mdupont> i have the cd from the linuxworldexpo
<mdupont> siesel: but that is a good idea
<mdupont> if i can translate all the schemas into postgres
<mdupont> then i can use gnue on them
<siesel> dcmwai: http://www.reportlab.org/
<nickr> reportlab would be nice if it included a viewer and printer too.
<dcmwai> siesel, I wen to www.python.org to do the searching what a joke ;)
<siesel> :)
<siesel> mdupont: you don't want to use gnue-schema?
<mdupont> i do
<mdupont> want to use gnue
<mdupont> but dont want to install oracle
<mdupont> let me first get the schemas all into postgres format
<mdupont> then we can import tem
<siesel> ok.
<mdupont> :)
Action: siesel remembers that the support for triggers and the like in gnue-schema is still a bit retarded
<dcmwai> siesel, sorry I've never install a python module before Just want to make sure. Where should the files be extraced and could it be remove later after the installation?
dodji (~dodji@bo-117-254.businessobjects.com) left irc: "ChatZilla 0.9.35 [Mozilla rv:1.5/20031007]"
<siesel> you can extract it temp,
<siesel> normally you just call "make install" and it will be installed in the right place.
<siesel> but you can search for it with rpmfind.net which should work too.
<dcmwai> siesel, there isn't a make install there... don't know why.... it seem to be something like gnue :) all source.
<dcmwai> Either unpack reportlab.zip or reportlab.tgz to some directory say
<dcmwai> d:\ReportLab. If you can, ensure that the  line terminator style is
<dcmwai> correct for your OS (man zip programs have a text mode option eg -a).
<dcmwai>                                                                                                    
<dcmwai> Create a .pth file, say reportlab.pth in your Python
<dcmwai> home directory.  It should have one line:
<dcmwai> d:/ReportLab.

Nick change: SachaS -> SachaAway
<siesel> http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=python-reportlab&submit=Search+...&system=&arch=
<siesel> no redhat, but probably the other ones work
<siesel> dcmwai: I've downloaded the source.
<siesel> you have to get ReportLab_1_18.tgz, untar it and go into that director
<siesel> then a  "python setup.py install" will do the rest.
<dcmwai> siesel, oh I see
<dcmwai> siesel, Ah Now it is running.. I just type python setup.py all the time ... but don't know there is a python setup.py instal :)
<dcmwai> siesel, DB000: Warn: Python Imaging Library not available 
<dcmwai> Now have to get Python Imaging Library :)
<dcmwai> siesel, it is so Nice :) the pdf is there ;)
<siesel> cool. Now you just have to apply the unicode patch to get chinese characters :)
Action: siesel will go to a halloween party now :)
<mdupont> have fun, where do you go?
<siesel> cu l8r
<siesel> Siegen.
<mdupont> am rhein?
<siesel> Nichts ist schlimmer als "Siegen" !
<mdupont> :)
<siesel> Nicht ganz, eher oberhalb von Gieﬂen/Frankfurt
<siesel> Jedoch gibt es von Bonn aus keine direkte Autobahn. d.h. 2 Stunden Autofahrt.
<siesel> mdupont: Where do you come from?
<mdupont> Ahh
<mdupont> ich Wohne in FFM
<mdupont> Du bist ja um die Eke!
<mdupont> Giessen? da war ich oft

<mdupont> what?
<mdupont> why?
<mdupont> derek: this is a hostile takeover of compier
<mdupont> soon it will be running with gnuenterprise
<mdupont> at least the database models will be merged
<mdupont> and consolidated
<mdupont> http://introspector.sourceforge.net/2003/10/schemas/Compiere.pgsql 
<mdupont> check it out
<mdupont> i am going to try and match the compier tables against the gcd specification files tomorrow
<mdupont> that way we can show how well it meets the requirements
<mdupont> (of gnue)
<jcater> derek: he doesn't find it funny
<jcater> btw, sick picture of a mouse
<derek> mdupont: becareful
<derek> it is under MPL and i dont think that is GPL compatiable
<derek> jcater: i felt 'weird' taking the mouse pictures...
<derek> but i took 2 more this morning as i caught another mouse last night
<mdupont> the mpl should be gpl compatible
<jcater> our cat has been amazingly effective with our mice
<jcater> I haven't seen any this year

Nick change: mdupont -> md-party-till-mo

<derek> This is a free software license which is not a strong copyleft; unlike the X11 license, it has some complex restrictions that make it incompatible with the GNU GPL. That is, a module covered by the GPL and a module covered by the MPL cannot legally be linked together. We urge you not to use the MPL for this reason.
<derek> according to FSF legal team MPL is not GNU GPL compatiable for the record
Action: derek is not certain that compiere is MPL or not (purely going by memory)
<nickr> I thought MPL let you colicense as GPL
<nickr> or is that just how Mozilla does it
<Ogart> Later all. Have a great Halloween. 
Ogart (~chatzilla@dialup-67.73.167.211.Dial1.Chicago1.Level3.net) left irc: "ChatZilla 0.8.31 [Mozilla rv:1.4/20030624]"
<derek> nickr: it is my understanding that Mozilla Team was persauded that the MPL had "problems"
<derek> rather than them try to change the license (see poor copyright management is a no no)
<derek> they decided to switch to a "dual" license
<derek> actually let me retract that i beleive they forced copyright assignment via wordingof the MPL
<derek> but wanted to keep the MPL because of some commericial contracts already signed
<nickr> yea.
<derek> in any event Mozilla is dual licensed MPL/GPL
<derek> but the MPL is incompatiable with GPL
Action: chillywi1ly goes off to havoc's wedding
<chillywi1ly> ;P
<jcater> chillywi1ly: run!
<jcater> stop him!
<jcater> save him!
<jamest> hmmmm
<jamest> does brandy know you feel this way about mariage?
<jcater> yes
<jamest> :)
<md-party-till-mo> derek: lets look at some scenarios :
<md-party-till-mo> 1. you have a MPL licensed database schema included for compatiblity with this Compiere
<md-party-till-mo> 2. you have gpled code that will connect to that database and extract data
<md-party-till-mo> 3. we build a GNUE server that can handle that database, but still it is gpl
<md-party-till-mo> connecting to a database is not a derivitive work
<md-party-till-mo> 4. we can build a better model that encompasses the content of Compiere without copying its names or files into the new one
<md-party-till-mo> i dont see a real problem
<md-party-till-mo> we cannot just mix the compiere tables into gpled tables
<jcater> unless your just working on a compiere-to-gnue conversion script, it would make me nervous too to borrow
<md-party-till-mo> well, gnue does not do all this
<md-party-till-mo> and I am not asking you to borrow
<md-party-till-mo> i am going to do a *review* of compiere
<md-party-till-mo>  and a match of what the db does and compare that to what we have
<md-party-till-mo> and what the requirements are
<md-party-till-mo> then I can plan out what needs to be implemented still
<md-party-till-mo> the good thing about compiere are the database concepts and the design patterns
<md-party-till-mo> those can be extracted and reimplemented via a complete rewrite
<md-party-till-mo> there are only a handfull on concepts, many of the tables in there implement only aspects of a single table
<md-party-till-mo> for example, asset has like 15 tables
<md-party-till-mo> one for each transaction
<md-party-till-mo> so there is alot for me to learn
Action: md-party-till-mo writes to them and asks for permission to use the db under GPL
Action: md-party-till-mo can provide the derived works from the db under the GPL and the MPL with thier permission
<md-party-till-mo> jcater: i fwd the mail to the list
<md-party-till-mo> did you get my mail about the dbmodels?
<jcater> it went through, yes
