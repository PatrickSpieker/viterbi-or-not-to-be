<jamest> switching to the popy driver fixed my problems
<jamest> however I've not run gnue-sb
<jamest> this was on internal apps
<frayed> hmm...  I was actually going to borrow the table layout for a custom app.
<jamest> the issue I saw was the databse would store time with what I assume was microseconds
<jamest> 25-APRIL-2003 12:00:00.12345
<jamest> and when using psycopg i'd pull from the db
<jamest> 25-APRIL-2003 12:00:00
<frayed> ERROR:  Type "datetime" does not exist
<jamest> gnue-sb is using datatime?
<frayed> looks like it.
<jamest> i'm 99% sure postgresql pulled datetime in the 7.3 release
<jamest> i know it burned people
<jamest> but it was a depreciated feature
<frayed> what'd they replace it with?  Or rather, was are we supposed to use instead?
<jamest> "To ensure an upgrade path from versions of PostgreSQL earlier than 7.0,
<jamest> we recognize datetime (equivalent to timestamp) and timespan (equivalent
<jamest> to interval). These types are now restricted to having an implicit
<jamest> translation to timestamp and interval, and support for these will be
<jamest> removed in the next release of PostgreSQL (likely named 7.3)."
<jamest> -- http://www.postgresql.org/idocs/index.php?datatype-datetime.html
<jamest> i pulled that from google
<frayed> heh, I had just gotten to the page in the manual on postgres's site.  :)
<frayed> I'll do a search and replace with timestamp in the SQL file.  ;)
<jamest> sigh, i have to go to work and abuse a machine that decided to quit allowing logins
<jamest> nite everyone
<frayed> have fun

<derek> a. 7.3 still isnt in woody (iirc)
<derek> b. gnue-sb tables (many of them) came from contact stuff that is 2.5 years old

<jamest> sigh, i hate computers
<jamest> jbailey: where we at on the .debs for sid?
<jbailey> jamest: I need to work with you to eliminate the noise that the debs make when they're being installed.
<jamest> ok, so I need to just install the ones for sid and see what happens?
<jbailey> They're not uploaded yet.
<jcater> morning all
<jbailey> If you instlal the ones from that sources.list, that's them, though.
<jamest> oh mr. cater
<jamest> here cater, cater, cater
<jamest> jbailey: what sources.list
Action: jcater points to the topic
<jamest> like I ever read that 
<jamest> :)
<jamest> we need to announce the release btw
<jamest> i mean it's one thing to take 6 months on a release
<jamest> but it's kinda sad when we take another month to announce it
<jamest> :)
Action: jcater thwaps jamest
<jamest> think i could just take your email and push it up on the site
<jcater> yeah
<jamest> but that's not why i was looking for you
<jamest> that image thing i'm working on
<jamest> i need to pull incoming fax images that are not assigned to a customer
<jamest> putting this on the datasource
<jamest>     <conditions>
<jamest>       <null>
<jamest>         <cfield name="id"/>
<jamest>       </null>
<jamest>     </conditions>
<jamest> works but then I can't go into query mode, type in an id, and get results
<jcater> right
<jamest> as the conditions rightfully filter that out
<jamest> i don't want to change that behaviour as I use it to make several forms look like they're pulling from different tables though they are not
<jamest> i'm wondering if we have a way, via a on-startup trigger to do this query
<jamest> but I don't know how i'd pass in the NULL as part of the masks
<jamest> datasources dont have a problem with this but the forms client doesn't "do" null
<jcater> well
<jcater> I could think of some hackerish ways to do it
Action: jcater doesn't know a good way to do it though
<jamest> i really don't want to hack in a custom constructed conditions tree
<jamest> i really hate to break this into 2 exact same forms
<jcater>     <conditions>
<jcater>       <or>
<jcater>         <eq>
<jcater>           <cparam name="catchNull>
<jcater>           <cconst value="N">
<jcater>         </eq>
<jcater>         <null>
<jcater>           <cfield name="id"/>
<jcater>         </null>
<jcater>       </or>
<jcater>     </conditions>
<jcater> then after the first query, you could change the parameter 'catchNull' 
<jcater> that's first thing off top of my head
<jcater> I don't consider it "good form" though
<jamest> hell, that's worth implementing just as a sample :)
<jamest> as it's evil and something I'd not have thought about
Action: jamest associates the parameters dict w/ dialogs not the master form
<jcater> lol
<jcater> that's funny
<jcater> 'cause parameters were never meant for dialogs
<jcater> though they've become a nice fit
<jamest> how do I use the parameters at the main form level
<jcater> iirc there's a form-level setParameter
<jamest> do I need to set catchNull 
<jamest> there is, but I mean wrt to initialization
<jcater> I think you have to add a <parameters> section
<jcater> that defines the parameter
<jcater> if so, there you can set a "default"
<jamest> this in the guide
<jamest> ?
<jcater> beats me
<jcater> ask the fewl doing the guide
<jcater> oh, wait....
<jcater> beats me

<btami> hi all
<btami> the native win32 form client is functional now
<btami> so feel free to try and report bugs
<jamest> cool!
<btami> it misses picture support yet
<jamest> :)
<jamest> that was a last minute addition 
<btami> and some other "little" things
<btami> like tooltips
<btami> but it has better dropdown and tabbed pages support than wx (on win32)
<jamest> execellent
<jamest> i'll have to try it out
<btami> ok :)
