<jhihn1> Hi all. What are your experices with GNUe?
<jhihn1> I'm evaling it. I was going to roll my own, but then I found this.
<Vee2d2> the development team is pretty responsive.. =)
<Vee2d2> how goes your evaluation?

<jamest> hey seisel...was query by detail broken?
<jamest> i see you commited something the the sql passthru it depended upon
<siesel> I don't know if query on detail was broken or not.
<siesel> I just realized, that the sql passthrou wasn't working
Action: siesel hopes that query on detail still works ;)
Action: jamest hopes query by detail still works too....for siesel's sake
<jamest> ;)
<jamest> but that was the only thing that was added for 
<jamest> i think
<jcater> siesel: what is that webform wizard that was added yesterday?
<jcater> on the surface, that seems quite counter to our goals of a ui-independent form definition
<siesel> Its a short time solution to create html + javascript code out of a gnue-forms definition.
<siesel> In normal cases that code could/should be generated on the fly by an cgi script.
<siesel> At the moment it is more like a "compile" step. 
Action: siesel is planning to give the administrator the choice of doing the parsing of the gfd file 1. on the fly (by a cgi script) 2. direktly after a changing the gfd files 3. by the javascript client itself.
chillywilly (~danielb@CPE-24-167-199-51.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> hi Daniel
<chillywilly> ello
Action: chillywilly kicks the server box
<jamest> should a quick hack be part of designer?  or a seperate script altogther
<jamest> i mean web form sounds like a form builder for the web
<jamest> and it sounds like to works nothing like the other wizards
<jamest> s/to/it
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<siesel> would it be ok to move it from "Extras|Create Webform" to "Extras|compile to html intermediate form representation" or ...
<siesel> the reason for adding it to designer was, that its much more difficult to write a seperate script than writing a wizard
<siesel> In its form its  a bit similar to the "create Schema" Wizard, which is disabled because of schema definition changes, I think.
<siesel> I've changed the name to "Compile for jsForms" and the entry in the menu to "Extras|Compile Form for GNUe JsForms'
<siesel> hope that makes it more clear
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> if anyone wants any gift ideas for me

<jcater> would be most helpful for my foray into reports :)
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<chillywilly> no one should buy anything from amazon
Action: siesel just wonders, why you concentrate on creating Postscript instead of TEX ;)
Action: jcater is doing both
<jcater> but I know postscript in and out for one
<jcater> am not as comfortable w/TeX
<jcater> though am trying to learn
<jcater> but I also don't want a ton of paths for a report to have to go thru to get printed
<jcater> GRD -> GNUe Reports Engine -> GNUe Reports Filters -> Tex -> Postscript
<jcater> is starting to push it a bit :)
<siesel> Postscript is fine for reports.
<jbailey> jcater: Why do you know postscript?
<jbailey> Are you crazy?
<siesel> Even Tex let you import EPS files. And its using Postscript for cool text effects :)
<knick> chillywilly, why you down on Amazon?
<chillywilly> cause they filed a patent for "one-click shopping"
<knick> chillywilly, right I remember that, how is that piece of crap doing?
<siesel> btw. will/does the reports ps writer support "font embedding"?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> though isn't at the top of my list of things to finish
<jcater> but I'm putting hooks in to do that
<siesel> Cool. Does/will it even support partial font emmbedding?
Action: knick ashamedely admits to buying from Amazon _all_the_time_ ... 
Action: jcater thwaps chillywilly
<jcater> I can only boycott so many places
<chillywilly> fuck off
Action: jcater already ran out of places to buy groceries
<jcater> so I had to reconsider why I was boycotting each
Action: chillywilly slaps jcater w/ a 50lb shanook salmon
<jcater> and choose the least of the evils
<dsmith> chillywilly: Amazon will try and patent one-click mouse clicking, just watch.
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> sorry jcater that f*** off was misdirected
<chillywilly> someone in another channel is pissing me off
<knick> how easy is it to get banned from channels?
<jcater> depends on the channel
<jcater> talk about java enough here
<jcater> and you might get banned

<JamesGosling> handhelds of all sorts
<chillywilly> there'a wireless networking protocols
<jamest> and a handheld running gnue-forms in the shipping dept would rock my socks

<jcater> I have an iPAQ sitting right next to me

<JamesGosling> html has its problems on handhelds though

<jamest> figures, I step outside and the closest thing to wireless are the solar powered chargers on fence keeping the cows in
<JamesGosling> well, formatting for one, lack of reall standardization across mobile browsers for two
