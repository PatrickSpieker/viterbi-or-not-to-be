<krouzos> johannesV? r u here?
<johannesV> yes
<krouzos> can i ask something about wx? ( i think u r working on it right?)
<johannesV> of course
<krouzos> it's an encoding problem, that i only have with ui wx (gtk2 works fine)
<johannesV> what kind of problem ?
<krouzos> i can't write greek in text boxes
<krouzos> althought they are displayed correctly
<krouzos> do i have to set something in wx?
<johannesV> ah, so after jumping to the next field the text disapears ?
<krouzos> yeah!!! that :D
<johannesV> hm
<johannesV> i've already sent a bug report to the wx mailing list yesterday evening
<johannesV> the problem is a bit tricky ...
<krouzos> tricky ehh?
<johannesV> all unicode-characters generate a wx.EVT_TEXT event (containing a proper unicode-string)
<johannesV> gnue-forms has to process the wx.EVT_CHAR event (to make use of it's display-handlers)
<johannesV> and that wx.EVT_CHAR event returns a *wrong* unicode-character
<johannesV> in fact it just returns something like the latin-1 character code of the key pressed
<johannesV> it works fine on wx.MSW and appears to work on wx.Mac (not heavily tested the latter one)
<krouzos> so it has to do with wx itself and not with gnue?
<johannesV> so i want to wait for robin dunn's oppinion to this problem before taking further steps
<johannesV> yes
<johannesV> and no
<johannesV> yes, because wx.EVT_CHAR is buggy
<krouzos> ok, i just  wanted to let u know about it
<johannesV> and no, because wx.EVT_TEXT is working correct
<johannesV> (but it is not useable to gnue)
<johannesV> anyway, thank's for reporting
<krouzos> i'm just playing around here :)
<johannesV> i'm sorry i cannot do more on this atm
<johannesV> have to run for lunch now
<johannesV> bbl
<krouzos> bye
<krouzos> and thanks
<krouzos> >> [12:51] johannesV: it works fine on wx.MSW
<krouzos> it doesn't work for me in windows, too
<krouzos> wxPython2.6-win32-unicode-2.6.2.1-py24
<krouzos> that's for after lunch :)
<johannesV> krouzos, 2.6.2.1 is broken anyway (dropdowns), have you tried using 2.6.1 ?
<krouzos> nope
<krouzos> i'll do that
<johannesV> ok, thanks for checking ... hm, i'm sure GetUnicodeKey () on wx.MSW returns proper unicode-values (at least it does for me) ...
* johannesV away again

<johannesV> hm, reinhard, i've experimented with wx.EVT_MOUSWHEEL ...
<johannesV> it could be quite easy to fire previous-/nextRecord events as a result of a wheel-event
<johannesV> pb is, how to determine the block which needs to be scrolled
<johannesV> we could bind such an event to each GFEntry, so one could use the wheel to scroll the corresponding block of each control
<johannesV> (without havin a scrollbar)
<reinhard> I think we should have that in 0.6 when we have layout management
<johannesV> but that doesn't change anything to the pb, does it ?
<reinhard> and we can define which vbox/hbox would be bound to a block regarding mouse wheel events
<johannesV> ah, ok
<johannesV> so that would do the trick then
<reinhard> it could at least :)

<jamest> reinhard: any timeline for moving the beta's to release?
<jamest> i've got some stuff I'd like to commit but it's at the base app level so i'd prefer to wait till after release
<reinhard> common or forms?
*** sacha has quit IRC
<jamest> common
<jamest> minor stuff but nothing I'd want in during a beta
<jamest> i've added docs to config system and adding a sys config dir override
<jamest> as it has to be GNUEs install dir/etc atm
<jamest> i'm also in navigator
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> I think I might do today or tomorrow
<jamest> no real rush as I'm going to be away from the computer till probably thursday night (wed night maybe)
<reinhard> johannesV: what do you think about final release common+forms+appserver?
<jamest> i can easily wait another week or so
<reinhard> I don't see any need to wait longer
<reinhard> actually we must do the cut now and start with 0.6 work anyway
<johannesV> hm, i had some minor things to do in 0.5
<johannesV> bah ... i don't mind ...
<johannesV> you can start a release if you like to
<reinhard> johannesV: no problem, just let me know when you are ready
<johannesV> ok, so i give it a try today
<reinhard> no need to hurry
<reinhard> as jamest said he can wait till thursday without problems
<jamest> or this weekend
<johannesV> ok

<Shufla> hello :)
<jamest> hi
<Shufla> i've found one irclog, in which you have criticised tinyerp. there's still no contribution between tinyerp-gnue?
<reinhard> hi Shufla
<reinhard> I can't remember to have "criticised" tinyerp
<Shufla> ops. that's my english :)
<reinhard> IIRC I said I would have been happy if they had approached us for cooperation, but they didn't
<Shufla> aaah!
<Shufla> indeed!
<Shufla> and they (hey - fb@tiny) wasn't interested? :(
<reinhard> and now we both are in a project state where it's not easy to cooperate much any more
<Shufla> s/hey/he/
<reinhard> tinyerp was developed behind the curtain completely
<reinhard> and they only made things public when everything was finished more or less
<Shufla> yes. they published more or less ready-to-go product.
<reinhard> so they made it impossible for us to even ask for cooperation
<Shufla> and right now they do not put cvs/svn to public. only for partners.
<derek> i believe i contacted tiny erp
<derek> for 3 years every year i would compile all similar projects and email them for collaboration
<derek> that is how DCL got bundled under us
<derek> ARIAS got bundled (or was going to at one time) under us
<Shufla> me too!!11 ;) in my company we are looking for OS SME ERP solution, and tinyerp is one of which are interested in
<Shufla> ARIAS?
<Shufla> ok, got it
<derek> http://www.aria-erp.org/ i think is their url now
<derek> it was the original NOLA software
<derek> i think jcater and myself helped port to postgres
<derek> and did some work fixing up directory structures from original NOLA
<derek> even started making some GNUe screens for it at one point
<derek> it kind of died on the vine
<Shufla> hm. I was looking at GNUe on jan'06, but as I see it's still not ready to deployment :(
<Shufla> and my programming skills (and time) is not enough to incorporate :(
<Shufla> well, my boss want me to implement something working "alomst" right-now
<Shufla> but tinyerp core team isn't interested in much contribution, without becoming partner
<reinhard> heh
<reinhard> if you look for a project that is interested in contribution no matter from whom, gnue is the project for you :)
*** derek has quit IRC
<Shufla> well, I'll have to discuss that with my boss :) but he need some proofs of concept :)
<Shufla> well, I've got to go right now, but I'm keeping my eye on GNUe :)

<johannesV> jamest, are you around ?
<derek> no jcater is the round one ;)
<johannesV> :)
* psu is pretty round as well at times
<derek> hey psu
<psu> hi derek
<derek> the blackcats appear doomed to relegation :(
<derek> BUT
* psu got down to 20 stone but now on way back up ;-(
<derek> i now have full home and away kits, thanks to their dismal performance, people are sending me merchandise just to make fun of me
<psu> we are already preparing for promotion campaign in 2006-07
<derek> the big problem is my second favorite (the reds) are not having a good time finding the back of the net
<psu> hmm if you get a free shirt out of it, I would say make all the fun you like
<derek> so its been a disappointing season for me thus far
<derek> seeing fulham take 3 points from mourhino and the chelsea scum was fun though :)
<psu> fulham's first win vs chelsea since 1977
<derek> do you know how liverpool made out today?
* derek forgot to record it
* derek wonders if match is over or might still be on live365
* psu would just listen on bbc website 
<psu> but i believe these are barred for furriners
<psu> rights issues ;-(
*** krizz has quit IRC
<psu> only just started & liverpool are 2-0 up already
<psu> http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/birmingham_city/live_text/default.stm
<derek> YES!
<psu> has a "text commentary"
<derek> more goals than they have put in all month :) (or so it feels like)
<derek> did you see the west ham v man city game the other day
<derek> man city nearly equalized in the final minutes (great last 15 minutes)
* derek notes how pitiful it is to see some excited about trivial games, just because finding a good match on tv is so rare
<jamest> johannesV: am now
<johannesV> for the logs: accessing a form's parameters within an On-Startup trigger fails; the reason is quite simple. _parameters of a GFForm are set by the GFInstance when activating a form (as it mixes in the user parameters there). But the On-Startup trigger get's fired by the GFForm's secondary phase init (which happens on construction of the GFForm object from XML)
<jcater> anyone know of a decent streaming video editor?
<johannesV> ah
<johannesV> there he is ...
<johannesV> jcater, which video format ?
<jcater> avi or whatever
<jcater> (can convert)
<johannesV> on linux ?
<jcater> ubuntu, fink, mac... one of the 3
<derek> http://www.virtualdub.org/ ?
* jcater thought that was windows
<derek> maybe
* jcater will boot up his laptop and test it
<derek> there is a ton of stuff for mac, but not free software
<johannesV> on mac i was using iMovie HD, but i'm about to change to Final Cut
<derek> have you tried imovie?
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> buggy
<johannesV> on linux i'm using ProjectX (for the mpeg stuff recorded from dvb)
<derek> or as johannesV says Final Cut
<derek> http://www.avid.com/freedv/
<johannesV> reinhard was experimenting with kino, but i didn't like kino as it was very unstable (and knowing the mac world it felt uncomfortable)
<jcater> actually, I'm trying to find one that won't forcibly downsample my format to NTSC/HD, etc
<johannesV> so most of the time i'm using iMovie or FinalCut
<jcater> it is an 800x600 screen capture
<jcater> and avid & imovie both wanted to make it smaller, which distorted it
<derek> bummer
* jcater is making some training videos for work
<jcater> hmm
<johannesV> jamest, have you tried gauntlet.gfd after adding that param-stuff to On-Startup Trigger ?
<jamest> johannesV: i didn't add parameter stuff on on-startup
<jamest> i had a bunch of forms that used that and some recent changes to gnue-forms broke all of them :)
* derek takes the blame
<johannesV> hm
<jamest> derek: you should
<psu> i though we were only allowed to blame stuff on derek when he wasn't here
<johannesV>   8220     jamest   <trigger type="ON-STARTUP" name="trgStartup"><![CDATA[
<johannesV>   8220     jamest     value =  form.getParameter('param1')
<johannesV>   8220     jamest     if value:
<johannesV>   8220     jamest       styleFields.defaultField=value
<johannesV>   8220     jamest
<johannesV>   8220     jamest     value =  form.getParameter('param2')
<johannesV>   8220     jamest     if value:
<johannesV>   8220     jamest       styleFields.labelField=value
<johannesV>   8220     jamest   ]]></trigger>
<johannesV> that is from "svn blame gauntlet.gfd"  :))
<jamest> johannesV: how old is that though
<jamest> i know this broken recently (as in this year)
<derek> im an equal opportunity scape goat
<derek> here.  not here.  i will take the blame
<johannesV> r8220 | jamest | 2006-03-12 01:01:05 +0100 (Son, 12 Mär 2006) | 2 lines
<johannesV> start of a very basic testkit for use by other gnue packages
<johannesV> it's not very old, isn't it ?
<jamest> psu: i don't see the need to limit my blaming of derek
<johannesV> :)
<jamest> johannesV: that would have been a mistaken comit then
<jamest> from ancient edits to my local forms
<johannesV> well, i don't think that gauntlet.gfd is very importaint; but it showed that we have to think about params being available to On-Startup-Triggers
<johannesV> as this doesn't work yet
<johannesV> (which we wouldn't have discoverd if you haven't added that stuff)
<johannesV> ok, i've to run now; maybe we could talk about this before doing the actual release then ...
<johannesV> have a nice day !
*** johannesV has quit IRC
<psu> jamest: an equal opportunity blamer. good.
<jamest> johannesV: but it DID work in forms up until just recently
<jamest> it's what our production forms here used until a recent install from svn broke unimportant features such as our ability to process payments
<jamest> psu: i also blame derek for the weather, my receeding hair line, any odd issues at work
<psu> jamest - you can try blaming him for this
<jamest> psu: pretty much anything that I care for
<jamest> s/care/ don't care/
<psu> http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/4778496.stm
<psu> Mind, as far as I can tell, derek himself is only person in whole of North America who cares ;-/
<derek> not true.. i know one other american that likes sunderland in arizona
<derek> he just wont admit it ;)
* psu guesses it's the reyna link
<derek> that is what got me started
<derek> plus i love an underdog
<jamest> psu: sounds like something derek would be responsible for causing
<derek> and EVERYONE here pretty much is Arsenal or ManU fan
* psu used to be a san diego chargers fan for similar reasons
