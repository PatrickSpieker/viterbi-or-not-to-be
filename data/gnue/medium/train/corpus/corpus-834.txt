<ajmitch> hi

<kilo> good morning

<btami> morning
*** lekma has joined #gnuenterprise
<lekma> morning everyone
<jcater> morning
<lekma> reinhard: you around?
<reinhard> yes
<lekma> do you think it'd be possible to have type, length and scale returned from a load(clas, [[]], propertylist) instead of a fullType string?
<lekma> otherwise i have to regexp or split or whatever the string to find out what i need
<reinhard> theoretically yes, however we use that internally so it would break compatibility just once again
<lekma> oh
<lekma> so no?
<reinhard> and we would like to avoid that
<lekma> ok
<reinhard> we would have to look where we use it
<lekma> that would have been my next question: where is it used?
<reinhard> language/Object.py is something I find
<reinhard> there it is used to determine whether something is a procedure or a property
<reinhard> and if it is a property, it selects plain property and reference property
*** johannesV has joined #gnuenterprise
<reinhard> alternatively you could query the gnue_class and gnue_property classes directly and not use the load (class, [[]], propertylist) hack at all
<johannesV> good morning
<lekma> morning johannesV
<johannesV> hi lekma
<lekma> there's less code involved with load :)
<johannesV> bad news for wx26-driver regarding unicode-problems: we have to enter a bug-report agains wxPython, but robin dunn isn't sure if he can fix that at all
<johannesV> lekma, are that good or bad news ?
<reinhard> johannesV: is that the "no EVT_CHAR for special characters" bug?
<lekma> johannesV: ??
<johannesV> reinhard, yes
<johannesV> lekma, as you've mentioned there is less code involved with load
<johannesV> is that good for you or is that bad ?
<lekma> it's good
<reinhard> johannesV: that was related to a discussion we are having
<johannesV> or do i need to backread the logs :)
<lekma> having less code
<johannesV> ah, ok, so i *do* backread the logs
<johannesV> ok, now i see
<johannesV> dimas_, are you around ?
<johannesV> is anybody here using unicode-characters for form-input on windows ?
<dimas_> johannesV: yep
<dimas_> hello all
<johannesV> hi dimas_
<johannesV> what ui-driver are you currently using and on which os ?
<dimas_> gtk2 in linux
<johannesV> ah, ok, thanks; that should work (at least for the unicode-stuff)
<reinhard> to be honest I can't understand why it should not be fixable - as all the events are there and correct in gtk2, it shouldn't be impossible to pass them through correctly through the wx layer
<johannesV> reinhard, he said something about the native control taking away that ime-event ...
<johannesV> but we'll see
<johannesV> the request-id is 1455924
<johannesV> i'll add a bug-report to our roundup, pointing to the bug-report in wxPython
<johannesV> ok, bug-report submitted to roundup
*** yure has quit IRC
<johannesV> reinhard, shall i close the bug-report 66 (closing form with sqlite3)
<johannesV> ah, it's issue 58
<reinhard> I think I have closed that, haven't I?

<lekma> a session.list sends data from cache if available, correct?
<lekma> is there a way to refresh the cache?
<lekma> session.rollback()?
<lekma> s/session.list/session.request()
<reinhard> a session.request will always do a new query on the backend
<reinhard> bbl, off to lunch
*** reinhard has quit IRC
*** btami has quit IRC
<lekma> reinhard: if you read it, i tested multiple requests with changes in the db in between
<lekma> the result is always the same
<lekma> ie changes in db are not reflected
*** reinhard has joined #gnuenterprise
<reinhard> back
<reinhard> changes done by another transaction?
<lekma> manually changing in db
<kilo> i can affirm that
<reinhard> that is a different transaction
<reinhard> that is isolated by the db
*** johannesV_ has joined #gnuenterprise
<reinhard> you must start a new transaction (commit or rollback) got get changes from other transactions
*** johannesV has quit IRC
<lekma> reinhard: ok
<reinhard> which I think is not only acceptable but even necessary
<reinhard> as it would be strange if, for example, you did the same query 2 times in a row just with different sorting and you get different result sets
<lekma> well, data changed, so to me it would seem normal
<lekma> even "required"
<lekma> :)
<reinhard> it's a matter of transaction isolation
<reinhard> it is not even a feature of appserver, it's a feature of postgres we use here
<reinhard> (or the other backends)
<kilo> could anyone test it if ggcvs works ok? if i use it, it put every line in the gsd file 2 times...
<kilo> s/put/puts
<lekma> bbl
<johannesV_> kilo, i will double-check ... just starting db host first ...
<kilo> thx
<johannesV_> kilo, i can confirm it ... all rows are duplicate ?!
<johannesV_> will investigate
<kilo> all rows, indeed
<kilo> thx in advance
<kilo> btw it does not harm any functional thing, ie the gsd can be imported without any trouble... but it is double sized...
<johannesV_> well, the gsd is doubl in size which does affect re-loading with gnue-schema (which in fact is not really optimized for handling large files)
<kilo> indeed
<johannesV_> oh, wow
<johannesV_> all field lists contain each field twice
<kilo> wow
<johannesV_> hm, all props are doubled in the classdef of the repository item
<johannesV_> ahhhh
<johannesV_> f****
<johannesV_> ok, will fix it
<kilo> \o/
<johannesV_> kilo, svn update and retry
<kilo> thx
<kilo> trying
<kilo> it's ok, thx for the fix johannesV_
<johannesV_> no problem

<siesel> hello
<jamest> hi
<siesel> jamest: what time is it over there?
<jamest> 9:06am
<siesel> here its 0:00.
*** johannesV has joined #gnuenterprise
<siesel> its really bad, always when I want to start coding, ... I should go to bed. :(
<siesel> hi johannes
<siesel> what was the info with the IME event?
<siesel> I just read the logs bad dunno what you mean concerning wx
<johannesV> siesel, i've added a bug-report against wxPython
<johannesV> siesel, the wxEVT_TEXT has the proper unicode-string, but the wx.EVT_CHAR does not show up the proper key-code
<siesel> ok
<johannesV> but we cannot use wx.EVT_TEXT since we have to put the displayHandler in between so it can decide wether a keypress is valid or not (i.e. max-length, format-mask, and so on)
<siesel> I think gtk2 works by using the equivalent to EVT_TEXT, but has a way to stop the event
<siesel> Or that is the way it was two years ago :)
<johannesV> yeah, haven't looked into pygtk recently
<siesel> Can we use EVT_TEXT as a fallback solution?
<johannesV> no
<johannesV> as this would break the displayHandler
<johannesV> (although i'm seriously thinking about it)
<siesel> I mean, it shouldn't be affected by setValue, so it should be only called via "bad" unicode characters
<johannesV> at least it would be a 'dirty' workaround
<siesel> yes
<siesel> where can I get a good description about EVT_TEXT?
<johannesV> it would result in strange, flickery widgets ... just think of an enty having a maxlength of 5. pressing the 6th character and holding it down, results in a flickering character
<johannesV> which is there and then disappears and so on
<johannesV> additionally, having format-masks is quite complicated then
<johannesV> as EVT_TEXT has only the complete contents of the widget
<johannesV> not just the last character pressed (which is evt_char [obviously])
<siesel> I aggree, that just using EVT_TEXT is bad
<johannesV> the signal chain is wx.EVT_CHAR (and if not skipped) wx.EVT_TEXT
<johannesV> but not for all characters
<johannesV> there are some unicode-characters which are built from multiple characters
<siesel> yes, I would guess that characters which come from input methods go directly to EVT_TEXT
<johannesV> if i change the input-method to cyrillic for example
<johannesV> and then enter abcd
<johannesV> i get the following result:
*** klasstek has joined #gnuenterprise
<johannesV> onCHAR: 97
<johannesV> onTEXT: u'\u0430' at 0
<johannesV> onCHAR: 98
<johannesV> onTEXT: u'\u0430\u0431' at 1
<johannesV> onCHAR: 99
<johannesV> onCHAR: 100
*** klasstek has quit IRC
*** klasstek_ has joined #gnuenterprise
<johannesV> onTEXT: u'\u0430\u0431\u0446' at 2
<johannesV> onTEXT: u'\u0430\u0431\u0446\u0434' at 3
*** klasstek_ has quit IRC
<johannesV> onCHAR shows the result of GetUnicodeKey () function of the wx.EVT_CHAR event
*** klasstek has joined #gnuenterprise
<johannesV> where onTEXT shows the GetString () result of wx.EVT_TEXT and the current insertion point of the widget
<siesel> and because gnue just uses the result of EVT_CHAR  just abc is printet instead of u'\u0430\u0431\u0446'
<johannesV> as you can see the "c" generates an onCHAR only (but with a wrong keycode)
<johannesV> well, i'm not really clear about the value of GetUnicodeKey ()
<johannesV> shouldn't that reflect the value of say, \u0430 ?
<johannesV> (= 4*256 + 3 * 16)
<johannesV> instead of 97 (=a)
<siesel> no, as I think that getchar just get the direct keypress
<johannesV> or can you explain that ime-thing
<johannesV> yeah
<siesel> I cannot try it out at the moment with chinese, but I imaging the following:
<siesel> all real keypresses are catched via EVT_CHAR
<johannesV> yes, that would fit to the result shown above
<siesel> when I insert a chinese charater like 我  which is writte WO3
<johannesV> just a sec, do you have to press a W, 0, 3 to get that char ?
<siesel> then i would press "w" "o" "3" and go down with the arrow keys to choose one out of a douzend characters which is spelled that way
<siesel> so probably also up and down keypresses would be send down via EVT_CHAR
<johannesV> hm, but that would mean wx.EVT_CHAR could never be enough for us
<siesel> and when I finally press space the character I've chosen will be send to the screen
<johannesV> insteat we have to look for a solution using EVT_TEXT anyway
<siesel> and an EVT_TEXT would be called
<siesel> in principle we need something in between,
<johannesV> hm
<johannesV> i cannot stop the emission of a wx.EVT_TEXT
<siesel> or a way to detect if EVT_CHAR is called in IME mode
<johannesV> what would be the benefit of that ?
<siesel> that would solve the cyrillic becomes latin case.
<johannesV> whose property is "IME mode"
*** derek has quit IRC
<siesel> if EVT_CHAR is in cyrillic mode or chinese ime input mode and  EVT_CHAR would  be called and terminated, then no cyrillic or chinese would be entered, but just normal letters
<johannesV> and otherwise ?
<siesel> otherwise, the characters would be passed through and converted via the IME into unicode characters
<siesel> these characters should be intercepted asap by a kind of EVT_CHAR2 event, but if this is not possible, we have to use EVT_TEXT
<siesel> btw. do you already have some kind of small wxpython testprogram for this issue?
<johannesV> yeah
<johannesV> (really small)
<siesel> cool
<siesel> could I try it?
<siesel> because I want to test the difference between  gtk2 chinese IME module, which should work as described above, and the XIM input method, which I have used till now.
<johannesV> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~johannes/input.py
<reinhard> must run off for today
<reinhard> cu tomorrow
*** reinhard has quit IRC
<johannesV> it's just a dialog having two entries with both handlers bound
<siesel> the XIM input method doesn't create EVT_CHAR events at all, as real keypresses are handled by the XIM server, which will finally sends the unicode characters to the application via XIM protocoll
<johannesV> you're using the sample-program ?
<siesel> yes. works fine.
<siesel> I just have to install another part of the gtk2 chinese input method handler (apt-get install uim-gtk2.0)
<siesel> sorry I was mistaken, in case of japanese input method no EVT_CHAR are produced at all
<johannesV> ok, so the situation is even worse
<siesel> I would like to know the meaning of EVT_CHAR in windows context
<siesel> hopefully just the gtk2 driver has to be adapted
<johannesV> how could this be checked on windows ?
<siesel> by just using f.e. chinese or japanese input method
<siesel> ok, starting up win32 chinese on a second comp.
<johannesV> wow
<johannesV> great
<johannesV> i've checked with greek
<siesel> and?
<johannesV> and i get a wx.eVT_CHAR with values like 968
<johannesV> looks good
<siesel> cool
<johannesV> try a japanese now
<siesel> so probably its a wxGTK bug
<johannesV> yeah, it looks like
<johannesV> it would be great to check it on os x to
<johannesV> but i've to find out how to change the im there first ... :)
<johannesV> as i'm quite new to os x
*** Shufla has joined #gnuenterprise
*** derek has joined #gnuenterprise
<siesel> os x is cool,  I think it should work very smooth there
<siesel> there should be an IME setting box in the overall settings
<siesel> installing wx2.6
<siesel> did the japanese character worked for you?
<siesel> ok, chinese is working
<johannesV> no, as i couldn't select it there
<johannesV> there is no japanese on my xp
<johannesV> looks like i've just set my mac to simple chinese ... and now i'm trying to get back
<johannesV> :)
<siesel> lol
<siesel> if you find the command to make a screen shot I can help you :)
<siesel> I confirmed chinese and japanese on my win2k, seems to be alright
* siesel trying to give some a advice
<johannesV> ok
<johannesV> so it really looks like a bug in wxGTK
<siesel> do you find the characters 格式化 ?
<johannesV> (as i've added the bug-report against wx.GTK)
<johannesV> i'm about to reboot the mac now
<siesel> ok,
<johannesV> (as i've use another account to look at the order of the settings and controls)
<johannesV> :)
<johannesV> ah
<johannesV> great, everything's in latin-1 again
* johannesV phu
<siesel> ok, but in case you see these characters, don't push it, as it means format ;)
<johannesV> *lol*
<johannesV> i'm very sorry but i've to leave now for a while ...
<johannesV> bbl
<siesel> ok, cu and good night.
<johannesV> i'll backread the logs
<johannesV> yeah, thanks ... good night to you too :)
<siesel> I should have been sleeping already one h.
<siesel> cu
<siesel>  :)
