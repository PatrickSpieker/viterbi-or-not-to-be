<btami_> siesel: btw. the connection.gfd doesn't works for me (on win32)
<siesel> :(
Action: siesel has an idea, why it doesn't work :)
<btami_> it doesn't find connections.conf IIRC
<siesel> you are using the installer version of gnue on win32, i.e. the connections.conf file is in /Programs/gnue ... instead of C:\PYTHON21\etc\
<btami_> y
<btami_> yes, it works if i use "setup.py install"  method
<btami_> but doesn't with packaged setup
<btami_> the placement.gfd fails too
<btami_> with 'There are no navigable widgets in this form...'
<siesel> yep. The only strange thing is, that it sometimes works ;)
<btami_> maybe it depends from wx version
<btami_> i remember it woked before for me too
<btami_> but i installd a newer wxpython
<ra3vat_> btami_: hi, does i18n (translated messages and menus) work with packaged install?
<btami_> yes
<btami_> and hi :)
<siesel> btami: placement.gfd works on debian with wxwindows  2.3.3.2
<siesel> having webpage which displays on which architecture which testcases ist working (or not) would be great
<btami_> the dependencies page is waiting for voluteers too :)
<btami_> siesel: btw how do you want to use the static datasources ?
<btami_> a real example?
<siesel> I would use it for something like the first part of the datasource/static example

<KeithJagrs> hmm
<KeithJagrs> I realise that
<jcater> btami uploaded updates to http://www.extra.hu/berado88
<KeithJagrs> forn win32?
<chillywilly> siesel: you meant RUNME scripts in the parser?
<jcater> I haven't had a chance to verify and copy to our main download directory yet though
<jcater> KeithJagrs: yeah
<KeithJagrs> good
Action: chillywilly just caught that comment
<chillywilly> siesel: my excse is that it was late and I needed to sleep ;)
<chillywilly> excuse
<siesel> could you just add same code to atest?
<chillywilly> atest.py?
<chillywilly> eventually
<chillywilly> I don't have time right now
<siesel> That would be better than having heaps of RUNME script ....
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> I thin each module should have a self test
<siesel> that would be great.
<KeithJagrs> http://www.extra.hu/berado88 is not working. Is there any info missing? port perhaps?
<chillywilly> if __name__ == "__main__": type stuff...that just a good convention
Action: siesel hopes to build the first pre-alpha version of js-forms-client tonight and more time for appserver then
<chillywilly> you da man
<ariel_> siesel: i noticed today from cvs that you added something related to '.gear' files, but there isn't any gear file in the whole cvs tree, what they are supposed to be?
<chillywilly> one thing you have to realize I haven't had time to read much of your code in _featuretest
<siesel> cw: doesn't matter, I hope that I can provide some design description, documentation etc. before the european gnue developer meeting
<siesel> ariel_: an .gear file is a zip file containing gfd's gpd's grd's etc.
<siesel> but you can directly access them.
<siesel> to try it just use the Makefile in gnue/samples to create a samples.gear. Then you can use navigator to access the .gear file and its whole content.

<mandor> hi ?
<ajmitch> hi
<mandor> I'm looking for a multi-platform way to access to DB2 and Oracle Databases, maybe some guys here have some advice ?
<btami> python ?
<mandor> C/C++
<btami> we use only python here :)
<ariel_> mandor: try unixodbc
<mandor> ariel_: I'm on the website, but the only oracle odbc driver I found was expensive :/
<ariel_> mandor: try also freeodbc they have free drivers.
<mandor> thx, I'm checking this
<ariel_> it seems me (but i can mistake) that along with oracle8 personal edition distro there is also odbc driver 
<mandor> ariel_: oracle has an odbc driver on its website, but it's windows-only
<ariel_> mandor: if you don't have to deal with legacy databases why not considering to switch to more free (or better open source) db's?

<siesel> hi all
<mandor> I have to deal with oracle & db2 database (at least). I'm working on a tool which connects to a client's database (I'm not building new databases, just accessing existent ones)
<ariel_> hi siesel
<siesel> hi ariel_
<ariel_> siesel: reinhard: for Frankfurt, there is any accomodation or do i nedd to provide by myself?
<reinhard> you should provide for yourself
<reinhard> it would be great if you could come
<ariel_> i dunno, it depends mainly on work
<reinhard> i would recommend staying in the InterCityHotel because that's where the meeting will be
<reinhard> ok
<ariel_> thx
<ariel_> there is www address of the hotel?

<Arturas> cool :)

<Arturas> --
<Arturas> as i understand in the beginning
<Arturas> it checks for and defines environment variables
<Arturas> but what does it do at the end???
<Arturas> (it's from setup-cvs.py)
<jcater> which part?
<Arturas> middle
<Arturas> about 350 lines
<lupo> you mean PYTHONPATH=%(BASEDIR)s:$PYTHONPATH; export PYTHONPATH ?
<jcater> err, I meant which part of what you pasted
<Arturas> sorry
<Arturas> yes
<Arturas> 3 bottom lines
<Arturas> not the last one :) that i understand :)
<Arturas> --> %(PYTHONBIN)s %(GNUEDIR)s/%%s "$@"
<jamest> PYTHONPATH=%(BASEDIR)s:$PYTHONPATH; export PYTHONPATH
<jamest>  %(PYTHONBIN)s %(GNUEDIR)s/%s "$@"
<jamest> those lines?
<Arturas> yes
<Arturas> we define and export python path and what do we do then?
<jamest> run python
<Arturas> i guess we execute something
<jcater> yes
<jcater> %(PYTHONBIN) would expand to /usr/bin/python2.1
<jcater> (or such)
<Arturas> and to what expands '%%s'?
<jcater> %(GNUEDIR) would expand to something line cvs/gnue/
<jamest> the gnue tool IIRC
<jamest> like the forms client .py file
<jcater> then %s would be whatever's passed to the method you are looking at
<jcater> e.g., forms/GFClient.py
<jamest> or ther reports client
<Arturas> i think that %%s should have to expand into something more concrete
<Arturas> i take it from setup-cvs.py
<jcater> Arturas: it does
<Arturas> and i guess neither
<jcater> it's not expanded by bash
<jcater> it's replaced by python
<jamest> passes in via the  % globals()
<Arturas> ok, but what's put instead the %%s?
<jcater> def createCVS (scriptdir,script,py):
<jcater>   script = "%s%s" % (script, SUFFIX)
<jcater>   print "Creating %s" % os.path.join(scriptdir, script)
<jcater>   file = open(os.path.join(scriptdir, script),'w')
<jcater>   file.write(cvsbase % py)
<jcater> ok, at this point
<jcater> cvsbase has had all %(PYTHON*)s stuff expanded out
<jcater> but the %s doesn't get expanded
<jcater> until this last line I pasted
<jcater> so it gets replaced with whatever's in "py"
<Arturas> ah
<Arturas> understood
<Arturas> and what is $@ ?
<jcater> that's a bash construct
<jcater> basically that's passing all command line parameters unchanged to the python binary
<jcater> so if I do
<lupo> Arturas: a shortcut for $1 $2 $3 ... -> all parameters
<jcater> gfcvs test 1 2 3
<jcater> it ends up calling:  python2.1 /path/to/GFClient.py test 1 2 3
<Arturas> aha
<Arturas> understood :)

<jamest> the def I was implying
<jamest> 3 : a small or annoying thing <put down my keys and now I can't find the buggers>

<jcater> cursing == GNUe's curses widget toolset
<StyXman> curses as in ncurses?
<jamest> yes
<jamest> it's the highly modified code originally based upon nstti
<StyXman> and why in common?
<jcater> because it's common to our code
<jamest> there isn't a curses library out there at the moment that does what we require or that is maintained
<jamest> we had this on seperate cvs server out of main code base but that made it harder to get fixes into it
<StyXman> ah, ok.

<crazymike> chillywilly: I shole am
<chillywilly> did eth1 come up by itself this time?
<crazymike> no
<crazymike> it is eth0
<crazymike> thats why
<ajmitch> hi chillywilly, crazymike
<chillywilly> HEH
<crazymike> i had to switch it
<crazymike> hi ajmitch
<ajmitch> dtm: afaik 'sophia' is greek for wisdom ;)
<dtm> ajmitch: interesting
<chillywilly> yep
<dtm> those silly Greeks!
<chillywilly> philosophy
Action: dtm watched "Yanni: Tribute" last night
<chillywilly> comes from 2 wors
<chillywilly> one is sophia
<dtm> 31337
<chillywilly> the other is somehting else and it mena study
<chillywilly> means
<chillywilly> philosophy is the study of wisdom
<chillywilly> hey I did learn me something afterall ;)
<chillywilly> philo is study, iirc
<chillywilly> sophia is wisdom
<dtm> how appropriate
<chillywilly> something like that
<chillywilly> my bad
<chillywilly> philosphy is the love of wisdom
<chillywilly> not study
<dtm> You tried.
<dtm> That's what counts.
<dtm> chillywilly: must a GNU project be under GPL/LGPL?  what about GPL compatible according to www.gnu.org?
<chillywilly> not sure
<KeithJagrs> derek:
<chillywilly> philo == love, sophia == wisdom...there that's the ticket ;)
<KeithJagrs> I am inthe gnukose site
<KeithJagrs> have you discarded zope or plone, etc?
<jcater> what's the topic of conversation?
<chillywilly> this is cool
<chillywilly> Based upon what has been described above, our working definition of philosophy will look something like the following:
<chillywilly> PHILOSOPHY = "A critical examination of reality characterized by rational inquiry that aims at the Truth for the sake of attaining wisdom."
<chillywilly> man I wish I could've taken philosophy of religion...that would've been a fun course
<jcater> lots of reading
<ajmitch> doubtful
<jcater> lots and lots of reading
Action: jcater knows :)
<ajmitch> at a secular university, they generally attack religion :)
<chillywilly> ajmitch: why?
<chillywilly> ajmitch: bah, not my philosophy proff he was awesome
<ajmitch> chillywilly: because that's what a lot of universities are like :)
Action: chillywilly took jst about every philosphy course at MSOE except philosophy of religion
<chillywilly> it didn't fit my schedule the last quarter
<chillywilly> conflicted with some stupid class I had to take
<ajmitch> from what i know, at the uni i'm at they use philosophy to 'prove' that all faith is a load of ****
Action: jcater thinks that really depends on the professors
<derek> zope is not workflow
<chillywilly> ajmitch: isn't that sorta retarded for a uni named after a saint?
<derek> dtm: no a gnu project need not be under the GPL or LGPL but generally its HIGHLY preferred
<ajmitch> chillywilly: uhh, university of otago is not :)
<chillywilly> oh yea that's the dorm you're in
<ajmitch> yup
<chillywilly> my bad
<chillywilly> ajmitch: yea, this is the normal plato-worshipping philosopher's take that faith is crap ;)
<chillywilly> my proff was a little more open minded then that ;)
<chillywilly> you know what I find funny is how these philosophers then go and start their own gnostic religion anyway ;)
<chillywilly> go figure :)
<dtm> derek: but it must be GPL compatible, right/
<dtm> ajmitch: by "faith", do you mean "belief in God"?
<KeithJagrs>  <derek> zope is not workflow
<KeithJagrs> i know 
<KeithJagrs> but is CMS
<KeithJagrs> and on top of it is plone and openflow
<ajmitch> dtm: belief in any higher power :)
<dtm> oic
Action: chillywilly meant God
<ajmitch> chillywilly: yes, but they go beyond that here :)
<chillywilly> of course ;)

<ajmitch> hey psu
<psu> hi
<psu> well, linux expor uk was interesting
<psu> smaller than I expected (40-50 stands) but still interesting
<psu> good mix of 
<ajmitch> GNUe stand?
<psu> a) the big boys (Sun, Oracle, IBM) come to explain their linux strategy
<psu> b) small to medium size IT firms based around GNU/Linux
<psu> c) the "dot-orgs"
<psu> ajmitch: not this year, maybe next
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> next year, when GNUe is taking the world by storm...
<psu> I got the organisers' details & will contact them once 
<psu> they re-awake from winter hibernation ;-)
<ajmitch> ok
<psu> My main purchase was the double-sided Debian DVD which I bought direct from the Debian stand
<ajmitch> ooh nice
<psu> along with a fetching Debian t-shirt
<ajmitch> wish i had a DVD drive :)
<ajmitch> i'll have the tshirt tho, want my postal address? ;)
<psu> T-shirt is extra large to fit me ;-)
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> would be about right for me then :)
<psu> Having had to do at least 20 disc swaps to resolve all the circular depends 
<psu> when going potato -> woody,
<ajmitch> ouch
<psu> suddenly a single DVD install looks quite attractive
<psu> ;-)
<psu> Of course, it's worth remembering *why* Debian bitch-slaps you about depends in the first place
<psu> it really is for your own good
<ajmitch> yeah
<psu> but does make for a longer install
<ajmitch> i haven't used a cd since my first install :)

<psu> ajmitch: well, as a dial-up user, physical media of some sort is preferred
<psu> hi btami
<btami> hi psu
<ajmitch> psu: i'm not using much more than dialup
<psu> good work on the windows .exes ;-)
<btami> :)
<psu> also seen at linux expo : www.jalia.com
<psu> if you were trying to design something to be the ant-GNUe, 
<ajmitch> huh?
<psu> s/ant/anti-
<psu> this would be it 
<psu> a) non-free
<psu> b) Java
<ajmitch> ooh, eeeeevil
<psu> c) postgres only
Action: ajmitch grabs a bucket & throws up
<ajmitch> hey at least it's not mysql-only ;)
<psu> actually, I'm *assuming* it's non-free - website's not clear
<ajmitch> it is
<psu> but talks about an "evaluation version", which would be an oxymoron for free as in speech
<ajmitch> "You are allowed to make one copy of the Program for back-up purposes provided you clearly label the back-up copy. Any other copies of the Program, whether as a whole or in part, made without the prior written consent of Jalia, are unlawful and in breach of this Agreement;"

<jcater> I should add that he also usually proves that he is one himself.

<siesel> hi
<siesel> jcater: the nstti driver doesn't work. Seems like an UIapp module/file is missing.
<jcater> I wouldn't mess w/that right now
<jcater> I have so much stuff outstanding
Action: jcater is working on it at the moment
<jcater>  http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/curses-intro.png
Action: siesel is just curious, but will wait till the next commit to do some testing :)
<jcater> it's no where near production ready :)
<jcater> although at the rate I'm going, it could be at the end of the day
Action: siesel would be happy to say that of the jsclient too :(
<jamest> jsclient?
<siesel> gnue forms written in javascript (i.e. mozilla)
<siesel> simple forms are working allready, but that just means a maximum of 10% of the work

zoyd (~zoyd@203.199.133.142) joined #gnuenterprise.
<zoyd> hi.
<zoyd> does gnue-forms now do gtk2 natively, i.e. not through wxGTK ?
<jcater> we had a gtk2 driver given to us
<jcater> that has been put into cvs
<jcater> (it is native)
<jcater> I'm honestly not sure how feature complete it is
<jcater> compared to the wxgtk driver
<jcater> but I think it's pretty far along
<jcater> but I haven't had the opportunity to test it, so I can't say whether "far along" means "usable" or not
<zoyd> so i guess this is the first time something other than wx* has gone in for gui forms ?
<jcater> we almost have a curses version too
<jcater> but we do consider the "wx" to be the "reference" implementation right now
<jcater> simply because it gave us the most bang for the buck
<jcater> in the near future, we'd like to see a native QT version
<zoyd> hmm.
<jcater> and a native Win32 version
ninja (~rossg@195.112.17.56) left irc: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)
<zoyd> another question about Reports. how does it work with dot matrix printers.
<zoyd> is it resourceful on the rybon ?
<jcater> well
<jcater> the reports package is not nearly far along as the forms package
<jcater> it's only at 0.0.2
<zoyd> or does it consume it like those win32 report programs.
<jcater> so it isn't spitting out reports for production use yet
<jcater> it would not consume as much
<jcater> as one of my requirements is that it talk to the printer natively
<jcater> i.e., send actual text
<jcater> not pictures of the pages
Action: jcater thinks the windows programs use truetype fonts, etc, then render graphics to send to the printers
<jcater> that has its place of course
<jcater> and you could do that if you wanted
<jcater> but that's just doing injustice to dot-matrix printers :)
<jamest> i would think it'd be as hard on the printer as you'd like
<jamest> as you could have your own output filter
<jamest> what little I've gotten into it i would think you could do dump text w/o too much issue
<zoyd> ok. I think fast printouts through something like GNUe is the key. that rhymed ;)
<zoyd> jamest: cool :)
<jamest> zoyd: reports is pretty cool
<jamest> thanks to jcater's mad coding skills he hacked a fax spammer filter up for me
<jamest> so we could send reports to various schools
<jamest> 1 year ago this required a student worker to hand fax 500 reports 
<jamest> i can't believe the poor s.o.b. didn't go mental on us :)
<zoyd> hehe
Action: zoyd searches for that page mentioning which parts are production level and which are not
<zoyd> I had tried GNUe about a year ago. It must've been changed quite a bit since, isn't it ?
<jamest> depends :)
<jamest> yes it's changed quite a bit
<jamest> but it's in spurts
<zoyd> so, is gnue used to create production systems already ?
<jamest> yes and no
<jamest> i use it here in production
<jamest> for small projects
<jamest> we've got interfaces to a few other pre-existing systems that make some things easier
<jamest> but there is no pure GNUe system
<nickr> I still like dom better than sax, but its annoying how appearently complex it is.

<ratmice> hmm, anyone using appserver from windows? 
<jamest> not i
<jcater> nor i
<ratmice> i have appserver running on a linux box, trying to use it with windows forms seems to hang the windows forms client...
<ratmice> has something to do with the connections.cof
<ratmice> changing though it works directly talking to the database

<siesel> ratmice: I've read in the log that you had problems to use appserver (on linux) from forms (on windows), right?
<siesel> which rpc adapter did you use?
<ratmice> xmlrpc
<siesel> the xmlrpc client should work on windows, although the pw_xmlrpc one is possibly a bit more stable
<siesel> you said that forms was hanging. Did it directly hangs or does it connected to appserver before?
<siesel> You could see that from the appservers output (gacvs/gnue-appserver -Z)
<ratmice> well, the gnue-forms executable launches and then exits
<ratmice> i don't even get the auth form
<siesel> ok, that seems to be a problem with the installation of xmlrpc on windows.
<siesel> did you use the installer version or the zip files?
<ratmice> installer
<siesel> possibly xmlrpc isn't included in the installer  version
<ratmice> thanks
<siesel> thank you :)

<crazymike> windows 2000 administration
<ajmitch> umm WHY?
<crazymike> what a waste of time
<crazymike> it is required
<ajmitch> required for what?
<crazymike> isn't there only one way to administer it? re-install?
<crazymike> for my networking degree
<ajmitch> ah
<crazymike> so, whats new ajmitch 
<ajmitch> very little
<ajmitch> haven't even played with GNUe tools lately
<ajmitch> jcater: you been a busy boy lately!
<ddttmm> crazymike: but it's the most accessible OS for all the students!  *all* they need is a $1000 product license apiece, right?
<ddttmm> or is it down to more like $500 these days
<ddttmm> for the server stuff
<ddttmm> and then voila!  you've got a server *anyone* can understand!
<ajmitch> ddttmm: depends if it's a compulsory part of fees ;)

<crazymike> lol
<crazymike> it is quality stuff man
<crazymike> :)
<ajmitch> students are getting reamed
<ddttmm> heheh oh yeah, "we've changed the class from Network Administration 101 to Windows Network Administration 101.  in a related note, we're raising the price of tuition from $30 to $1030."
<crazymike> my professor and I were arguing linux vs windows
<crazymike> lol
<ddttmm> crazymike: oh BOY
<crazymike> he was about to start yelling, he must be a windows fanatic
<ddttmm> hey in the college of architecture at KSU when i was at KSU, they had a mandatory purchase of a LAPTOP and AUTOCAD for everyone just for being enrolled
<crazymike> it was funny
<ddttmm> so that's like $8000+ on top of everything
<ajmitch> ouch
<crazymike> yeah, there are a few schools around here like that
<ddttmm> this was in like 1997, buying autocad-capable laptops.
<crazymike> not the autocad
<crazymike> but the laptops
<ajmitch> here we have to use redhat in the labs! the horror! :)
<crazymike> ajmitch: lol
<ddttmm> crazymike: yelling?!
<ddttmm> crazymike: seriously how much does the softwre cost
<ajmitch> and we have to pay the uni $5NZ for a cd if we want a copy!!
<crazymike> he wasn't actually yelling, but he was about to
<ddttmm> ajmitch: hehe
<ddttmm> crazymike: so you say "I'M RIGHT, YOU'RE WRONG BYE!" and ran away?
<crazymike> pretty much
<ajmitch> or we can download it from a uni server & burn it if we have blanks :)
<ddttmm> oic
<ddttmm> ajmitch: leet
<crazymike> he was like "but if windows breaks at least you have a throat to choke"
<ajmitch> iirc one of the admins is setting up a local debian mirror as well
<crazymike> i was like "WHEN windows breaks"
<ajmitch> heh
<ddttmm> what the fuck?!
<ajmitch> the only thing you can do when windows breaks is take out your frustration
<ajmitch> soon if things break you'll have to pay MS for fixes ;)
<crazymike> pretty much
<ddttmm> what kind of psychopath admin would *want* to call someone else up when their software breaks?  as opposed to being able to fix it themselves?
<ddttmm> or to subcontract anyone to fix it
<crazymike> ddttmm: yeah thats what i was saying
<ddttmm> for what sick mind would that even be an option?
<ajmitch> someone who likes shifting blame!
<ddttmm> what does a sysadmin do, if not that?
<ddttmm> (fix it, not shift blame, i mean ;)
<ddttmm> tee hee
<crazymike> i was like "you can sit on the phone and wait for hours, or you can jump on IRC and get a fix in minutes" :)
<ddttmm> crazymike: well either that or rtfm or read the source or buy a support contract from the 283702709153205 linux companies
<ddttmm> crazymike: is he daft?
<ddttmm> or what
<ddttmm> is he teachable?  :)
<ajmitch> not many sysadmins would jump on IRC
<ddttmm> doesn't sound good
<crazymike> i think he is a part-time professor, and full-time at McDonalds
<jcater> ajmitch: yeah
<ddttmm> crazymike: hahahahaha
<jcater> been quite busy
<jcater> 0.5.0 is almost ready :)
<crazymike> ddttmm: he is a bit loopy
<ddttmm> i once had a substitute high school teacher who was 40+ yrs old, lived with his mom, and was a fulltime stockboy at Sears
<ddttmm> crazymike: great.
<crazymike> ddttmm: LOL
<ddttmm> crazymike: yeah they brought him in when the normal teacher got put in the hospital that morning or whatever ;>
<crazymike> my unix professor was great
<ddttmm> like when the principle can't step in
<ddttmm> or the school nurse ;)
<crazymike> ddttmm: they went to Sears and got him?
<ddttmm> crazymike: well just be sure and have well formed responses to your professor buddy
<ddttmm> crazymike: talk about open standards so you can pick the best tool for the job, and say that all software has paid support and contracts no matter what form the source code license comes in
<crazymike> it was just before class, he is up there making a fool of himself right now
<ajmitch> which means that slashdot is a bad resource for facts, ok?
<ddttmm> crazymike: flat out evangelism doesn't work on people lik ehtat
<crazymike> ajmitch: lol
<crazymike> oh, there is no evangelism from me
<ddttmm> ajmitch: if you filter it wrong, yes :)   you must have a bulletproof mental slashdot filter!
<crazymike> i could care less what he thinks
<ddttmm> crazymike: well even normal talk doesn't work usually
<ajmitch> ddttmm: slashdot sometimes has a rare gem or two
<ddttmm> crazymike: it's all about the TCO reports, the paid support, the open standards, and the low cost of R&D
<ddttmm> ajmitch: yes and depending on the topic, there may be all gems
<ajmitch> ddttmm is THE master at advocacy!
<ddttmm> i'd say half of slashdot is amazing
<ddttmm> i search it for everything
<ajmitch> ddttmm: fool's gold, perhaps ;)
<ddttmm> it's one of my top resources, but certainly far from the only one.  i go there for esoteric tribal knowledge basically.
<ddttmm> but that's only coz i know how to read it

<jcater> anyone here played w/neighborhood wireless before?
<jamest> nope
<ajmitch> hi hi
<ajmitch> not yet
<ajmitch> was at a local wireless group meeting the other night :)
<jcater> I just measured the distance between our house and our bookstore
<jcater> it's between 0.2 and 0.3 miles
<ajmitch> planning for an eventual city-wide MAN
<jcater> which is closer than I realized
<ajmitch> jcater: you can get up to 25 miles with directional point-point
<jcater> there is one row of trees between us
<ajmitch> so 0.3 is no problem if there's no obstructions
<ajmitch> hmm
<jcater> (and residential houses)
<jcater> we have a 2 story though
<ajmitch> trees can be worse in winter
<jcater> it's a single line of trees
<ajmitch> when they get wet
<jcater> not like a forest
<ajmitch> right
<ajmitch> go to max signal strength at both ends, good cards, good directional antennae, and test
<jcater> you have any links to recommended equipment?
<ajmitch> just a min...
Action: jcater figures with the cost of broadband
<jcater> it wouldn't take me long to recover the costs
<jcater> of doing a one-time wireless to my house
<ajmitch> www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/CategoryHardware
<jcater> vs having broadband in 2 places
<ajmitch> apparantly cisco cards are good
<jcater> ouch
<ajmitch> prism2 chipsets work well with GNU/Linux, in HostAP mode
<jcater> I'm sure that name shoots the price up
<ajmitch> yeah
<Mr_You> 25 miles for what?
<ajmitch> http://seattlewireless.net/?HardwareComparison
<ajmitch> Mr_You: 802.11b 
<Mr_You> ahh ok
Action: jcater thought it was closer to 2.5 miles
<jcater> I guess I'm out of touch :)
<ajmitch> nope
<Mr_You> 25 miles could be askin for trouble ;-)
<ajmitch> had adam shand, top personaltelco person, talking at the LUG the other night
<ajmitch> he's an ex-dunedin person, so it was quite good :)
<ajmitch> #wireless on freenode is also good
<ajmitch> ah, the seattle wireless page looks good
<Mr_You> I can't see 25 miles realistic unless 2Ghz phones aren't sold/used in your area ;-)

<ajmitch> Mr_You: it was on the edge of portland on a clear day, iirc :)
<Mr_You> multiple points?
<ajmitch> point-point
<ajmitch> one of which was on the back of a truck :)
<Mr_You> two points only, spanning 25  miles?
<ajmitch> yup
<Mr_You> if a 25 mile 802.11b signal lasted more than a year, I'd be satisfied.
<Mr_You> but the FCC might shut it down
<ajmitch> it was a one-off thing
<Mr_You> ok, yeah I don't see it as a realistic setup.
<Mr_You> maybe possible, but not realistic.
<Mr_You> better off with multiple access points, bridging one another.
<ajmitch> yup
<Mr_You> my orinoco/lucent card works fine with linux.
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> i think prism2 chipsets are the only ones capable of HostAP
<Mr_You> the latest wincrap driver is trash tho
<Mr_You> HostAP?
<ajmitch> yeah, running a linux box as an AP
<Mr_You> hmm
jbailey (~jbailey@65.48.140.35) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> yo jbailey
<jbailey> Hyea Andrew
<Mr_You> that is builtin to the driver?
<ajmitch> Mr_You: it's an option
<ajmitch> http://personaltelco.net/index.cgi/HostApMode
<Mr_You> in the driver only?
<ajmitch> afaik, yes
<ajmitch> i don't have the hardware
<ajmitch> it's dependant on the card
<Mr_You> hmm.. well.. is ad-hoc/computer-to-computer the same as being a NAP?
<ajmitch> don't think so
<Mr_You> my wincrap orinoco driver has ad-hoc capability
<Mr_You> wait a minute
<ajmitch> right, i think most of them do
<Mr_You> I would agree with you, but the Apple Airports use the same card as this orinoco
<ajmitch> adhoc mode isn't hostAP mode, there's a difference in protocol
<ajmitch> Mr_You: hmm, read the personaltelco.net wiki & tell me what you think :)
<Mr_You> ok, maybe some other time ;-)
<ajmitch> it'd be nice to use them, but you'd have to hack your own firmware
<ajmitch> which is why only the prism2 work in hostAP mode currently :)
<Mr_You> who makes prism2?
<ajmitch> intersil makes the chipsets
<ajmitch> lots & lots of card manufacturers use them
<Mr_You> one day, I'd like to use this laptop as a satelitte broadband connection.. so I could hook it up ad-hoc or up to the airport.
<ajmitch> http://personaltelco.net/index.cgi/Prism2Card
<ajmitch> that'd be nice
<Mr_You> unfortunately itwould require a Wincrap gateway <-> satelite
<ajmitch> ugh
<ajmitch> hack time! ;)
<Mr_You> well I'm sure someone is out there working on a direcway satellite driver
<Mr_You> I think someone has, but its for commercial apps
<ajmitch> yeah, no free drivers :(

<ddttmm> subversions can be used for standard document control, right?  revisoining all file formats and file sizes?
<psu> I would guess it's like CVS - fully functional with text files and the like (e.g. html)
<psu> where it can do diff/patch magic
<ddttmm> cvs isn't entirely binary-safe though, right?
<psu> but still usable for binary files such as Open Office as well
<psu> ISTR that the only problems with CVS & binaries are if you have a mix of 
<psu> Win32 and *nix clients
<ddttmm> i wonder if OO.o's files would be easier to revision as pure xml rather than xml.gz
<psu> as CVS tries to be "too clever" and 
<psu> adjust for ^Ms in binary files as well unless you tell it not to.
<psu> ddttmm: undoubtedly, but I'm not aware of any way of making it 
<ddttmm> mmmmm
<psu> save as pure XML
<psu> If so, please tell me, as I have a project I want to use OOo and CVS together on
<ddttmm> similarly, psu's irc client is optimizing for ^M by inserting carriage returns in totally random portions of sentences!
<psu> "share and enjoy"
<ddttmm> i dunno but i'd imagine you could simple gunzip them, huh?
<psu> yes, but I really want to be able to work in XML native - otherwise I have to 
<psu> a) do CVS check out
<psu> b) re-gzip the files
<psu> c) work on them
<ddttmm> well i just wonder if you can insert gzip/gunzip transparently in your cvs process
<psu> d) re-ungzip the files
<psu> e) check them in
<ddttmm> like in a single script that does ci/co
<psu> I could probably bash together a simple script
<psu> just wondering if anyone has already done something I could re-use
<psu> Also, I have yet to look at what revision tracking OOo has inside itself anyway
<ddttmm> you should check openoffice.org and the associated mailing lists huh
<psu> yeah, I know 
<psu> I just have this bad habit of using #gnuenterprise as my personal wiki/helpdesk

<KeithJagrs> Hello
derek (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<KeithJagrs> what are the current  both propietrary and GPL apps that GNUe aims to rival?
<KeithJagrs> Great Plains, for instance?
<KeithJagrs> If there's any. I mean for Small to Medium Business
<KeithJagrs> Discarding SAP, PeopleSoft and the alikes
<derek> currently forms is almost feature complete to Oracle SQL*Forms product
<derek> can replace Access (for applications *not query building*)
<derek> reporter has no equals that i can tell (reportlabs (free software) might be the closest)
<derek> but even BIG vendors like crystal reports and business objects dont really have a 'server' with caching and transformation like we do
<KeithJagrs> I see
<derek> designer is similar to filemaker pro, delphi, powerbuilder or visual basic (only specific for business applications)
<derek> app server would be similar to any app server on the market only with additional features
<derek> that woudl be 'tool' comparisions
<KeithJagrs> aha
<derek> dcl is similar to MANY free software applications like request tracker and such
<derek> as similar to commercial applications like support magic or the likes
<derek> acclite would be similar to netledger, sql*ledger etc
<derek> the backend stuff is like nothing comparable in free software world that i know of and only the BIG end has it in the proprietary end
<derek> by backend i mean shipping automation, warehouse management, order management etc etc etc
<KeithJagrs> uh huh
<KeithJagrs> great
<KeithJagrs> So you have a well defined roadmap
<KeithJagrs> hmmm. This is maybe a silly question. But which modules would you use to run a call center'?
<KeithJagrs> For inbound calls
<derek> no we dont
<derek> have a well defined roadmap it is next on the list
<KeithJagrs> oh. I see
<derek> after the 0.4.0 release
<KeithJagrs> well you seem so sure of the mid and long term goals
<derek> well having in head and having official roadmap are two different things
<derek> most of the core team has an idea of what the road map is
<derek> just some finer points arent ironed out and none of it is official down digitally for others to review
Action: derek is away: softball

<KeithJagrs> question: 
<KeithJagrs> while working with gnue, you don't have to deal with tkinter of wxpython, do you?
<ajmitch> wxpython? we use that all the time :)
<KeithJagrs> :)
<KeithJagrs> hehe
<KeithJagrs> I mean ,  a gnue user
<KeithJagrs> if he wants to customize something
<KeithJagrs> That's what designer and forms are for..
<KeithJagrs> Isn't that so?
