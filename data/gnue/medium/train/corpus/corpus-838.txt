<mandor> hi ?
<ajmitch> hi
<mandor> I'm looking for a multi-platform way to access to DB2 and Oracle Databases, maybe some guys here have some advice ?
<btami> python ?
<mandor> C/C++
<btami> we use only python here :)
<ariel_> mandor: try unixodbc
<mandor> ariel_: I'm on the website, but the only oracle odbc driver I found was expensive :/
<ariel_> mandor: try also freeodbc they have free drivers.
<mandor> thx, I'm checking this
<ariel_> it seems me (but i can mistake) that along with oracle8 personal edition distro there is also odbc driver 
<mandor> ariel_: oracle has an odbc driver on its website, but it's windows-only
<ariel_> mandor: if you don't have to deal with legacy databases why not considering to switch to more free (or better open source) db's?

<Arturas> cool :)

<Arturas> --
<Arturas> as i understand in the beginning
<Arturas> it checks for and defines environment variables
<Arturas> but what does it do at the end???
<Arturas> (it's from setup-cvs.py)
<jcater> which part?
<Arturas> middle
<Arturas> about 350 lines
<lupo> you mean PYTHONPATH=%(BASEDIR)s:$PYTHONPATH; export PYTHONPATH ?
<jcater> err, I meant which part of what you pasted
<Arturas> sorry
<Arturas> yes
<Arturas> 3 bottom lines
<Arturas> not the last one :) that i understand :)
<Arturas> --> %(PYTHONBIN)s %(GNUEDIR)s/%%s "$@"
<jamest> PYTHONPATH=%(BASEDIR)s:$PYTHONPATH; export PYTHONPATH
<jamest>  %(PYTHONBIN)s %(GNUEDIR)s/%s "$@"
<jamest> those lines?
<Arturas> yes
<Arturas> we define and export python path and what do we do then?
<jamest> run python
<Arturas> i guess we execute something
<jcater> yes
<jcater> %(PYTHONBIN) would expand to /usr/bin/python2.1
<jcater> (or such)
<Arturas> and to what expands '%%s'?
<jcater> %(GNUEDIR) would expand to something line cvs/gnue/
<jamest> the gnue tool IIRC
<jamest> like the forms client .py file
<jcater> then %s would be whatever's passed to the method you are looking at
<jcater> e.g., forms/GFClient.py
<jamest> or ther reports client
<Arturas> i think that %%s should have to expand into something more concrete
<Arturas> i take it from setup-cvs.py
<jcater> Arturas: it does
<Arturas> and i guess neither
<jcater> it's not expanded by bash
<jcater> it's replaced by python
<jamest> passes in via the  % globals()
<Arturas> ok, but what's put instead the %%s?
<jcater> def createCVS (scriptdir,script,py):
<jcater>   script = "%s%s" % (script, SUFFIX)
<jcater>   print "Creating %s" % os.path.join(scriptdir, script)
<jcater>   file = open(os.path.join(scriptdir, script),'w')
<jcater>   file.write(cvsbase % py)
<jcater> ok, at this point
<jcater> cvsbase has had all %(PYTHON*)s stuff expanded out
<jcater> but the %s doesn't get expanded
<jcater> until this last line I pasted
<jcater> so it gets replaced with whatever's in "py"
<Arturas> ah
<Arturas> understood
<Arturas> and what is $@ ?
<jcater> that's a bash construct
<jcater> basically that's passing all command line parameters unchanged to the python binary
<jcater> so if I do
<lupo> Arturas: a shortcut for $1 $2 $3 ... -> all parameters
<jcater> gfcvs test 1 2 3
<jcater> it ends up calling:  python2.1 /path/to/GFClient.py test 1 2 3
<Arturas> aha
<Arturas> understood :)

<jcater> cursing == GNUe's curses widget toolset
<StyXman> curses as in ncurses?
<jamest> yes
<jamest> it's the highly modified code originally based upon nstti
<StyXman> and why in common?
<jcater> because it's common to our code
<jamest> there isn't a curses library out there at the moment that does what we require or that is maintained
<jamest> we had this on seperate cvs server out of main code base but that made it harder to get fixes into it

<dtm> it's definately Mexican
<dtm> hey, tell GNU to use the Google Appliance!  ;)  haha
<chillywilly> wb crazymike
<dtm> running on a Netapp!
<dtm> crazymike: werd
<dtm> chillywilly: sup
<crazymike> thank you
<crazymike> it is good to be back
<chillywilly> dtm: sup g
<chillywilly> crazymike: your running 2.4.19?
<crazymike> yep
<dtm> derek: must a GNU project be under GPL/LGPL?  what about GPL compatible according to www.gnu.org?
<crazymike> chillywilly: I shole am
<chillywilly> did eth1 come up by itself this time?
<crazymike> no
<crazymike> it is eth0
<crazymike> thats why
<ajmitch> hi chillywilly, crazymike
<chillywilly> HEH
<crazymike> i had to switch it
<crazymike> hi ajmitch
<ajmitch> dtm: afaik 'sophia' is greek for wisdom ;)
<dtm> ajmitch: interesting
<chillywilly> yep
<dtm> those silly Greeks!
<chillywilly> philosophy
Action: dtm watched "Yanni: Tribute" last night
<chillywilly> comes from 2 wors
<chillywilly> one is sophia
<dtm> 31337
<chillywilly> the other is somehting else and it mena study
<chillywilly> means
<chillywilly> philosophy is the study of wisdom
<chillywilly> hey I did learn me something afterall ;)
<chillywilly> philo is study, iirc
<chillywilly> sophia is wisdom
<dtm> how appropriate
<chillywilly> something like that
<chillywilly> my bad
<chillywilly> philosphy is the love of wisdom
<chillywilly> not study
<dtm> You tried.
<dtm> That's what counts.
<dtm> chillywilly: must a GNU project be under GPL/LGPL?  what about GPL compatible according to www.gnu.org?
<chillywilly> not sure
<KeithJagrs> derek:
<chillywilly> philo == love, sophia == wisdom...there that's the ticket ;)
<KeithJagrs> I am inthe gnukose site
<KeithJagrs> have you discarded zope or plone, etc?
<jcater> what's the topic of conversation?
<chillywilly> this is cool
<chillywilly> Based upon what has been described above, our working definition of philosophy will look something like the following:
<chillywilly> PHILOSOPHY = "A critical examination of reality characterized by rational inquiry that aims at the Truth for the sake of attaining wisdom."
<chillywilly> man I wish I could've taken philosophy of religion...that would've been a fun course
<jcater> lots of reading
<ajmitch> doubtful
<jcater> lots and lots of reading
Action: jcater knows :)
<ajmitch> at a secular university, they generally attack religion :)
<chillywilly> ajmitch: why?
<chillywilly> ajmitch: bah, not my philosophy proff he was awesome
<ajmitch> chillywilly: because that's what a lot of universities are like :)
Action: chillywilly took jst about every philosphy course at MSOE except philosophy of religion
<chillywilly> it didn't fit my schedule the last quarter
<chillywilly> conflicted with some stupid class I had to take
<ajmitch> from what i know, at the uni i'm at they use philosophy to 'prove' that all faith is a load of ****
Action: jcater thinks that really depends on the professors
<derek> zope is not workflow
<chillywilly> ajmitch: isn't that sorta retarded for a uni named after a saint?
<derek> dtm: no a gnu project need not be under the GPL or LGPL but generally its HIGHLY preferred
<ajmitch> chillywilly: uhh, university of otago is not :)
<chillywilly> oh yea that's the dorm you're in
<ajmitch> yup
<chillywilly> my bad
<chillywilly> ajmitch: yea, this is the normal plato-worshipping philosopher's take that faith is crap ;)
<chillywilly> my proff was a little more open minded then that ;)
<chillywilly> you know what I find funny is how these philosophers then go and start their own gnostic religion anyway ;)
<chillywilly> go figure :)
<dtm> derek: but it must be GPL compatible, right/
<dtm> ajmitch: by "faith", do you mean "belief in God"?
<KeithJagrs>  <derek> zope is not workflow
<KeithJagrs> i know 
<KeithJagrs> but is CMS
<KeithJagrs> and on top of it is plone and openflow
<ajmitch> dtm: belief in any higher power :)
<dtm> oic
Action: chillywilly meant God
<ajmitch> chillywilly: yes, but they go beyond that here :)
<chillywilly> of course ;)
