<btami_> siesel: btw. the connection.gfd doesn't works for me (on win32)
<siesel> :(
Action: siesel has an idea, why it doesn't work :)
<btami_> it doesn't find connections.conf IIRC
<siesel> you are using the installer version of gnue on win32, i.e. the connections.conf file is in /Programs/gnue ... instead of C:\PYTHON21\etc\
<btami_> y
<btami_> yes, it works if i use "setup.py install"  method
<btami_> but doesn't with packaged setup
<btami_> the placement.gfd fails too
<btami_> with 'There are no navigable widgets in this form...'
<siesel> yep. The only strange thing is, that it sometimes works ;)
<btami_> maybe it depends from wx version
<btami_> i remember it woked before for me too
<btami_> but i installd a newer wxpython
<ra3vat_> btami_: hi, does i18n (translated messages and menus) work with packaged install?
<btami_> yes
<btami_> and hi :)
<siesel> btami: placement.gfd works on debian with wxwindows  2.3.3.2
<siesel> having webpage which displays on which architecture which testcases ist working (or not) would be great
<btami_> the dependencies page is waiting for voluteers too :)
<btami_> siesel: btw how do you want to use the static datasources ?
<btami_> a real example?
<siesel> I would use it for something like the first part of the datasource/static example

<KeithJagrs> hmm
<KeithJagrs> I realise that
<jcater> btami uploaded updates to http://www.extra.hu/berado88
<KeithJagrs> forn win32?
<chillywilly> siesel: you meant RUNME scripts in the parser?
<jcater> I haven't had a chance to verify and copy to our main download directory yet though
<jcater> KeithJagrs: yeah
<KeithJagrs> good
Action: chillywilly just caught that comment
<chillywilly> siesel: my excse is that it was late and I needed to sleep ;)
<chillywilly> excuse
<siesel> could you just add same code to atest?
<chillywilly> atest.py?
<chillywilly> eventually
<chillywilly> I don't have time right now
<siesel> That would be better than having heaps of RUNME script ....
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> I thin each module should have a self test
<siesel> that would be great.
<KeithJagrs> http://www.extra.hu/berado88 is not working. Is there any info missing? port perhaps?
<chillywilly> if __name__ == "__main__": type stuff...that just a good convention
Action: siesel hopes to build the first pre-alpha version of js-forms-client tonight and more time for appserver then
<chillywilly> you da man
<ariel_> siesel: i noticed today from cvs that you added something related to '.gear' files, but there isn't any gear file in the whole cvs tree, what they are supposed to be?
<chillywilly> one thing you have to realize I haven't had time to read much of your code in _featuretest
<siesel> cw: doesn't matter, I hope that I can provide some design description, documentation etc. before the european gnue developer meeting
<siesel> ariel_: an .gear file is a zip file containing gfd's gpd's grd's etc.
<siesel> but you can directly access them.
<siesel> to try it just use the Makefile in gnue/samples to create a samples.gear. Then you can use navigator to access the .gear file and its whole content.

<jcater> are you installing the latest releases (0.4.0) or from cvs?
<chillywilly> crazymike: it's locked up?

<jcater> yes to which?
<crazymike> no, not locked up
<chillywilly> switch VTs
<crazymike> i can type but can't see what i am typing
<chillywilly> force it to redraw itself
<crazymike> it is the same
<chillywilly> it has that stupid FB console right?
