<reinhard> good morning all
*** derek has quit IRC
<johannesV> good morning
*** btami has joined #gnuenterprise
<reinhard> johannesV: I just noticed that dialog boxes in the wx26 driver are not modal
<reinhard> the "go to record" box and the about box both allow the main form to be clicked while the box is still open
<reinhard> then the cursor even blinks in the main form
<reinhard> but I can't type anything
<reinhard> --
<reinhard> johannesV: you're still able to use wx (24) driver and win32 driver, right?
<reinhard> could you please test if menu bar and toolbar still works as expected with these drivers?
<reinhard> (after my last commit)
<btami> reinhard: have you read my yesterday traceback?
<reinhard> oh yes
<btami> ok
<reinhard> I completely forgot about that, thanks for reminding
<btami> btw. the latest released gnue-reports doesn't work with gnue-common
<reinhard> that's bad
<reinhard> should we do a release of gnue-reports now? would that help?
<btami> it needs GRParser .py and GRSources from svn head to work
<btami> trying...
*** kilo has joined #gnuenterprise
<kilo> good morning
<btami> hi kilo
<dimas_> good morning
<btami> reinhard: nope, it needs svn common too
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> so we might want to look into releases for common and reports at least
<reinhard> actually latest release of forms *should* work with svn common
<btami> dunno
<reinhard> (because I don't want to release forms in the middle of this stuff we are doing)
<btami> i think non use released reports yet
<btami> except me :)
<kilo> :)
<kilo> i tried i tried :)
<btami> lol
<reinhard> btami: about your traceback yesterday
<reinhard> can you please svn up and see if you can reproduce?
<btami> yes
<reinhard> (although I think nothing should have changed here)
<btami> same error (with gtk2 uidriver only)
<reinhard> when you open the form and then go to query mode, does that traceback, too?
<btami> Traceback (most recent call last):

<reinhard> hmmmm
<reinhard> is the first focusable widget on that form a button?
<btami> yes
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> I can reproduce
<btami> bingo, if i put it to be second it's ok
<reinhard> did you change that lately?
<reinhard> or did it work with button first before johannes' changes?
<btami> yes, lately
<reinhard> ok, so it could be that the problem was there since ever?
<reinhard> (however, I wonder why it works with old wx driver at all)
<kilo> it was there earlier iirc
<johannesV> reinhard, the dialgs *are* shown modal ... i would say it's a bug in wx that the mouse-click is sent to (and handled by) the parent-window
<reinhard> johannesV: oh, ok
<reinhard> can you investigate further?
<johannesV> running it on msw it works as intended
<johannesV> so it appears to be a wxGTK bug
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> on msw
<reinhard> do you have an hourglass cursor while your mouse is outside the dialog?
<johannesV> on wxMac it works fine too
<johannesV> no, there's no hour-glass ... should it be there ?
<reinhard> I'm not sure
<reinhard> (did you svn up?)
<johannesV> if so we'd have to change the cursor for the parent-frame
<reinhard> I set the mouse to hourglass immedately on toolbar click
<johannesV> ah, ok
<johannesV> just a sec
<johannesV> hm, that damn svn ...
<johannesV> have to wait for the first timeout ...
<johannesV> this could take some time
<btami> strange
<btami> svn works ok here
<johannesV> reinhard, for which frame are you changing the cursor ?
<btami> no first timeout needed
<johannesV> btami, that's a problem which only affects jamest and me ... :(
<btami> hmm
* johannesV still waiting for timeout
<kilo> maybe j* problem? :D
<johannesV> yah
<johannesV> we'd have to ask jcater then ... :)
<kilo> :)
<reinhard> johannesV: I just do a wx.beginBusyCursor()
<johannesV> hm, but then what kind of cursor is set for the new dialog ?
<reinhard> if there's something better, please tell me (or change in wx26/Udriver.py beginWait()
<reinhard> honestly I just copied that over from the old wx driver :)
<johannesV> oh, time out ....
<johannesV> svn running now
<johannesV> ok, the hour-glass blinks for a very short time
<reinhard> hmm...
<reinhard> I'm trying to find *any* modal dialog in a gtk2 app
<johannesV> ok, hour-glass also blinks on msw
<johannesV> reinhard, the dialog is modal
<johannesV> as it stays on top of the parent
<reinhard> yes
<johannesV> the pb is, that one is still able to focus another widget of the paretn
<reinhard> I think for gtk2 modal dialogs *always* allow the main window to be focussed again
<johannesV> maybe
<johannesV> reinhard, what shall i check wrt toolbar on msw/mac ?
<reinhard> just if query, delete, undelete, exit work
<reinhard> with menu and with toolbar
<reinhard> especially with old wx driver and with win32 driver (as I can't test for those)
<johannesV> ah, ok , so i need a database ...
* johannesV sending wol-call downstairs ...
<btami> i'm just trying wx26 on XP, but the spalsh is before the startup error box, so i can't read the error msg unless turn off splash in gnue.conf
<johannesV> hmm, i think there should be a fix to hide the splash in the exception handler ...
<johannesV> btami, can you add a bugreport to roundup ?
<btami> yep
<reinhard> btami: can you work around the button-is-first-control-on-form bug for now? I think it might take some time to fix this properly
<btami> sure
<reinhard> ok, I'll add this one to roundup then
<btami> thx
<reinhard> two new bugs within 2 minutes
<reinhard> not a good day ;-)
<btami> i have another 2
<btami> designer tracebaks with unicode error with this form
<btami> forms with win32 ui too
<johannesV> reinhard, win32-driver seems to be ok with menu and toolbar
* btami is fighting to correct overlapping errors without designer
<johannesV> btami, i'm sorry for that ... but it must have been done at some point in time ... :(
*** kilo_ has joined #gnuenterprise
<btami> nevermind, it's my bad
<johannesV> reinhard, wx-driver is ok too
<reinhard> johannesV: thanks for testing
*** kilo_ has left #gnuenterprise

<reinhard> contains non-ascii chars?
<btami> yep
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> I don't think this is allowed at all
<btami> it was no pb before
<reinhard> you could fix it for this traceback by adding a repr() around the "entry" also
<reinhard> or even better
<reinhard> replace %s by %r
<reinhard> (which results in the same thing)
<reinhard> bbl
<btami> aha, i have to use caption too
<btami> ok, solved with caption
<johannesV> hm, maybe i've introduce that bug wrt page-captions ...
<johannesV> let me have a look
<johannesV> ah, no should work well
