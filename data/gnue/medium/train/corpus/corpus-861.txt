<reinhard> question
<reinhard> dropdowns (or other entries with a list of allowed values
<reinhard> )
<johannesV> like a listbox
<reinhard> currently when a wrong value is entered, the complete entry is deleted and the field is set back to empty
<reinhard> and the cursor moves out of the entry
<reinhard> and no error message is displayed
<reinhard> I consider this a bug and would think the correct behaviour would be
<reinhard> display error message in status line, beep, leave the input as it was (so I can just correct my typo) and leave the focus in the entry
<reinhard> would you agree?
<johannesV> yes
<johannesV> i agree
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> i'd agree that the dropdown should block invalid input
<jamest> but i'm thinking about situations where input is based upon previous input
<reinhard> this is just about invalid input from field definition
<reinhard> i.e.
<reinhard> not in _allowedValues
<reinhard> invalid date
<reinhard> invalid number
<reinhard> etc
<jamest> lets say that I have a list of vendors "Abes", "Bobs", and "TOms"
<jamest> ah, nevermind
<jamest> :)
<reinhard> the point is
<reinhard> when you now type "Abex" and hit enter
<reinhard> the field is reset to "blank" and you don't even see/hear any feedback
<reinhard> at least that's what it does for me
<reinhard> (did, before the last commit, to be precise)

<reinhard> hmmm
<reinhard> interesting problem
<reinhard> I've managed to block tabbing out of a control as long as the entered value is invalid
<reinhard> so when you hit tab or enter gnue-forms just beeps and shows an error message
<reinhard> however I seem to have no means to block moving the focus to another widget with the mouse
<reinhard> so you can still click out of a control even when the value is invalid
<reinhard> does anybody have any idea about this?
*** llp has joined #gnuenterprise

*** llp has quit IRC
<reinhard> ok, I think I found a solution that behaves fairly reasonable
<reinhard> but I guess it needs testing on different UIS
<reinhard> Us
<reinhard> grr
<reinhard> UIs
<reinhard> I can confirm that it works on gtk2 and wx26

<reinhard> hi johannesV
<johannesV> good morning
<reinhard> if you have time, please test my changes of yesterday with different uis
<johannesV> ok
<johannesV> something special to look at ?
<reinhard> about mouseclicking out from an invalid entry
<johannesV> ok
<johannesV> is there a prepared gfd ?
<reinhard> as there is no way of blocking the foucus change if it was done with a mouse click
<reinhard> I tried the idea to just focus back into the invalid entry immediately
<reinhard> it seems to work for wx26 and gtk2
<reinhard> you can use any gfd with dropdowns in it
<reinhard> just enter something invalid in the dropdown
<reinhard> appserver sample.gfd should be ok
<johannesV> ok
<johannesV> updating svn takes a while here ... :(
<johannesV> btw. there was little response on the wx-mailing list regarding the grid problem
<johannesV> looks like some guys have implemented a grid-control (derived from wx.grid) which is capable of handling multiple rows per logical record
<johannesV> but it appears as the have troubles with selecting a row as well as moving around in a logical way
<johannesV> i've installed gnuecash yesterday to get a look at how they did it there ...
<johannesV> (looks like is a kde app, isn't it ?)
<reinhard> no
<reinhard> it's a gtk1 app
<johannesV> reinhard, bad news ...
<johannesV> clicking out of a field having a min-length constraint ends up in a never-ending loop of error-message "minimum length is 4" ...
<reinhard> please don't test min length
<johannesV> use gauntlet.gfd to check ...
<johannesV> ah, ok
<reinhard> I just noticed that min length is checked at a *completely* other point than other constraints (like allowed values, valid date/time etc)
<johannesV> yeah, that's not a good solution right now
<johannesV> looks to work on wx26, although there are some weird things happening when using the mousclick to change a notebook page ..
<johannesV> but i think that is a pb we've already discussed a while ago
<johannesV> where the change of the page should be vetoed befored
<johannesV> s/befored/before/
<reinhard> I would even think that you can commit a record where an entry is below the min length
<reinhard> you just can't tab out of it
<johannesV> should your change work on win32 too ?
<johannesV> or just on other platforms using wx26 ?
<reinhard> on all UIs
<johannesV> ok, then here we go:
<johannesV> on wx clicking into another entry moves the UI-focus to that entry, but keeps GF-focus in the dropdown. entering new text goes still into the dropdown - the errormessage appears in the statusline
<johannesV> on win32 clicking into another entry moves both ui- and gf-focus into the new field, no message, no error. the value of the dropdown is the first one which was available depending on my input
<reinhard> gack!
<johannesV> e.g. i'm entering Foo into the country-name. after clicking out of it, Falkland Islands is set
<johannesV> using wx26 on win works as intended
<johannesV> btw. leaving the ctrl with a tab on win32 clears the field completley
<reinhard> you test with sample.gfd?
<johannesV> yep
<reinhard> can you do same test with invalid date instead of invalid dropdown value?
<johannesV> ok, let me search for a date-field ...
<reinhard> born
<johannesV> yeah, could it be that 'Select-all' is no longer workin ?
<johannesV> on wx26 i'd say it's working, aside from the wrong input-cursor-position after clicking out of the entry. while the cursor was after the last char before the click it is before the first afterwards

<johannesV> win32: nothing happens at all - like it was with the dropdown; no message, no error
<kilo> good morning
<johannesV> wx: same as with dropdowns. ui-cursor is in the new entry. gf-layer still in the born-field (with cursor before start)
<johannesV> good morning kilo
