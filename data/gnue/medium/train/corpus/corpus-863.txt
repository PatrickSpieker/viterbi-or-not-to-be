*** reinhard has joined #gnuenterprise
<reinhard> good morning
*** kilo has joined #gnuenterprise
<reinhard> sorry if this is a stupid question, but
<reinhard> can I print directly to a printer with gnue-reports under windows?
*** johannesV has joined #gnuenterprise
<johannesV> good morning
<kilo> good morning
<reinhard> wow, zipgrid looks very nice already
<johannesV> yah ... although the code still needs a lot of 'lifting'
<johannesV> and it supports only default-entries atm
<dimas> reinhard: is there a screenshot?
<dimas> good morning all
<johannesV> dimas, for which os do you like to see the screenshot ?
<kilo> DOS
<kilo> 6.22
<johannesV> well, curses is not yet up to date but i'll get it there ...
<kilo> ;)
* reinhard slaps kilo with a trout
<reinhard> was about time
<reinhard> ;-)
<kilo> nooo not a fish... anything but fish
<reinhard> chilliwilly is not as reliable as he was
<reinhard> ;-)
<kilo> lol
<kilo> any chance to release soon? translator tools getting rusty :)
<dimas> johannesV: for linux would be ok, win32 too
<reinhard> anybody using gnue-reports on windows?
<kilo> svn or release?
<reinhard> either
<reinhard> just want to know whether you can print directly
<reinhard> or you have to generate a pdf which you then manually print
<kilo> we use release inhouse
<kilo> oh... we generate a txt file and print that
<kilo> *maybe* it is possible though
<reinhard> ok, I think I'll ask jcater later
<reinhard> thanks anyway
<reinhard> kilo: forms is still a highly moving target
<reinhard> and I frankly don't expect any release before holiday season is over
<kilo> ok, will be away from 13-29
<kilo> ah ok
<reinhard> we will see forms 0.6 by the end of the year
<reinhard> but we might do something like a 0.5.90/91/92 series in between
<kilo> would be nice
<kilo> and appserver?
<johannesV> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~johannes/zipgrid-gtk.png  and http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~johannes/zipgrid-xp.png
<reinhard> there have been nearly no changes in appserver since the last release IIRC
<reinhard> same goes for common
<kilo> wow johannesV... it is so 'enterprise-level-like'
<reinhard> hmm... appserver *had* some changes regarding performance improvements
<reinhard> kilo: you're right, we should do releases
<reinhard> but I won't do before my holiday (which starts the day after tomorrow)
<kilo> ok, not pushing it....
<reinhard> lol - reading this in a mail .signature:
<reinhard> Have you ever noticed that the Klingons are all speaking unix? 'Grep
<reinhard> ls awk chmod.'' 'Mknod ksh tar imap.' 'Wall fsck yacc!' (that last is
<reinhard> obviously a curse of some sort).
<reinhard> Gandalf Parker
<kilo> lol
<dimas> johannesV: looks cool
<johannesV> yes, and the best thing is it is done with just a few lines of gfd-code
<johannesV>  <grid block="zip" rows="5">
<johannesV>         <gridline>
<johannesV>           <entry name="city" field="city" label="City" />
<johannesV>           <entry name="zip" field="zip" label="ZIP" />
<johannesV>           <entry name="state" field="state" label="State"/>
<johannesV>         </gridline>
<johannesV>         <gridline>
<johannesV>           <entry name="longitude" field="longitude" label="Longitude"/>
<johannesV>           <entry name="latitude" field="latitude" label="Latitude" s:span="2"/>
<johannesV>         </gridline>
<johannesV>       </grid>
<johannesV> that's the code needed to build that zipgrid sample
*** btami has joined #gnuenterprise
<btami> hi all
<kilo> llo btami
<btami> reinhard: you can print to a printer a Char report
<reinhard> with a proper printer selection box, or only to default printer?
<btami> if use xml formatter, can print to a gdi printer
<reinhard> ok, sounds good
<reinhard> thanks
<btami> text, html, escp,.. to a raw win32
<btami> if you don't select a printer, it will pop up a selection dialog
<btami> all above true with svn version of reports, released doesn't works
<reinhard> ok
<btami> have to say, reports is far from a polished state
<reinhard> we are approaching a project where we would need a number of reports
<reinhard> most of them probably being simple lists of records (maybe with master/detail, but nothing complicated)
<btami> same here
<kilo> M/D is... tricky
<btami> Char not supports it yet
<btami> iirc
<kilo> true
<reinhard> so the simple "click on <i want a report> - enter parameters - select printer from standard dialog - click ok" way doesn't quite work now?
<btami> it works, but the reports filters (layouts) not there...
<btami> universal is stalled
<btami> char is limited
<btami> there was no work on reports lately
<reinhard> we'll have to decide whether we use reports or do some manual python (maybe reportlab) based solution
<btami> just look at reports version number...
<btami> i suggest to use/enhance gnue-reports
<reinhard> problem is we need the program working with 1 september
<btami> if everyone using custom report solution, it will be never finished
<reinhard> and that might become a little tough if we have to fix reports first
<btami> i say, try it first
<reinhard> however I agree in principcle and we will have to look how far away we are from what we need
<reinhard> ye
<reinhard> yes
<btami> :)
<btami> as i see, the engine itself is ready, the filters need more work
<reinhard> we might need your help with finding our way through reports
<btami> np

*** jamest has joined #gnuenterprise
<reinhard> hmmm
<reinhard> I thought it was 7-9
<reinhard> but not really suer
<reinhard> sure
<johannesV> hm, i think that pylint is doing a mistake
<johannesV> it argues that my abstract class UIHelper (in _base.py) isn't used anywhere ...
<johannesV> (R0921)
<johannesV> but if i just open entry.py the first thing is class UIEntry(_base.UIHelper): ....
<btami> bbl
*** btami has quit IRC
<reinhard> johannesV: so pylint is correct, because a class beginning with an underscore is not expected to be used outside the module
<johannesV> ah, that's it ...
<johannesV> ok, sorry for that noise :)
<johannesV> so maybe we should consider renaming _base.py into base.py
<johannesV> or, just change that import line
<reinhard> I think it must begin with an underscore to not count as a valid widget
<johannesV> ah right ... that import-thingy
<reinhard> so I would just leave that
<johannesV> yes, that was what i was about to do with it ...

<johannesV_> bha, that damn svn ...

*** sjc has joined #gnuenterprise
<johannesV_> jamest, yes usually once a day is enough ... today i had it twice ... in the morning an svn update is almost the first command issued in the shell and once in the afternoon
<jamest> it is the same as I see trying to get into work then
<jamest> but I have no issues w/ getting into ash from the same machine
<johannesV_> exactly the same here ..
<johannesV_> which distro are you using ?
<johannesV_> maybe it's bug in  breezy's svn
*** llp has quit IRC
*** llp has joined #gnuenterprise
<jamest> at home I'm using breezy I think
<jamest> latest kubuntu
<johannesV_> have you tried removing and reinstalling svn ?
<johannesV_> or even a brand-new checkout ?
<jcater> what exactly happens?
<reinhard> off for today
<reinhard> cu
*** reinhard has quit IRC
<johannesV_> jcater, the first time each day i want to access svn the connection times out
<johannesV_> this takes a few minutes
<johannesV_> after the timeout error, i can just issue the same command again and it work fine imediately
<johannesV_> it doesn't matter which command (update, commit, ...)
<jamest> jcater: i don't have that issue with ash but it describes exactly what I see trying to login to work from home
<jamest> i don't have issues getting from home to ash
<johannesV_> ah, right, and it is no problem connecting to ash using ssh ...
<jamest> ash and svn should be the exact same box
<johannesV_> yes, of course. with ash i mean svn.gnuenterprise.org
<jcater> is it a series of updates, like "cd gnue; svn update; cd ../gnue-contrib; svn update"
<jcater> etc?
<johannesV_> no, just a single one
*** SachaS has joined #gnuenterprise
<johannesV_> after i've turned on my computer, pushed up evo and xchat and after reading the mails i start an xterm, and do that svn update (which fails)
<jamest> jcater: it's the initial connection attempt that fails
<johannesV_> no other svn commands before
<johannesV_> right
