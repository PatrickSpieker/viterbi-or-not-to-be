<lekma> good morning
<lekma> reinhard: i tested you changes, the script that use to take 4min+ is now 0:01:53.797909
<lekma> \o/
<reinhard> excellent
<reinhard> now how do we stand in that sap comparsion?
<reinhard> not that i would take beating sap as a minimum requirement, but just curious
<lekma> First try:
<lekma> 1 min 45 sec. for 516.390 records and display two fields.
<lekma> Second try:
<lekma> 1 min 35 sec
<lekma> so we're not there yet
<reinhard> this is *including* the rpc layer?
<lekma> yep
<reinhard> xmlrpc or hessian?
<lekma> and my test is only 185000 records, one field
<lekma> sap, i don't remember (their protocol), gnue, xmlrpc for the moment
<lekma> i'm hitting strange bugs in http 1.1 with hessian
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> I think that xmlrpc still adds a lot of overhead
<lekma> even thougt in oure encode/decode hessian is 3 to 4 time faster
<lekma> s/oure/pure
<lekma> the request still eats 300Meg of memory (instead of 500)
<reinhard> well
<reinhard> at least for speed we're not magnitudes away any more
<lekma> :)
*** btami has quit IRC
<reinhard> lekma: as for "only one field", please don't forget that there is always the gnue_id as a second field
<reinhard> also, I think adding more fields wouldn't make it slower proportionally
<reinhard> i.e. a second field would by far not add the same amount of time again
<lekma> no, of course
<lekma> i need a gnue expert
<lekma> that's plain crazy
<reinhard> you mean you need a gnue expert who's plain crazy? ;-)
<reinhard> that would be implied :)
<lekma> a hessianlib.dumps() of a big list outside of gnue context:
<lekma> hessianlib.dumps() 0:00:00.143382
<lekma> the same in ServerAdapter:
<lekma> hessian.dumps () 0:00:26.166066
<lekma> i don't understand where the extra time comes from
<lekma> while xmlrpc is coherent
<lekma> ie:
<lekma> xmlrpclib
<lekma> .dumps:  0:00:02.267522
<lekma> in ServerAdapter:
<lekma> xmlrpc.dumps () 0:00:02.914790
<reinhard> how did you get these times?
<reinhard> pstats module?
<lekma> dumping value :
<lekma>     r = 30000
<lekma>     v = ["this is a record", 1, 2, 1000001, "(08)123123123", "some more text", 22/7.0 , u"some unicode", True, False]
<lekma>     value = ([v for i in range(r)])
<lekma> nope datetime.datetime()
<reinhard> ah
<reinhard> even with pstats i see "unexplainable" results sometimes
<lekma> the crazier is if i run in profile
<reinhard> like a function that only consists of a single function call uses 20 seconds
<reinhard> for 100000 calls
<lekma> everything is back to normal, ie hessian faster than xmlrpc
<reinhard> I suspect all the hidden python magic like garbage collection and the like has a big impact on performance
<reinhard> and the decision when exactly python runs the garbage collection might depend on conditions that we as humans would regard as "random"
*** kilo has left #gnuenterprise
<lekma> it is systematic
<lekma> it is always slower when run in gnue
<lekma> and always faster outside gnue
<lekma> that doesn't seem like random
<lekma> :(
<lekma> it drives me crazy
<reinhard> I think it is slower because within gnue there is a lot more garbage to collect
<reinhard> but I can only suspect, too
<reinhard> that's all guessing
<jcater> could it have anything to do with unicode vs non-unicode data?
<reinhard> AFAICT lekma's non-gnue test contains unicode data, too
<lekma> yes same data
<lekma> everything is equal
<jcater> do you have psyco installed on your computer? I know gnue initializes it by default if it can find it, which in most cases makes a huge performance diff ... but I wonder if it causes problems with your lib
* jcater is just making guesses here ... sorry if I'm butting in :)
<reinhard> jcater: your suggestions are welcome
<lekma> >>> import psyco
<lekma> Traceback (most recent call last):
<lekma>   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
<lekma> ImportError: No module named psyco
<lekma> >>>
<lekma> so psyco seems out of the equation
<lekma> could you guys have a look at the code cause it really is driving me crazy
<lekma> ?
<jcater> I'd be happy to
<jcater> as you have me very curious
<reinhard> I can also try
<lekma> can i dcc send?
<reinhard> can you mail?
<jcater> please email to jason at gnue.org for me
<reinhard> reinhard at gnue dot org
<reinhard> :)
<lekma> ok
<lekma> sent
* lekma hopes you will find where he has been stupido :)
<lekma> bbl

<reinhard> hi lekma
*** johannesV has quit IRC
<lekma> i figured it out
<reinhard> really? cool
<reinhard> what was it?
<lekma> a bug in hessianlib that shown itself when dumping instances
<lekma> which in fact makes me wonder if hessian is really faster than xmlrpc
<lekma> bah soon the answer
<lekma> some more tests and we'll see
*** SachaS has joined #gnuenterprise
<lekma> some results:
<lekma> Server is a small comp
<lekma> Client is a big comp (more mem, more cpu power)
<lekma> running gnue-appserver and tests on Server:
<lekma> python 00000_test_psycopg.py
<lekma> 0:00:02.222326
<lekma> python 00000_test_xmlrpc.py
<lekma> 0:02:07.577575
<lekma> python 00000_test_hessian.py
<lekma> 0:01:41.565727
<lekma> running gnue-appserver on Server and tests on Client:
<lekma> python 00000_test_psycopg.py
<lekma> 0:00:01.537350
<lekma> python 00000_test_xmlrpc.py
<lekma> 0:01:52.654580
<lekma> python 00000_test_hessian.py
<lekma> 0:01:35.573958
<lekma> well i don't know if it was worth the trouble
<lekma> even though pure dumps/loads is around 3 times faster in hessian than xmlrpc
<reinhard> these numbers witness a huge improvement
<lekma> that's true we're not in the 4min+ range anymore
<lekma> but i believe we should be in the less than 1min range
<SachaS> lekma are you testing gnue client with gnue server or some gnue server to gnue server communication ?
*** btami has quit IRC
<lekma> ?? i'd say client/server
<SachaS> ok.
<lekma> hessian is an rpc protocol
<SachaS> ok.
* SachaS is still interested in gnue 2 gnue communication ... maybe based on ebXML messaging.

<reinhard> good morning jamest and jcater
<jamest> morning reinhard
<jamest> or afternoon :)
<reinhard> I've just committed some more stuff in gnue-common/src/utils/tree.py
<reinhard> and would again like you to have a look at it and tell me whether this is what you would consider the right direction
<jamest> i can try to look a bit later
<reinhard> thanks
<reinhard> lekma: I saw your patch in roundup - don't you have commit access yet?
<lekma> nope
<reinhard> is there still a problem with your copyright assignment, or is it just that you should get an account on ash?
<reinhard> I thought I saw some mails about your copyright assignmet cc'd to info at gnue.org but I didn't follow too closely
<lekma> the copyright assignment is still not solved (fsf seems to be like any other system... confused)
<lekma> the first mail got lost
<lekma> and then arrived
<lekma> so frances sent it back
<lekma> and 2 days after we got a second letter
<lekma> of course the first one had the name wrong
<lekma> :)
<reinhard> sigh
<lekma> so it's in the process of being solved
<lekma> but it takes time
<reinhard> so I think I will just commit it
<reinhard> so others can have a look and a try at all
<lekma> i'm writing the javascript client right now
<reinhard> hessian driver committed
<lekma> ok thx
<jcater> reinhard/lekma: did y'all figure anything out with the performance?
<lekma> yep
<lekma> there was a bug withe the hessian lib
<lekma> but that don't solve all performance issue
<jcater> okay
<jcater> I suspected as much
<jcater> I wrapped the calls into the hotshot profiler the other day
<jcater> and noticed that most of the wait was inside of the networking code of hessianlib.py
<lekma> that's another pb, whch in fact is the same for xmlrpc
<lekma> appserver adds a non negligeabable overhead in ClientAdapter and ServerAdapter
<lekma> but it tries hard to balance this overhead with agressive http 1.1 connections
<lekma> so all in all it's not that bad
<lekma> in fact the way it's done make http 1.1 connections nearly twice faster as standard httplib.HTTPConnection
<jcater> cool
<lekma> disclaimer: i may be wrong on my lecture of what appserver does (note to myself: i am not a programmer (repeat x100))
<jcater> nah, I think the definition of "programmer" is pretty loose these days
<jcater> after all, jamest claims to be one
<lekma> :)
