<jamest> how stable is forms head?
<jamest> and the wx driver in particular
<jamest> 2.6
<jamest> the dropdowns the the old wx driver have started causing us lots of issues
*** klasstek has joined #gnuenterprise
<reinhard> apart from the fact that I'm messing with forms a little right now
<reinhard> head should be perfectly usable, and wx26 should be possibly the most stable driver of all
<reinhard> (which shouldn't mean that you *won't* hit bugs...)
<jamest> :)

<jamest> hmmmm
<jamest> 2.6 computes spacing a bit different than 2.4 did doesn't it
<reinhard> yes it does
<reinhard> ah, and I think you might hit the same problems as you did with the gtk2 driver
<reinhard> spacing depends on the biggest control of the form, IIRC
<johannesV> reinhard, no
<johannesV> spacing depends on the biggest control possibel
<johannesV> erm possible
<johannesV> depending on the platform used
<reinhard> ah ok
<jamest> it's odd
<jamest> looks like spacing might not take pages into account?
<jamest> so it's global for all tabs on a form?
<johannesV> ?
<reinhard> what johannesV said: it does not depend on what controls are there on the form
*** derek has quit IRC
<reinhard> it just takes standard entry size, standard button size, standard dropdown size
<reinhard> and takes the biggest of them
<reinhard> so no control will get chopped
<johannesV> and no control gets streched ....
<johannesV> (which looks as ugly as well :)
<jamest> it really increases the horizontal space usage though
<jamest> like on a rows=10
<jamest> it looking like whitespace is doubled
<reinhard> yes
<johannesV> hm, in the horizontal the space depends on the current app-font (taking in account the average character-width)
<reinhard> wx driver used to chop for example dropdowns and buttons
<reinhard> oh
* reinhard mixed up horizontal and vertical ;-)
<jamest> ok, i was going to mention vertical too :)
*** johannesV_ has joined #gnuenterprise
<reinhard> johannesV_: I wonder whether widgetWidth and widgetHeight point sizes could be a configuration option
<reinhard> and if set override the auto dectected widget sizes
<johannesV_> hm
<jamest> that doesn't work well
<jamest> as for whatever reason themes effect forms here
<johannesV_> should be handled quite well if there are layoutmanagers ...
<johannesV_> right
<jamest> a form that fits on user A's screen doesn't on User B's
<reinhard> ok, I agree that the only real solution is layout management
<jamest> i'm not reporting this as a bug, just confirming behaviour
<reinhard> a button simply *isn't* of the same size as an entry
<jamest> i have a list of real bugs/feature issues i'll bring up after test opening all the forms
<jamest> :)
<reinhard> :)
<jamest> but I guess I could start :)
<jamest> the two biggest things stopping me from opening forms are
<jamest> 'integer' is not valid for typecast-attribute which allows these values only: 'date','text','number'
<jamest> 'boolean' is not valid for typecast-attribute which allows these values only: 'date','text','number'
<johannesV_> hm , but that should have been fixed ... quite some time ago
<johannesV_> ah, no, not at all ... that was the thing with ValueSet
<johannesV_> is svn working ?
<jamest> I'm running svn head from this AM
<johannesV_> seems as if my svn update is hanging ...
<jamest> checking
<jamest> wtf?
<jamest> it's updating
<jamest> ah, ok, didn't see the commits from this morning
<jamest> yeah, worked fine
<johannesV_> johannes@chicago:~/prj/gnue$ svn update
<johannesV_> ssh: connect to host svn.gnuenterprise.org port 22: Connection timed out
<johannesV_> svn: Netzwerkverbindung wurde unerwartet geschlossen.
<johannesV_> i'm not able to update svn ...
<jamest> probably getting blocked in the AT&T closests we're not supposed to know about
<johannesV_> :)
<johannesV_> ok, i've to run now ... bbl
<jamest> can you ssh in to the server at all?
<jamest> ok, l8r
<johannesV_> yes, login in via ssh is ok
<reinhard> bbl

<jamest> reinhard: is there a reason we don't don't support typecast= boolean or integer in gfd fields?
<reinhard> I have no idea, the set of possible values was defined ages ago
<reinhard> but it was never checked
<reinhard> I am no opposed at all to add any other values to the list as you see fit
