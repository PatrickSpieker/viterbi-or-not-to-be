<esands> Anyone looked at this one: http://www.mustardandrelish.com/ledger/ (Gnu Ledger)
<jcater> not I

<derek> esands: you seem to research this stuff like mad
<derek> i used to but ran out of time
<derek> ANY chance as you find this stuff you could make a database/spreadsheet/textfile
<derek> that has
<derek> projectname - category - maincontact - maincontact email
<derek> category = financials, crm, erp, workflow etc
<esands> Trying to find something workable for the moment.  Although now I have win4lin working, maybe I go to the darkside. ;)
<esands> Sure, I could probably do something like that. 
<derek> and if you give me that file regularly
<esands> However freshmeats pretty good:
<derek> one thing i used to do is contact the projects
<esands> http://freshmeat.net/browse/76/?topic_id=76 
<derek> if it was something that was complimentary i invite them to work with us
<esands> This is an interesting under the radar project I just discovered there: http://www.redrocketconsortium.com/zbc/index.html
<derek> if its an 'infant' project i generally try to help persaude them to join us (i.e. us swallow them)
<esands> Furthermore on freshmeat you can filter on licenses: GPL only: http://freshmeat.net/browse/15/
<derek> we at one time consolidated about 10 projects into us
<derek> i used to do freshmeat and sourceforge
<derek> i just dont have the time :)
<derek> i have see the redrocket one before
<esands> Yeah, well I should be sorting out GST at the moment.  
<esands> What did you think? (about rr)
<derek> i think its in ADA iirc
<derek> and was like GACK
<esands> Has some nice screenshots. Although it looks like it suffers from the same us-centric issue of only dealing with sales tax on sales
<esands> Yes, ADA
<esands> and gtk
<derek> the problem with ADA is finding otehr developers will be murder
<derek> if this guy decides to stop
<derek> finding someone to maintain it could be impossible or (costly)
<esands> No doubt.  
<derek> and growth is limited
<derek> as i dont suspect he has lots of ada volunteers :)
<esands> Er, that should have been GPL: http://freshmeat.net/browse/76/?filter=15
<esands> Probably defense industry retirees 
<esands> btw, win4lin works really nicely with my banking software and a pcmcia modem. Can delete my ntfs partition now. 8)
<esands> Anyway, of all the oss/free-type accounting projects I've looked at so far.  None of them are quite there, in terms of being solid mature and robust.  
<esands> With regards to that list, there wouldn't be many that would be worth putting on there.  The only three I've keep coming back to are sql-ledger, nola and gnucash (cvs sb version)
<esands> Nothing else I've tried is still on my machine.  
<derek> gnue isnt on that list :)
<esands> Nola/acclite is still there only because you guys are working on it.  Given its broken for the NZ tax enviroment its not very function for me.
<esands> Gnue doesn't have an accounting system yet. Its just at the moment a access replacement.
<derek> acclite
<esands> From the sounds here its getting close to being at that stage.
<derek> very soon
<esands> acclite has the same failings as nola for my uses.
<esands> You can
<derek> GNUe Small Business Edition
<esands> er, You can't imagine how much pain not having a decent accural and reporting system for GST 
<esands> Look forward to a GSBE.   
<esands> Anyway got to run off to the supermarket.

<Kai1> oh, it was mentioned in your logs...

<pradhap> does it comes with the souce ..
<jamest> Kai1: looking at project now
<jamest> pradhap: yes, are you messing with last release or the cvs code?
<jamest> the cvs has a much nicer doc being worked on by jcater
<jamest> Kai1: what's this written in?
<Kai1> what is what written in?
<pradhap> i want to install GNUe, which will be the best CVS or tar ??
<Kai1> kardia? just an XML standard for enviroments like centrallix or gnue to interpert(sp?)

<jamest> sorry, back
<jamest> I'd suggest cvs if you're comfortable with working w/ code install
<derek> id suggest cvs if you are comfy with cvs and breakage
<derek> knowing code isnt alll the much a requirement
<pradhap> i d'nt have any idea of code ..
<pradhap> but i want to install GNUe, which shall i try CVS or the tar package ???
<derek> windows or *nix
<derek> if *nix i suggest cvs
<derek> as we are close to a 0.4.1 release and there are lots of fixes in cvs not in 0.4.0
<pradhap> i use linux..
<derek> if windows, cvs is a pain to install, so i suggest 0.4.0 release
<derek> is there a link somewhere to kardia
Action: derek thinks this might be the thing micah talked about a LONG time ago
<derek> im not quite sure how it woudl 'work' with gnue
<derek> they are somewhat competing architectures

<pradhap> jcater: hi
<jcater> morning
<pradhap> jcater: i want to install GNUe in debain.. which is best should i try CVS or the tar package ??
<jamest> if you just want to play on debian 
<jamest> then use this line in your apt source.list
<jamest> deb http://www.gnuenterprise.org/debian woody main
<pradhap> jamest: fine ..
<jamest> then you can apt-get forms, designer, and common 0.4.0
<jamest> they are a bit buggy but much easier to install :)
Action: jamest assumes you're running woody
<pradhap> ya ..
<jamest> i'd still be tempted to check out the cvs code if bandwidth cost isn't an issue
<jamest> as jcater has the start of a nice forms developers guide in the in openoffice format
<jamest> s/in the in/in there in
<pradhap> ok 
<pradhap> bandwidth is not a problem for me ..
<pradhap> actually my oracle server is running in a seprate machine ... is it possible to connect the forms such a way they can access the database .. what are the necessary changes should i do in connections.conf file ??
<jcater> you can do 1 of 2 things
<jcater> 1. if you can get the Oracle OCI8 libraries on the debian machine
<jcater> then it'll be a snap... just install DCOracle2
<jcater> if not, then
<jcater> 2. You might want to play w/ODBC
Action: jcater hasn't tried the latter
<jcater> and it's not as nice... not all the features are supported
<pradhap> oh !!
<jcater> is #1 an option?
<pradhap> ya i have DCOracle2 driver ..
<jcater> ok
<pradhap> but not yet tried :-(
<jcater> well, connections.conf will look like:
<jcater> [op]
<jcater> comment = NCS Production
<jcater> provider = oracle
<jcater> service = PROD.DBS.NCSMAGS.COM
<jcater> where server = <your TNS Name>
<pradhap> ok ..

<jcater> ...algorithms have no reflection
<revDeke> AI have no concept of 'self'

<siesel> sorry, wrong window :(
<chillywilly> hmmm, I think I am regretting giving money to the ACLJ
<chillywilly> now they are asking me to sign a petition in spport of the U.S. Patriot Act to stop the ACLU's case against it
<jcater> ACLJ?
<chillywilly> I spported them with the abortion spreme court case, but not the frelling U.S. Patriot Act
<chillywilly> American Center for Law and Justice
<chillywilly> some ppl and orgs are jst blindly conservative
<jcater> oh, sick
<chillywilly> the abortion case was ACLU, NOW etc. bringing charges against anti-abortion protests based on federal racketeering laws
<chillywilly> trying to sue pro-life groups out of existance
<jcater> well, that's certainly one spin on it :)
<chillywilly> you don't agree?
<chillywilly> how is it that ppl should not have the right to protest something?
<jcater> that's a loaded statement
<chillywilly> they were sing laws that were created for organized crime
<jcater> of course I believe that
<jcater> and the ALCU fights for that right
<chillywilly> er, using
<jcater> the "spin" was " trying to sue pro-life groups out of existance"
<chillywilly> then why are they sing federal racketeering laws against pro-life groups?
<chillywilly> wtf does that have to do with protesting?
<chillywilly> jst becase they are loosing money when ppl are protesting doesn't mean protesting is illegal then does it?
<chillywilly> the law they are sing is RICO
<jcater> dude
<jcater> are you talking about the 1993 case
<chillywilly> ummm, no it was like 2 weeks ago
<jcater> NOW vs Scheidler iirc
<chillywilly> October 16th or something
<jcater> that was designed to protect women against violence
<jcater> not to destroy peaceful protests
Action: jcater lives in the bible belt
<jcater> I've seen some protests
<jcater> it ain't purdy
<jcater> or safe
<jcater> I'm all for either group to protest
<grib> chillywilly: which ever side you're on, you might try going to one of those protests.  the level of nastiness is unbelievable.
<jcater> it's the level of violence that's sick
<jcater> grib: exactly
<chillywilly> srry but I DID protest, we had the life chain in downtown Milwaukee last month and it was peaceful
<chillywilly> I don't condone violence
<jcater> chillywilly: and I don't think the lawsuit was against your group either
<jcater> dude
<jcater> I know for one
<jcater> here in TN
<jcater> most abortion clinics are not marked

<jcater> and they move around
<jcater> because the doctors and the women fear for their safety
<jcater> I'm not defending them as I'm not taking sides in irc :)
<chillywilly> how can ppl use violence to retecfiy a different type of violence? that lame
<neilt> chillywilly: for once I agree with you :)
<neilt> not that it matters, but it is different
<neilt> :)
<jcater> chillywilly: lame, but happens every day
<jcater> so that's why the case is in the courts
<jcater> not because of hands across america
<jcater> or life chain
<jcater> whatever it's called
<chillywilly> yea, but how can you sue various non-violent groups becuse of some nut cases?
Action: jcater questions that placement of "non-violent"
<jcater> I'm not arguing with you one grounds of right or wrong... I only said that was quite a bit of "spin" in that statement
<jcater> and I have seen the opposite side of the coin... the part that triggered the lawsuit for an injunction
<jcater> anywho, I have to go home

<chillywilly> I can't find any evidence on the other side, jst thing saying how it would effect anyone protesting a "business"
<chillywilly> and the thing that I am arguing is the principle in itself, the right to protest
<chillywilly> without being sued under some federal law because a business lost money
