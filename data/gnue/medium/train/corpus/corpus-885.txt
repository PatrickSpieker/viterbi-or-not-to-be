<derek> right now john cougar - jack and diane
Action: derek embarassedly admits Culture Club - I'll Tumble For You is next in the cue
<dtm> HEH
<dtm> whoa.
<dtm> we had that crap on 8track
Action: derek has a WIDE variety in taste
<derek> most modern christian music though
<derek> with oldies rock and 80s pop mixed in
<derek> dtm: you might get a kick out of this one
<derek> daughter is having a slumber party and the wife took them out to Toilet Paper some houses for a prank
<dtm> omg
<dtm> hehehe
<dtm> that's insane
<derek> being an upstanding youth pastor of course i suggested they start with the senior pastors house ;)

<derek> sup dave
<dyfet> oh just working late
<dyfet> quiet night it seems :)
<derek> yeah
<derek> but you and i are here now, so LETS PARTY
<dyfet> we are close to a 1.1 release in bayonne....
Action: derek turns on the disco ball and throws in the BeeGees Staying Alive soundtrack
<derek> opps sorry wrong decade
<dyfet> lol
<derek> cool on release
<dyfet> well, i thought i would exercise my fair use rights over my doors collection actually
<derek> as chillywilly would say
<derek> i need to get a frelling copy of bayonne working
<derek> i just got a new phone that does AOL IM and im enamored
Action: derek is drooling over possibilities
<dyfet> actually I have considered adding im support to Bayonne....so it can send sms messages and popups with incoming call info
<derek> hmm it does sms
<derek> grr i REALLY need to get a hold of it
<derek> the biggest hold up (i know you guys hate hearing this) is it needs to support normal modems
<dyfet> well, it could though something like jabber, i suppose, where there are appropriate im/sms gateways.  thats why i want to build an im module in bayonne
<derek> currently the hardware cost is way too high barrier to entry for 'free software' developers
<dyfet> derek, free is not free as in price :)
<derek> i know freedom is expensive
<derek> just free software developers unless commissioned directly to install phone software can not afford 500+ for a professional phone card
<derek> i think if it ran on modems you would have a huge user base
<dyfet> it is often the most expensive and valuable commodity...(freedom that is)
<derek> i know for myself i would be running at home
<dyfet> I would like to get a modem version running
<derek> but cant afford the card
<derek> i have 3 clients that are considering buying hardware
<dyfet> there even is a start of a voicemodem driver, but nobody has been working on it
<derek> but its hard for me to give strong recommendation
<derek> when i havent driven it myself
<derek> i have been trying to work with rich on a client
<derek> so that i can get a bayonne install and get an idea for capabilities
<derek> and MOST importantly start writing applications to it :)
<dyfet> and most important, I think, writing applications that integrate into/relate to gnue apps....
<dtm> david!
<dtm> whaddap
<dtm> dyfet: bayonne 1.1 already?!
<dyfet> getting close to that, yes
<dyfet> probably would have been out last week but for my pbx card getting busted
<dtm> dyfet: derek wants normal modem support.... maybe we should give him the friends & family discount on an Openline4 instead ;>
<dtm> dyfet: oh no
<dyfet> yep, right after the free software business expo
<dtm> hahahah "free is not free as in price"
<dtm> Words of wisdom, Lloyd!
<dyfet> so i am waiting for the replacement to arrive so i can do a final unittest before the release
<dtm> well was it insured?  :)
<dyfet> yes, the replacement is already on it's way here
<dyfet> when it arrives, i will do the release :)
<derek> jcater: if you are around speak up i need to ask you questions!
<dtm> derek: you should email him then!
<dyfet> the pbx exhibition went well though

<derek> yumminess!
<derek> gack all the item stuff isnt there
<derek> whew now added and committed
<derek> watch out foolz here comes gnue-sb
<esands> heh
<esands> nice.
<esands> I assume designer reads gsd files and outputs sql?
<derek> kind of
<esands> how you import the schema into a db then?

<derek> website for it committed too wee
<derek> esands: gsd is an xml file
<derek> currently you use xslt and an xsl (style sheet)
<derek> and it makes a sql file
Action: derek thinks designer might do this
<nickr> I sohuld be committed
<derek> currently i do it via command line
<derek> eventually it will do it
<derek> designer that is
<ajmitch> evening lads
<derek> designer will take database tables and create gsd's :)
<derek> which should make it easier for others to adopt
<derek> night ajmitch
<esands> Got the details, so I can have a fiddle with gnue-sb. 
<derek> turning in early?
<derek> must be feeling sick
<esands> He must have an exam tomorrow
<derek> esands: yes but its broken
<esands> Its like only 8:40pm here.
<derek> the gsd stuff in gnue cvs is broked
<derek> unless jcater fixed it today
<derek> i have local cache of some things that work
Action: derek is consolidating many things
<esands> You have the xslt/xsl method writing up?
<derek> DCL, Acclite and custom stuff I have
<esands> Which is of course your job
<derek> so expect gnue-sb to be a bit broked for a few days until i get all schemas talking the same
<esands> Will it (gnue-sb) work against acclite's schema?
<derek> and revisit all my forms
<ajmitch> i said evening! not goodnight!
<esands> heh
<derek> for now just wanted to get consolidated and into cvs
<ajmitch> although esands is right about having exam tomorrow :)
<derek> ajmitch: whew i was worried
<esands> Why you here? ;)
<derek> esands: re: xslt its all in gnue-common iirc
<derek> should be build.py or something that lets you do things
<ajmitch> esands: exam's at 2:30 :)
<esands> So, shouldn't you be studying? 
<derek> pyxslt i think is the name of the binary
<esands> heh
<derek> in gnue/common/scripts/
<derek> or something
<ajmitch> ah yes, study...
<esands> You mean ../gnue/common/scripts/pyxslt ??
<derek> gnue/common/utils/xml2sql/ i think has the stylesheets
<derek> esands: yeah that would be it
<esands> what deb is PySablot?
<derek> there should be a readme in the xml2sql dir
<derek> debs arent in sid yet :(
<derek> working on it
<derek> they are on our website though :)
<esands> Nice. Oh. Yes. what was that source.list line again? 
<derek> let me find
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/debian/
<derek> is where you can find the .deb file
Action: derek has no clue as to the 'sources.list'
<derek> i forgot to add to mine
Action: derek is hoping to get stuff in sid ASAP
<esands>  /etc/apt/sources.list ?
<derek> jbailey hopefully adopted gnue and is working on it
<derek> esands: i know what sources.list is, i meant no clue as to what gnues is
<derek> nickr can do pysablot just waiting on its maintainer to apply some patches
<esands> That sources line was: deb http://www.gnuenterprise.org/debian woody main
<esands> pysablot's not in the repository though. Only on that jcarter link
<nickr> yea
<nickr> you can get it from my site too
<derek> try  deb http://www.gnuenterprise.org/debian woody main
<derek> oops you found it never mind
Action: derek was grepping log in another channel
Action: derek wants to know how they consider it woody :)
Action: derek was looking for sid or unstable
<esands> Maybe it was built on a woody machine
<ajmitch> they were probably compiled on woody
<esands> Hmm.' [nic@thunder:~/devel/gnue/gnue-sb]  ../gnue/common/scripts/pyxslt -i schema/item.gsd -x ../gnue/common/utils/xml2sql/pgsql_2.xsl -o t' doesn't work to well
<esands> Neither does sabscmd
<esands> er, sabcmd
<derek> sabscmd?
Action: derek warned that likely the stuff in gnue/common was borked
Action: derek loves that within minutes of cvs checkin there is checkout + bug reports ;)
<esands> From the xml2sql readme
<derek> and who says free software dont work ;)
<esands> heh, fs/oss development. 8)

<derek> ;)
<derek> if you give me a minute i will tell you how
Action: derek has to get pysablot :)
<esands> sure thing. 8)
Action: derek forgot i dont have on my laptop
<derek> piss
<derek> latitude:/home/dneighbo/cvs/gnue-sb/schema# apt-cache search pysablot

<derek> i think python2.2 is my default
<esands> np, I can wait until tomorrow. 
Action: derek tries unstable
<derek> give me a minute
<derek> minor road block
<esands> You could run python2.1
Action: ajmitch just reading gnue-dev archives, how's things going with Via Libre & PAPO people?
<derek> ok you should have to do something like this
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue-sb/schema$ ~/cvs/gnue/common/scripts/pyxslt -i account.gsd -x ~/cvs/gnue/common/utils/xml2sql/pgsql.xsl -o pgsql.cmd.xml

<derek>   XML parser error 2: syntax error
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue-sb/schema$ 
<esands> Yep
<derek> again as iterated the stylesheets/pyxslt in common is probably broked
<derek> i built all my schemas on a GOOD copy
<derek> and jan was playing aroudn as was jcater with the gnue ones
Action: derek warned VERY strongly that this would screw me
<derek> and now as you see it has :)
<esands> I assume you are getting good sql out, while I'm just getting strangest. I guess I'll be waiting for jcarter to fix things
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue-sb/schema$ ~/cvs/ue/sql/pyxslt -i account.gsd -x ~/cvs/ue/sql/pgsql.xsl -o pgsql.cmd.xml
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue-sb/schema$ ~/cvs/ue/sql/pyxslt -i pgsql.cmd.xml -x ~/cvs/ue/sql/strip.command.xsl -o pgsql.sql
<derek> works perfectly
<derek> i can send you pgsql.sql and strip.command.xsl im using if you like
<derek> just give me an email address
<derek> i would replace what is in gnue cvs and tell you to update
<derek> but i wnat to talk to jcater first
<derek> thus my earlier question (where is jcater?) ;)
<esands> nic@plumtree.co.nz
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue-sb/schema$ less pgsql.sql   
<derek> Create Sequence seq_account;
<derek> Create Table account (account_id int4 NOT NULL default nextval('seq_account'), name varchar(80) NOT NULL, active varchar(1) NULL default 'Y', parent int4 NULL, created_on timestamp NOT NULL default now(), created_by int4 NOT NULL, modified_on timestamp NOT NULL default now(), modified_by int4 NOT NULL);
<derek> Create Unique Index pk_account On account(account_id);
<derek> pgsql.sql (END) 
<derek> is the output fwiw
<esands> definitely not what I get. 
<derek> ok on its way to you
<derek> note the contact stuff is severely broken
<derek> as i changed table names before checking in but never touched the forms
<derek> the item stuff should work
<derek> i suppose since i have church in the morning i should go to bed
<derek> i plan to continue tomorrow
<derek> esands: i have real world deadlines and others have needs that are watiing on us
<derek> so expect gnue-sb to move at fairly steady pace compared to how gnue apps have gone in the past
<esands> excellent. Hopefully I can help things along as well. 
Action: derek is away: sleepy pooh
<esands> Works now. Thanks derek. I'm pretty busy tomorrow as well, got some new windows and french doors turning up. 
<esands> ajmitch: good luck if I dont see you before your exam
<esands> Hmm.

<neilt> chillywilly: hello
<chillywilly> which list are the mails on?
<neilt> gnue-dev@gnu.org
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> wonder if I got unsubscribed again somehow
<chillywilly> this is pissing me off
<neilt> not sure when they were sent, but they were the last 3 email ireceived
<chillywilly> http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue-dev/2002-October/thread.html
<neilt> http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue-dev/2002-November/thread.html
<chillywilly> is that accurate?
<neilt> has them all
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> I might've read them then
<chillywilly> nope, I never got those
<chillywilly> man, I dnno why I keep getting unsubscribed

<reinhard_> neilt: any comments yet?
<neilt> happy to see the work progressing
<neilt> i think it is a good start
<reinhard_> with emphasis on "good" or on "start"?
<reinhard_> :)
<neilt> actually both
<reinhard_> well seriously i agree
<neilt> I want to build buniness objects
<neilt> and as long as we have a agreed aproach that works
<chillywilly> well I have a parser commited for ODL that uses PLY in case no one noticed, but I need to make it parse into something like perhaps an AST
<neilt> I am happy
<reinhard_> i hope we have finally agreed on storing the class definitions in the database
<neilt> I also like the idea that we have several people working on appserver and agreed to priorities
<reinhard_> or to be more precise in "system business objects"
<reinhard_> yes
<chillywilly> what did jan say?
<reinhard_> chillywilly: we also talked about your parser
<chillywilly> I don't really care, but I'm not sure I see a point if you se meta objects (like system tables) then those should go int he db
<reinhard_> as well as about comparable things that only exist more or less as an idea
<chillywilly> well I'll try and get through some mails
<reinhard_> and we agreed that it is a good thing to have parsers for other formats
<chillywilly> ;)
<reinhard_> that can read "external" defined objects and "merge" that into the "main" repository
<chillywilly> have to go to church in 30 mins or so :)
<reinhard_> as a separate command line tool
<chillywilly> k
<neilt> reinhard_: the back end for 
<neilt> storing business objects
<neilt> should be plugable just in case
<reinhard_> chillywilly: ok i don't want to hold you back then :)
<neilt> we want to change it
<chillywilly> I figured using an xml markup as an exchange format between designer and appserver would be nice too
<reinhard_> neilt: yes that's why made it a separate "module"
<chillywilly> since designer probably wants xml
<neilt> reinhard_: excellent
<reinhard_> chillywilly: i'm not even sure if designer will be the tool of choice to define business objects
<chillywilly> well it is supposed to be our IDE isn't it?
<reinhard_> because an object definition is like a normal business object
<chillywilly> jcater made it so you could write plugins
<reinhard_> we could even have some "normal" form that accesses these metaobjects
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> that we could do too
<neilt> reinhard_: can business objects be aggregates of other business objects?
<chillywilly> they have the cncept of relationships in ODL
<chillywilly> which is like having a ref to an object or cllection of objects
<reinhard_> neilt: can you give an example please?
<neilt> for example
<neilt> sales order
<chillywilly> you can have 1 to 1, 1 to n, and n to m relationships between the objects
<neilt> is the object presented to the gui a sales order
<neilt> or a sales order header and sales order detail objects
<neilt> so the GUI has to manage both objects
<neilt> or can the GUI just deal with one sales order objects
<reinhard_> the GUI will have to deal with two different objects
<neilt> Ugh
<reinhard_> however the details will be connected to the master
<reinhard_> not sure how one object could work
<neilt> so the GUI can just request the sale order and get all the header and items on the sales order
<neilt> s/can/can not/
<reinhard_> ah ok
<reinhard_> i think i see what you are after
<reinhard_> the gui will request a specific sales order
<reinhard_> will get the requested header data
<reinhard_> then the gui will request a list of details to the order
<reinhard_> and fetch the first few items
<chillywilly> master-detail?
<reinhard_> because the sales order might have 1000 items on it
<reinhard_> and the gui doesn't want to load all 1000 at once
Action: chillywilly finishes the "Halloween Documents" ;)
<neilt> the systems that I have been working with are doing it slightly different
<neilt> that does not make it right
<reinhard_> however the author of the form definition woudln't have to know how this works
<reinhard_> neilt: please explain
<chillywilly> reinhard_: these should've been about how we can defeat SAP, PeopleSoft, etc. ;)
<neilt> the systems I've been working with
Action: chillywilly hopes everyone gets his reference
<neilt> make one business object that cooresponds to the form
<neilt> this business object can be a real object or a proxy object for several real business objects
<neilt> but this means that some of the complexity of the GUI is moved to the business object
<chillywilly> why aren't we sing the scope resolution operator instead of an '_'
<reinhard_> neilt: exactly
<chillywilly> nevermind
<reinhard_> this is the point i'm not sure if we want it
<neilt> because the GUI does not need to know how many (potentially loosely related ) business objects are displayed on the form)
<neilt> it just gets the data
<reinhard_> OTOH
<chillywilly> I prefer the scope resolition operator and methods to resolve names, etc.
<reinhard_> the form definition is in the appserver
<chillywilly> module::name
<neilt> reinhard_: i thought the form def was XML text file
<chillywilly> can be transformed in one line of python
<reinhard_> my point of view is rather that the appserver shouldn't deal with visualisation of data
<reinhard_> neilt: i meant
<reinhard_> if we define those "form-bound" business objects
<neilt> reinhard_: i agree that appserver should deal with visualation
<neilt> s/should/should not/
<reinhard_> we move parts of the form definitions into appserver
<reinhard_> that means
<reinhard_> well
<neilt> but if we dont we move linking all of the data to the form?
<reinhard_> i for example think that the business objects shouldn't define
<reinhard_> whether i want to see header information and detail information
<reinhard_> on the same form or not
<neilt> reinhard_: exactly I agree with that
<reinhard_> appserver would define relations between objects
<neilt> ahh that is the problem
<reinhard_> like sales_head has a list of sales_items
<reinhard_> and sales_item defines a reference to the sales_head
<neilt> they also have to be defined by the form so the work to maintain it will be double
<reinhard_> but a form would have to define that it wants to _use_ that link
<neilt> and the forms or appserver will be fragile to breaking
<neilt> if one is changed but not the other
<neilt> reinhard_: that is the essence of the issue
<reinhard_> i see your point
<neilt> if the form just retrieves the data without know about the link
<reinhard_> it is IMHO actually independent of the master-detail problem
<neilt> then the form can use all of the data or just part of it
<neilt> or none of it
<reinhard_> we will always have this issue as long as form definitions (XML) and object definitions (database) are maintained seperately
<reinhard_> that a form definition doesn't match the underlying object
<neilt> not necessarily
<neilt> let me explain
<neilt> lets say i define a simple object with 3 properties (A B C)
<neilt> the form can referrence to object obj1 and the 3 properties ( A B C)
<neilt> lets say that I take property C out of obj1
<neilt> and create obj2 with property C and link that to obj1
<neilt> since obj1 can be proxy object the form can still think it is getting property C from obj1
<neilt> but it is really stored in obj2 now
<reinhard_> ok
<reinhard_> i understand that
<chillywilly> even in MVC achritectures the view is separate from the model and any changes in one may have to be changed in the other
<reinhard_> however i don't understand how this could work with 1:n
<reinhard_> instead of 1:1
<neilt> thats is the downside
<neilt> in that you hide the relationships in the proxy objects
<neilt> and the forms just deal with data
<chillywilly> the relationshipd should be refernceable in a form and/or trigger
<neilt> but the upside is that i can add a complex stored procedures to retreive data into andobject and the form does not need to know the relationship
<chillywilly> hmmm
<neilt> only that it should display the data
<reinhard_> but the form has to know that it's master detail
<reinhard_> doesn
<reinhard_> 't it?
<neilt> no I dont think it does
<reinhard_> then
<chillywilly> why wouldn't you just use the objects interface to change anything ans just worry about updating the form?
<chillywilly> (view)
<neilt> it needs to know that this object has a list of data to display
<reinhard_> how does the form know that it can insert a new item into the order?
<neilt> the list is either read only or read write
<neilt> if the list is added to then the business object maintains referrential integrity when it updates the db
<reinhard_> hmmm
<reinhard_> how does the form know that i can add another item to the order
<reinhard_> but i can not add another customer?
<chillywilly> it shouldn't display stuff to add a customer then ;)
<chillywilly> or the gui should be 'disabled'
<neilt> in the business object with is (1:1) with the form the properties are read only
<chillywilly> forms has read-only widgets
<neilt> s/with/which/
<reinhard_> well i can _change_ the customer
<chillywilly> could someone be so kind as to forward me the Halloween mails?
<neilt> what email
<chillywilly> all 5 of them
<neilt> addr
<chillywilly> the ones on gnue-dev
<chillywilly> danielb@libertyetech.com
<neilt> to what email addr
<reinhard_> neilt: let my try if i understand you basically
<reinhard_> what you are talking about means that we have some "array" type of property
<reinhard_> would this be correct?
<neilt> reinhard_: essentially
<chillywilly> which in ODL would be a ref to a collection ;)
<neilt> reinhard_: but let me also say I did not plan to have this conversation this morning and so I am just reponsding with first thoughts
<reinhard_> ok :)
<chillywilly> cause relationships and attributes are the object "properties"
<neilt> not necessarily having thought through all of this
<neilt> but this is how some weel know system I am working with operate
<reinhard_> neilt: one of the side results of the meeting was
<neilt> s/weel/well/
<reinhard_> we agreed that there has been much much talk about appserver
<reinhard_> and not so much implementation
<reinhard_> and that we have to start getting something done
<reinhard_> look where we will have the _real_ problems
<neilt> exactly and i dont want to get in the way of progress
<reinhard_> and improve that
<reinhard_> rather than for more months talking about problems that could theoretically arise
<reinhard_> very good example
<reinhard_> we just implemented that first draft api
<reinhard_> with jforms siesel found out we have to change it to make performance better
<reinhard_> so we changed it
<reinhard_> but if we hadn't done that prototype implementation
<neilt> unfortunately the fact that the forms architecture is relational based may well hinder the appserver design in the long run and I have accepted that
<reinhard_> we would never ever have seen the real problem
<neilt> except that I have see these problems
<neilt> but I will keep it to myself
<reinhard_> part of the problem relates to XMLRPC which is what you are refering to now
<reinhard_> and you are certainly right in that respect
<reinhard_> and part of the problem relates to bad design of the API
<reinhard_> which IIRC nobody saw before
<reinhard_> (at least I was not aware of it)
<neilt> I did, but people just want to see work done
<neilt> and everyone wanted this
<neilt> so i shut up and will do so again
<reinhard_> so then i would be thankful for a comment to the new api
<reinhard_> just a sec
<reinhard_> returning to my other ego

<reinhard> hello ariel_!
<ariel_> hi! did i lost something in the last hour?
<reinhard> possibly
<reinhard> neilt explained a system that lets you include several related business objects into a single "proxy" object
<reinhard> however i felt that i partly failed to understand :(
<neilt> and sorry about the rant
<neilt> but i think there is a big difference between  discussions that hold up progress and discussions that prevent further problems
<reinhard> there _is_ a big difference
<reinhard> the problem is that it's not always possible to tell in advance which category a discussion will end in ;-)
<neilt> exactly and that means that if you dont agree then continue on, never stop
<reinhard> whether i agree or not - input is always valuable
<reinhard> even whether i completely understand or not
<neilt> discussions should not mean that the idea has to adopted or dropped
<reinhard> its always better to have additional input
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> it's not only black or white
<neilt> the other item is that my view is for implementing large systems
<neilt> anyway i won't go there, sorry
<neilt> i better go nonw
<neilt> now
<neilt> later all
<reinhard> later neilt
<reinhard> thanks again

<jcater> omg!
<jcater> someone who uses the debian packages
<jcater> has sent in a patch which fixes the Property Inspector issue
<jcater> :) :) :)
<jcater> the one we've been trying to figure out for a year now
<psu> yay!
<jcater> and it's a one-liner
<jcater> whoop!
<drochaid> is that the "can't edit field with scroll bars present" one?
<psu> this is the great thing about free software
<psu> users who fix their own bugs
<psu> gotta love 'em
<jcater> drochaid: yeah
<drochaid> :)
<jcater> psu: for the KC, that was from Monte Lin
<jcater> :)
<jcater> hint, hint
<psu> All hail!
Action: psu will have to cross-ref this to all the previous KC threads mentioning the bug
<psu> must be a good dozen of them
<jcater> You mean the one's where I said it was a WX bug, and not a GNUe bug?
Action: jcater hides his head in shame
<psu> first line of defence "the wx docs weren;t clear"
<drochaid> lol
<psu> second line of defence "no-one else noticed it either"
<psu> third line "derek told me to do it that way"
<psu> ;-)
<jcater> lol
Action: drochaid swaps first and third round
<psu> Can people please check 
<psu> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/community/contrib.php
<psu> in their favourite browser
<psu> The e-mail addresses should be just about readable, but not too clear
<psu> to foil spambots
<psu> (probably futile, but I feel a need to make an effort)
<drochaid> looks good in Opera v6.04 on Win2k
<jcater> looks good in Konqueror 3
<psu> and I guess even if anyone can test in MSIE, they are hardly likely to "out" themselves in this channel...
<drochaid> lol
Action: drochaid doesn't want to test it in IE
Action: drochaid doesn't want to have to reboot his machine
Action: jcater cranks up his win4lin instance
<jcater> well, for the most part, looks good
<jcater> the email addresses look like they're in superscript on IE 6 :)
<jcater> ah cool
<jcater> those are images
<jcater> isn't that spiffy
<drochaid> well spotted ;)
<psu> I'm assuming that most of the people on the end of info@gnue.org have spamassasin 
<jcater> I do
<psu> but for some of the others, an ounce of prevention
<psu> Of course, it stuffs lynx users right royally
<psu> but I'm afraid the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
<psu> (in this case - I am normally a "sites unreadable in lynx are broken sites" zealot)
<jamest> man
<jcater> What manual page do you want?
<jamest> that many people are willing to associate their name w/ gnue
<jamest> the net is just full of sick people
<psu> jamest: well, some of the "gone but not forgotten"s might be trying to live it down ;-)
<jamest> they were young and didn't know better eh?
<psu> i think some of them are people we acquired in mergers
<jcater>  hehe
<jcater> spoken by a true accountant
<psu> back wehn you & derek were in "embrace and extend" mode
<jcater> "we acquired in mergers"
<psu> well, we have to leverage our brand identity and focus on our core vision
Action: psu is obviously sick, being able to come up w/this sort of stuff on a Sun
Action: psu is away: gone to recover
<jamest> me in embrace and extend
<jamest> what was I thinking
<jamest> more users = more issues
<jamest> more coders = more solutions to those issues
<drochaid> ok, who's got my NAV cd?
<drochaid> own up, I know one of you do
Action: jcater hides
Action: drochaid stares
Action: drochaid starts to cry
<drochaid> this is ridiculous
<drochaid> I'm a firkin Symantec authorised software partner

<ajmitch> morning you lot
<jcater> afternoon, senior aj
<jcater> psu: have you given any thought on how to handle our new GNUe/Small Business Edition?
<jcater> I think derek and I were leaning towards keeping it as GNUe
<jcater> (and so having it be a part of GNUe's website, somehow)
<jcater> we just wanted a separate CVS tree
<ajmitch> jcater: they been approved by savannah yet? :)
<jcater> ajmitch: I got root + savannah admin acces
<jcater> s
<jcater> so, yes :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<jcater> I signed up for savannah-hackers 2 days ago

<psu> jcater: Is the rationale for gnue-sb as seperate simply that

<drochaid> wheeeeee
<jcater> psu: I wish derek were here
Action: drochaid on saberhagen
<psu> yep
<jcater> I think the final verdict is
<jcater> this is not really a self-fork
<jcater> this is a smaller, scaled down version
<jcater> incidentally
<jcater> we are **strongly** considering going to this gnue-??? model
<jcater> for all our gnue stuff
<jcater> gnue-forms
<jcater> gnue-reports
<jcater> etc
Action: psu likes
<psu> gives us an auto structure for the web site too
<psu> as each gnue-foo will have its own mini site on www.gnu.org
<jcater> I hadn't considered the website structure implications
<jcater> actually, that is one of our hangups
<psu> with /software/gnue/ as the official entry point
<jcater> as we were expecting it to be harder to do the websight :)
<psu> and the whole thing mirrored onto ash
<jcater> website, even
<jcater> well
<jcater> another thing
<jcater> this would let gnue.org be more of a community site like derek's always clamoring for
<jcater> as we would always have easily accessible tool sites
<jcater> I dunno... I'll let our webmaster figure all that out
<jcater> <cough>psu
<psu> well, www.gnuenterprise.org already has things that we wouldn't ever put on www.gnu.org
<psu> e.g. the irc logs
<jcater> one of the big concerns is that our gnue/ cvs is getting way too big :)
Action: psu nods
<drochaid> psu: are you the website maintainer?
<psu> drochaid: for my sins ;-)
<drochaid> psu: could you do me a favour on it please? :)
<psu> bugs to www-support@gnuenterprise.org
<psu> drochaid: no nekkid goat porn
<psu> derek said
<psu> ;-)
<drochaid> give documentation a much more prominent position?
<drochaid> ah boo to the nekkid goat porn ban :'(
<psu> Documentation is a funny one
<psu> as we only have 1 docs page at the moment 
<psu> but there are at least 3 levels
<psu> a) end user docs
<psu> b) application developer docs (people designing apps with gnue)
<drochaid> I always find it's one of the most important link .. and just now it's the 2nd last item on the menu, or into community and the 2nd last item, there
<psu> c) GNUe developer docs 
<jcater> drochaid: I think psu is waiting on us to give him better docs ;)
<drochaid> I'd like to see "GNUe Docs" beside "GNUe Community" in the top header
<psu> Short term, I may as well go back to the old "fudge"
<drochaid> jcater: LOL
<psu> which is to have Docs listed in both Project
<psu> (loghically just under "Downloads"
<psu> ) 
<psu> and also in Community as well
<drochaid> jcater: I can't comment on that, I promised to write some back in June .. haven't had time yet :)
<drochaid> psu: or just see my suggestion above maybe?
<psu> The main sections (other than Project) link to the three bullet points on the home page
<psu> at the moment
<psu> So I guess I'd have to say that GNue was 4 things, one of which is a repository of docs 
<psu> and add another tab along the top
<psu> Actually, that might not be a bad idea
Action: drochaid spies psu trying to work drochaids suggestion round to his own way of thinking ;)
<psu> but of course
<psu> I used to be a consultant 
<jcater> can I chime in?
<psu> and all consultants know the art of modifying the customer's ideas
<psu> to fit the pre-packeged solution
<psu> jcater: ?
<jcater> I'd hate to see another tab across the top
<jcater> I think we have about as many tabs as we can realistically put there
Action: psu agrees, esp. at 800 x 600
<drochaid> psu: what I think you'll find the real situation is, is that consultants take customer ideas and make them fit a pre-packaged solution
<drochaid> :)
Action: drochaid spits at jcater for dashing his new tab idea
Action: jcater ignores drochaid... is used to being spit on
<drochaid> lol
<jcater> I think each tab deserve's its own doc menu
<jcater> menu=page
<drochaid> :o
<drochaid> jcater: really really bad idea IMHO
<jcater> GNUe Community --> Developer Docs
<jcater> err
<jcater> crickey
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> but if we have a centralized doc page
<jcater> I think it's going to be so confusing
<drochaid> just thinking on basic knowledge management philophies
<drochaid> if someone isn't sure which category a doc is likely to be in, could piss them off trying to find it
Action: jcater is thinking on basic "Designing around tasks"
<jcater> mentality
<jcater> i.e., "What task is this web visitor doing?"
<jcater> Studying/writing with GNUe Tools?
<drochaid> if they're centralised, there's nothing to stop you linking to docs within other sections as required
<jcater> Looking for Downloadable solutions?
<jcater> looking for goat pr0n?
<jcater> drochaid: well, that is true
<jcater> I'm still not sure I agree though :)
<jcater> my $0.02 (USD)
<jcater> :
<drochaid> my suggestion would also allow the docs to be linked from within the sections at a location that is appropriate to the doc rather than a "docs" section in each main section
<jcater> Each module/tool/package needs a documentation section on its page
<jcater> but then each tab should have a documentation page
<jcater> linking to all relevant documentation
<jcater> e.g., GNUe-Forms has a doc section
<jcater> but GNUe Tools section
<jcater> has a doc page of all GNue Tools docs
<jcater> and on the right hand side
<jcater> the last (or first, whatever)
<jcater> option under GNUe Tools
<jcater> is 
<jcater> Documentation
<jcater> So, you end up with
<jcater> GNUe Tools
<jcater>   Forms
<jcater>   Designer
<jcater>   ....
<jcater>   Document Store
<jcater>   Documenation
<jcater> Gnue Packages
<jcater>   Financials
<jcater>   ....
<jcater>   DCL
<jcater>   Documentation
<jcater> or maybe having Docs as first option makes more sense
<jcater> either way
<jcater> am I making sense?
<drochaid> yes
<jcater> the Forms/ page would still list all the form-related docs
<jcater> but from the main menu, you could quickly get to all tool-related docs too
<drochaid> but I still disagree with the positioning/logic behind it
<jcater> that's ok, because I disagree with yours :)
<jcater> grrrr
<drochaid> I noticed :)
Action: jcater runs off to get his duel weapons
<jcater> drochaid: I challenge you to a duel
<drochaid> LOL
<drochaid> ok
<drochaid> I've got a claymore
Action: jcater takes off his gloves
<drochaid> which arm would you like to loose first? :)
Action: jcater puts his gloves back on and slowly walks away
<drochaid> bwhahaHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAA
<jcater> one of the things we've been emphasizing over the last month or so
<jcater> is that the tools get lost in the apps
<jcater> so we're trying to point out that GNue is 3 projects in one
<jcater> I just think the documentation should follow in that focus as well
<jcater> and I'm talking at a minimum here
<drochaid> whereas I would always classify documention as a separate project, as without really good docs, the tools/apps are useless to the less than technical users
<jcater> as far as I'm concerned, we could do: 
<drochaid> ie, me
<jcater> gnue.org/docs <-- all docs, categorized
<jcater> gnue.org/tools/docs <-- all tool-related docs
<jcater> gnue.org/tools/forms/docs <-- all form-related docs
<jcater> after all, I don't think psu has anything better to do
<drochaid> LOL
<drochaid> I would REALLY just rather see gnue.org/docs
<drochaid> sub cats as required in that
<jcater> we already have that
<drochaid> and links to individual docs as required from the relevant sections of the rest
<drochaid> yeah, you have that logically .. but not obviously from a UI pov
<jcater> I don't like it from either standpoint, but we've already established that :)_
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> oh well, I'm not even a pretend member of the community, so I'll just bow out gracefully now ;)
Action: jcater was hoping others would chime in
<drochaid> I think psu is hiding
<jcater> as if I'm in the minority, I'll certainly bow out
<jcater> I really don't know what others think
Action: psu isn't really fussed
<drochaid> hey, even if you're in the majority ... you're still wrong jcater
Action: drochaid runs away
<jcater> depends on the perspective
Action: psu notes we need a lot more docs before any of this matters
<jcater> I still believe in task-oriented websites
<psu> but that willcome
<jcater> psu: true dat
<psu> anyway
<drochaid> jcater: yeah, but as I've mentioned, I believe the docs are as important a task as the tools
Action: psu is away: assisting wife's essay crisis - still logging
<jcater> drochaid: by task, I mean visitor task
<drochaid> damn, that means we can't insult psu :'(
<jcater> :(
<jcater> of course
<drochaid> jcater: I mean it in both development and visitor tasks
<jcater> I'll say this, as I have many times before
<jcater> ...as long as someone else is doing the website maintenance
<jcater> I am happy with whatever
<jcater> :)
<drochaid> personally, I go to a site to find out about something, I want to see a prominant about/downloads/docs arrangement so I can scan quicjly and easily
<drochaid> I don't want to have to go into one section and scan, then move to another and scan etc
<jcater> odds are, though
<jcater> you care about one section or another
<jcater> i.e., you are here to develop with the tools
<jcater> or you are here for the packages
<drochaid> most will be, some won't
<drochaid> even tho I'm nowhere near technical enough to think about developing .. I may still want to scan the docs as I find an understanding of the architecture and coding can help me design with a tool
<drochaid> so I still use both
<drochaid> anyways, I doubt either of us are going to change opinion since BOTH our opinions are valid from a different perspective ..
<drochaid> so a small change of topic instead [and just SLIGHTLY OT :)]
<drochaid> can anyone think of a decent domain to use for "Andrew Robertson Studios"??

<jcater> ack!
<derek> jcater: you around?
<psu> drochaid: I assume the obvious 3-letter abbreviation is taken?
Action: derek hasnt read back logs and i have nasty well ...
<derek> im pissing out my arse ;)
<derek> i will respond to your mail ASAP (between runs to the border)
<drochaid> psu: it is :'(
<jcater> otay
<jcater> no hurry
<derek> all points are very valid and was hoping to resolve before i committed anything last night
<derek> but got impatient :)
<jcater> not like we're releasing tomorrow anyway :)
<jcater> I just wanted to put all my thoughts down in writing
<jcater> while they were fresh
<drochaid> psu: as are all the most likely contenders I've thought of except the full name which I think is just too much
<drochaid> allo de
<drochaid> rek
<derek> jcater: well actually...
<derek> we will be releasing VERY soon possibly even tomorrow
<derek> likely no later than wednesday
<derek> at least for item stuff
<psu> drochaid: try a .biz or other bijou domain?
<derek> so it is 'critical' for me :)
<drochaid> psu: erk, no ta
<jcater> ah
Action: derek is very upset that gsd stuff in common is grossly broked
Action: derek understands why and how and stuff happens 
<psu> drochaid: domain name registration is so critical these days 
Action: psu is registering a domain for a business I have no intention of starting for at least 2 years
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> very wise
<drochaid> I launched ARS on the 1st July 2001
<drochaid> been thinking about a domain since may 2001
<drochaid> got 2 photographers [inc me] and 2 artists involved just now
<drochaid> and STILL no domain :'(
Action: psu is away: bbl
<drochaid> oh dear, I frightened him off :)
<dtm> drochaid: hey there1
<dtm> !
<drochaid> hey dtm :)
<dtm> derek: so did you code stuff last night?
<dtm> drochaid: howya doin?
<drochaid> erm .. no, but I designed a fairly complex site structure
Action: drochaid notes he isn't derek and shuts up
<dtm> hehe well that's cool anyway!
<dtm> we all want to be derek, but alas there can be only one.
<drochaid> LOL
<jcater> thank gawd!
<jcater> I don't think I could ever get any rest
<drochaid> we don't want to be derek right now ;)
<jcater> with multiple dereks
<derek> you dont want to be derek right now
<derek> unless you like well severe stomach cramping
<dtm> no i dont!
<dtm> so i hereby reiterate my committment to delegating all derek-like duties to derek.
Action: dtm is not derek
<ajmitch> who wants to be ajmitch for the day?
<jcater> ajmitch: not I, unless you are a well-figured 19 year old blonde chick
<ajmitch> sorry
<dtm> well he might be, for all we know!
<jcater> true dat
<dtm> has anyone ever met the REAL ajmitch?
Action: ajmitch checks
<dtm> and how would you know?
Action: chillywilly has seen pictures f ajmitch
<dtm> if you did?
<ajmitch> nope, i'm not well-figured, 19, blonde, or a chick
<dtm> chillywilly: how can you be sure?
<chillywilly> dtm: how can I be sure that you are who you say you are?
<ajmitch> come on, all i need is someone to sit the exam for me this afternoon! :)
<jcater> I'd be happy to sit in
<jcater> I couldn't promise a good grade though
<ajmitch> neither can i :)
<chillywilly> blah, I have more cleaning to do
<jcater> anyone know of some good, non-permanent glue?
<jcater> I want to turn some paper into, basically, sticky notes
<ajmitch> most glue will break down after you try to restick the notes 
<chillywilly> by some frelling sticky notes ;)
<jcater> I don't need to restick them
<ajmitch> anyway, bbiab
<jcater> just one time use
<jcater> but when I take it down
<jcater> I don't want any glue to remaind
<jcater> remain
<chillywilly> I gess this goes to show just how cheap VPs are ;)
Action: chillywilly is away: clean the house
<derek> jcater: dont use jet glue then ;)
<derek> you want 'rubber cement' based stuff likely
<derek> as it is more like 'stickem' than glue
<jcater> ok
<jcater> I'm using christmas wrapping paper as a faux wallpaper
<jcater> in a display in the bookstore
<jcater> so, come December 26, I want it to peel off :)

<Mr_You> hehe, didn't know such a thing existed ;-)
<jcater> www.google.com
<jcater> works for me
<chillywilly> someone pasted the url fr the page into this channel a while back, iirc

<jcater> but I don't know the url
<ajmitch> makeashorterlink.com?

<Dema> I sent an email to www-supPort@gnuenterprise.org some time ago (retried today also) which gives an error-message. Then i tried with a guess: dneighbo gnue.org but I didn't get any reply on that.
<Dema> Can someone tell me this is alright, I can forget it and go to sleep? Or should I resend the mail (correction for webpages) to another email?
<derek> email to info@gnue.org for now
<derek> if you can email the error you get when sending to www-support@gnuenterprise.org as well that would be good
<derek> as we can fix it
<Dema> will info@gnue spam lot's of ppl?
<derek> nope
<derek> like 5 or so
<derek> you can send directly to derek@gnue.org if you are worried
<Dema> Ok, it's running through the net.

<aliguori> hello all
<aliguori> i was browsing the gnue website and saw the app server diagram
<aliguori> had a quick question about the security adapter layer...
<aliguori> noticed that ldap and active directory were connected to it (presumably, example security plugins)
<aliguori> ldap doesn't seem like nearly enough for enterprise security though (and security is a huge part of the app server) so i was wondering if this project is going to have a huge dependecy on active directory?
<aliguori> or are there plans to work on an enterprise security layer?
<ajmitch> probably plans to work on something - i very much doubt that there'd be an AD dependency :)
<aliguori> it seems like a big portion...
<ajmitch> there's possibly more details in the mailing list archives - that's just an early diagram
<aliguori> is this the same app server that the dotGNU project refers too?
<ajmitch> most likely :)
<aliguori> :)
<ajmitch> especially as i'm the one who talks about dotgnu & gnue the most :)
<aliguori> lol
<aliguori> so this is the one that supposed to support both j2ee and clr ;-)
<aliguori> a mighty big task...
<ajmitch> say what?
<ajmitch> not the GNUe appserver..
<aliguori> what's it based on?
<ajmitch> the GNUe appserver is written in python
<aliguori> hmmm, that's quite different :)
<ajmitch> yes
<aliguori> i guess i don't know enough about python to know whether it would lend itself to this kind of model
<aliguori> does it have an architecture similiar to j2ee or .net?
<ajmitch> it's a programming language - we build the architecture :)
<aliguori> :)
<jcater> I think you are describing a completely different type of appserver than GNUe is building
<ajmitch> probably
<jcater> this must be dotGNU's stuff, I take it?
<aliguori> when i think of app server, i think WebLogic, WebSphere, or the MS App server...
<aliguori> how does the GNUe app server differ?
<jcater> well,take away all those "web" references, for starters
<aliguori> btw: i'm terribly interested in this area as i've been doing a lot of active directory interoperability work, so sorry if this comes off as grilling ;-)
<aliguori> so its not based on a web client model, that's a good start IMHO
<jcater> but I'm not really a good one to be asking about appserver
<jcater> our main goal with gnue appserver is centralizing business application rules
<jcater> business logic, if you will
<jcater> there were a host of "Halloween" messages posted to our gnue-dev mailing list yesterday
<jcater> from the October 31 meeting of the appserver guys
Action: ajmitch only saw one :(
<jcater> note that we aren't building a generic, all purpose application server
<jcater> ajmitch: ??
<aliguori> doh, i see that now :)
<ajmitch> only saw one halloween message
<ajmitch> hmm, i subscribed to that list yesterday
<ajmitch> or was it day before
<ajmitch> i should have got those messages anyway :)
<derek> http://www.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/geas_notes.txt
<derek> from a meeting a while back
<derek> you will notice goal number one precludes use of j2ee and/or .NET
<aliguori> i thought that was what dotGNU was though... a web services server (which is an app server) with a GPL CLR implementation
<aliguori> my confusion i guess is the relationship between GNUe and dotGNU.  dotGNU is implementing an open version of .NET and .NET app server and business logic server
<ajmitch> no
<ajmitch> DotGNU is building a framework with things like DGEE, which maybe what you're thinking of
<ajmitch> it's not going for just a .NET clone
<aliguori> yes, i realize its not just trying to be a clone, but its implementing similiar functionality, or at least, this was my impression
<ajmitch> yeah

<jcater> nice /quit message
<aliguori> so, it seems that the GNUe app server is based on RPC, LDAP, and Python.  Seems a bit like Active Directory...
<jcater> so is my email program
Action: jcater isn't familiar w/active directory
<ajmitch> jcater: MS' spawn
<rdean> AD = MS's answer to Novell NDS (at least it was NDS at the time...think it's Novell OpenDirectory now)
<jcater> that's what I was thinking
Action: jcater is curious what that has to do with our business rules server
<aliguori> so, my understanding of an app server is that its composed of a transport protocol (j2ee for WL & WS, LDAP+RPC for AD, and SOAP for .NET), a big server-library, and a database/transaction server
<derek> aliguori: huh?
<rdean> from a web services perspective, I think you could have the business rules registered in the directory, and then clients would look it up in the directory when needed
<derek> appserver can run fine w/o ldap
<derek> it uses rpc but virtually any
<derek> SOAP, CORBA, DCOM what ever melts your butter
<aliguori> yes, ad uses both, but you could use anything
Action: derek doesnt see it as anything REMOTELY like AD
<derek> at ALL
<derek> i would see it more like
<derek> MTS
<derek> than AD
<aliguori> MTS?
<rdean> MS Transaction Server
<aliguori> ok
<derek> and even there its a bad analogy
<derek> but better than active directory
<aliguori> active directory isn't an app server
<aliguori> it was a step towards one i imagine...
<derek> nah
<derek> active directory 
<derek> imho is 3 things
<derek> 1. replacement to ldap (m$ doesnt want open standards)
<aliguori> so ms's extensions to ldap actually were quite logically... but they did break the standards a bit superfluously ;-)
<derek> 2. a penis measuring contest with Novells NDS (i.e. they have gotten their arses kicked so bad in this area bill problably told people their job was gone if they didnt trump novell in directory services)
<derek> 3. a way to lockout non microsoft platforms from directory services
<derek> best i can tell they are being successfull at 1 and 3
<derek> but still falling short on 2
<aliguori> the interesting thing about ad, is that they were able to integrate more of the platform into directory
<rdean> it's just the logical extension of MS Registry
<derek> rdean: yes i think thats where they are going
<derek> basically network registry services
<derek> NDS was there to make admin life easy
<derek> ADS is there to chain your ass to mickey soft
Action: jcater stopped caring about MS plans long, long ago
<derek> that is of course my opinion
<jcater> boy, do I sleep better at night
<jcater> well, at least, until I hooked up with GNUe
<aliguori> so, my interest in the MS stuff is merely in overlap between dotGNU and GNUe of course :)
<jcater> now I have nightmares about shackles and dots and Mt Dew
<rdean> don't stop caring...stop worrying, but don't stop caring.....MS can lock up things with patents that will give open/free software developers fits
<aliguori> i am not one of those keep up with ms people :)
<aliguori> just trying to understand the two projects better :)
<jcater> aliguori: we are two very independent projects
<jcater> rdean: ok, I give you that
<derek> crap i have a box of dots hidden away
Action: derek forgot
Action: derek thanks jcater
<aliguori> jcater: yes, and i still don't understand the difference--that could be my ignorance ;-)
<derek> aliguori: at this point there is no ties to dotgnu with gnue
<aliguori> simply because an app server isn't a small task, at least, if scalability and mass acceptance is desired
<derek> except perhaps observers that observe both projects
<derek> there have been talks on two items
<derek> one is using gnu-rpc
<ajmitch> derek: yes
<aliguori> gnu-rpc?
<derek> which at some point if a CLR was available could be converted into that
<ajmitch> derek: that's what i'm working on
<derek> also there was talk by dotGNU folks to look at appserver as something they are interested in
<derek> i couldnt tell you the status of either of these from dotGNU
<derek> GNUe has working gnu-rpc in our cvs
<derek> which was our end of the bargain :)
<ajmitch> i'm probably the main person who has feet in both projects (not so much in GNUe)
<ajmitch> the gnu-rpc implementation will be getting worked on next week after i finish exams, and appserver will be used where it suits 
<ajmitch> if appserver is not suitable for more generic tasks, then we'll sort something else out :)
<aliguori> whats gnu-rpc based on? dce-rpc
<aliguori> ?
<ajmitch> no
<aliguori> any particular reason not to base it on dce-rpc?
<ajmitch> gnu-rpc is an abstraction layer to allow multiple transports to be used
<derek> think perl-dbi only for rpc mechanisms
<derek> again its written in python
<ajmitch> well, the GNUe implementation is done in python :)
<aliguori> how so?
<ajmitch> my one is being done in C#
<aliguori> is it an object model?
<ajmitch> in a way - it's like System.Runtime.Remoting on .NET
<ajmitch> where remote objects can be manipulated in ways like local ones (at least that's the plan)
<aliguori> not familiar with C# i'm afraid...
<derek> i still think programmers should be more creative
<aliguori> so its just like COM
Action: Mr_You makes note.
<derek> object.sniff.butt
<derek> and such
<Mr_You> dol, scrollback syndrome.
<Mr_You> doh
<ajmitch> heh
<jcater> derek: what, you haven't looked at our dbdriver system?
<ajmitch> no, COM is less than ideal, it's one reason why .NET exists, to fix up some of MS' screwups & crappy COM API
<derek> gack... oo creates ugly html
<derek> http://www.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/schema.html
<derek> new gsd info
<aliguori> .NET is much more than that...
<derek> mainly the bottom part is relevant
<ajmitch> aliguori: i realise that
<ajmitch> aliguori: and DotGNU is far more than the gnu-rpc implementation :)
<aliguori> lol
<ajmitch> jcater: you into compiler sado-masochism?
<jcater> ajmitch: I am into all forms of S&M
<derek> .NET to date is nothing
<derek> cept vapor
<derek> i got to sit through 5 days of smoke and mirrors to prove it ;)
<jcater> compiler, tail recursion, self-modifying python code
<ajmitch> derek: and the framework which people are using & have been writing apps on for awhile :)
<jcater> you name it
<derek> it actually has code so its not vapor i guess
<derek> but it was FAR from complete
<derek> i felt like i was in a GNUe demo :)
<ajmitch> jcater: cool, i'm going to add python code generation support to treecc :)
<aliguori> derek: MS has released a .NET server beta...
<Mr_You> how did the bayonne demo go?
<ajmitch> so if you want ultimate bloat, GNUe could get a compiler! ;)
<jcater> lol
<jcater> cool
<jcater> I guess
<jcater> actually
<jcater> I've been looking into supporting
<jcater> pyco
<jcater> sorry, psyco
<ajmitch> real?
<chillywilly> tail recursion?
<jcater> http://psyco.sourceforge.net/
<derek> aliguori / ajmitch not to burst your bubble, but m$ releases BETAS nearly 2 years before final product ships.  Most customers consider the shipping product not USABLE until Service Pack 1 at a minimum
<chillywilly> self-modifying code?!?
<jcater> ajmitch: completely optional, of course
<derek> currently that puts .NET about 18 mos out from even being usable
<ajmitch> derek: gives others time to catch up then :)
<ajmitch> chillywilly: python is suited for it
<aliguori> besides, .NET has moved away from rpc.. rpc has many problems...
<derek> wtf?
<jcater> rpc is a generic term
<derek> all they do is preach SOAP
<derek> whtf is SOAP?
<jcater> just like "app server" is :)
<derek> smells like RPC to me
<ajmitch> rpc plus a dash or 10 of hype :)
<chillywilly> derek: sime object access protocol
Action: jcater breaks out into tune of "Smells like Teen Spirit"
<derek> no when i say SOAP i mean gnu-rpc SUPPORTS SOAP
<chillywilly> yep, her rpc means nthing but remote invocation
<chillywilly> er, here
<aliguori> ah, i see
Action: derek thinks its impossible ot have these hyped up buzzwords like 'web services'
<derek> w/o RPC
<derek> as without RPC you done have thick clients
<chillywilly> yuuuuuup
<derek> RPC = Remote Procedure Call
<derek> could be CORBA, DCOM, RMI, SOAP, XML-RPC, FOOMAGIC you name it
<derek> i.e. its generic like the term SQL
<chillywilly> GOATSPEAK?
<derek> hmm i almost have that ready for release
<chillywilly> that's what we should call the tcp/ip mechanism
<derek> oh wait thats COWSPEAK
<chillywilly> GOATSPEAK
<derek> mooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.
<Mr_You> the vinum author says you should be able to do remote mirrors using software RAID and iSCSI ;-)
<derek> iSCSI just sounds like a BAAAAAD idea to me
<chillywilly> sime, effective, and painful ;)
<Mr_You> no way
<derek> certainly it could have its uses
<chillywilly> GOATSPEAK
<chillywilly> er, simple
<derek> but overall it seems like more hype less substance
<chillywilly> well, to make a tre analogy
<chillywilly> grpc format is more like WSDL than anything, imho
<Mr_You> atleast with cisco they are providing stats showing near fiber channel capability... like REALLY close..
<Mr_You> or even in other aspects
<chillywilly> we suport multiple transports like WSDL
<chillywilly> etc.
<ajmitch> chillywilly: yup
<ajmitch> siesel & i have talked a little about gnu-rpc stuff
<Mr_You> derek: it will be excellent for synchronous file system replication.
<Mr_You> over long distances
<Mr_You> or even locally
<chillywilly> having looke dat both mysefl
<chillywilly> looked at
<chillywilly> WSDL is more crack-laden ;)
Action: jcater will stick with my carrier pidgeon redundency system
<Mr_You> siesel is not here ;-)
<chillywilly> grpc is KISS all the way
<Mr_You> oh duh
<ajmitch> of course
<Mr_You> I read that wrong.
<ajmitch> we don't need to hype it
<derek> Mr_You: why would siesel need to be here
Yurik (~yrashk@as5300.kharkov.ukrtel.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> jcater is one that wrote gnu rpc
<Mr_You> I thought andrew directed a message to siesel
<derek> true siesel has fine tuned parts but really most of the code base was commited by jcater certainly he could answer the questions as well as jan :)
<Mr_You> nothing more ;-)
<derek> he might not like to admit it, but that beast was his work :)
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> you outted me
<jcater> now, how can I face my 2-tier friends?
<ajmitch> i talked to siesel cos jcater is scary
<jcater> mwahaha
<jcater> boo!
Action: ajmitch is scarier, especially when using the nick andrewm
