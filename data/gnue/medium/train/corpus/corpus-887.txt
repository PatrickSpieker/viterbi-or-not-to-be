<Chipaca> hi all
<btami> hi
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> is it me or do you guys think it is lame to have a private devel/dev list for a Free software project?
<Chipaca> we have a private list and a public list, the private list is for coordination of the Fundación's team, not for discussion of the project
<Chipaca> dunno if you were referring to us :)
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> hurd-devel
<chillywilly> is read only unless yo are blessed or something
<chillywilly> s/yo/you/
<Chipaca> it is lame, but until recently all of GNU's subprojects were carried like that
<Chipaca> (cf. Cathedral)
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> LAME
<chillywilly> ;)
<Chipaca> quick question on python: is it "global foo; import foo" or viceversa?
<chillywilly> to import a module?
<Chipaca> yeap
<chillywilly> it si the latter
<Chipaca> in the OnStartup trigger, to be able to use it from the others
<chillywilly> crap I have to go

<Chipaca> jamest: hi
<Chipaca> jamest: tell me more about trigger libraries
<jamest> they're broken!
<jamest> :)
<Chipaca> ah, ok
<Chipaca> so I'll just carry on importing stuff the python way
<jamest> well
<jamest> how they work is
<jamest> your create a trigger lib file
<jamest> <form>
<Chipaca> suits me way up to the point the gfd lives in the database
<jamest>   <trigger type="named" name="foo">
<jamest>      print "Hi Mom"
<jamest>   </trigger>
<jamest> </form>
<jamest> then in your .gfd file you have
<jamest> let me start over 
<jamest> i have two files
<Chipaca> yeah, i got that :)
<jamest> testlib.glb   (my own bs name)
<jamest> test.gfd
<jamest> bash-2.05a$ more testlib.glb
<jamest> <form>
<jamest> <trigger name="helloworld" type="NAMED">
<jamest>   print "I'm alive!!!!!!!!!!!"
<jamest> </trigger>
<jamest> </form>
<jamest> now in my test.gfd I have
<jamest> <form tabbed="top" title="Welcome to GNUe Forms">
<jamest> <import-trigger library="./testlib.glb" name="helloworld"/>
<jamest> <trigger type="on-startup" name="startupTest" src="helloworld"/>
<jamest> the ./ on the library name is meaningless
<Chipaca> :)
<jamest> btw - I'm working on the library system now
<jamest> if you want to use them I think you can get the old system working by going into GFParser.py
<Chipaca> meaningless as in ignored, meaningless as in superfluous, meaningless as in breaks?
<jamest> meaning it'll pull from the current dir by default
<Chipaca> we're not currently on current cvs :)
<jamest> that's fine
<jamest> this hasn't changed in ages
<jamest> anyway try a simple one like above 
<Chipaca> ok
<jamest> if you get a key error with a key of 0
<jamest> then in GFParser.py look for a line like
<jamest>       self._importclass = self._xmlParser\
<jamest>          .getXMLelements()[string.lower(self._type[9:])][0]
<jamest> change the [0] at the end to read
<jamest> ['BaseClass']
<jamest> what I did for my testcase 
<jamest> was to take the intro.gfd file and modify the top to read like what I pasted above
Action: jamest is altering the parser system to allow other gnue apps to do imports
<jamest> the current cvs is forms only wrt imports
<Chipaca> ok
<jamest> i should have any gnue apps able to do them this morning (time allowing)

<Chipaca>  You've got your bar in my foo! And you've got your foo on my bar!  Two great reams that ream well together!
<Chipaca> :)
<jamest> you know
<jamest> i wonder what companies think when they get error reports like that :)
<Chipaca> LOL
<Chipaca> 'uhhhh...'
<jamest> the worse I read about was a coder that left in a message to himself along the lines of 
<jamest> "hey dumbass, you shouldn't be able to do that"

<nickr> jamest: I aws just entertained by your anecdote
<jcater> btami: if you are only ever outputting xml, then no
<jcater> but I was leaving the option open to output more than that
<jcater> btw, if we don't want the \n's
<jcater> then the patch isn't necessary
<jcater> as there is already a stripContent or such flag in the xmlElements hash
<jcater> we just need to set that for the Layout tags
<btami> aha, but passthru isn't a layout tag :)
<jcater> ah, true
<btami> so i'v failed with simplereport wizard (text.xsl)
<btami> that was the reason i looked into GContent

<jcater> reaming error?
<Chipaca> you know, something like your foo is in my bar and your bar is in my foo or something like that
<jcater> how are you triggering that message?
<jcater> I've never seen it
<jcater> is it a specific function you are calling that triggers it
<jcater> or a certain trigger
<Chipaca> nope, when accessing the db
<Chipaca> it's in pgsql's extension triggers (or something like that, I'm no longer fresh on the error, but I just peeked at the irc logs and saw you asked something after I left last time)

<jamest> 1 ) keep the splash on top for 3 seconds 
<jamest> 2 ) drop the splashscren the moment the form was ready for processing
<jamest> it's 1 line of code either way
<jamest> I did 1 as on a fast system the splashscreen wouldn't have been up any time at all

<Chipaca> jcater: form.setFocus(widget) changes the focus back to the page, but it then changes back to the page the user clicked on

<jbailey> Anyone have a public gnue site of some sort I can show off to my boss?
<ajmitch> eh? gnue site?
<ajmitch> you mean dcl, or you thinking that gnue is web-based?
<jbailey> web based full gnue site.
<ajmitch> umm
Action: ajmitch doesn't think anyone is really using gnue as web-based
<jbailey> Hmmm.
<jbailey> I should probably just install it then, shouldn't I.
<ajmitch> would be a good idea if you want to maintain the debs ;)
<ajmitch> the main forms client is wxpython/pygtk based
<ajmitch> and designer uses wxpython
<revDeke>  a month ago i could have shown you a cool demo
<revDeke> basically had you install forms locally
<revDeke> and execute over ssh to my backend
<revDeke> but ssh2 screws that up :)
<revDeke> at least temporarily
Nick change: esands_ -> esands
<jbailey> Ah, okay - My boss is asking me whether we can use it for a simple PO system.  I think it's all good for that, yes?  Like it's stable, generally won't eat data and all that?
<jbailey> Backend would presummably one of our Oracle DBs or mysql or something like that.  Clients are all win32.
<jcater> lol... haven't had it eat data yet :)
<jcater> jbailey: I think it'll be fine
<jcater> as long as you don't have a user
<jcater> named dneighbo
<jcater> if that's the case, everything seems to fall apart
<jbailey> *lol*
<jbailey> how are the screens published to the client?
Action: jcater was only semi-joking
<revDeke> well i guess that means the good news is
<revDeke> im not sure its EVER eaten my data
<revDeke> its not accepted it before
<revDeke> but never eaten it
<revDeke> it has eaten all my X resources before
<revDeke> which was well interesting ;)
<ajmitch> screens are either supplied locally, or can be grabbed over http, iirc :)
<revDeke> if anyone says they changed the 'layout' system be very afraid to run old forms ;)
<revDeke> ajmitch: they can be grabbed over any transport supported by python
<revDeke> http/https/ftp/etc
<ajmitch> ah ok
<ajmitch> uses urlOpen() ?
<jcater> ajmitch: or the python equivalent, yip
<ajmitch> i think that is the python function
<jcater> gnue-reports --list-filters now works 
<jcater> :)
<ajmitch> sorry, it
<ajmitch> 's urlopen()
<ajmitch> cool
<jbailey> Nice, thanks.
<jbailey> I've gotten go ahead to play with gnue during work hours, sweet.
<ajmitch> yay!
<jbailey> Now if only I could get paid to abuse cw during work hours too.
<jbailey> But alas, my dream job is not yet here. =)

<Chipaca> hi all
<Chipaca> can I pass a paremeter to a trigger?
<jcater> no
<Chipaca> :(
<Chipaca> ok
<Chipaca> jcater: it's about cancelling the pageflip
<Chipaca> jcater: I need some way of saying form.setFocus(da_widget), without writing one trigger per page
<Chipaca> can you think of a way?
Action: Chipaca would do it in xml if the xml parser was up to it
<jcater> um
<jcater> you completely lost me
<Chipaca> good! (=:]
<Chipaca> where?
<jcater> <Chipaca> jcater: it's about cancelling the pageflip
<jcater> <Chipaca> jcater: I need some way of saying form.setFocus(da_widget), without writing one trigger per page
<jcater> <Chipaca> can you think of a way?
<jcater> * Chipaca would do it in xml if the xml parser was up to it
<ajmitch> you want a default widget set on each page?
<jcater> take your pick
<Chipaca> lol
<Chipaca> no
<ajmitch> hmm
<ajmitch> explain please :)
<Chipaca> I need to go back to the page the user was on if she forgot to fill something in
<ajmitch> ah
<Chipaca> or
<jcater> the goal was to allow triggers to return a true or false
<jcater> based on success/failure
<ajmitch> so you need to store the previous page visited?
<jcater> so if a failure was returned
<jcater> everything stops
<Chipaca> well, actually, if she forgot to commit or rollback, there's this popup that says "commit/rollback/cancel" except that the cancel thing isn't getting done (same problem)
<Chipaca> yeah, but the page has already changed, even in pre-focusout
<ajmitch> hmm
<jcater> then that's a bug w/page changing
Action: Chipaca feels like ripping out the whole wx thing and doing it over
<Chipaca> the feeling subsides
<Chipaca> :)

<ajmitch> you don't like the wxpython ui driver?
<ajmitch> or is this some other wx stuff? :)
<Chipaca> no, it's the wxpython ui driver
<Chipaca> (or maybe it's wxpython per se, dunno)
<Chipaca> the worst bug is the widget-seems-to-get-focus-but-doesn't
<Chipaca> that confuses the hell out of people
<jcater> I'm not getting that one any more
<ajmitch> wxpython 2.2 has a few issues, i guess :)
<ajmitch> anyone working on the pygtk driver?
<Chipaca> jcater: not the one with multiple rows, the one where you point at an entry but just on the border so the cursor isn't acutally I-shaped, click, and the | cursor appears in the entry, but the focus isn't there
<Chipaca> it's amazingly simple to trigger that one by accident
<jcater> lol
<jcater> I didn't even know about it
<jcater> all the time I've ever run forms
<jcater> I've never hit that bug
<Chipaca> lol
<Chipaca> I think we put it in dcl some time back
Action: ajmitch volunteers to play with the pygtk driver next week, for something to do
<ajmitch> i'm sorry, but wxpython just looks ugly on my gnome 2 desktop ;)
<jcater> I'd much rather see a Win32 driver written 
<ajmitch> so how is PAPO going?
<jcater> in case anyone cares :)
<dtm> aloha fewlz   what's the url for phpforms?

<Chipaca> dtm: I'm working on plain forms :)
<dtm> chillywilly: psp huh
<dtm> havne't heard of that
<ajmitch> chillywilly: which psp do you mean?
<chillywilly> python server pages
<ajmitch> i know of about 3 different psp products
<ajmitch> 2 of which are python, one is perl server pages :)
<chillywilly> eeek!
<chillywilly> not perl!
<chillywilly> nooooo!
<ajmitch> the only one which i am familiar with using, is the psp which is part of webware
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> this is what I am referring to
<dtm> chillywilly: oh yes, in this crazy universe some of you are in where you require zero compatibility with the outside world and instead reimplement the world one coordinate at a time, yes there's not much value in learning php.  :)
<dtm> hee hee
<dtm> in that case, it is indeed handy

<chillywilly> for the record
<ajmitch> chillywilly: so hack dcl
<dtm> of course for one who does not code or design at the speed of light
<dtm> .....
<chillywilly> dtm: are you talking smack?
<dtm> or who doesn't already know everything, and hence requires multiple points of view and multiple intelligences, then one must integrate one's code once in a while

<chillywilly> woops, try http://sf.net/projects/trioweb/
<dtm> because unlike the majority, they implement it correctly
<dtm> they use abstraction layers and other clever ideas
<dtm> dewd even I can see that stuff like postnuke is a rat's nest
<dtm> also i have discovered that php is highly tolerant of mistakes or suboptimal practices
<chillywilly> it's a pretty dead project though as I am converting to GNUe
<dtm> see, these things should be embraced properly
<ajmitch> you are?
<dtm> not chastized for what the kiddies do with it
<dtm> that's all!
<chillywilly> dtm: I was saying as a language I prefer python, it's a personal choice

<derek> jcater: it is a 'shorten' file

<derek> as chillywilly stated :)
<derek> the 'tape traders'
<derek> use it to trade live shows
<jcater> bah
<jcater> all my sound can be done with the BASIC "sound" command
<chillywilly> they bring their little mini disks or DAT stuff and tape the shows ;P
Action: derek thinks jcater is thinking why trade music when you have video... girls moaning is only so exciting ;)
<chillywilly> and mp3s are satan spawn becase it is loassy compression
<chillywilly> according to them
<derek> chillywilly: well they have valid points to a degree
<derek> they just go a little insane at times :)
<dtm> chillywilly: yeah, because they're fucked in the head
<chillywilly> sure, but the human ear is only so good ;)
<derek> chillywilly: i agree
<derek> the debate is lossless...
<derek> well once you go wav to ogg and trade the ogg
<derek> you shouldnt be going ogg 2 wav 2 ogg 2 wav etc...
<chillywilly> I don't care either way, but I don't go out of my way to piss them off and encode into mp3
<derek> i.e. the quality degrades not by 'copying' from one machine to antoher
<chillywilly> yea
<derek> but rather when 're-encoding'
<chillywilly> that's their argument
<dtm> they're basically paranoid about the EVENTUAL loss of quality in case some mind-baffling idiot decides to downsample or convert all their compressed audio, as if that somehow reduces the number of high quality encodings in the world
<chillywilly> they don't want shitty mp3s floating around
<derek> but regardless most of it is prog rock stuff i have no interest in
<chillywilly> derek: prog rock?
<derek> i would play the shn game if i found decent tape traders
<dtm> and they're protecting the allegedly lossless (it's inherently lossy due to the human ear, playback equipment, and the fact that most of em are live recordings anyway!) as if they're protecting a species against genocide.

<jcater> as much as I love debian
<jcater> gentoo portage is based on python
<jcater> that's just too kickass
<willieb> Aye :)
<willieb> which package contains /etc/gnue.conf?
<jcater> common contains some samples
<jcater> I don't know who did the ebuilds
<jcater> but it looks wrong :)
<willieb> I like it when other people are wrong, not me!
<ajmitch> heh
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> these are off
<jcater> I may be able to tweak them into working

Action: jcater needs to get a "test OS" system though
<ajmitch> sigh this computer feels sluggish
<jcater> ajmitch: send it my way
<willieb> what spec is the hardware?
<jcater> I'm sure it'll work for my test system :)
<ajmitch> ahtlon xp 1800+, 512MB ram
<jcater> yup
<jcater> that'll do
<willieb> ppphhh - sluggish you say?  my machine here does very nicely  p2@400, 256MB
<Mr_You> jcater: removable HD do?  or multiple partitions?
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I'd rather have a separate machine
<jcater> as I would like to test on other OS's
<jcater> but I sure as hell don't want to code the fixes on them
<jcater> :)
Action: jcater needs break down and buy VMWare
<Mr_You> heh
<Mr_You> hmm
<Mr_You> UML  would work for multiple distros I guess
<jcater> I wish plex86 were further along
<Mr_You> linux distros
<ajmitch> perhaps it's the stuff i'm running
<ajmitch> but harddrive access seems to be slow (have to change filesystem sometime too)
<jcater> ajmitch: yeah, I have an Athlon 1700 at work
<jcater> and the harddrive access was worse
<jcater> than on my 800Mhz Duron
<jcater> I dunno why
<ajmitch> this tends to swap a bit
<jcater> I played w/hdparm and got much better performance
<jcater> but still not where it should be imho
<ajmitch> perhaps i should get another 512MB & turn swap off
<ajmitch> yeah, hdparm reports reasonable performance
<Mr_You> swap off or no swap is askin for trouble ;-)
<ajmitch> Mr_You: with 1GB of RAM?
<jcater> geeze!
<jcater> and you're swapping?
<jcater> you must be running OpenOffice AND mozilla AT THE SAME TIME
<ajmitch> jcater: no, i said i only have 512
<jcater> ah
<ajmitch> at the moment
<Mr_You> well.. swap space on server is abosolutely mandatory.. minimum of a gig... if its a desktop minimum of 256MB
<Mr_You> even with 1GB 
<Mr_You> even if it only uses 1MB of that swap.
<ajmitch> why?
<Mr_You> because you never know what app or whatever might have a memory leak or hog resources or what not.. its just a safety net.. if you have diskspace problems thats a whole other issue.
<jcater> wow
<jcater> these Gentoo ebuilds are way off
<ajmitch> no, if i have swap enabled, then it just delays the death a little
<Mr_You> delays the death to the point you can intervene?  ;-)
<ajmitch> hardly
<Mr_You> no it does
<Mr_You> I just never understood why people wanted so little swap.
<ajmitch> because on a normal system it's on the same disk as all the apps, and causes lots of disk access?
<Mr_You> not if you have plenty of ram ;-)
<ajmitch> s/normal/normal desktop/
<willieb> are you seeing anything in the ebuilds in particular, or just in general?
<Mr_You> In the past I increased solaris boxes swap space many times cause people configured machines with little swap. ;-)
<jcater> willieb: in general
<Mr_You> unfortunately swap files, cause not worth adding a partition.
<jcater> e.g., common is not dependent on DCL or wxPython
<jcater> and the Common ebuild doesn't set up default /etc/gnue stuff
<Mr_You> I dunno if linux allows swap files.. which if it does.. swap size doesn't matter so much cause you can just add some.
<Mr_You> but I'd rather just go ahead and give 256MB with disk space being so cheap
<jcater> plus there needs to be some "sed"s in all the tools
<jcater> to adjust the bin/ scripts that are created
<jcater> to replace the explicit references to /usr/local/gnue
<jcater> hmm
<Mr_You> If I'm building a Sun box with multiple processors and say 4 gigs of ram with the expectation to expand, I'll create 2GB swap.
<jcater> I wonder if a Dual P166 would be enough for a "test" system?
<jcater> put gentoo, freebsd, redhat, et al on it
<Mr_You> but then thats a big ole server.
<Mr_You> jcater: hell yeah
<Mr_You> jcater: actually.. I dunno... might want to be sure the chipset is supported.
<willieb> aye, a dual 166 would work, would be a few days installing though
<jcater> Mr_You: only problem is it's an ALR Revolution
<jcater> it's based on an INtel chipset that is poorly supported
<jcater> I could not get debian to install on it using the 2.2 kernel
<Mr_You> the only multiproc pentiums I ever admined was NCRs about a year plus ago hhe
<jcater> it'd lock up
<Mr_You> big ole machines
<willieb> need and remember to boot with a i586 image though... that one's caught me out before :(
<Mr_You> jcater: forget it then
<Mr_You> too much trouble
<Mr_You> for little gain
<jcater> Mr_You: I finally got Debian on this machine, BUT i had to install on a separate machine and swap hard drives :)
<jcater> and I cna't use SMP
<jcater> but, damn
<jcater> I hate wasting this machine
<Mr_You> ouch
<jcater> my company gave like $25K - $30K for it back in the day
<jcater> it's our old SCO machine
<Mr_You> what is it?
<Mr_You> dual pentium?
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> back when they said you couldn't do "dual pentium" :)
<Mr_You> well if its free.. *shrug*
<Mr_You> shoot.. you could probably find some desktops to use.
<Mr_You> maybe?
<jcater> not at work
<jcater> we have all available old desktops as LTSP nodes now :)
<jcater> really quite cool
<jcater> I haven't bought a new desktop in like 12-18 months
<jcater> and we've expanded quite a bit
<jcater> well, except for my new Athlon, btu that doesn't count:)
<jcater> I'm not a user
<jcater> and I approve the purchases
<jcater> ;)
<Mr_You> cool
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I have a boat-load of 486s
<jcater> but that'd be painful too :)
<Mr_You> knoppix seems to be the best CD based distro.. but I'm biased to debian ;-)
<ajmitch> everyone is here :)
<Mr_You> well 486DXs are actually pretty useful..
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> do you know the power consumption comparisons between a 486DX
<jcater> and a Pentium 200
<jcater> ?
<Mr_You> no
<jcater> as I'm using the latter as a firewall
<jcater> but have several 486s lying around
<Mr_You> make a cluster.
<ajmitch> can probably still cook an egg on a p200
<jcater> ajmitch: yeah
<jcater> but I've heard pentium-class power supplies are more efficient
<jcater> so I dunno
<jcater> I can't get a good answer
<ajmitch> hmm
<jcater> my inclination is that a Pentium *has* to use more power
<jcater> as it burns hotter
<ajmitch> atx power supplies?
<ajmitch> depends on the other parts, too
<jcater> I find that hard to believe though
<jcater> as I can use a much smaller wattage PS in a 486
<ajmitch> noisy & hot hard drives use much power
<jcater> than I can in a Pentium
<ajmitch> if you can, measure it
<jcater> eh?
<ajmitch> iirc you can get old power meter things to measure power consumption
<jcater> there's an idea
<ajmitch> they're not within the power company's tolerances to use as a house meter, so you might be able to pick one up
<jcater> I tried googling for a comparison
<jcater> but couldn't find anything
<derek> jcater the problem is i dont think you can go by 'output' per say
<derek> for example if i have a hotwater heater from 10 years ago and one from this year
<derek> likely the one from this year will burn 10 times hotter but be 80% more efficient
<jcater> yeah, I know that
<derek> obviously the sway in powersupply's wont be that drastic
<jcater> hmm
<derek> i think its probably about a wash
<jcater> well, this 486 has a 325W PS drawing 4.2 Amps
<ajmitch> derek: the newer one could still be hotter, but gets it's efficiency thru insulation
<willieb> a cheap multimeter from radioshack would soon tell you - hack up an old PC power lead, set the meter to AC amps and stick it inline?
<jcater> according to the sticker
<derek> this reminds me of old generator talk
<derek> people going i only need a 2500 watt generator for my stuff im only running a circular saw and a small nailer for compressor
<derek> BUT
Action: dtm washes derek's mouth out with degreaser
<derek> they always forget you have to calculate for 'surge' on initial draw of startup
Action: derek forgets the calc but its nearly twice the steady throughput
<dtm> well they just need to get a running start then
Action: derek would try to warn the guys and they would think i was trying to rip them off and sell them something bigger
<derek> but then.....
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> boom?
<derek> next day... hey when i fire up my second saw it cuts out and i have to restart...
<derek> and me is like ... 'duh'
<willieb> nature's way of telling you only to do one thing at once ;)
Action: chillywilly has a nice fluke meter
<chillywilly> hey derek how do you like our defense ;)
<willieb> clamp on ac/dc ammeter by any chance?
Action: derek likes the 14 points they have for me
<chillywilly> 14 - 0

<chillywilly> and this is with a banged up Favre

<chillywilly> lol
<ajmitch> when's the next release planned for? how long we got for testing?
<jcater> if I had to estimate
<jcater> I'd say between 2 and 30 days
<ajmitch> hmm
<jcater> but that's only a guestimate
<jcater> I could be wrong
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> depends on how many bugs need fixed
<ajmitch> yay, setup-cvs.py doesn't generate docs
<ajmitch> TMPDIR is DBTOHTML_OUTPUT_DIR2117
<ajmitch> Using stylesheet: "/usr/lib/sgml/stylesheet/dsssl/docbook/cygnus/cygnus-both.dsl"
<ajmitch> Usage: db2html [filename.{sgml,xml}]
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> placement.gfd is broke
<jcater> what?
<jcater> placement was working for me an hour ago
<ajmitch> hmm
<ajmitch> i just did cvs update, ran setup-cvs.py
<jcater> bbiaf... trying a 486 as my firewall
<ajmitch> and tried placement.gfd with both gtk2 & wx drivers

<esands> Mr_You: with a 486 you might have PCI bus bandwidth issues. I know with the Soekris net4501 it has issues pushing large amounts of bandwidth though.

Not so sure and older 486 could handle. I'm replacing all my old routers with Celeron 1Ghz/815E/256Mb/Case/

<jamest> hi
<jamest> for all the appserver developers in the house
<jamest> jcater and myself are wanting to do a normal release of common, forms, reports, designer
<jamest> then do what I've been calling a spitshine release at (0.5.0)
<jamest> meaning the next release is 0.4.1
<jamest> then 0.5.0 comes out with no new functionality
<jamest> (I'm talking common version numbers btw)
<reinhard> that means like
<jamest> we've instead focus on code cleanup
<jamest> docs
<reinhard> 0.4.1 is really 0.5.0 beta ?
<jamest> bugfixes
<btami> i have to say there are some (many) win32 bugreports in DCL
<jamest> 0.4.1 would be basically cvs that we have now
<jamest> btami: cool, those are worth fixing then
<jamest> in 0.4.x
<SachaS> hi reinhard
<reinhard> hey SachaS
<reinhard> long time no see
<jamest> however how would this effect appserver?
dsmith (~dsmith@p199.n-chpop03.stsn.com) left irc: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)
<jamest> do we need to hold off on a common freeze for a while to get some features needed in there
<reinhard> i would rather say that it would be better
<reinhard> to do both 0.4.1 _and_ 0.5.0 of common
<reinhard> _before_ we break it again :)
<jamest> 0.5.0 wasn't to break anything it's to clean it up
<jamest> and get docs
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> i meant
<reinhard> i would like to let you release 0.5.0 of common
<SachaS> long time no see ........ no wonder when i got father :))
<reinhard> before we (we = appserver team) break it
<jamest> lol
<reinhard> that means
<reinhard> we will try to wait for 0.5.0 to be released
<reinhard> before we touch common
<jamest> hmmmmm
<jamest> is there anything you need in common in the near future?
<reinhard> however it would be good to ask siesel too
<reinhard> because he's exactly the one that can answer this question
<reinhard> he always was the personified interface between common and appserver :)
<reinhard> and at our meeting he talked about some points he wants to change in common
<reinhard> however i didn't get the feeling that they were _urgent_
<jamest> ok, the main reason I ask is we don't want the appserver needs to not get met
<jamest> and I'd hate to try and say "no new features" if it hurts appserver
<jamest> i'd rather do a series of 0.4.x releases to get what you require in there first
<jamest> we've kind of promised ourselves no common|forms|designer 0.5.0 without good docs
<reinhard> good promise jamest :)
<jamest> well, one thing that I hope to get into 0.4.1 is autodoc support for triggers in the base apps
<jamest> so that it'll be easier to create them for 0.5.0 :)
<jamest> autodoc = our command line interface to dump various info about things like parameters

<jamest> it's a text command line tool
<Chipaca> derek: first, wvdial to identify your modem and its caps
<jamest> but I don't recall having to set anything

<derek> Chipaca: ok apt-getting wvdial and pppconfig
<derek> will ask for further instructions in a minute :)

<derek> nothing with ttyS
<derek> are there python bindings to GNUstep?
<derek> similar to pyGTK or pyQT
<derek> if so, probably about 3 days for someone that knows python and GNUstep
ariel_ (~ariel@ppp-217-133-240-27.dialup.tiscali.it) left irc: "Uscita dal client"
<TSCHAK> derek: no, but I bet a binding could be written for python..there are similar bindings for java and ruby already.
<Chipaca> and gnue
<TSCHAK> hmmm
<Chipaca> derek: and pcmcia?
<derek> TSCHAK: well then it woudl be num_days to write python binding + 3 days ;)
<TSCHAK> derek: hehehe
<derek> you could also write in ruby or java or such, just the time would be longer as you would have to rewrite many things that are alredy written in python
<TSCHAK> *nod*
<derek> if you use python you only need to write a 'driver' for the gnustep api and nothing mroe
<TSCHAK> the native language is Objective-C..but a python binding should fit.

<Chipaca> "because the telco is paying us by the minute"
<derek> interesting
<derek> pppd died - The remote system is required to authenticate itself ...
<derek> As far as I can tell there are two causes for this problem:
<derek>     * /etc/ppp/options contains the auth option. Simply put a # comment character in front and try again.
<derek> * Your system already has a default route. Have you set up a local network ? In thise case recent versions of pppd will behave as if the auth had been specified. To override this you may add noauth to the pppd arguments in kppp' setup dialog. Alternatively you could take down the local network prior to dialing in. I'd be thankful if someone could provide instructions on how to peacefully combine the two network connections.
<derek> in the options file
<derek> its says DO NOT comment out auth :)
<derek> hmmm who is right :)
<derek> work states they have seen no login attempts
<Chipaca> try without auth
<Chipaca> (it'll break pon/poff, but that's ok if you'll be using kppp afaik)
<derek> so its connecting but dying before it ever attempts to login there
<derek> anyone use anything else?
<derek> if so help is appreciated
<derek> i.e. i ran pppconfig
<derek> so what is the debian way to login?
<jcater> what are you doing?
<Chipaca> derek: to make sure you _could_ connect, install minicom, and do it 'by hand'

<nickr> oh
<Chipaca> derek: may I suggest you use wvdial, that'll ask for a username/password right there (sidebanding ppp's conf etc)

<derek> i have to enter codes into it

<derek> it should be standard old auth
<Chipaca> derek: one-time passwords
<nickr> if you can login with your vcard through ppp
<derek> likely PAP
<nickr> I don't think its standard auth.

<jbailey> derek: I know it's in CVS (although I haven't decided for certain that I will use the stuff in CVS or not.  I don't like that style of packaging) - But I imagine that there's some build order to get it running.
<derek> they think its CHAP, but are verifying
<nickr> derek: sorry I'm not more help, I am flying blind here

<derek> i dont understand why you dont use what we have though
<jbailey> I haven't said that I won't.
<derek> if you are going to make new debs can you commit them to cvs and get them in sid?
<jbailey> It will probably be based on it heavily - but I don't like packaging being in the tree.  HAving it in packaging makes it that much harder.
<jbailey> phone lurk.
<jcater> I don't want a debian/ structure in cvs
<jcater> as then we have 
<jcater> redhat/
<jcater> freebsd/
<jcater> windows/
<jcater> that's why we have packaging, just fyi
<jcater> mmmm
<jcater> lunch
<jbailey> I understand that.  abisource does the same thing, and it has the sideeffect that no DD understands it when they look at it.
Action: Chipaca just wanted to know the name of the current widget
<jbailey> The way I do the packaging is that the upstream source is just a tarball sitting in the deb.  That way upgrades are mostly just replacing the tarball.
<jbailey> I will cheerfully keep that in cvs if you'd like - that would be easy enough - but I'd make a new toplevel "packaging/debian/PACKAGENAME/" probably...
<jbailey> Is that an okay compromise?

<jbailey> "Am I too small for your package?"
<jbailey> Oh dear..
<nickr> you have to stop routing to your local network before you dialup and pppd will automatically route through ppp0
<derek> at least im back to where i was before...

<Chipaca> derek: ah, yes
<derek> nickr: before i do a route del default
<derek> how do i get back local network?
<derek> just redo dhclient
<nickr> well, make note of your gateway
<nickr> should be like 192.168.1.1
<nickr> or somethin
<nickr> and then later you can route add default gw 192.168.1.1

<jbailey> yes.
<nickr> jcater: Thanks.:)
<jcater> jbailey: did you look at the setup.cfg.debian in that directory?

<jamest> dude, printing under windows SUCKS
<laurie> generally i can repair them without rebooting

<laurie> how do you set compression and screen resolution?
<laurie> my desktop at work is like 1800x1600 or something on windows vnc i can set some factors to scale that down to fit in a 800x600 space also i can use compression

<jbailey> It depends on the maintainer.
<jbailey> I only package against CVS when I'm friends with upstream.
<jcater> ah, ok
<ajmitch> and what level of masochism they like
<jcater> well, that's why I did it that way
<ajmitch> i package from cvs for DotGNU stuff
<jbailey> This way I can say to you guys "Ping me when I should update"

<jbailey> It's not clear to me why some .py's in src/ are chmod +x and some are not.
<ajmitch> some are library modules
<jcater> really, there shouldn't be any in src/ that are

<jcater> I do know that
<jamest> most the scripts that are +x are created on install 
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> really the utils/ stuff is +x
<jcater> but those won't be installed anyway
<jcater> those are developer's lazy hacks
<jcater> and the setup.py
<jcater> but jamest is right
<jbailey> I'm going out on a limb to say it should either be +x or the top line should be removed. =)
<ajmitch> GTest.py looks to be an RPC tester
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> that should not be in common/src
<jamest> with jan's name on it
<jamest> get a rope
<ajmitch> #!/usr/bin/env python
<ajmitch> # GNU Enterprise Common Testing client 
<jcater> can someone move that to utils/
<jbailey> Adn you folks wonder why I had trouble creating the packaging from scratch... =)
Action: drochaid is away: dying elsewhere
neilt (~neilt@66.95.5.110) left irc: "later all"
<jbailey> jcater: How do you like it moved?
<jamest> mv
<jamest> it's meaningless to our installs so personally I don't care about it's location in cvs history
<jcater> I didn't have this problem I guess
<jcater> because I used the packaged tarballs
<jamest> jbailey: we value change history in cvs more than file location 
<jamest> so we're not above moving a file
<ajmitch> you can move the file on the server
<jamest> ya
<ajmitch> all of you can :)
<siesel> GTest.py shouldn't be executable, as GFClient.py shouln't be executable
<jamest> hey jan
<jamest> did you see the talk about 0.5.0 this morning?
<siesel> hi jamest
<siesel> no I had no time to look.
<jamest> a possible feature freeze on forms/reports/common between the 0.4.x and 0.5.0 releases
<jamest> so that 0.5.0 is no new features only bug fixes, code cleanup, documentation
<jamest> if that'll work for the appserver people
Remosi (dahoose@port-219-88-246-65.jet.net.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> and reinhard mentioned you'd be one to talk to to find out if common needed something before the freeze
<jbailey> ajmitch: I don't know if they all have shell accounts.
<jamest> no
<jbailey> ajmitch: I was a real asshole when I was the subversions admin and refused to give them out.
<ajmitch> jbailey: jcater just got one
<jamest> only I did 
<jbailey> ajmitch: The current folks have continued my fine tradition.
<ajmitch> jbailey: i could believe that :)
<ajmitch> jamest: jcater got an account last week, poor chap
<jamest> yeah, i know, he'll learn 
<jcater> hey
<jcater> I didn't ask for it
<jbailey> You want it in utils?
<jcater> works for me
<jcater> we can then adjust setup-cvs.py if need be
siesel_ (jan@dial-213-168-72-99.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel_> IMHO GTest.py should be more than just a RPC tester. So
<siesel_>          I put it in common. If it should be moved, then it should be moved
<siesel_>          into scripts (like grpcdoc etc.)
<jcater> err
<jbailey> siesel_: You've got about 60 seconds to convince jcater to tell me different instructions...
<jamest> siesel! quick! Offer donuts!
<jcater> siesel_: my thinking was any developer-related stuff goes in util
<jcater> any end-user stuff goes in scripts/
<jamest> scripts are for gnue-forms gnue-reports etc
<jcater> I plan on yanking gnuedtd and others out of scripts/ and into utils/ too
<jamest> maybe jbailey could hit them all at once?
<siesel_> ok, thats ok with me too.
Action: siesel_ hasn't any donuts to offer today.
<jbailey> jamest: As long as 'them all' is clear.
<siesel_> jamest: The most important stuff which has to go into common BEFORE 5.0 is a new version of the appserver dbdriver.
<jbailey> Move from src/ to utils committed.
<siesel_> That's because we have defined a better API for communication between clients and appserver.
Action: siesel_ looks into the log for the datelines.

<jbailey> Woohoo!  Lintian clean!
<ajmitch> yay
<ajmitch> upload time? ;)
<jbailey> I forgot to put the close of the adoption.
<ajmitch> might be a good thing to test first
<jbailey> I should have a release name for these.
<siesel_> Jason, James: when do you want to release 4.1?
<jbailey> This is the "I got around to it " release...
<jbailey> Hmmm.
<jbailey> The is the "Round Tuit" release.
<derek> looks like 0.5.0 will release before 4.1
<jbailey> Much better.
Action: psu suggested using Star Wars names for releases some time ago
<siesel_> 0.4.1?
<ajmitch> nononononononono
<psu> light side = Tools, dark side = Packages
<jamest> the 0.4.1 tools will be real soon now
<jamest> i think
<psu> Anakin/Vader = 1.0 release bringing everything together
<jamest> I'm hammering on missing feature I want pre 0.5.0
<derek> tatoonie?
<derek> the desolate desert release?
<jamest> features
<jamest> and dcl issues
<jamest> we may have a 0.4.1 0.4.2 etc
<derek> hopefully after next release we will have real roadmap
<jamest> but I think both jcater and myself really want 0.5.0 to be cleanup
<derek> to determine what goes where
<jcater> jamest: he said that dirty word again!
<derek> i.e. if something belongs in somewhere or not
<jamest> and if he's not in the same mindset i've got cash set back for donuts
<siesel_> hehe
<jbailey> Hmm.  Is there any way of testing gnue-common before I upload?
<jbailey> I guess there isn't is there.
<jamest> um
<jamest> what are you testing?
<ajmitch> test it with gnue-forms?
<jamest> .debs?
<jcater> jbailey: dpkg --install gnue-common*
Action: jcater awaits his troutslapping
<jbailey> jcater: I have made sure it installs. =)
<jcater> you're probably gonna hve to do gnue-forms before you can know if it worked right
<jbailey> jamest: Yeah.  I'm about to uplaod gnue-common to unstable.
<jbailey> jcater: Joy. =)
<jamest> ooooo
<jbailey> Do you think I should hold off uploading?
<jbailey> Or should I gratuitously break anyone who had it installed? =)
<jamest> we could get you account on ash and put in the external repository there
<jamest> then fools^H^H^H^H^Hpeople in here could try it out
<jbailey> *lol*
siesel (jan@dial-213-168-97-239.netcologne.de) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<jbailey> That might work.
Nick change: siesel_ -> siesel
<ajmitch> gratuitously break!!
<jbailey> Or I could just create a new module on subversions for it all.
<ajmitch> jbailey: they'll install on a decent OS, right? ;)
<psu> ajmitch: most debs install on a decent OS 
<jamest> debian/hurd 
<ajmitch> i haven't sneezed today, so it hasn't crashed
<jbailey> ajmitch: I don't think we have python2.2 yet.
<jbailey> ajmitch: You'll have to troutslap the port maintainer.
<jbailey> But do it later.  This week is toolchain week.
<ajmitch> ii  python2.2                         2.2.1.91-1                        An interactive object-oriented scripting language (version 2.2)
<jbailey> Then it should go in fine.
<ajmitch> i have webware running nicely on it
<jbailey> Marcus is hacking oskit-mach this week.
<ajmitch> fun
<jbailey> Neal is writing exams for the next 4 weeks.
<ajmitch> poor neal
<jbailey> Someone needs to get db4 working and in unstable so that perl can get built and go in unstable.
<ajmitch> and i've got an exam tomorrow!
Action: ajmitch should run off & study soon, really
<jbailey> Hmm.
<jbailey> I guess I'll wait until I do forms to upload.
<jbailey> *pout*
<ajmitch> :)
Action: psu is away: but not far
<ajmitch> jbailey: what was holding up libffi? it builds fine in the pnet tree
<ajmitch> well, afaik it does :)
<jbailey> pnet?
<ajmitch> dotgnu compiler
<jbailey> That sounds like you might have some info about it.  Please fix. =)
<ajmitch> the one that i package :P
<jbailey> I hear a volunteer! =)
<ajmitch> only thing i had to change was a configure option
<jbailey> Excellent!
<jbailey> Which one?
Action: ajmitch hunts
<ajmitch> added a i*86-*-gnu*) TARGET=X86; TARGETDIR=x86;;
<ajmitch> in libffi/configure.in
<ajmitch> and it built
<jbailey> I did that, and I still get an error. =(
<ajmitch> weird
<jbailey> Some preprocessor symbols not working.
<ajmitch> perhaps different version
<jbailey> Yeah, maybe.
<jbailey> But at least I know that it shouldn't be very hard.
<ajmitch> k
<ajmitch> the fun bits will be libgc & threads ;)
<jbailey> libgc already builds. =)
<jbailey> I'm sure gcj will exercise the pthreads code, though.
<ajmitch> oh it builds fine
<ajmitch> but if you look at the code, it has black magic
<jbailey> *all* garbage collectors are black magic.
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> it has linux-specific thread code, and other specifics
<ajmitch> also has some mach voodoo :)
<jbailey> jcater: Why did you call the package gnue-forms-wxgtk instead of just gnue-forms?
<ajmitch> because there's a phpforms? :)
<ajmitch> and a gtk2 driver for that client
<jamest> that package contains the wxwindows gtk client
<jcater> because there's also a gnue-forms-curses
<jcater> and a gnue-forms-gtk
<jcater> err
<jamest> we support cur
<jcater> gnue-forms-gtk2
<jamest> nevermind
<jbailey> Ah, I see.
<jcater> was that not the right thing to do?
<jamest> is there a better way?
<jbailey> Will those all come from different sources, then?
<jamest> as we have UI plugins
<jcater> actually
<jamest> all in gnue/src/uidrivers
<jcater> there probably should be a gnue-forms-base or such
<jbailey> jcater: It's probably the right thing to do - I'm still learning about gnue.
<jcater> as a good chunk of the code is the same
<jamest> then driver .debs
<jamest> none of them are so huge they could go in base
<jamest> but the dependencies change based upon what you need
<ajmitch> cool, so we'll end up with 10 forms packages ;)
<jcater> and soon enought
<jcater> gnue-forms-qt :)
<jcater> or knue-forms
<ajmitch> gnue-forms-base depends on gnue-forms-wxgtk | gnue-forms-wxgtk
<jamest> yeah
<ajmitch> oops
<jcater> as the case may be :)
<ajmitch> eeeevil
<ajmitch> do NOT name it knue-forms
<ajmitch> please
<jbailey> Okay, cool.  So they'll be different source packages too, then.  That just lets me know how to setup the conflicts/replaces headers.
<ajmitch> well...
<ajmitch> wxgtk & gtk2 are in same source
<ajmitch> dunno about curses, it might be as well
<jbailey> Oy.
TSCHAK (~garnome@dialin-184.fbg.net) left irc: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)
<jcater> err
<jcater> not different source packages, no
<jbailey> Okay.  So I'll put the source package as gnue-forms and the package then as gnue-forms-wxgtk for now.
<jcater> ajmitch: what's wrong w/ knue-forms? :)
Action: ajmitch kicks jcater
<jbailey> jcater: rms might find out and then you'll never hear the end of it. =)
<jcater> bah
<jcater> I can take him
<jcater> I think
<ajmitch> hehe
<dsmith> Is there a php forms?
<ajmitch> yes

TSCHAK (~garnome@dialin-8.fbg.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jbailey> .dll?
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> scary isn't it
<ajmitch> both mono & pnet compile to .exe or .dll :)
<jbailey> mono
<jbailey> Like C#?
<ajmitch> yes
<jbailey> wow.  I didn't think that had gone anywhere.
<ajmitch> pnet is primarily a C# compiler
<ajmitch> heh
<dsmith> jbailey: Are you the maintainer of any other Debian packages?
<ajmitch> dsmith: be warned, he is!

<jcater> go back a page in the log
<ajmitch> dsmith: you might even use one or two of his packages ;)

<derek> and EVERY corporate one we have looked into MANDATED i.e. 5.0
<derek> jcater: i hit autocomplete it picked wrong j

<derek> ssh
<derek> forms can contain a self contained ssh client
<derek> and use a tunnel

Action: psu is back (gone 00:43:42)
<jbailey> Is there a useful way to override the target version in sdist?
<jcater> eh?>
<jbailey> The version number in Debian is going to be 20021105.
<jbailey> So I would want the source tarball to have that version,
<jbailey> Or somethingk like that.
<jcater> um
<jcater> not currently
<jcater> we can add version prefixes easily
<jcater> like 0.4.0-rc1
<jcater> but not actually change the version
<jbailey> 0.4.0-20021105 would be fine.
<jbailey> In automake land I always define a rule:
<jbailey> release:
<jbailey>         $(MAKE) dist distdir=$(PACKAGE)-`date +"%Y%m%d"`
<jcater> GNUE_VERSION_SUFFIX=`date +"%Y%m%d"` ./setup.py sdist
<jcater> iirc
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> #
<jcater> # You can run:
<jcater> #   $ GNUE_VERSION_SUFFIX=-pre1 ./setup.py sdist
<jcater> # and the packages will be created as GNUe-App-0.x.x-pre1.tar.gz
<jcater> #

<ajmitch> 0.4.0-20021105 would be bad
<jbailey> ajmitch: Why so?
<ajmitch> unless this is the 2million, 21 thousand, and fifth debian revision :)
<jbailey> I could add a -1 to that.
<ajmitch> oops, missed out 100 revisions
<psu> ajmitch: we'll get there someday ;-)
<jbailey> I think it copes with that.
<ajmitch> can you have 2 '-'? i thought you couldn't
<jbailey> psu: Hopefully not of the same version.
<jbailey> ajmitch: Dunno.  Let's see if dpkg-buildpackage pukes.
<psu> jbailey: um, no 
<ajmitch> jbailey: just checked, it should be ok
<jbailey> ajmitch: Tx.
<ajmitch> The upstream_version may contain only alphanumerics[14] and the characters . + - : (full stop, plus, hyphen, colon) and should start with a digit. If there is no debian_revision then hyphens are not allowed; if there is no epoch then colons are not allowed. 
<jbailey> Coo.
<jbailey> Should this sdist command work on all of the gnue packages?
<jcater> jbailey: yes
<jcater> ajmitch: actually, that will come out to be 0.4.1a-20021105, fyi
<jbailey> GNUe-Forms-0.4.1a20021105.tar.gz
<ajmitch> right :)
<jcater> purdy

<jbailey> Hmm.  Looks like it's in usr/lib/gnue/lib/python/gnue/forms/GFClient.py
<jbailey> Which is certainly far away from the python search path.
<jbailey> Any suggestions as to where it ought to be?

<ajmitch> ah
<derek> you here?
<derek> you can do
<jamest> no
<jcater> yes
<derek> ctrl-spacebar
<derek> to set region
<derek> highlight what you want then do
<derek> C-x TAB
<jcater> some day I'll have to learn emacs
<jcater> but I haven't found a good tutorial yet
<jbailey> jcater: Can you tell me where the sed is supposed to be?  I don't see anything in your rules file that would cover that.
<jamest> whoop
<jcater> 	: # Replace all '#!' calls to python with $(python)
<jcater> 	: # and make them executable
<jcater> 	cd debian && \
<jcater> 	for i in `find tmp/$(GNUEBINDIR) -type f`; do \
<jcater> 	  sed '1s,#!.*python[^ ]*\(.*\),#! /usr/bin/$(python)\1,' \
<jcater> 		$$i > $$i.temp; \
Action: derek is amazed jamest is using emacs
<jcater> 	  if cmp --quiet $$i $$i.temp; then \
<jcater> 	    rm -f $$i.temp; \
<jamest> ctrl-u ctlr-c #
<jcater> 	  else \
<jcater> 	    cat $$i.temp |sed "s,'stage,'/usr/lib/gnue,"|sed "s,'/usr/lib/gnue/etc/connections.conf','/etc/gnue/connections.conf'," > $$i;  \

<jcater> 	    chmod 755 $$i; \
<jcater> 	    echo "fixed interpreter: $$i"; \
<jcater> 	  fi; \
<jcater> 	done
<jamest> it's the only editor in the world capable of getting me ready for gnue datasource code
<jbailey> Oh, I see aprt of the problem.
<jbailey> I'm not installing to tmp anymoer.
<jbailey> Cool.
<jcater> jamest: not true
<jcater> jamest: a hex editor would be just as well
<jbailey> And the comment doesn't describe that at all.
<jcater> jbailey: sorry
<jcater> that was my first rules file ever
<jcater> it was a bit, um, overbearing on me
<jcater> and I forgot to comment in some places :(
<jbailey> jcater: That's fine. =)
<jbailey> jcater: This is my first gnue install.
<jcater> jbailey: it was basically:
<jcater> Holy shit! it worked!
<jcater> <clunk>
<jbailey> Every other attempt has met in massive failure, so...
<jcater> 2 hrs later... I awaken
<jamest> lol
<jamest> nakid and without a donut
<jcater> exactly
<jcater> so how could I possibly remember to go back and comment
<jcater> jbailey: just ask jamest
<jcater> be glad I didn't do self-modifying sed
<jamest> he was damn near histerical on the phone
<ajmitch> hehe
<jbailey> *lol*
Action: ajmitch only has simple packages :)
<jamest> what bothered me was it wasn't for 15 minutes until he noticed his clothes missing
<jbailey> jamest: I'm sure it was a warm day.
<jbailey> Ah!  Much better error.
<ajmitch> jamest: this was just on the phone, right? 
<jbailey> GNUe Common Version 0.4.1a
<jbailey> Error: No Forms Definition File Specified.
<jamest> oh yeah
<jbailey> Is there a sample forms definition and mysql unload file on the website somewhere so I can try this out quickly?
<jamest> try the intro.gfd sample
<jamest> a database isn't required
<jamest> does anyone use the forms <entry> option  sloppyQuery
<jcater> not I
<chillywilly> lick my sack
<chillywilly> beotches
<jamest> hey chilly's back
<jcater> wb chillywilly
<chillywilly> why you gonna talk smack when a body is not present?
<jbailey> Frighting.  It appears to be running.
<jamest> why should we treat you any different than say derek?
<chillywilly> thanks...I guess
<ajmitch> chillywilly: must you detail such disturbing activity?
<jbailey> fear
<jbailey> piglatin.  woo
<chillywilly> how am I like derek? I don't file unnecessary bug^H^H^Hfeatre requests
<chillywilly> thanks jc
<jbailey> I just have to figure out how to make the bloody man page and I'll upload to sid.
<chillywilly> ajmitch: get in line punk
Action: chillywilly needs to vote for governor tonight
Action: chillywilly is going to vote libertarian
<ajmitch> that's nice
<jcater> woot
<jcater> jbailey: had you done a ./setup-cvs.py
<chillywilly> it's better than voting republocrat
<jcater> as I forgot
<jcater> even setup.py sdist requires that
<jcater> to create the man page
<jbailey> jcater: No, I'm doing GNUE_VERSION_SUFFIX=-`date +"%Y%m%d"` ./setup.py sdist and working from that.
<jbailey> jcater: It appears that I can generate one from ``gnue-forms --generate-man-page'' 
<jbailey> When an odd feature.
<jcater> jbailey: yeah, that's what I was about to say
<jcater> our code auto-documents itself
<chillywilly> my car needs a new muffler
<siesel_> jcater: how can I quit the curses client? 
<chillywilly> my old beater
<jcater> siesel_: ctrl+\  ?
<jamest> jbailey: we're pushing as much of that in as possible
<ajmitch> siesel_: reset button? :)
<chillywilly> hi jan
<jbailey> Is there any way to make sdist to this for me?
<chillywilly> ajmitch: shut it ;)
<siesel_> hi Daniel
<jamest> i would think we could modify setup.py to do it
<jamest> but I'm not sure those pages are 100% complete
<jcater> jamest: ??
<jbailey> jamest: Even if they're partially complete that's fine.
<jbailey> The GNU project doesn't support man pages, right? =)
<jamest> jcater: ???
<jbailey> So having a partial one, and a note to look at the texinfo documentation is usually fine.
<jamest> i'm not sure what you're questioning?
<jcater> as soon as I learn texinfo
<jcater> we'll hve a --generate-texinfo-page :)
<jcater> jamest: um
<jcater> I'm not sure what you mean by partially complete
<jcater> wrt?
<jamest> i didn't think they generated the description, files, known bugs
<jamest> sections
<jcater> Known bugs is hardcoded
<jcater> to "Are you kidding?"
<jcater> maybe you're right... it may not do files yet
<jamest> that was part of the 0.5.0 release, um, <whisper> roadmap </whisper>
<jcater> argh!
<jcater> spit!
<jcater> are you turning on me too?
Action: jamest grabs the trashcan lid and prepares to be assulted
Action: jcater hides in his corner, crying
<jcater> see, my problem with roadmaps is
<jcater> it doesn't define where we're going
<jamest> they are not need based
<jcater> it defines what others expect me to do 
<jcater> :)
<jcater> of course, now that you're back
<jcater> mwahahaha
<ajmitch> jcater: there are others who can help!
<jcater> "can" and "will" are two different things
<jcater> but I digress :)
<chillywilly> nah, no one is worthy of hacking jcater's code
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> I welcome help
<jcater> and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank
<jcater> those who have started coding more and more
<jcater> btami
<jcater> ajmitch
<jcater> jan
<jcater> papo
<ajmitch> jcater: ok, i promise that i will hack the gtk2 forms driver this weekend & next week :)
<jcater> ariel
<jcater> et al
<ajmitch> since i've already started
<jcater> I *know* I missed someone... so don't take it personally
<jamest> man
<ajmitch> chillywilly?
<jcater> oh, and of course jbailey for packaging this up
<ajmitch> :)
<jamest> know we know how he feels about my code
Action: jcater looks thru the forms changelog
<jamest> thats ok though, i agress
<jamest> agree
<jcater> jamest: you haven't started coding more and more
<jbailey> jamest: So, could I ask you to hack sdist to generate the man page sometime soon?
<jbailey> =)
<jcater> you've always coded
<jcater> except for that brief 18 month leave of absense
<jcater> ;)
<jamest> well yeah, i had to get over the crack addiction that gnue drove me too
<chillywilly> ajmitch: I don't need any recognition form donut boy ;)
<chillywilly> from
<jamest> as if you're not on crack the code doesn't make sense
<jcater>  /msg jamest well, I swear I didn't tell anyone it was because of the abuse clinic you were staying at
<jamest> jbailey: I can try 
<ajmitch> chillywilly: perhaps if you showed some more respect ? :)
<chillywilly> is that the secret?
<jamest> right now I'm up to my knees in datasources
<jbailey> jamest: Thanks.  I'm certain to get a bug pretty quickly filed for not having a man page.
<chillywilly> ajmitch: yea like he shows me respect, right? ;)
<jamest> and it's kinda icky
<jbailey> jamest: As long as I know it's on a todo list. =)
<ajmitch> he might if you showed some
<jamest> so datasources, shower, man page thing
<jcater> jbailey: were you not going to do gnue-forms --generate-man-page temporarily?
<chillywilly> I do respect him
<jbailey> jcater: Hmmm.. I could, but I'm worried that I would forget about it.
<jamest> of course jcater will have it commited before i finish this sentence
<chillywilly> giving ppl shit is the highest form of respect ;)
<jcater> chillywilly: yeah, like my mother-in-law does
<jbailey> jcater: The problem is that gnue-forms isn't runnable from it's temp location, is it?
<jbailey> Or hey - I guess it is runnable from it's place in staging.
<chillywilly> jcater: whatever
<jbailey> Nope, it's not.
<jbailey> jeffb@desert:~/debian/gnue-forms-0.41a-20021105$ build-tree/GNUe-Forms-0.4.1a-20021105/stage/bin/gnue-forms --help

<jbailey> ImportError: No module named gnue.forms.GFClient
<jbailey> So I've got no way of generting it live.
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> I wonder.....
<ajmitch> what do you wonder?
<jcater> can you require that gnue-common is installed before you can build gnue-forms?
<jbailey> jcater: Yes.
<jbailey> jcater: Is that desirable?
Action: jcater is thinking
<jcater> don't do it yet
<ajmitch> jbailey: lazycode spammed #gnu & #fsf with same question :)
<jcater> jbailey: what does your "staging" area look like?
Action: ajmitch just had nil incentive to think about an answer
<jbailey> Define staging?
<jcater> or build, or whatever
<jcater> <jbailey> Or hey - I guess it is runnable from it's place in staging.
<jbailey> The tarball is unpacked into build-tree
<jcater> the sdist tarball
<jcater> ?
<jbailey> So the python build puts everything in build-tree/tarball/stage
<jbailey> Yes.
<jcater> ok
<jbailey> It occured to me that all the paths would be correct from there, but they're not.
<jbailey> Anyone feel like trying my gnue-common and gnue-forms packages for sid?
<ajmitch> hmm
<jbailey> (silence falls on the channel)
<jcater> I can
<jbailey> If not, I can just upload them.  I've got them signed and ready. =)
Action: ajmitch has crap in /usr/local/gnue that could conflict
<jbailey> jcater: Lemme just get them to a website.
<ajmitch> i presume they shouldn't
Yurik (~yrashk@as5300.kharkov.ukrtel.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> ok, let us test!
<derek> jbailey: my problem is i have 4 diff versions installed :)
<derek> so im afraid my testinmg would bear much fruit
<derek> once at least one other person has tested i will give it a whirl
<nickr> whats the name of that win32 library for python?
<jcater> win32all
<jcater> pythonwin
<nickr> ah, thanks

<ajmitch> course not
StyXman (~mdione@ADSL-200-59-86-17.cordoba.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> hi StyXman
<jcater> jbailey: well
<jcater> I have a hack
<jcater> um
<jcater> jason@jason:~/test/GNUe-Forms-0.4.0a-pre3$ echo "import sys
<jcater> import src
<jcater> sys.modules{'gnue.forms':src}
<jcater> "; cat scripts/gnue-forms|python - --generate-man-page
<jcater> it works
<jcater> but it ain't pretty
<jcater> but it works from the staging area
<ajmitch> why do you want to build manpages that way?
<jbailey> ajmitch: I'd prefer they just came from sdist
<jcater> they do come from sdist
<StyXman> hi alll
<jbailey> From your friendly neighbourhood aptable source:
<jbailey> deb http://people.debian.org/~jbailey gnue sid 
<jcater> as long as you already have forms installed
<jbailey> apt-get install gnue-forms-wxgtk
<StyXman> (this time I didn't mispelled it, is just for the consistence :)
<StyXman> so. anybody seen siesel lately?
<jcater> StyXman: he was here briefly today
<StyXman> hmmm 
<jbailey> I didn't set it up as an aptable source archive, but all the files are in there if you want to pull them down and see what I did.
<StyXman> because a couple of weeks ago he said he will look into the problem that parameters are no set up at time
<StyXman> I mean, I cannot use form parameters @ on-startup trigger and in database conditions...
<jcater> you can't get them
<jcater> or set them
<StyXman> they're not built yet, as siesel said
<StyXman> I can't _get_ them... but may be that is fixed?
<jcater> wha?
<jcater> wow
<jcater> somethings odd about those debs
<jcater> it runs
<jbailey> *lol*
<ajmitch> no
<jcater> but my intro.gfd shows no labels
<ajmitch> that's not possible
<jcater> but running against my latest cvs copy, they do show

<jbailey> what?
<jbailey> (rather...)
<jbailey> *sigh*
<jcater> jbailey: lemme do screenshots
<jcater> I don't see how this could have *anything* to do with debs
<jcater> but its odd
<chillywilly> jcater: frell off
<jcater> chillywilly: btie me
<chillywilly> ajmitch: why should I?
Action: chillywilly rips jcater in half then ties him together
<ajmitch> don't try apt-get install gnue-forms gnue-designer
<jbailey> *lol*
<ajmitch> unless you want the 0.1.1 version :)
<jbailey> Just gnue-forms for now.  That sould pull in common and al of it's dependancies automatically.
<ajmitch> gnue-forms didn't look to be 0.4.x
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/debug-cvs.png

<jbailey> ajmitch: did you do gnue-forms or gnue-forms-wxgtk?
<ajmitch> jbailey: i eventually did gnue-forms-wxgtk
<ajmitch> sigh
<ajmitch> no worky, i got cruft in /usr/local/bin :)
<jcater> fsck
<jcater> nevermind
<jcater> ajmitch just explained my problem too

<chillywilly> you know what i thought would be cool is to have a forms "component" that you cold embed into an existing interface like gtk+/gnome or even qt/kde
<jcater> jbailey: running the right gnue-forms, she looks beautiful :)
<jbailey> jcater: Excellent!
<ajmitch> chillywilly: cool, get hacking on it then
<chillywilly> alrighty then ;)
<jcater> derek: if you squint hard enough
<jcater> and/or have enough vodka
<jcater> vegan vodka, of course
<jbailey> =)
<ajmitch> those vegans are an odd lot
Action: ajmitch wonders what jcater's life would be like without chicken strips :)
<jbailey> You can do breaded tofu strips.
<jbailey> I don't think they're very good, mind you.
<jcater> ajmitch: much happier
<jbailey> Tofu scramble is good though.= )
<ajmitch> jcater: you have then far too often?
<jcater> I assume you are being sarcastic
<jcater> that's the second biggest running joke in irc about me
<jcater> 1. donuts
Action: ajmitch wasn't sure if it was every night, or most nights :)
<jcater> 2. wife eats nothing but chicken strips
<jcater> :)
<jcater> seriously dude
<jcater> she was in such a mood for seafood
<jcater> \me thought "hell, yeah!"
<ajmitch> you haven't got her to eat only donuts?
<jcater> we go to red lobster
<chillywilly> we had some really good chicken strips at the hockey game last friday
<jcater> guess what she orders!
<jcater> chicken strips
<jcater> she's in the mood for mexican
<jcater> \me thought "hell, yeah!"
<jcater> we go to local mexican restaurant
<ajmitch> dude, your wife has issues
<jcater> guess what she orders!
<jcater> we are at jamest's house visiting for the weekend
<jcater> he takes us out to nice local restaurant
<jcater> one guess....
<jcater> chicken strips
<ajmitch> and you have to eat them at home?
Action: jcater usually does two meals
<ajmitch> ah
<jcater> I'm more a beef guy
<chillywilly> is she a bit obsessive compulsive?
<jcater> but I eat anything and everything
Action: jbailey runs.
<jcater> chillywilly: only with food
<chillywilly> has t have eerything a certain way
Action: ajmitch ties jbailey down
<chillywilly> has to only eat certsin things'
<jbailey> ajmitch: Oooo.
<jbailey> ajmitch: Just don't let Angie know.
<ajmitch> you ain't uploaded them packages yet!
<jcater> ajmitch: I think he's enjoying that too much
<ajmitch> jcater: that's what i'm worried about
<jbailey> ajmitch: How would you know? =)
<ajmitch> i haven't heard omnic's scream in frustration yet
<jbailey> omnic?
<jbailey> Who's that?
<ajmitch> mike beattie
<jbailey> I don' tknow him.
<ajmitch> one of the debian ftp people
<ajmitch> he works at uni here
<jbailey> *lol*
<jbailey> He doesn't like uploads?
<ajmitch> it's gnue :)
<ajmitch> wait until they have to put in override entries for all the new packages :)
<jbailey> ajmitch: forms alerady will require one because of the name change. =)
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> does gnue-forms-wxgtk replace gnue-forms?
<jbailey> ajmitch: replace,conflicts, yes.
<ajmitch> ok
<jcater> jbailey: so, overall, how was my first deb?
Action: jcater knows i had mistakes
<ajmitch> i have the lovely thing where i had to put an epoch version on my pnet debs
<jbailey> So all I have left is designer, and I've adopted and replaced everything that was already in Debian.
<jbailey> jcater: Good - Have you taken a look at the source for mine?  you'll notice they look very similar to yours.
<ajmitch> appserver?
<jcater> jbailey: not yet
<ajmitch> gnue-appserver had best replace geas
<jcater> jbailey: do you have cvs access to our tree?
<jbailey> oh yeah.  'geas'
<ajmitch> gnue-appserver has a lower version than geas, i guess :)
<ajmitch> what version is appserver at now?
<jbailey> 0.0.6
<jbailey> (-8)
<ajmitch> appserver or geas?
<jbailey> geas
<jbailey> appserver shows 0.0.2
<ajmitch> i wanted to know appserver :)
<jbailey> But I'll upload it as a new package that conflicts/replaces the old one.  It won't be a problem.
<ajmitch> ok
<jbailey> I'll probably do designer tommorow morning so I can show it off to my boss.
<jbailey> Is there any value in doing appserver yet, or should it wait?
<jbailey> jcater: Yes, I do.
<ajmitch> do appserver just to get rid of geas
<ajmitch> petition for the removal of geas from the archive :)
<jbailey> I'll just file a bug and have it removed.
<ajmitch> ok
<jbailey> jcater: If you take a look at the packaging, you'll see why it's difficult to put in upstream CVS.  I wouldn't mind creating another module in the GNUe project on savannah to store them, though.
<chillywilly> are all the packages called gnue-something?
<ajmitch> gnue doesn't do modules ;)
<jbailey> chillywilly: They will be.
<chillywilly> sholdn't it be gnue-appserver?
<ajmitch> chillywilly: yes!!
<ajmitch> chillywilly: it will be
<chillywilly> ok, sorry...
<ajmitch> as soon as appserver is packaged
<jbailey> Which might be this weekend.
Action: chillywilly has to go vote for governor
<ajmitch> geas is the old andrewm & others code
<chillywilly> I know
<jbailey> Yeah, I think I'll do designer tommorow morning.
<ajmitch> cool
<jbailey> Hopefully it goes quickly like the last one did - about an hour.
<ajmitch> jbailey: which libgc was giving you troubles?
<jbailey> ajmitch: Context?
<ajmitch> jbailey: GNU/Hurd
<ajmitch> just to go wildly offtopic :)
<jbailey> ajmitch: None recently...
<ajmitch> jbailey: ok, it was libffi?
<jbailey> libffi, yes.
<jbailey> The one in gcc-3.2
<ajmitch> right
<ajmitch> hmm
<jbailey> Does dyfet ever drop by here anymore?
<ajmitch> yup
Action: chillywilly is away: going to the polls
<ajmitch> from time to time
<jbailey> I'll probably be writing software for telephone management for Nortel M1 Option 11c phone switches.  It's probably something I should write as a plug in system and contribute to Bayonne.
<ajmitch> cool fun :)

<jbailey> Depends who's looking for me.
<jcater> hehe
<jcater> grrrr
<Mr_You> Raleigh has a Nortel location.
<jcater> gentoo's webpage isn't konqueror friendly
<jcater> they should be shot
<jbailey> Ah, I'm in Canada.  But I don't work for Nortel.
<Mr_You> I use to admin at Fujitsu Network Switching for their developers..
<jbailey> I work for a company that is tired of paying contractors to do MAC orders.
<Mr_You> ok
<jbailey> So I will write somethign that shows a picture of the phone, and you can change the buttons.  When you hit 'go', it will out the set, and then upload the new one. =)
<jbailey> But there's room for a couple levels of abstraction there:
<jbailey> Both the set, and the backend.
<ajmitch> fool the users so that they always ring the helpdesk instead of the sysadmins? :)
Action: ajmitch reads too much BOFH
<jbailey> Could do that with call forward, never mind messing with sets.
<ajmitch> pity you can't rewire the phone to put mains voltage into the handset :)

<jbailey> jcater: The version number was generated from sdist - Assuming you never lower the number that it generates, I will continue to produce sane debs.
<jcater> we never lower the number
<jcater> but it will become 0.4.1 when released
<jbailey> Excellent!
<jbailey> 0.4.1 is lower than 0.4.1a.
<ajmitch> so you're lowering the number according to debian's versioning
<jbailey> So I will probably be unable to update number you increment beyond that.
<jbailey> wtf?
<jbailey> bah.
<ajmitch> as others use X.X.Xa to indicate a subrelease after X.X.X
Action: ajmitch has sane upstream for pnet :)
<jcater> according to debian's standards, I suppose so :(
Remosi (dahoose@port-219-88-247-65.jet.net.nz) left irc: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)
<jbailey> It had never occured to me that you might do it otherwise.
<jcater> jbailey: what if we change that do to
<jcater> (our internal code)
<jcater> 0.4.1_alpha
<jcater> that works out better, doesn't it?
<ajmitch> probably not
<ajmitch> 1 < 1_alpha :)
<jbailey> Probably not. =(  It's a fairly simple match.
<jcater> sigh
<ajmitch> which is why you get hideously ugly versions like 2.999+3.0.alpha20-3
<ajmitch> (samba)
<jbailey> In any event, it's uploaded, so I couldn't stop it now if I tried.
<jbailey> I could always epoch it if it were terribly important.
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> i had to do that yesterday :)
<jbailey> And I need to go do my homework.
<ajmitch> lol
Action: ajmitch runs away to study
<jcater> I guess we'll have to change our internal naming scheme
<derek> jcater how are we moving on a 'fixed' schema program
<jcater> sigh
<ajmitch> tomorrow evening, i celebrate!
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 00:25:40)
<jcater> ajmitch: yay!
<jcater> derek: moving
Action: derek wants to do some *testing* after dinner ;)
<jbailey> jcater: Sorry for the hassle.
<derek> cool
<jcater> jbailey: well, I imagine it'll be an issue with all packaging systems we will later support
<jbailey> Yeah, probably.
<jcater> I was just looking on gentoo
<jcater> and it will be there
<jcater> it would be on freebsd's ports
<jbailey> I think it is on RH too.
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I guess we could do
<jcater> 0.4.0.99
<jbailey> Yup.  I've seen that.
<ajmitch> or go for 0.4.x
<jbailey> But would you mind skipping to 1.4.2 for the next release?  =)
<ajmitch> where x is even for stable
<jcater> if we're gonna start packaging up CVS periodically
<jcater> we may need to start that
<jcater> I'll talk to jamest tonight
<jbailey> Sure.  I will package up CVS as often as someone says "This would be a good idea".
<ajmitch> i have this: 0.4.7.20021106-1
<ajmitch> as 0.4.6 was just released
<ajmitch> 0.4.8 will be next stable release
<jbailey> ajmitch: I don't like that option because sometimes upstream decides they want to use another decimal place.
<ajmitch> jbailey: then i'd smack upstream around
<jbailey> ajmitch: But cw *scares* me!
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> in my case upstream is the dotgnu people
<ajmitch> damn
<ajmitch> esands: Build-Depends dependency on gcc-3.2 cannot be satisfied because the package libc6.1-dev cannot be found
<jbailey> What system are you on?
<ajmitch> oops, silly nick completion
<ajmitch> GNU/Hurd
<jbailey> Really?
<jbailey> That's messed up, lemme check my upload from this morning.
<ajmitch> it has | libc0.3-dev in build-depends :)
<jcater> jbailey: for this "change-over" period
<jcater> I supppose the official 0.4.1 release
<jcater> could be 0.4.1b
<jcater> wrt packaging :)
<jbailey> jcater: Tx. =)
<jcater> as we can't change our method now
<jcater> err, until after 0.4.1 is released, I mean
<ajmitch> sure you can!
<jamest> we could release 0.4.2
<ajmitch> exactly
<jcater> without a 0.4.1?
<ajmitch> yup
<derek> sigh why bother releasing 0.4.1 at all
<jbailey> jcater: It only stresses OCD people.
<jbailey> =)
<derek> might as well release 0.5.0
<derek> we have no method right now (seriously)
<derek> other than chaos
<derek> its completely abitrary
<jcater> I certainly wouldn't say that
<derek> as to packaging why the a and b and c and such
<jbailey> ajmitch: Something's messed up.  My upload from this morning definetly doesn't mention libc6.1
<jcater> derek:
<jcater> 0.4.0 is the last releaser
<ajmitch> or you could do what wolfgang is doing - start at -0.9 & work upwards to 0 :)
<jcater> cvs is known internally as 0.4.1a (alpha)
<jcater> that's for support reasons
<ajmitch> jbailey: hmm ok
<jcater> if a user goes to "Help|ABout" when using CVS
<jcater> it shows 0.4.1a
<ajmitch> jbailey: 3.2?
<jcater> that's our cue
<jcater> but when we release
<jcater> it becomes 0.4.1
<derek> imean more with numbers 
<jbailey> ajmitch: I upload gcc-3.2 this morning.
<ajmitch> ok
<jbailey> ajmitch: Let's take it to #hurd
<jcater> that's the part that's not working
<derek> my point is there is no 'roadmap' that states what release is what
<derek> so there is no control
<jcater> no control for whom?
<derek> at which point who cares if its 0.4.1 or 0.5.0 (independent of the alpha question)
<derek> any control anywhere
<jcater> we have our internal markers
<derek> there is nothing stating what features will be in what releases
<derek> so USERS have no idea until something is released what is what
<jcater> a lot is dependent on whether common's API changed
<derek> we do a bad job of limiting breakage
<jcater> if common's API is vastly different, it has to be a major point release
<derek> until now its been no big deal
<jcater> I dare say it's not arbitrary
<derek> as we didnt have mass of other developers
<derek> and we didnt have production users
<jcater> it's not perfect, nor well planned
<jcater> but it's not arbitrary
<derek> you and jamest both admit you use cvs generally for production
<derek> we need to very soon get to the point where we really maintain 2 releases
<jcater> I'm actually using 0.4.0 in production
<derek> so that someone on an old release can expect to get their bugs fixed
<jamest> i have no desire to release0.5.0 without major documentation
<derek> but not expect a bunch of expiremental features
<derek> or major breakage
<jamest> i thought someone was going to backport patches if we tagged cvs
<jamest> ?
<derek> that would be me
<derek> my problem is cvs commits are going like mad
<derek> but the cvs commit messages frankly suck
<ajmitch> or have a stable branch maintainer - someone who's not handling the main tree
<derek> and there is no roadmap or system used to manage what should be backported
<derek> my proposal is we have a strict feature roadmap
<derek> for the new releases and only if some feature is minor in nature does it get backported
<jamest> i can't see that working with free labor
<derek> and bug fixes be committed as only the bugfix with commit messages pointing to the dcl bug number
<jcater> that's bullshit
<derek> jamest: i never said 'put dates on features'
<ajmitch> you mean that developers have to put bugfixes into dcl even if they have a 5-min patch?
<jamest> what I'm saying is that like tonight
<derek> ajmitch: absolutely
<jamest> i finally got sick of the no query by detail
<jamest> so I'm fixing it
<jamest> this isn't on any roadmap
<jamest> other than I'm sick of it
<derek> and btw: im not saying that roadmaps cant change
<jcater> ajmitch: yes he is
<jcater> that's part of the problem
<derek> jamest: you entirely miss the point
<ajmitch> or yesterday, i found a gtk2 bug, and fixed it within a couple of minutes
<ajmitch> haven't sent you the patch yet :)
<derek> the point isnt that a roadmap cant change
<derek> its that there is something to work at 
<jcater> I'm not against roadmaps per se
<jcater> I think general guidelines are great
<derek> and if someone deems you know what ofr 0.5.0 we need detail queries
<derek> add it to the fucking roadmap
<derek> at some point one has to say this road is closed
<derek> or you end up with woody (the six year release)
<jcater> well
<derek> we already have had this happen with two releases
<jcater> I have absolutely no hesitation putting woody into use at any place of business
<derek> where they took twice as long as planned because 'features' snuck in
<jcater> without any IT department on standby
<derek> jcater: you missed the analogy
<derek> ask the debian developers how they felt about potato vs woody issue
<derek> it was hell for them
<jbailey> derek: And the fact that sarge is showing signs of being just as long.
Remosi (dahoose@port-219-88-247-65.jet.net.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> certainly we can end up with things like 0.4.23423423423
<chillywilly> woody was not that long
<derek> cause 0.5.0 wont feature freeze
<ajmitch> chillywilly: hyperbole
Action: derek isnt saying there is problems with 0.5.0 
<jcater> wtf are you talking about?
<derek> just stating that the problems will only get worse
<derek> the more develoeprs come along
<chillywilly> ajmitch: don't make me whoop you ;)
<derek> wtf am i talking about?
<ajmitch> chillywilly: shutup for a change & let them argue it out :)
<jcater> <derek> certainly we can end up with things like 0.4.23423423423
<derek> well we have a group running a custom fuckign cvs cause we couldnt get our shit together
<chillywilly> ajmitch: same to you pal
<jcater> we couldn't get our shit together?
<jbailey> g'night gentlemen.
<derek> and another group that stopped putting full time employees on gnue because we cant understand development cycles
jbailey (~jbailey@atlas.fundserv.com) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<derek> jcater: yeah we promissed a release for a month
<derek> and never showed signs of getting close
<jcater> part of the gawd damn problem
<jcater> were buggy patches from them
<jcater> that got into cvs
<derek> wait
<derek> that was a month BEFORE they STARTED thier cvs
<derek> the REASON they had own cvs
<derek> is our release was 6 months old
Action: chillywilly hands out the popcorn
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-91.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> here ajmitch, I'm sowwy
<ajmitch> derek: so what are you proposing? hard feature freeze at specified times, followed by only bugfixes until release?
<derek> ajmitch: im saying if you have a roadmap for say 0.5.0 and 0.4.0 is current release
<derek> any bug fixes applied to cvs can immediately be ported to 0.4.0 tree and new 0.4.1 and 0.4.2 releases can be made
<derek> as soon as the feature list is nearing completion for 0.5.0 someone says ok we are freezing 0.5.0
<derek> any new features go into 0.6.0 roadmap
<ajmitch> like KDE's cycle?
<chillywilly> "branch"?
<jamest> nothing prevents that today however the API is constatnly in flux, we are a 0.5.0 project
<jcater> chillywilly: someone has to maintain it
<ajmitch> new features have to be added to the feature plan
<chillywilly> jcater: yes
<derek> jamest: i have stated in the past it has been impossible to do this to a degree
<derek> BUT 
<jamest> I can see something stable as we approach 1.0
<derek> as we get more developers and more solid releases it will be mandatory to avoid chaos
<jamest> well, another way to approach this problem that i would prefer
<jamest> an (semi-)automated testing framework
<jamest> i'd love to see that today
<jcater> I would to
<jcater> and I've BEGGED people to do it
<derek> jamest: certainly that is necessary to help speed moving a release out the door
<jcater> I haven't seen a damn thing
<derek> as thats one thing that has made the process difficult
<jcater> so guess what
<derek> feature freeze is called
<jcater> I guess you or I need to do it
<derek> and it takes too long to test to point where its too tempting to add new features in 
<jcater> siesel has even taken the initiative
<jcater> to start one in samples/testcases
<jcater> but I don't see testcases flowing in
<jamest> yeah, i've been adding to it for what I'm working on
<jamest> but it's not standardized yet
<jamest> was hoping to make it part of the 0.5.0 cleanup release
<chillywilly> there's different types of testing
<chillywilly> black-box, white box, etc.
<chillywilly> white box requires good knowledge of the code
<chillywilly> that is being tested
<chillywilly> the *internals* of it
<chillywilly> there's probably on 3 ppl right now that fit this description, imho
<chillywilly> er, only
<chillywilly> with perhaps a couple that have a decent understanding
<ajmitch> how do you do automated forms testing?
<derek> well you have test cases and unit testing
<derek> unit testing will take a program that interfaces with the API of forms etc
Action: chillywilly apppoints derek as the "getting our shit together" guru ;)
<jamest> ajmitch: we'd have to create a pipe to send pre-packaged events into the form
<ajmitch> right, so you can't really test UI drivers that well
<derek> test cases should be sample forms sets or applications that have a QA person walk through
<ajmitch> as they're terribly subjective at times :)
<jamest> i wanted to make a gnue navigator thing
<chillywilly> well also the ppl need to document when they test it
<jamest> with various forms that had pages lableed step 1 2 3 4
<chillywilly> especially when it is interactive like a form
<jamest> and a final pass/fail step
<chillywilly> basically we need a testing team and/or go intoa  testing mode
<derek> chillywilly, i dont think anyone wants me to have that title
<derek> as they feel i dont do any work and only demand things
<derek> its much more fun to code when you just do as you like
<jamest> anything is better than what we have now
<derek> its more like work if you add structure
<derek> and i can relate to that
<jamest> which IIRC was jcater saying "prereleases is here please test"
<jamest> then have people test after the final release
<chillywilly> but it is sort of informal
<chillywilly> no offense
<derek> jamest: yes anything is better
<chillywilly> soem ppl can't code without some structure as they like to see down the "road" ;)
<derek> unfortunately all people are like that
<derek> just the people closest to gnue have the roadmap in their head
<derek> and cant see why anyone is frustrated that there is no structure
<jamest> or voices telling us what to do next
<chillywilly> :P
<derek> because when you are close to it, there appears to be structure (and there is) 
<derek> just its not in a format that can be well shared
<derek> i.e. not everyone can hear the voices ;)
<chillywilly> well can't I download the jcater essence via my nueral interface ala the matrix?
<derek> fwiw: its not so much requesting things be radically different than they are now, just that they be better presented to the public
<jcater> well
<jcater> to use psu's terminology
<jcater> when I brought up wikis
<jcater> we are already stretched pretty thin
<chillywilly> wiki, wiki
<jcater> the few of us
<derek> and i still think that all bugs should go through a tool, if everyone hates dcl fine, lets use bugzilla or request tracker or whatever people like
<jcater> and you make it sound like we are unresponsive to the public
<derek> but its necessary to cut down support as we grow
<jcater> I've spent a HELL of a lot of time on the developer's guide
<jcater> did I need the damn thing?
<jcater> no

<chillywilly> thanks jcater :)
<jcater> did I have more pressing things I should've been working on?
<jcater> yes
<chillywilly> we luv you man!
<derek> im willing to write up roadmaps and maintain a back branch
<jcater> and dammit
<jcater> you make it sound like we just only add new features and never look back
<derek> but not if i have to swim against the river to do it
<jcater> jamest and I take a release every so often
<jcater> and do NOTHING but cleanup
<jcater> and profiling
<derek> i.e. if you and jamest loathe the idea of roadmaps i woudl rather not try to document whats in your heads for the public :)
<jcater> and cos
<jcater> err, docs
<derek> jcater: actually my complaint is you guys do far too much clean up :)
<jamest> lol
<derek> and my hope is to get to a point where others can 'clean up some' and you guys can add new cool stuff
<jamest> there are tons of things I want to toss in 0.5.0
<jcater> derek: so would I 
<jcater> I would also like some donuts
<jcater> but I don't have any
<jamest> depreciated tags and the upgrade code hidden in gnue to support them
<jcater> so it won't happen
<chillywilly> jcater: I have some
Action: chillywilly thinks derek must change his nick to "masta" when going on such a crusade ;)
<chillywilly> it's only fair to warn ppl when he's in masta-mode
<jcater> maybe a step down from masta mode would help
<jcater> we can only take so many "forms is useless... it's been useless since 0.3.0"

<chillywilly> how can I know what has what?
<Mr_You> I still don't understand the question, but man syslogd
<chillywilly> I have been reading syslog.conf man page
<chillywilly> that will be the next one I look at
<chillywilly> the syslogd man page
<chillywilly> Mr_You: you mean a big unix admin liek you doesn't have this tuff memorized? ;)
<Mr_You> The priority is one of the following keywords, in  ascend­
<Mr_You>        ing  order:  debug,  info,
<Mr_You> etc..
<Mr_You> thats in syslogd.conf
<Mr_You> syslog.conf
<Mr_You> man page
<chillywilly> yea I got that
<chillywilly> but how would I know wat priority iptables messages have?
<chillywilly> so I can put them in their own place
<chillywilly> or would they just be in kern
<chillywilly> kernel.whatever
<Mr_You> yeah they are a part of kern
<chillywilly> nm, I am just going to read until I get an answer
<chillywilly> I can't separate them?
<Mr_You> I doubt it.
<chillywilly> I don't want all the packet stuff filling up /var/log/mesages
<Mr_You> not via syslog
<chillywilly> messages
<Mr_You> maybe via iptables configuration
<chillywilly> or spewing to the console when I have a VT on my firewall box
<Mr_You> yeah you would have to route kern.=info or such to /var/log/info 
<chillywilly> how do you know it is info?
<Mr_You> "or such"
<chillywilly> that's what I don't grokk
<chillywilly> someone said there was an --log-to option but I don't see it
<Mr_You> you'll just have to find which one it is that you want since it doesn't tell you in the man pages
<chillywilly> for iptables that is

<ajmitch> the jeff-meister!
<jbailey> Heya.
<jbailey> Is someone here willing/able to give me rights to alter the topic?
Action: ajmitch can't
<jbailey> It would be nice to be able to post things there when relevant.
<ajmitch> yep
<jbailey> Well, for everyone - gnue-common, gnue-forms, and gnue-designer were all ACCEPTED into Debian as of about 30 minutes ago.  They'll be in sid tommorow.
<jbailey> The geas update will probably wait until next week.  
<jbailey> In the meantime, I'll probably be back tommorow to pester about how to use the data sources in designer. =)
<jbailey> Since all I did was generate ugly Python errors.
