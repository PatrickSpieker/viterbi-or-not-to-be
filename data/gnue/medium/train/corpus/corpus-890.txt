<Chipaca> hi all
<btami> hi
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> is it me or do you guys think it is lame to have a private devel/dev list for a Free software project?
<Chipaca> we have a private list and a public list, the private list is for coordination of the Fundación's team, not for discussion of the project
<Chipaca> dunno if you were referring to us :)
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> hurd-devel
<chillywilly> is read only unless yo are blessed or something
<chillywilly> s/yo/you/
<Chipaca> it is lame, but until recently all of GNU's subprojects were carried like that
<Chipaca> (cf. Cathedral)
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> LAME
<chillywilly> ;)
<Chipaca> quick question on python: is it "global foo; import foo" or viceversa?
<chillywilly> to import a module?
<Chipaca> yeap
<chillywilly> it si the latter
<Chipaca> in the OnStartup trigger, to be able to use it from the others
<chillywilly> crap I have to go

<Chipaca> jamest: hi
<Chipaca> jamest: tell me more about trigger libraries
<jamest> they're broken!
<jamest> :)
<Chipaca> ah, ok
<Chipaca> so I'll just carry on importing stuff the python way
<jamest> well
<jamest> how they work is
<jamest> your create a trigger lib file
<jamest> <form>
<Chipaca> suits me way up to the point the gfd lives in the database
<jamest>   <trigger type="named" name="foo">
<jamest>      print "Hi Mom"
<jamest>   </trigger>
<jamest> </form>
<jamest> then in your .gfd file you have
<jamest> let me start over 
<jamest> i have two files
<Chipaca> yeah, i got that :)
<jamest> testlib.glb   (my own bs name)
<jamest> test.gfd
<jamest> bash-2.05a$ more testlib.glb
<jamest> <form>
<jamest> <trigger name="helloworld" type="NAMED">
<jamest>   print "I'm alive!!!!!!!!!!!"
<jamest> </trigger>
<jamest> </form>
<jamest> now in my test.gfd I have
<jamest> <form tabbed="top" title="Welcome to GNUe Forms">
<jamest> <import-trigger library="./testlib.glb" name="helloworld"/>
<jamest> <trigger type="on-startup" name="startupTest" src="helloworld"/>
<jamest> the ./ on the library name is meaningless
<Chipaca> :)
<jamest> btw - I'm working on the library system now
<jamest> if you want to use them I think you can get the old system working by going into GFParser.py
<Chipaca> meaningless as in ignored, meaningless as in superfluous, meaningless as in breaks?
<jamest> meaning it'll pull from the current dir by default
<Chipaca> we're not currently on current cvs :)
<jamest> that's fine
<jamest> this hasn't changed in ages
<jamest> anyway try a simple one like above 
<Chipaca> ok
<jamest> if you get a key error with a key of 0
<jamest> then in GFParser.py look for a line like
<jamest>       self._importclass = self._xmlParser\
<jamest>          .getXMLelements()[string.lower(self._type[9:])][0]
<jamest> change the [0] at the end to read
<jamest> ['BaseClass']
<jamest> what I did for my testcase 
<jamest> was to take the intro.gfd file and modify the top to read like what I pasted above
Action: jamest is altering the parser system to allow other gnue apps to do imports
<jamest> the current cvs is forms only wrt imports
<Chipaca> ok
<jamest> i should have any gnue apps able to do them this morning (time allowing)

<Chipaca>  You've got your bar in my foo! And you've got your foo on my bar!  Two great reams that ream well together!
<Chipaca> :)
<jamest> you know
<jamest> i wonder what companies think when they get error reports like that :)
<Chipaca> LOL
<Chipaca> 'uhhhh...'
<jamest> the worse I read about was a coder that left in a message to himself along the lines of 
<jamest> "hey dumbass, you shouldn't be able to do that"

<nickr> jamest: I aws just entertained by your anecdote
<jcater> btami: if you are only ever outputting xml, then no
<jcater> but I was leaving the option open to output more than that
<jcater> btw, if we don't want the \n's
<jcater> then the patch isn't necessary
<jcater> as there is already a stripContent or such flag in the xmlElements hash
<jcater> we just need to set that for the Layout tags
<btami> aha, but passthru isn't a layout tag :)
<jcater> ah, true
<btami> so i'v failed with simplereport wizard (text.xsl)
<btami> that was the reason i looked into GContent

<jcater> reaming error?
<Chipaca> you know, something like your foo is in my bar and your bar is in my foo or something like that
<jcater> how are you triggering that message?
<jcater> I've never seen it
<jcater> is it a specific function you are calling that triggers it
<jcater> or a certain trigger
<Chipaca> nope, when accessing the db
<Chipaca> it's in pgsql's extension triggers (or something like that, I'm no longer fresh on the error, but I just peeked at the irc logs and saw you asked something after I left last time)

<jamest> 1 ) keep the splash on top for 3 seconds 
<jamest> 2 ) drop the splashscren the moment the form was ready for processing
<jamest> it's 1 line of code either way
<jamest> I did 1 as on a fast system the splashscreen wouldn't have been up any time at all

<Chipaca> jcater: form.setFocus(widget) changes the focus back to the page, but it then changes back to the page the user clicked on

<jbailey> Anyone have a public gnue site of some sort I can show off to my boss?
<ajmitch> eh? gnue site?
<ajmitch> you mean dcl, or you thinking that gnue is web-based?
<jbailey> web based full gnue site.
<ajmitch> umm
Action: ajmitch doesn't think anyone is really using gnue as web-based
<jbailey> Hmmm.
<jbailey> I should probably just install it then, shouldn't I.
<ajmitch> would be a good idea if you want to maintain the debs ;)
<ajmitch> the main forms client is wxpython/pygtk based
<ajmitch> and designer uses wxpython
<revDeke>  a month ago i could have shown you a cool demo
<revDeke> basically had you install forms locally
<revDeke> and execute over ssh to my backend
<revDeke> but ssh2 screws that up :)
<revDeke> at least temporarily
Nick change: esands_ -> esands
<jbailey> Ah, okay - My boss is asking me whether we can use it for a simple PO system.  I think it's all good for that, yes?  Like it's stable, generally won't eat data and all that?
<jbailey> Backend would presummably one of our Oracle DBs or mysql or something like that.  Clients are all win32.
<jcater> lol... haven't had it eat data yet :)
<jcater> jbailey: I think it'll be fine
<jcater> as long as you don't have a user
<jcater> named dneighbo
<jcater> if that's the case, everything seems to fall apart
<jbailey> *lol*
<jbailey> how are the screens published to the client?
Action: jcater was only semi-joking
<revDeke> well i guess that means the good news is
<revDeke> im not sure its EVER eaten my data
<revDeke> its not accepted it before
<revDeke> but never eaten it
<revDeke> it has eaten all my X resources before
<revDeke> which was well interesting ;)
<ajmitch> screens are either supplied locally, or can be grabbed over http, iirc :)
<revDeke> if anyone says they changed the 'layout' system be very afraid to run old forms ;)
<revDeke> ajmitch: they can be grabbed over any transport supported by python
<revDeke> http/https/ftp/etc
<ajmitch> ah ok
<ajmitch> uses urlOpen() ?
<jcater> ajmitch: or the python equivalent, yip
<ajmitch> i think that is the python function
<jcater> gnue-reports --list-filters now works 
<jcater> :)
<ajmitch> sorry, it
<ajmitch> 's urlopen()
<ajmitch> cool
<jbailey> Nice, thanks.
<jbailey> I've gotten go ahead to play with gnue during work hours, sweet.
<ajmitch> yay!
<jbailey> Now if only I could get paid to abuse cw during work hours too.
<jbailey> But alas, my dream job is not yet here. =)

<Chipaca> hi all
<Chipaca> can I pass a paremeter to a trigger?
<jcater> no
<Chipaca> :(
<Chipaca> ok
<Chipaca> jcater: it's about cancelling the pageflip
<Chipaca> jcater: I need some way of saying form.setFocus(da_widget), without writing one trigger per page
<Chipaca> can you think of a way?
Action: Chipaca would do it in xml if the xml parser was up to it
<jcater> um
<jcater> you completely lost me
<Chipaca> good! (=:]
<Chipaca> where?
<jcater> <Chipaca> jcater: it's about cancelling the pageflip
<jcater> <Chipaca> jcater: I need some way of saying form.setFocus(da_widget), without writing one trigger per page
<jcater> <Chipaca> can you think of a way?
<jcater> * Chipaca would do it in xml if the xml parser was up to it
<ajmitch> you want a default widget set on each page?
<jcater> take your pick
<Chipaca> lol
<Chipaca> no
<ajmitch> hmm
<ajmitch> explain please :)
<Chipaca> I need to go back to the page the user was on if she forgot to fill something in
<ajmitch> ah
<Chipaca> or
<jcater> the goal was to allow triggers to return a true or false
<jcater> based on success/failure
<ajmitch> so you need to store the previous page visited?
<jcater> so if a failure was returned
<jcater> everything stops
<Chipaca> well, actually, if she forgot to commit or rollback, there's this popup that says "commit/rollback/cancel" except that the cancel thing isn't getting done (same problem)
<Chipaca> yeah, but the page has already changed, even in pre-focusout
<ajmitch> hmm
<jcater> then that's a bug w/page changing
Action: Chipaca feels like ripping out the whole wx thing and doing it over
<Chipaca> the feeling subsides
<Chipaca> :)

<ajmitch> you don't like the wxpython ui driver?
<ajmitch> or is this some other wx stuff? :)
<Chipaca> no, it's the wxpython ui driver
<Chipaca> (or maybe it's wxpython per se, dunno)
<Chipaca> the worst bug is the widget-seems-to-get-focus-but-doesn't
<Chipaca> that confuses the hell out of people
<jcater> I'm not getting that one any more
<ajmitch> wxpython 2.2 has a few issues, i guess :)
<ajmitch> anyone working on the pygtk driver?
<Chipaca> jcater: not the one with multiple rows, the one where you point at an entry but just on the border so the cursor isn't acutally I-shaped, click, and the | cursor appears in the entry, but the focus isn't there
<Chipaca> it's amazingly simple to trigger that one by accident
<jcater> lol
<jcater> I didn't even know about it
<jcater> all the time I've ever run forms
<jcater> I've never hit that bug
<Chipaca> lol
<Chipaca> I think we put it in dcl some time back
Action: ajmitch volunteers to play with the pygtk driver next week, for something to do
<ajmitch> i'm sorry, but wxpython just looks ugly on my gnome 2 desktop ;)
<jcater> I'd much rather see a Win32 driver written 
<ajmitch> so how is PAPO going?
<jcater> in case anyone cares :)
<dtm> aloha fewlz   what's the url for phpforms?

<Chipaca> dtm: I'm working on plain forms :)
<dtm> chillywilly: psp huh
<dtm> havne't heard of that
<ajmitch> chillywilly: which psp do you mean?
<chillywilly> python server pages
<ajmitch> i know of about 3 different psp products
<ajmitch> 2 of which are python, one is perl server pages :)
<chillywilly> eeek!
<chillywilly> not perl!
<chillywilly> nooooo!
<ajmitch> the only one which i am familiar with using, is the psp which is part of webware
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> this is what I am referring to
<dtm> chillywilly: oh yes, in this crazy universe some of you are in where you require zero compatibility with the outside world and instead reimplement the world one coordinate at a time, yes there's not much value in learning php.  :)
<dtm> hee hee
<dtm> in that case, it is indeed handy

<chillywilly> for the record
<ajmitch> chillywilly: so hack dcl
<dtm> of course for one who does not code or design at the speed of light
<dtm> .....
<chillywilly> dtm: are you talking smack?
<dtm> or who doesn't already know everything, and hence requires multiple points of view and multiple intelligences, then one must integrate one's code once in a while

<chillywilly> woops, try http://sf.net/projects/trioweb/
<dtm> because unlike the majority, they implement it correctly
<dtm> they use abstraction layers and other clever ideas
<dtm> dewd even I can see that stuff like postnuke is a rat's nest
<dtm> also i have discovered that php is highly tolerant of mistakes or suboptimal practices
<chillywilly> it's a pretty dead project though as I am converting to GNUe
<dtm> see, these things should be embraced properly
<ajmitch> you are?
<dtm> not chastized for what the kiddies do with it
<dtm> that's all!
<chillywilly> dtm: I was saying as a language I prefer python, it's a personal choice

<derek> jcater: it is a 'shorten' file

<derek> as chillywilly stated :)
<derek> the 'tape traders'
<derek> use it to trade live shows
<jcater> bah
<jcater> all my sound can be done with the BASIC "sound" command
<chillywilly> they bring their little mini disks or DAT stuff and tape the shows ;P
Action: derek thinks jcater is thinking why trade music when you have video... girls moaning is only so exciting ;)
<chillywilly> and mp3s are satan spawn becase it is loassy compression
<chillywilly> according to them
<derek> chillywilly: well they have valid points to a degree
<derek> they just go a little insane at times :)
<dtm> chillywilly: yeah, because they're fucked in the head
<chillywilly> sure, but the human ear is only so good ;)
<derek> chillywilly: i agree
<derek> the debate is lossless...
<derek> well once you go wav to ogg and trade the ogg
<derek> you shouldnt be going ogg 2 wav 2 ogg 2 wav etc...
<chillywilly> I don't care either way, but I don't go out of my way to piss them off and encode into mp3
<derek> i.e. the quality degrades not by 'copying' from one machine to antoher
<chillywilly> yea
<derek> but rather when 're-encoding'
<chillywilly> that's their argument
<dtm> they're basically paranoid about the EVENTUAL loss of quality in case some mind-baffling idiot decides to downsample or convert all their compressed audio, as if that somehow reduces the number of high quality encodings in the world
<chillywilly> they don't want shitty mp3s floating around
<derek> but regardless most of it is prog rock stuff i have no interest in
<chillywilly> derek: prog rock?
<derek> i would play the shn game if i found decent tape traders
<dtm> and they're protecting the allegedly lossless (it's inherently lossy due to the human ear, playback equipment, and the fact that most of em are live recordings anyway!) as if they're protecting a species against genocide.

<jcater> um
<jcater> as much as I love debian
<jcater> gentoo portage is based on python
<jcater> that's just too kickass
<willieb> Aye :)
<willieb> which package contains /etc/gnue.conf?
<jcater> common contains some samples
<jcater> I don't know who did the ebuilds
<jcater> but it looks wrong :)
<willieb> I like it when other people are wrong, not me!
<ajmitch> heh
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> these are off
<jcater> I may be able to tweak them into working
<jcater> but I don't have a gentoo system laying around
Action: jcater needs to get a "test OS" system though
<ajmitch> sigh this computer feels sluggish
<jcater> ajmitch: send it my way
<willieb> what spec is the hardware?
<jcater> I'm sure it'll work for my test system :)
<ajmitch> ahtlon xp 1800+, 512MB ram
<jcater> yup
<jcater> that'll do
<willieb> ppphhh - sluggish you say?  my machine here does very nicely  p2@400, 256MB
<Mr_You> jcater: removable HD do?  or multiple partitions?
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I'd rather have a separate machine
<jcater> as I would like to test on other OS's
<jcater> but I sure as hell don't want to code the fixes on them
<jcater> :)
Action: jcater needs break down and buy VMWare
<Mr_You> heh
<Mr_You> hmm
<Mr_You> UML  would work for multiple distros I guess
<jcater> I wish plex86 were further along
<Mr_You> linux distros
<ajmitch> perhaps it's the stuff i'm running
<ajmitch> but harddrive access seems to be slow (have to change filesystem sometime too)
<jcater> ajmitch: yeah, I have an Athlon 1700 at work
<jcater> and the harddrive access was worse
<jcater> than on my 800Mhz Duron
<jcater> I dunno why
<ajmitch> this tends to swap a bit
<jcater> I played w/hdparm and got much better performance
<jcater> but still not where it should be imho
<ajmitch> perhaps i should get another 512MB & turn swap off
<ajmitch> yeah, hdparm reports reasonable performance
<Mr_You> swap off or no swap is askin for trouble ;-)
<ajmitch> Mr_You: with 1GB of RAM?
<jcater> geeze!
<jcater> and you're swapping?
<jcater> you must be running OpenOffice AND mozilla AT THE SAME TIME
<ajmitch> jcater: no, i said i only have 512
<jcater> ah
<ajmitch> at the moment
<Mr_You> well.. swap space on server is abosolutely mandatory.. minimum of a gig... if its a desktop minimum of 256MB
<Mr_You> even with 1GB 
<Mr_You> even if it only uses 1MB of that swap.
<ajmitch> why?
<Mr_You> because you never know what app or whatever might have a memory leak or hog resources or what not.. its just a safety net.. if you have diskspace problems thats a whole other issue.
<jcater> wow
<jcater> these Gentoo ebuilds are way off
<ajmitch> no, if i have swap enabled, then it just delays the death a little
<Mr_You> delays the death to the point you can intervene?  ;-)
<ajmitch> hardly
<Mr_You> no it does
<Mr_You> I just never understood why people wanted so little swap.
<ajmitch> because on a normal system it's on the same disk as all the apps, and causes lots of disk access?
<Mr_You> not if you have plenty of ram ;-)
<ajmitch> s/normal/normal desktop/
<willieb> are you seeing anything in the ebuilds in particular, or just in general?
<Mr_You> In the past I increased solaris boxes swap space many times cause people configured machines with little swap. ;-)
<jcater> willieb: in general
<Mr_You> unfortunately swap files, cause not worth adding a partition.
<jcater> e.g., common is not dependent on DCL or wxPython
<jcater> and the Common ebuild doesn't set up default /etc/gnue stuff
<Mr_You> I dunno if linux allows swap files.. which if it does.. swap size doesn't matter so much cause you can just add some.
<Mr_You> but I'd rather just go ahead and give 256MB with disk space being so cheap
<jcater> plus there needs to be some "sed"s in all the tools
<jcater> to adjust the bin/ scripts that are created
<jcater> to replace the explicit references to /usr/local/gnue
<jcater> hmm
<Mr_You> If I'm building a Sun box with multiple processors and say 4 gigs of ram with the expectation to expand, I'll create 2GB swap.
<jcater> I wonder if a Dual P166 would be enough for a "test" system?
<jcater> put gentoo, freebsd, redhat, et al on it
<Mr_You> but then thats a big ole server.
<Mr_You> jcater: hell yeah
<Mr_You> jcater: actually.. I dunno... might want to be sure the chipset is supported.
<willieb> aye, a dual 166 would work, would be a few days installing though
<jcater> Mr_You: only problem is it's an ALR Revolution
<jcater> it's based on an INtel chipset that is poorly supported
<jcater> I could not get debian to install on it using the 2.2 kernel
<Mr_You> the only multiproc pentiums I ever admined was NCRs about a year plus ago hhe
<jcater> it'd lock up
<Mr_You> big ole machines
<willieb> need and remember to boot with a i586 image though... that one's caught me out before :(
<Mr_You> jcater: forget it then
<Mr_You> too much trouble
<Mr_You> for little gain
<jcater> Mr_You: I finally got Debian on this machine, BUT i had to install on a separate machine and swap hard drives :)
<jcater> and I cna't use SMP
<jcater> but, damn
<jcater> I hate wasting this machine
<Mr_You> ouch
<jcater> my company gave like $25K - $30K for it back in the day
<jcater> it's our old SCO machine
<Mr_You> what is it?
<Mr_You> dual pentium?
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> back when they said you couldn't do "dual pentium" :)
<Mr_You> well if its free.. *shrug*
<Mr_You> shoot.. you could probably find some desktops to use.
<Mr_You> maybe?
<jcater> not at work
<jcater> we have all available old desktops as LTSP nodes now :)
<jcater> really quite cool
<jcater> I haven't bought a new desktop in like 12-18 months
<jcater> and we've expanded quite a bit
<jcater> well, except for my new Athlon, btu that doesn't count:)
<jcater> I'm not a user
<jcater> and I approve the purchases
<jcater> ;)
<Mr_You> cool
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I have a boat-load of 486s
<jcater> but that'd be painful too :)
<Mr_You> knoppix seems to be the best CD based distro.. but I'm biased to debian ;-)
<ajmitch> everyone is here :)
<Mr_You> well 486DXs are actually pretty useful..
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> do you know the power consumption comparisons between a 486DX
<jcater> and a Pentium 200
<jcater> ?
<Mr_You> no
<jcater> as I'm using the latter as a firewall
<jcater> but have several 486s lying around
<Mr_You> make a cluster.
<ajmitch> can probably still cook an egg on a p200
<jcater> ajmitch: yeah
<jcater> but I've heard pentium-class power supplies are more efficient
<jcater> so I dunno
<jcater> I can't get a good answer
<ajmitch> hmm
<jcater> my inclination is that a Pentium *has* to use more power
<jcater> as it burns hotter
<ajmitch> atx power supplies?
<ajmitch> depends on the other parts, too
<jcater> I find that hard to believe though
<jcater> as I can use a much smaller wattage PS in a 486
<ajmitch> noisy & hot hard drives use much power
<jcater> than I can in a Pentium
<ajmitch> if you can, measure it
<jcater> eh?
<ajmitch> iirc you can get old power meter things to measure power consumption
<jcater> there's an idea
<ajmitch> they're not within the power company's tolerances to use as a house meter, so you might be able to pick one up
<jcater> I tried googling for a comparison
<jcater> but couldn't find anything
<derek> jcater the problem is i dont think you can go by 'output' per say
<derek> for example if i have a hotwater heater from 10 years ago and one from this year
<derek> likely the one from this year will burn 10 times hotter but be 80% more efficient
<jcater> yeah, I know that
<derek> obviously the sway in powersupply's wont be that drastic
<jcater> hmm
<derek> i think its probably about a wash
<jcater> well, this 486 has a 325W PS drawing 4.2 Amps
<ajmitch> derek: the newer one could still be hotter, but gets it's efficiency thru insulation
<willieb> a cheap multimeter from radioshack would soon tell you - hack up an old PC power lead, set the meter to AC amps and stick it inline?
<jcater> according to the sticker
<derek> this reminds me of old generator talk
<derek> people going i only need a 2500 watt generator for my stuff im only running a circular saw and a small nailer for compressor
<derek> BUT
Action: dtm washes derek's mouth out with degreaser
<derek> they always forget you have to calculate for 'surge' on initial draw of startup
Action: derek forgets the calc but its nearly twice the steady throughput
<dtm> well they just need to get a running start then
Action: derek would try to warn the guys and they would think i was trying to rip them off and sell them something bigger
<derek> but then.....
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> boom?
<derek> next day... hey when i fire up my second saw it cuts out and i have to restart...
<derek> and me is like ... 'duh'
<willieb> nature's way of telling you only to do one thing at once ;)
Action: chillywilly has a nice fluke meter
<chillywilly> hey derek how do you like our defense ;)
<willieb> clamp on ac/dc ammeter by any chance?
Action: derek likes the 14 points they have for me
<chillywilly> 14 - 0
<chillywilly> :)
<derek> miami is my defense on the 'bench'
<derek> they arent doing bad either
<chillywilly> and this is with a banged up Favre
<jcater> banged up?
<ajmitch> you talking about that pansy game again?
<jcater> the boys been playing w/him in the locker room again?
<chillywilly> yes he sprained his knee last game
<chillywilly> no he got sacked
<chillywilly> sprained his knee
<chillywilly> real men actually watch football ;)

<chillywilly> aaah!
<chillywilly> plz!
<chillywilly> someonme poke out my eyes with a hot sick
<ajmitch> ah yes, that's what i'm doing now :)
<chillywilly> lol
<ajmitch> when's the next release planned for? how long we got for testing?
<jcater> if I had to estimate
<jcater> I'd say between 2 and 30 days
<ajmitch> hmm
<jcater> but that's only a guestimate
<jcater> I could be wrong
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> depends on how many bugs need fixed
<ajmitch> yay, setup-cvs.py doesn't generate docs
<ajmitch> TMPDIR is DBTOHTML_OUTPUT_DIR2117
<ajmitch> Using stylesheet: "/usr/lib/sgml/stylesheet/dsssl/docbook/cygnus/cygnus-both.dsl"
<ajmitch> Usage: db2html [filename.{sgml,xml}]
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> placement.gfd is broke
<jcater> what?
<jcater> placement was working for me an hour ago
<ajmitch> hmm
<ajmitch> i just did cvs update, ran setup-cvs.py
<jcater> bbiaf... trying a 486 as my firewall
<ajmitch> and tried placement.gfd with both gtk2 & wx drivers
<jcater> hmm
<ajmitch> masks.gfd also has some buglets with gtk2 drivere (i need to hack it next week)
