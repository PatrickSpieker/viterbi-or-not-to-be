<reinhard> just some further info about performance issues in appserver and in gnue in general
<reinhard> over the weekend I was having a talk with another developer that was fighting performance issues in python, and this developer had the very same problem that garbage collection is *the* performance killer in python and close to impossible to optimize as it runs just at random times and it can't be easily found out which function causes which garbage
<reinhard> good night all
*** reinhard has quit IRC
<jcater> most of my functions produce a lot of garbage
<derek> cant python hire a better sanitation engineer?
<derek> sometime back i read a good article on this subject
* derek thinks it was python specific and gave examples on how to avoid object churning
<derek> http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/MinimizingObjectChurn
<derek> but then again... when we chose python the primary reason was
<derek> python values productivity over performance :)
<derek> is gnue to a point where it needs to consider optimization?
*** dimas__ has joined #gnuenterprise
<jcater> probably not
<jcater> I think the question just came up in the context of some tests someone was doing with a new comm backend
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I was dismissing that article
<jcater> until it pointed to the intern() builtin
<jcater> which I'd never seen
<jcater> Enter string in the table of ``interned'' strings and return the interned string - which is string itself or a copy. Interning strings is useful to gain a little performance on dictionary lookup - if the keys in a dictionary are interned, and the lookup key is interned, the key comparisons (after hashing) can be done by a pointer compare instead of a string compare. Normally, the names used in Python programs are automatically interned, and the di
<jcater> ctionaries used to hold module, class or instance attributes have interned keys. Changed in version 2.3: Interned strings are not immortal (like they used to be in Python 2.2 and before); you must keep a reference to the return value of intern()  around to benefit from it.
<jcater> that sounds like a perfect candidate for our event system
<jcater> as event names are strings
<jcater> and our event dispatcher maps events to functions using a dictionary
<jcater> vewy, vewy interesting
<jcater> well, except for that last part about the python 2.3 change... guess I need to read up on it some more
