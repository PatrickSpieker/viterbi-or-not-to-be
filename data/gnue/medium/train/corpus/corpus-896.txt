<reinhard> omg
<reinhard> <derek> we need a new homepage
<reinhard> (no further comment)
<ajmitch> reinhard: why?
ra3vat (ds@195.239.64.228) joined #gnuenterprise.
<reinhard> plz don't get me started
<reinhard> we had a cool static homepage under www.gnu.org/projects/gnue
<reinhard> and we had a cool mailing list at gnue@gnu.org
<reinhard> but that wasn't enough for us
<reinhard> we needed 15 new mailing lists (of which >= 12 are completely dead)
<reinhard> and we needed a hyper super dynamic homepage
<reinhard> (where an average of 1-2 articles per month are posted)
<reinhard> well i have to add that we had 3 or 4 versions of that dynamic homepage
<ajmitch> yeah
<reinhard> and now i hear
<reinhard> "we need a simple (static?) homepage"
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> i don't really care about the homepage, i care about the code :)
<reinhard> me too :)
<reinhard> so I _don't_ adivse you to read the logs to see what position I took in the homepage discussion :)
Action: ajmitch scrolls up... ;)
<ajmitch> this was quite awhile ago, i guess?
<reinhard> um yes several months :)
<ajmitch> hmm, i probably wouldn't be able to find it ;)
Action: ajmitch has always wondered why there are so many mailing lists
<ajmitch> they hardly ever get used, from what i see
<reinhard> exactly
<reinhard> but we needed that because we will have so many developers
<ajmitch> will have, but it's not needed now
<reinhard> yeah and we needed a dynamic web page because of the many articles people will post
<ajmitch> heh
<reinhard> and we couldn't understand that rms is anti dynamic pages
Action: reinhard has to stop now
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> what mailing lists are actually used, btw?
<reinhard> officially you could mail to all of them
<reinhard> most of the subscriber lists are nearly identical :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<reinhard> gotta leave, 3 installs are waiting for me
<reinhard> bb in a few hours

<derek> jamest: no form fixage
<jamest> ok
<derek> first we must verify there is a real problem :)
<jamest> taco bell needs to rename their "Win it before you can buy it" x-box sweepstakes
<jamest> to "Win it before you can buy it but receive it a week after you could have bought it" x-box sweepstakes
<jamest> as we're one week away from retail rollout and their sigh keeps saying "come back real soon for the list of winners!"
<jamest> sigh=site
<jamest> something funny
<jamest> they are claiming huge interest in the x-box
<jamest> Xbox.com brought in 589,000 unique visitors during the week ended Oct. 28, soaring 71 percent from the previous week
<jamest> now I wonder if that may have, in some remote way, and I'm only guessing here, been due to the fact that you had to visit xbox.com to register your !@#!@# game piece and the last day to enter was the 29th of Oct
<jcater> be back tonight

<Mr_You> hi
<RockTiger> Howdy.
<Mr_You> hey, haven't seen you before, checkin out GNUe?
<RockTiger> Yep, couple of days ago - I recognized your nick.
<Mr_You> ahh, I might not have been around then
<RockTiger> East coast, right?
<Mr_You> or maybe my memory has failed, which does happen heh
<Mr_You> yeah NC
<Mr_You> you
<Mr_You> ?
<RockTiger> I'm in Hawaii - it was 3 AM when you logged out.
<Mr_You> ahh I think I recall now, talkin about hiking in Hawaii right?
<RockTiger> Yep, and the inheriting from other languages?
<RockTiger> Like the M$ CLR does?
<Mr_You> I'd like to go 4 wheelin and hike/camp in hawaii one day.. I dunno if they have public 4 wheelin areas tho.. I know some people 4 wheel there tho.. 
<RockTiger> Not a lot of 4wheel areas, a few, tho.
<Mr_You> I might have been away during that part of the conversation ;-)
<RockTiger> Yeah - know how it goes.
<RockTiger> Mr_You: working on any of the GNUe stuff?
jwserra (jwserra@as9-port44.efes.net.tr) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Mr_You> not programming, mainly an end-user/developer of Form applications.. trying to get a custom Debian based distro first then will start working on GNUe
<Mr_You> hi jwserra
<jwserra> hi
<jwserra> This is all very interesting stuff. How far along is gnue?
<Mr_You> still alpha, but coming along
<Mr_You> I hear 2 tier apps are in production
<jwserra> Should one try to setup a system from cvs or just download the last release?
<Mr_You> I have heard to use the cvs version
<Mr_You> as of today
<Mr_You> I imagine a release might be coming up soon (as in a month or who knows)
<Mr_You> but I recall someone stating multiple changes between the latest release and cvs
<jwserra> I suppose I can find all the info in the install docs right?
<RockTiger> Hewlett-Paquard has released an entire web service framework as open source: E-speak.
<Mr_You> jwserra: well I dunno... if you have probs, hang out here, someone is always willing to help you get running (assuming someone is here/available and knows how to fix your problem), but most of the developers are here frequently and like to help you get started if you have problems
<RockTiger> I think it is GPL'ed.
<Mr_You> have a url tiger?
Action: RockTiger is looking - one minute.
Action: RockTiger suugests http://www.e-speak.net/
<Mr_You> cool thanks
<Mr_You> I think its awesome these big corps are GPLing software
<RockTiger> Me, too. I spent 6 month building a framework when all this was new, and HP's looks pretty good.
<RockTiger> They had a lot more resource to put into than we did.
jwserra (jwserra@as9-port44.efes.net.tr) left irc: using sirc version 2.211+4KSIRC/1.1
<Mr_You> its interesting to find out what "web services" platform will gain the most market share
<RockTiger> Umhm . . . but part of the beauty of it is - doesn't matter: whose Ethernet card has the biggest market share?
<RockTiger> As long as you have a working interface . . . 
<RockTiger> e-Speak is 'GPL for the run-time engine and LGPL for the programming library API'
<RockTiger> Just found that on their site.
<RockTiger> What is LGPL again - 'lesser'
<RockTiger> ?
<Mr_You> yeah
<Mr_You> well.. what I mean is that.. usually the one with the most market share is the best one.. ;-)  atleast as far as open source goes ;-)
<RockTiger> An people(corporations) are starting to open source their app servers too!
<RockTiger> Oh - got ya!

<RockTiger> Well, I've looked into the 'market share' thing a bit, and I don't think many people have actually gotten that far with it yet.
<Mr_You> I agree
<Mr_You> hafta wait and see
<Mr_You> all you can do is use what works in the mean time
<RockTiger> And what seems appropriate for your organization.
<Mr_You> 6,642 developers .. geez heh
<RockTiger> 6,642?
<Mr_You> thats what it says for e-speak.net under site statistics
<Mr_You> I read that the HP family doesn't want the Compaq and HP merger to happenn
<RockTiger> Read that too.
<Mr_You> sounds good to me
<RockTiger> Yeah, seems to make sense in the current market.
<RockTiger> HP is open sourcing their app server, to, according to this: http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/23/22671.html
<RockTiger> IBM just open source 40 mil buck worth of web service development tools, too.
<RockTiger> Thats what they say it cost them to develop them.
<Mr_You> yeah
<jamest> use cvs
<Mr_You> thats what I thought
<jamest> i think you can expect a release of forms, designer, and common (all at 0.1.0) before the start of next week
<jamest> and the more people testing cvs before the release the better :)
<Mr_You> sweet
<jamest> plus the cvs is far nicer than last release
<RockTiger> Can we use Forms against Postgres?
<jamest> oh yeah
<Mr_You> yeah thats 2-tier rock
<jamest> we support popy, pygresql, pypgsql, psycopg drivers for postgresql
<RockTiger> okey-dokey - will look into it.
<jamest> in cvs
<RockTiger> yep, I'll take that advice, too.
<RockTiger> I'm new to GNUe is their a GUI-based form design tool?
<jamest> yip
<jamest> designer
<RockTiger> 'is there', sorry
<jamest> the quick and dirty setup guide to gnue cvs
<RockTiger> Way cool!
<jamest> check it out
<jamest> then
<jamest> cd gnuef
<jamest> python setup.py devel
<jamest> cd ../designer
<jamest> python setup.py devel
<RockTiger> Python! yay!
<jamest> this will get you the "uninstalled"  version
<jamest> gfcvs - runs forms
<Mr_You> oh james, nov 4th has come and gone any word from madlocke?
<jamest> gfdes - runs designer
<jamest> not a peep
<jamest> i think if we don't hear anything by the weekend we'll call it a loss :(
<jamest> as 0.3.0 of forms is the UI rewrite release
<jamest> and there will not be a 0.2.0
<Mr_You> why? oh..
<jamest> so once 0.1.0 hits the wire we'll move forward
<jamest> you have cvs write?
<Mr_You> well.. I say we still make one or two more attempts to atleast get the code and look at it.. I could hack at it, or learn from it
<Mr_You> me?  heh nah
<jamest> i have and older copy that the new stuff is based upon
<jamest> it's the pre-rewrite rewrite :)
<Mr_You> cool
<jamest> but it didn't support the web interface
<Mr_You> you seen that web forms deal?
<jamest> what? where?
<Mr_You> lemme find it

<Mr_You> chilly found it
<jamest> RockTiger: while I'm thinking about it
<jamest> designer does support everything forms can do
<Mr_You> what do you think about XForms?
<jamest> mainly themaster/detail forms have to be setup by hand
<jamest> the designer can manipulate them once setup
<jamest> Mr_You: i looked once but don't recall details, lemme check it out quickly
<Mr_You> also, what widgets does Forms have now?  
<Mr_You> jamest: I like the idea of integrating audio or video with X-Forms

<dneighbo> "your new 'pirate protection' initiatives are really helping me as I am able to give a 'good' reason why my clients should pay for licenses
<jamest> "A completely unexpected yet very positive side effect of the migration involved most of my customers in-house IT quiting soon after the migration."
<jamest> "My consulting revenues have gone thru the roof!"
<dneighbo> "The best effect I have seen is that the customers are having so much trouble with the operating system, they barely call me anymore about bugs in my software.  Since your support is so poor, I get additional 'operating system' support revenue"

<psu> hi all
<psu> got an interesting e-mail 
<psu> as a result of the 1st Kernel Cousins GNUe
<nickr> theres a kc gnue?
<psu> that's a cue for someone to say "tell us about it psu..."
<nickr> oh there it is
<psu> nickr - hidden in the list across the top
<psu> not on the main list yet
<dneighbo> test about it psu
<dneighbo> please i want to know :)
<psu> aha!
<psu> e-mail from a guy in Brussles
<psu> he has persuaded a 
<psu> large private company
<psu> to GPL its HR/Payroll 
<psu> system
<psu> Are we interested?
<dneighbo> possibly
<dneighbo> we would like to talk to him
<dneighbo> the biggest problem is we want our architecture
<dneighbo> not something that is 'fixed' or 'hardcoded'
<dneighbo> BUT
<psu> agreed
<psu> shall I fwd mail to you
<dneighbo> the nice thing about such things is it gives us a base requirement
<psu> or to one of the other guys?
<dneighbo> i.e. implement the fuctionality in GNUe architecture
<psu> yes
<dneighbo> of course if he wanted to GPL it we could put under GNUe umbrella regardless if he liked
<dneighbo> send the email to info@gnue.org
<psu> also, I suppose problems 
<dneighbo> then it will go to appropriate folks
<psu> if they have used any non-free s/w 
<dneighbo> psu: yes, im leary at best about such things
<psu> to help write it.
<dneighbo> but i dont like to count things out
<psu> ok.
<psu> if it's technologically incompatible
<psu> maybe it becomes our first test for GNUe Integrator
<psu> (oops, forget I said that)
<psu> :-)
<dneighbo> why
<dneighbo> it makes some sense :)
<psu> first rule of the army & GNU -
<psu> never come up with any ideas
<nickr> Integrater?
<nickr> or
<psu> or someone will suggest you do it
<dneighbo> rofl
<psu> of course, I should be safe
<dneighbo> this is true
<psu> as IANAP (i am not a programmer)
<dneighbo> and your wonderful for volunteering to start integrator
<dneighbo> and so diligent about it too :)
<dneighbo> so when does next gnue kc come out :)
<dneighbo> weekly? monthly?
<psu> weekly
<psu> I have 80-90% of the next one written
<psu> depending how much you all talk the next two days ;-)
<psu> Monday was 137k
<psu> of log file
<psu> some excellent stuff in there, however.
<Mr_You> what is GNUe Integrator?
<Mr_You> omg you quoted me
<psu> i quote everyone
<psu> gotta spread the fame/blame/shame/whatever
<psu> AFAIK, Integrator is the module 
<Mr_You> hmm I'm not quoted, but the statement from me isn't entirely accurate, but no big deal
<psu> that allows you to integrate 
<Mr_You> Instead, he was looking to customize Interchange to provide a web shopping cart using PHP.
<psu> stuff that doesn't fit the GNUe architecture
Action: Mr_You just bein picky.
<psu> at all
<Mr_You> cool
<dneighbo> Integrator is a GNUe Tool that will allow you to merge disparate data
<psu> Mr_You - I can actually resubmit if there's anything major wrong
<dneighbo> jcater is a good example
<dneighbo> he has an existing financial (accounting) package
<psu> part of the problem with IRC is there's less context
<dneighbo> but is going to do inventory etc in GNUe
<Mr_You> psu: ehh nah, its got enough buzz words to get someone in here to ask ;-))
<psu> so I'm bound to make a serious boo-boo eventually
<dneighbo> integrator woudl allow him to configure a 'map' from one to the other
<dneighbo> and run it in batch or real time
<psu> the old fashioned way to do this
<psu> would be - 
<psu> export text file from source app
<psu> frig around with it using 
<psu> perl, SQL, COBOL (no joke), whatever
<psu> then load into target system
<psu> and hope it all works
<psu> "old fashioned" - earlier this year
<psu> in my case anyway
<Mr_You> yeah, if someone wanted to hack together Interchange and GNUe that would be a good spot for it I guess..
<dneighbo> yip that is old way :)
<Mr_You> also know as contrib 
<dneighbo> new way is 
<dneighbo> have integrator build an xml def of source a and source b
<dneighbo> visually match one field to antoher and apply rules
<dneighbo> save definitions and rules
<dneighbo> and use at will
<psu> what's will ever done to upset you?
<psu> v old joke
<psu> sorry
<dneighbo> huh?
<psu> "fire at will"
<dneighbo> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/Integrator/
<dneighbo> explains a bit
<Mr_You> psu: in regards to mdeans "new Release" is more specificly about his dcl app not GNUe, but coincidentally GNUe seems to also have a release coming
<dneighbo> dont think its teh 'final' direction we will go but its general idea
<dneighbo> psu: i think you did exceptional job for being new to gnue on the kc
<dneighbo> some minor inaccuracies like the one Mr_You is pointing out
<psu> Mr_You - I'm going to issue a "clarification" next issue 
<dneighbo> but over time i think it will iron itsefl out :)
<psu> trans. I fubared up
<dneighbo> hopefully you have been getting your notes :)
<psu> second one is much easier alredy
<dneighbo> we have been dropping them in log as we see fit
<dneighbo> BTW:
<dneighbo> i have a lot to html converter
<dneighbo> that will be very nice for you :)
<Mr_You> psu: sounds good, I would say all you need to do is add "DCL (Double Choco Latte)" to it and be done, IMO
<dneighbo> i will make it so you can also insert anchors so in teh KC you can link right to the spot in the log
<dneighbo> also it was designed to allow message drops and topic filtering
<psu> thanks dneighbo
<dneighbo> so you can do
<dneighbo> **EMAIL psu**
<dneighbo> hey do foo please, thanks -d
<dneighbo> **END EMAIL**
<dneighbo> and it would emai you that
<dneighbo> or
<psu> k()()l
<dneighbo> **GEAS**
<dneighbo> some stuff
<dneighbo> other stuff
<dneighbo> **END GEAS**
<Mr_You> psu: I may have missed it, but how long til there is a GNUe mailing list on there?
<dneighbo> and then it would create a geas.html that only had lines in all the geas tags
<psu> Mr_You - when there is actually some traffic
<dneighbo> there were issues with how to best do that
<psu> I am theoretically covering all the GNUe lists I can find 
<nickr> funy
<dneighbo> as you have cross topic stuff
<psu> as well as IRC
<dneighbo> and people forget to use topics etc
<dneighbo> which is why i gave up on it
<dneighbo> but i still have the code :)
<dneighbo> so i will play with it again
<psu> dn - part of joy or IRC is that you can start talking one thing 
<psu> and onto another 
<psu> without even realising
<dneighbo> oddly enough i hacked in my hotel room at LWCE NY last year :)
<psu> I can always retrospectively "designate" "threads" anyway
<dneighbo> i called the original file logger.py
<psu> Mr_You - there is an email thread next issue
<dneighbo> and then got childish on the plain and couldnt stop lauging at the name logger :)
<dneighbo> for those that dont know logger = childish slang for a large turd
<nickr> I thought a logger was someone who loged
<nickr> logged
<dneighbo> that too :)
<nickr> eg a lumerjack
<psu> lumbejack
<psu> & i'm OK
<psu> lumberjack even
<dneighbo> most lumber jacks do produce 'loggers', i think its the pancakes :)
<dneighbo> maybe its a redneck child thing to call big turds loggers (thusly why i thought i should clarify)
<jamest> dneighbo: you are sick
<Mr_You> Reinhard said that James Thompson had started it, "but has been mad goat raped in the middle of the development process". 
<jamest> :)
<dneighbo> psu : what were we saying about topics again?
<Mr_You> bahahah!
<psu> KC guidelines say don't swear, but don't cut other's swearing
<psu> I was only obeying guidelines
<nickr> hahaha
<Mr_You> psu: huh?  I was refering to a mailing list that would send the kc for GNUe to my mailbox
<psu> Mr_You - don't know about that 
<psu> I assume it is covered by whatever functionality 
<psu> Zack has set up for the other KCs
<psu> dn - if people can put topic markers 
<psu> in the log it would be helpful
<Mr_You> ok, I might just try a blind email, its not on the site yet
<psu> but since I need to read the whole log anyway
<psu> doesn't matter if they forget
<Mr_You> anyone decided on a format for topic markers?
<Mr_You> could be as simple as 
<Mr_You> TOPIC: Goats
<psu> "hey psu are you reading this?" 
<psu> works for me
<nickr> TOPIC: goat rape
<Mr_You> PSU: goats
<Mr_You> well, to me, it looks like the first IRC-based Kernel Cousin was a success ;-)
<ajmitch> yep
Action: Mr_You pats psu on the back.
<nickr> It does seem a little more um crazy than the list based ones
<psu> ta muchly
<nickr> But its very useful
<psu> nickr - I think that reflects the medium
<psu> the medium is the message
<nickr> Indeed
<Mr_You> it gives someone the ability to go back and read the entire conversation or some incentive to contact us to find out more
<Mr_You> its like recording meeting minutes
<Mr_You> sorta
<psu> Mr_You - very similar in fact
<psu> except at meetings not everyone talks at the same time
<psu> (oh, I don't know, though...)
<Mr_You> heh
<nickr> Meetings also tend to have fixed agendas
<nickr> TEND to
<ajmitch> meetings don't tend to discuss goats or trout
<Mr_You> TEND to ;-)  
<Mr_You> this is one long meeting heh
<nickr> one long rambling meeting with no doughnuts and lots of farmsex
<nickr> ahem
<ajmitch> heh
<psu> MOTTO!
<Mr_You> hehe
<dneighbo> i think we should after every KC release
<dneighbo> a. post the summary part as a news story with a link to the KC
<dneighbo> b. notify linuxtoday
<dneighbo> c. mail a version the discuss list
<dneighbo> this way all bases covered
<nickr> yea
<Mr_You> sounds godo
<psu> I can do all that.
<psu> AFAIK, linux today carries all KCs automagically
<psu> but I could be wrong
<Mr_You> it sure does, cause there it is! ;-)))
<dneighbo> psu: but didnt you 'submit' that KC?
<dneighbo> or was it auto done?
<Mr_You> Kernel Cousin GNUe #1 by Peter Sullivan 
<Mr_You> (Nov 6, 2001, 15:03 UTC) (1701 reads) (0 talkbacks) (Posted by mhall) 
<Mr_You> "Welcome to the first issue of KC GNUe! Thanks (I think!) to Jeff Bailey for persuading me to volunteer for this, and to Zack Brown for his help and patience in sorting out my first draft. This Cousin will cover the IRC channel for GNUe (and some mailing lists as well). For more information about the GNU Enterprise project, see their home page..." 
<Mr_You> After battling to stay alive, Eazel succumbed to market conditions, and on May 15 it closed its doors for good. If this were the world of closed-source software, this event would have been devastating to customers." 
<psu> dn - I submitted the announcement, but not the KC itself
<Mr_You> if Eazel *had* paying customers they might still exist ;-)
<Mr_You> InfoWorld must need clicks
<dneighbo> Mr_You why is that
<psu> A local firm, QSP just went under
<psu> they wrote accounting software & provided it ASP
<psu> all their clients are currently still have their servers kept running 
<psu> by the administrator
<psu> but are feeling very nervous
<psu> in  a hypothetical future
<psu> if they were using a GNUe Application Service Provider
<psu> they could switch tomorrow
<psu> even take their "special modules" 
<psu> written by the ASP 
<psu> as long as they have been GPL-ed as well
<psu> In fact, would they not have to b?
<Mr_You> dneighbo: I just don't care for the articles scenario
<Mr_You> Eazel seemed like a bad example.. 
<Mr_You> that example seems better to me
<psu> now QSP have been taken over by another firm
<Mr_You> instead they picked on open-source
<psu> guess what "mandatory upgrade" is coming next?
<dneighbo> Mr_You i agree and disagree
<psu> http://uk.biz.yahoo.com/011101/183/ce5c1.html
<dneighbo> i think nautilus is a shining example of how in free software world a good product lives even if its company dies
<psu> note to psu - continution of thread from Mon 05 Nov
<dneighbo> i think it is a bad example of customers not getting the shaft, as eazel had no customers, therefore they had no one that would have been shafted :)
<nickr> actually it freed nautilus from its bondage lsort of
<dneighbo> same if ximian died today
<Mr_You> derek: yeah.. 
<dneighbo> their software would live on im sure
<dneighbo> but i dont think they have any 'customers' in sense of word 'customer' so no one is screwed
<Mr_You> exactly
<dneighbo> both nautilus and ximian do have 'end users' that are/wouldnt be hosed if the companies folded and that is valuable information
<dneighbo> :)
<dneighbo> i think psu's sample is MORE powerful in the sense that you can say look at this REAL WORLD situation where PAYING customers are left with fate hanging in the balance
<dneighbo> IF it had been free software like ....insert package here... it could exist w/o the company (one that comes to mind outside nautilus is greatbridge (postgresql)
<dneighbo> psu: for the record i think most of GNUe developers are pretty much against the notiion of ASP's
<dneighbo> obviously one could use GNUe for an ASP, but its not something we intend to encourage much
<Mr_You> yeah.. I think thats what infoworld is probably going for (didn't read the entire article) but putting an open-source company known like Eazel might get more hits than a no name
<dneighbo> i think it was a 'positive' article really
<dneighbo> as it was trying to say even though some 'big name' linux companies are dying the software remains strong
<psu> dn - I think you're right
<psu> at least initially, orgs interested in GNUe 
<psu> will also be interested in running them itself
<dneighbo> as with demise of eazel, and linuxcare/valinux on the ropes a lot of FUD is being used saying Linux is dead look at thier 'wall street darlings'
<dneighbo> this article i think was meant to counter such FUD though possibly not in the most 'effective' manner
<Mr_You> I think software as a service will still continue to process on the local (LAN) side, but with WAN integrated with a service provider.
<psu> isn't the new GPL 3.0 meant to have something re. ASPs
<dneighbo> Mr_You i agree
<dneighbo>  i think most shops except very small ones
<dneighbo> will want something like gnue in their own control
<dneighbo> but might use it like an ASP to smaller affiliates of thiers
<dneighbo> so the home office houses 'super GNUe'
<dneighbo> and the remote offices get reduced access via web to some critical yet not as intense things
<psu> if you are sufficiently afflicted by FUD over running your own financial apps
<psu> you will probably have too much FUD to use GNUe anyway
<dneighbo> most true :)
<psu> early GNUe adopter = cluefull
<psu> typical ASP cutomer = clueless
<psu> (descriptive, not insultative)
<psu> is that a word?
<Mr_You> well I would say the adopter doesn't need so much clue, cause it will just run and run and run, the integrator will need clue
<psu> FUD is a powerful thing
<psu> comes in words like "reference sites"
<nickr> insultive seems like a useful word
<psu> "experience in the industry"
<psu> all subsitutes for working out whether your integrator/supplier knows their onions
<nickr> The Idea of ASPs seems like a good one
<nickr> if there are ratings and assurances
<dneighbo> the idea is ok
<dneighbo> the problem is 
<dneighbo> a. risk
<dneighbo> b. reality
<psu> I would find it frustrating knowing every time I wanted 
<psu> something changing, I have to renegotiate SLA
<dneighbo> most people throw b out the door but most good companies are reasonably concerned about a :)
<psu> or rely on goodwill
<psu> With in-house IT, I just need to persuade the IT director 
<psu> that what I want to do is reasonable.
<dneighbo> the most poignant example i have is
<dneighbo> if i buy package a from vendor a, he tell me upgrade or you dont get support
<psu> YES!
<dneighbo> if i really dont like his new package i can continue to use the old one and just not have support (which i probably never had anyhow)
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> if im an ASP customer
<psu> (in big, Ben-Hur title style lettering)
<dneighbo> the son of a bitch over night can upgrade me 
<dneighbo> and im screwed
<psu> dn - that's their business model, of course
<psu> economies of scale, everyone the same set up
<Mr_You> dneighbo: assuming their architecture forces that situation
<dneighbo> now granted we can have a contract that makes it so he has to warn me and i get a choice etc etc
<nickr> There's definitely the need for an infrastruture of agreements to prevent ad things like that from happening
<psu> (not telling you anything you don't know...)
<dneighbo> but now its not an ASP its simply a co-locatino that im overpaying for :)
<Mr_You> pretty much ;-0
<Mr_You> )
<dneighbo> nickr: my point being i can name like 40 situations like this
<dneighbo> and the answer is always well make a contract so you cant do that
<nickr> Indeed.
<dneighbo> and my point is that then its not an ASP
<reinhard> dneighbo: i think meanwhile microsoft can upgrade your pc over night without letting you know even without being ASP
<dneighbo> its a consulting house / software vendor / where you just choose to use their hardware :)
<psu> only if you leave it swiched on
<reinhard> psu: true :)
<dneighbo> reinhard : sadly i think that is their goal
<psu> which isn't likely with Windows
<reinhard> psu: and especially only if you have windows installed ;)
<psu> need to clear down all the memory leaks
<dneighbo> the thing is ASP's make sense for SOFTWARE VENDORS
<dneighbo> its easier to 'control' the customer
<dneighbo> you control the hardware
<dneighbo> the software versions
<dneighbo> the data
<dneighbo> etc etc etc
<Mr_You> known bugs
<psu> GNUe is intended to be the opposite of control
<dneighbo> however, 90% of all consulting jobs i have been on the NUMBER ONE complaint is the customer felt they had no control with current vendor and wanted out
<dneighbo> thats why we started GNUe
<psu> this is why free as in speech is more important than free as in beer
<dneighbo> its 'ultimate' control
<psu> for GNue
<dneighbo> psu ABSOLUTELY :)
<reinhard> psu: couldn't agree more
<dneighbo> and why most gnue developers are anti ASP, for the simple reason we feel it removes freedoms of end users most of them not 'understanding it' until its too late :)
<Mr_You> GNUe Hosting is better ;-)
<psu> actually, most medium/large finance s/w vendors
<psu> are probably above average in giving access 
<dneighbo> now im sure there will be a few gnue asp's that come around
<dneighbo> some might even be successful
<psu> not necess to source, but to info
<dneighbo> i dont doubt that there is a market for companies
<psu> not saying much, probably
<dneighbo> that really dont want to 'care' about IT at all
<psu> but there's a world of difference between 
<dneighbo> and do want someone else to control it all w/o much input
<psu> a private customisation which will break with the next upgrade
<nickr> what about a company that is basically an external IT dept?
<dneighbo> i think its a SMALL percentage though as the ASP's that are going under are quickly finding out
<psu> and just checking out & customising the "GNUe Weird & Wacky Requirements" module
<nickr> thats not considered an ASP is it?
<dneighbo> nope, thats the problem :)
<dneighbo> ASP you cant customize :)
<dneighbo> really
<dneighbo> but to each their own
<psu> that was one of teh culture shocks 
<psu> at my old company when they started selling ASP
<dneighbo> the biggest one i have gotten from companies about ASP
<psu> salesmen used to saying "yes" to everything 
<psu> & adding in the cost of the customisation
<dneighbo> is "NO FRIGGIN WAY IM PUTTING MY FINANCIALS ON A MACHINE I DONT OWN"
<psu> suddenly the ASP people were saying NO
<psu> the ultimate no-no for salesmen
<nickr> Hrm
<dneighbo> i.e. at one company, the CEO was all hot on using an ASP (from FUD)
<Mr_You> basicly all an ASP is: packaged software accessed within the web-browser eliminating the need to maintain backups or hardware
<dneighbo> we discussed what that meant and him and the account after realizing it meant putting data outside their network said 'what idiot company would do that' end quote :)
<dneighbo> Mr_You : shining example, say you use greatplains
<nickr> what about a company that manages a computer inside your company as a delivered service?
<dneighbo> which assuredly will use passport
<dneighbo> and passport was just hacked
<dneighbo> and ewallet with it
<nickr> passport is a joke
<dneighbo> now your company data is available to the world
<dneighbo> now thats not to say your 'data' isnt secure when not in an ASP but its a HELL of a lot more secure even if its not
<Mr_You> The following information was not given:
<Mr_You> oops
<dneighbo> let me give you an example
<dneighbo> you can have an insecure system
<dneighbo> but theoritically only random hacker or a competitor will try to 'crack' it
<dneighbo> probably fairly low probablility
<dneighbo> you go to a large ASP w/ say 500 customers
<dneighbo> much more likely target of a cracker
<psu> hacker sees "KICK ME" sign
<Mr_You> yes
<dneighbo> and once they have cracked the system they will have access to all 500 custom data
<psu> cracker, sorry ;-)
<dneighbo> so even if thier security is better theoritically it is being attacked more often probably by higher level of cracker :)
<Mr_You> unless an ASP does EXTREMELY thorough security audits *regularly* then you have a huge risk, which is why it should only be used for really small biz at a really cheap price
<dneighbo> also most companies only expose key data to the 'net' rarely
<dneighbo> but anyhow i think most of us are in agreement here
<psu> or for a large start-up that needs to be up next Tuesday
<psu> but then most of these are jt ventures
<psu> so one of the partners can provide financials
<dneighbo> regardless of security etc my primary knock on ASP's are they remove 'freedom' from their users which is bad IMO
<Mr_You> you could layer your arch. so that GNUe lies on the local side with isolated wan services to a service provider for additional services.. ie. a VPN
<dneighbo> Mr_You thats what we are starting to do now
<dneighbo> setting up ssl postgres as well as setting up a freeSWAN VPN
Isomer (isomer@210-54-84-189.adsl.xtra.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> and testing forms with it
<dneighbo> so you could have WAN capabilities
<dneighbo> of course when geas is ready we woudl do with geas opposed to the db
<Mr_You> cool
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise.
<Isomer> how's geas going?
<Mr_You> ssl postgres is a solution but year I'd rather use a VPN, or limited ssl web access
<Mr_You> s/year/yea/
<Mr_You> + GEAS
<nickr> you could have geas/db as a provided service?
<Mr_You> yeah, using a VPN
<Mr_You> or (eventually) do DB replication between multiple sites via VPN.. (just a guess/dream)
<nickr> ;that'd be cool
<nickr> storage provider
<nickr> if you had several then if one went out of usiness or something you'd be okay
<dneighbo> Mr_You that would be best end game for large sites
<Mr_You> thank you ;-)
<dneighbo> real time replicatoni of geas objects as well as database data
Action: Mr_You snickers.
<Mr_You> one day
<dneighbo> this way they can use local servers at locations for speed
<dneighbo> but if one node or another fails
<nickr> offsite backup in secure datahaven in a salt mine in romania?
<Mr_You> yup, and additional functionality..
<dneighbo> they have dual location instant backup for no loss in business
<Mr_You> servers consolidation will continue.. companies save money with less machines.. in the future one or two machines will have multiple virtual private servers with different services with added security
<Mr_You> gonna get some late lunch bbl

Action: Isomer must say debian's "apt" really spoils you.  trying to find all the dependancies for gnue on a rh7.1 box sigh.
<Mr_You> I feel yer pain
<nickr> apt is simply the way things should be
<Isomer> theres lots of dependanceis too
<dneighbo> Isomer surely you jest
<Isomer> :P
<Isomer> how many of the frontends work so far?
<dneighbo> attempt installing gnucash on a rh6.2 machine w/o ximian (or even with ximian) and you will understand the true meaning of 'dependency' 
<dneighbo> same goes for evolution etc etc etc
<dneighbo> to be fair to gnucash
<Isomer> try doing it from a box without X
<Isomer> and watch the dependancies climb!
<dneighbo> :)
<Isomer> perhaps you should have a page with links to all the dependancies that you are likely to need?
<nickr> perhaps you should use apt
<nickr> no-one has packaged gnue for debian yet?
<Isomer> well, this box is RH7
<Isomer> and apparently noones packaged it at all
<Isomer> unlessy ou count .tgz as a package :)
<nickr> I'm shocked and dismayed
Action: Mr_You packaged gnue for debian, but no one had any use for them, and someone is maintaining sid packages I think
<Mr_You> not sure what version of GNU
<Mr_You> e
<Isomer> ah
<Isomer> funky
<nickr> gaes 0.0.6
<nickr> but thats all I see in sid
<jamest> Isomer: frontends are currently only wxpython
<jamest> the curses one is broken
<jamest> the html one isn't in cvs
<jamest> as for the dependency page, we did start putting them in downloads
<jamest> but kinda dropped the ball and don't have them all up there :(
<jamest> also, wrt the frontends, 0.1.0 of forms will be out this week
<jamest> then the focus shifts back to the frontends
<Isomer> ahh
<Isomer> cool
<Isomer> the form designer doesn't do much? or am I being stupid?
<jamest> cvs version or release?
<jamest> which one you running?

<jamest> ah, that designer is old and is little more than framework
<Isomer> looks nice 
<jamest> you definately want the cvs stuff
<Isomer> but not overly functional :)
<jamest> we're about to release 0.1.0 of it as well
<jamest> you have access to cvs?
<jamest> also, i assume you're running on a *nix system
<jamest> is that right?
<Isomer> yeah
<Isomer> I'm on a RH7.1 box

<Isomer> the plan is to show the boss something neat, we start doing projects with it, then he pays me to code on it :)
<Isomer> keep everybody happy :)
<Mr_You> yea! ;-)
<jamest> :)
<jamest> Isomer: what you working on?
<Isomer> I work for a company that does a lot of web based projects for companies
<Isomer> ranging from ecommerce -> various business apps (eg: Timesheet, TODO etc)
<Isomer> mostly in php
<dneighbo> Isomer we had rpms at one time
<dneighbo> technically with setup.py its not hard to create, should be included with next release
<dneighbo> as for debians they are on the way
<dneighbo> geas debian exists
<Isomer> cool
<dneighbo> the rest are in development by jbailey
<dneighbo> designer even the old one tgz was VERY functional to me
<dneighbo> not intuitive at times
<dneighbo> but still very useful (for editing existing forms)
<Mr_You> what widgets does forms have right now?
<dneighbo> the cvs version is more intuitive and the BIG plus is it has WIZARDS to build forms directly from dbs
<jamest> label and text
<dneighbo> so in like 5 minutes
<jamest> :)
<Isomer> sweet :)
<dneighbo> you can have fully functional db aware unix/win32 app
<Mr_You> man
<jamest> however it has different styles of those :)
<dneighbo> label
<dneighbo> dropdown
<dneighbo> edit
<Isomer> checkbox?
<dneighbo> checkbox
<Isomer> textarea?
<dneighbo> textarea
<Mr_You> ok
<dneighbo> fake grids :
<dneighbo> :)
<Mr_You> caffeine is kickin in
<Mr_You> not good heh
<Isomer> cool!
<Mr_You> this script is frustratin me
<jamest> Isomer: most of these are variations of a <entry> widget
<jamest> gnuef has a very basic set of widgets
<Mr_You> are multiple forms within a single forms client capable?  and how about launching another forms client?
<jamest> no, yes
<jamest> wait, that's not true
<jamest> yes, yes
<Mr_You> hehe cool
<jamest> man, i hate windows
<Isomer> so you can do master/detail relationships?
<Mr_You> ok, so yes you can create menus to other forms and yes you can launch another forms client from a menu?
<jamest> Isomer: yes
<Isomer> very very sweet
<jamest> but designer form wizard doesn't support autocreation of them yet
<jamest> what i do
<jamest> create two forms in desginer
<jamest> merge them with the needed tag changes
<jamest> then use designer to fix up the layout
<Isomer> cool
<jamest> as designer itself has no problems with master/deatil only the wizzard has issues
<jamest> Mr_You: no menu alterations yet
<jamest> that's part of the UI rewrite
<jamest> Isomer: i have to leave soon
<jamest> did you get cvs ?
<Isomer> it's still CO'ing
<Isomer> I should have -z9'd it :)
<Isomer> I'm sure I can figure it out
<jamest> ok
<Isomer> thanks for your help :)
Action: Isomer looking forward to playing with this
<jamest> no problem I'll try and be on tonight
<Isomer> :)
<jamest> where are you located at?
<Isomer> ah ha! just finished the co
<Isomer> I'm in New Zealand
<Isomer> it's currently 11am
<Mr_You> TOPIC: GNUe Forms Client (preceeded)
<jamest> more NZrs!
<Mr_You> heh
<jamest> the 3 dirs of interest (at least for forms)
<jamest> gnuef
<jamest> gnue-common
<jamest> desginer
<jamest> install gnue-common first
<jamest> then forms
<jamest> then designer
<Isomer> yep
<Isomer> done that already from the tgz's
<jamest> then
<jamest> you're set :)
<Isomer> hrm
<Isomer> it wants me to upgrade python now :/
<jamest> whoops
<jamest> crap,crap,crap
<jamest> i completely forgot about that
<jamest> 0.1.0 will require python2.x
Action: Isomer might stay late tonight and upgrade to 7.2
<jamest> argh!
<Isomer> and hope that comes with python2 :)
<jamest> i must leave now
<jamest> sorry
<jamest> i'll be back later

<dtm> hehe
<dtm> chillywilly: HIDAN
<chillywilly> hey dude
<chillywilly> got your email
<dtm> yep
<dtm> gravy
<dtm> i've been reading the book of Daniel
Action: dtm removes his glasses so as to not mess em up due to the light and fire spouting from his eyes
<dtm> so how's it going
<dtm> i read somewhere that males go through monthly hormonal cycles but i have no idea what that's all about
<dtm> i dont know if it's the same time every month or why it is,etc
<dtm> what symptoms to look for
<dtm> kinda weird
<dtm> MOST UNUSUAL.
<jcater> dtm: I've read that too
<jcater> but don't recall where
<dtm> hmm!
<jcater> therefore it must be true!!
<jcater> :)
<dtm> How very queer.
<dtm> Well I'm glad for that!
<chillywilly> haha
<dtm> hey you know what's another weird biological life cycle thingie that The Man doesn't want you to know about?!!  perimenopause
<chillywilly> we have your time of the month too?
<dtm> women get it of course.
<chillywilly> er, our
<dtm> chillywilly: yeah, apparently!
<dtm> right, jcater?
<jcater> yes
<dtm> perimenopause is nutty coz it occurs from age 30-45 and is way misunderstood and misdiagnosed
<dtm> hmmm
<dtm> but it's serious.
<dtm> the reason why doctors called the removal of the uterus a hysterectomy, is because it used to be considered a cure for "hysteria"
<dtm> obviously.
<dtm> i dont know if it really works.
<dtm> maybe it does in some cases.
<dtm> i'd think it'd l;eave ya feeling kinda hollow!
<chillywilly> it is an old suoerstition
<chillywilly> superstition even

<jcater> 'sup dawg?
<jamest> hey
<jcater> found a bug
<jamest> so did I
<jcater> (from derek's form :( )
<jcater> wassat?
<jamest> modal dialog (login) choaks on windows 
<jamest> but the code is correct
<jcater> <sigh>
<jamest> i locks on the 2nd call to ShowModal()
<jamest> i have workarround
<jamest> what's your bug
<jcater> master/detail
<jamest> ARGH!
<jcater> in forms, if you create a new record in a master block
<jcater> it automatically creates a new record in detail block
<jcater> but when you commit
<jamest> that seems right
<jcater> it then fills in the primary key in the master
<jcater> and commits the master
<jcater> then commits the detail
<jcater> (without first setting the detail's foreign key)
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> you working on a fix?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> BUT
<jcater> one caveat
<jcater> you need to use a pre-commit (or pre-insert, or whatever it's called) trigger to populate the master's primary key
<jcater> not a postgresql automatic incremented field
<jcater> or forms won't know what the key is
<jamest> ?
<jcater> in derek's example, 
<jamest> the pygresql driver requeried automattically
<jamest> so the primary key was available
<jcater> oh, it does
<chillywilly> wtf is a foreign key?
<chillywilly> I mena like where do you usually use one?
<jamest> it's a key that's only allowed in the db with a proper work visa
Nick change: mdean-[codeSlave] -> mdean
<jamest> lets say you have a db called states
<jamest>   state_code char(2)
<jamest>   description varchar(30)
<jamest> then in your customer db
<chillywilly> oh, ok
<jamest>   you have a state_code field that is a foreign key
<jamest> crappy example but the idea is there

<dtm> :)
<dtm> chillywilly: yeah and you said more than that :)
<chillywilly> well dude if we had mono and dotgnu cooperation then maybe I wuld think more highly of miguel
<chillywilly> but when he uses the glibc release notes to take a shot at RMS and uses it to justify being a code nazi he can kiss my butt
<mdean> you don't want mono
<dtm> i acknowledge that there may be reasons to not be entirely appreciative of ximian's/miguel's efforts :/
<dtm> chillywilly: yeah
<dtm> mdean: yeah i thought i was pregnant once for a whole year
<dtm> turned out it was mono

<chillywilly> er?

<Isomer> nah
<Isomer> I need to upgrade python
<Isomer> and I think thats going to take a while :)
<Isomer> so I won't do that on work hours :)
<jamest> sorry about that
<chillywilly> they just uploaded 2.1.1 into debian sid
<Isomer> np :)
<jamest> we debated it a while but 1.5.2 was making us kludge things a little too much
<Isomer> I find it mildly amusing that NEWS says that the forms developer now works better with 1.5.2 :)
<Isomer> yeah
<Isomer> I can completely understand :)
<Isomer> python2's much nicer
<Isomer> I'll upgrade this box this evening
<Isomer> I hope RH7.2 has python2
<jamest> i'm not sure
<Isomer> otherwise I'll have to do it at home
<jcater> yes it does
<jcater> BUT
<jcater> it's a python2*.rpm
<jcater> iow it comes with the distro

<jamest> anyone have a win32 machine handy 
<jamest> with gnuef dependencies installed?
<jamest> preferably not win98
<jcater> sorry
<jamest> bummer
<jamest> what you going about the key thing
<Isomer> master detail's a bitch to implement :)
<Isomer> always is :)
<Isomer> everything always ends up with the wrong key :)
<jcater> the child result sets are pulling their foreign keys from the master result set during their post
<jamest> they did that before didn't they?
<Isomer> let me guess: at that point the master doesn't have it's key yet on an insert?
<jcater> only if the master is new as well
<jcater> if the master was an existing record, it worked fine
<jamest> man , know pygresql updated it's fields
<jamest> and I'm supprized that is not part of DB API 2.0
<jcater> I've honestly never seen anything like that until pygresql
ToyMan (Stuart@c5300-3-ip141.albany.thebiz.net) left irc: Client Exiting
<jcater> although I wish all did :)
<Isomer> what does postgres do?
<Isomer> and besides, you've got to handle completely broken db's like mysql that wouldn't know a foriegn key if a million fell on them
<jamest> Isomer: mysql basher eh? I think you'll fit in well here :)
<Isomer> heh
<jamest> we drove away all the mysql lovers 
<jcater> Isomer: we are talking foreign keys in principle; not necessarily DB-enforced foreign keys
<Isomer> rofl
<Isomer> yeah, but you said something about postgres updating itself?
<jamest> the pygresql driver IIRC updated it's fields after a commit
<jamest> so that a row commit would return the row
ToyMan (Stuart@c5300-3-ip141.albany.thebiz.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> that way any foriegn keys, fields updated by db triggers, etc were reflected in the data right away
<jamest> IIRC I used that feature in the old db drivers so that I could get OIDs
<jamest> on newly inserted rows
<Isomer> cool
<jamest> but we've grow to dislike pygresql a bit I'm afraid 
<jamest> grow = grown
<Isomer> oh?
<Isomer> why is that?
<jamest> it's buggy
<jamest> and some are long standing bugs
<Isomer> such as?
<jcater> well, the real issue is there's a Python DB API we wanna use.. Pygresql itself has its own API, but wrote a wrapper around its API to support the standard
<Isomer> we use it on undernet
<Isomer> and we *Really* give it a huge thrashing
<jamest> the fetchOne on the DB API 2.0 does not work
<jcater> IIRC pygresql works fine (using it's home-grown interface)
<jamest> a patch was submitted long ago but they won't, don't fix it
<jcater> but it's DB-API wrapper just plain sux
<Isomer> ahh ok
<jamest> yes, the custom API was what I used at first too
<Isomer> our biggest problem with it is that you need to vacuum it regularly
<Isomer> and when you do it brings the entire thing to a halt
<Isomer> and when we've got realtime constraints
<Isomer> it's pretty harsh :)
<jamest> i didn't think 7.1 did that anymore
<Isomer> It may not lock the entire database
<jamest> or is it 7.2 cvs that has that fixed now
<Isomer> but it locks too much :)
<Isomer> so, what other db's are there if you disqualify mysql and postgres is buggy?
<jcater> open source/free?
<Isomer> theres no point using something otherwise :P
<jcater> well, there's SAP-DB... never used it so can't comment
<jcater> also, is it interbase that has a OSS version?
<Isomer> interbase and sybase I thought were both OSS'd
<jcater> is sybase OSS?
<mdean> nope - but their first Linux version is free
<Isomer> ahh
<Isomer> they're abusing the word Free

<chillywilly> heheh
<jamest> it was a known bug we were told to not worry about

<jamest> i'm not too worried about pygresql issues anymore
<jamest> btw - jcater
<mdean> jcater: yes
<jamest> sqlrelay driver was donated?
<mdean> jcater: and it only supports 5 concurrent connections
<jcater> jamest: yeah, by me
<mdean> tho they don't mention that fact when you dl it
<jcater> I was using it in house for testing a few months ago
<jamest> and?
<jamest> fell in love with it did you?
<jcater> and realized yesterday that I hadn't put in CVS
<jcater> it's ok
<jamest> pwd
<jcater> I was using it as a replacement for ODBC
<jcater> believe it or not :)
<jcater> cause at the time I couldn't find Oracle-python drivers for Windows
<jcater> but now, both DCOracle and cxOracle have win32-compatable python drivers
<jcater> BUT
<jcater> since it'd already been written, why not commit it :)
<jamest> :)
<jcater> actually, someone was asking about SQLRelay last week
<jcater> out of the blue
<jcater> kinda odd
<jamest> i'm all for it!
<jamest> i hate seeing tools that only support 1 db 1 ui
<jamest> that doesn't tourture the coders enough
<jcater> :)
<jcater> well, I've decided to convert to debian
<jcater> can you install it via FTP?
<jamest> ?
<jamest> i think so
<jamest> but why?
<jcater> cause I don't have a CD handy
<jamest> think it faster than http?
<jamest> ah
<jamest> you can install lots o ways
<jamest> you'll probably need the root and rescue floppy images
<jamest> why the change?
<jcater> I'm gonna get plex86 working
<jamest> and debian helps in what way?
<jcater> it's in sid now
<jamest> no rpms?
<jcater> uh, no
<jcater> it's highly experimental
<jamest> i wouldn't wish sid upon you
<jamest> as is sid
<jamest> is your laptop still debian?
<jcater> oh, yeah
<chillywilly> oh plz
<jcater> I suppose I could test on that :)
<chillywilly> sid is fine

<jcater> do we really need to support master/derail????
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> derail?
<chillywilly> hehe
<Isomer> rofl
<jcater> well, that's appropriate for now :)
<jamest> jcater: that was one of the driving factors for the db rewrite if you recall
<jamest> better master/detail support
<jcater> oh, yeah

<chillywilly> doh!
<jcater> what was I smokin?
<Isomer> dunno, but it sounds like some real good stuff!
<jcater> it is better, right?
<jcater> right?
<jamest> may

<jcater> DOS
<jamest> mac os
<jcater> really?
<jcater> wait
<chillywilly> jcater: what would you parallelize?
<jcater> doesn't wxwindows run under its own "thread"
<jamest> older mac oses were not even multi-tasking
<jcater> jamest: good point
<Isomer> newer ones probably aren't either :)
<jcater> note that this would not break designer
<jcater> only the realtime run/debugging
<jamest> that is ok with me
<chillywilly> mac os x uses freebsd on Mach
<chillywilly> it has to have threads
<chillywilly> mach is multi-threaded
<chillywilly> it at least has cthreads
<chillywilly> but I have a feeling since glibc is ont here you get pthreads too
<jamest> can someone test new gnuef login code

<jcater> Isomer: I dunno
<Isomer> MS gets thrashed over their reliability or lack thereof

Action: jamest just found his win32 beta tester
<jamest> I'd test it at work more, but see, um, i have a real OS on my desktop
Action: jamest hides
<jcater> argh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<jamest> that good?
<jcater> I've been beating my head against my Trinitron over this master/detail insert statement crap
<jcater> just to finally realize it's another bug in another part of GDataObjects
<jcater> GDataObjects isn't automatically "binding"
<jcater> fields specified in masterfields or detailfields
<jamest> you mean your 21 inch Trinitron?
<jcater> yes
<jamest> you shouldn't treat it like that
<jcater> it's a rock solid monitor
<jcater> I wouldn't worry
<jamest> you'd better just send it to me until you can learn to treat it with respect
<jcater> lol
<jcater> my mom's gonna be upset with me
<jcater> I was supposed to order one of these for her
<jcater> but egghead went bankrupt before I got around to it
<jcater> I haven't told her yet
<jcater> :(
<jamest> anyone recall how to redirect dos stderr to a file?
<jamest> oh my
<jcater> I don't think you can
<jamest> you have to download a utility to do it
<jamest> un fscking believable
<jcater> where's masta???
<jcater> I want to tell him just how much grief his form is!!
Action: mdean is away: I'm busy
Action: mdean is back (gone 00:00:02)
Action: mdean is fast
<Isomer> <rant target="mysql">
<Isomer> auto increments should be rather simple things to get right
<Isomer> and NULL and 0 are completely different concepts
<jcater> oh, yeah
<jcater> definitely
<Isomer> you'd think a relational database could figure that out
<Isomer> but NOOOOOOO
<mdean> mysql is not a relational database
<Isomer> insert 0 into an auto increment field and what happens?
<Isomer> you get some other number *instead* of 0!
<Isomer> but wait, theres more
<mdean> I like how it reuses deleted numbers
<Isomer> if you insert a negative number into that field
<jcater> mdean: really?
<Isomer> it can nolonger create any more autonumbers
<mdean> jcater: it does, but I don't like it
<mdean> Isomer: hehe - nice feature
<Isomer> because the next one it generates will be MAXINT
<jcater> mdean: neither would I
<Isomer> and the one after that will *also* be MAXINT
<Isomer> even if 0..MAXINT is *empty*
<Isomer> but wait! 
<Isomer> it gets better
<Isomer> you can insert a value in then UPDATE it to 0
<Isomer> but never insert
Action: Isomer slams my head against something hard and brick like
<Isomer> </end of rant>
<Isomer> mdean: mysql *thinks* it's a relational db
<mdean> how about it's handling of the timestamp data type?
<Isomer> even though it wouldn't know relational if it was married to it
<mdean> insert a null into it, it populates with the current date/time
<mdean> if you have multiple timestamps in a table and do not specify them in an insert/update query, guess what it does?
<jcater> HALLELUAH!!!!
<mdean> populates the *first* timestamp with current date/time
<mdean> and leaves the rest alone
<jcater> finally got the damn thing working!!!
<Isomer> mdean: it does that with DATETIME's too
<mdean> very very annoying
<mdean> when I say NULL, I mean *NULL* dammit!
<Isomer> I find autonumbers even more entertaining
<Isomer> since it appears to confuse NULL with 0
<Isomer> which really is a fundamental problem 
<jamest> knows whats even worse than that?
<mdean> yes
<jcater> sigh
<Isomer> jamest: the fact that they documents these as features?
<jcater> jamest: are my TriggerExtensions no longer implemented in trigger namespaces?
<jamest>   people actually build business apps with mysql and can't figure out why some of us have issues with that
<jamest> jcater: no, they were causing a namespace collision of some sort
<Isomer> jamest: I'm employeed to do that
<Isomer> but we've convinced them to migrate to postgres
<jcater> ah, ok
<jamest> I think I documented it in the cvs log
<jamest> Isomer: you poor, poor person
Action: jamest loathes mysql
<Isomer> I loath it too
<Isomer> I tend to do "other things"
<mdean> hey, it's OK that you have to lock the entire table for writing
Action: jcater was brought up on Oracle, so he is still learning to deal w/postgresql even :)
<mdean> pg has a lot of similarities to Erkle
<Isomer> mdean: they're fine grained enough to do entire table locks?
Action: Isomer is amazed at how advanced their getting this day
<mdean> Isomer: what?  you need more?
<Isomer> s/this day/these days/
<mdean> actually, a co worker pointed me to http://www.innodb.com/ today
<jamest> jcater: :)
<Isomer> noone would require anything more fine grained than locking the entire machine
<jamest> so you get it all fixed up jcater?
<jcater> yes and no
<jcater> yes master/detail works right
<jamest> however?
<jcater> but no it doesn't auto-repopulate the recordset, so derek's form isn't quite working right :)
<jamest> (entering data is broken :)
<Isomer> bah, who would want to enter data?
Action: jamest can't believe he's installing cygwin so he can have a real size terminal window w/ stderr support
<jcater> rofl
Action: jcater pities you
<jamest> Isomer: where you working btw?
<Isomer> Business Systems Developments
<jcater> jamest: do you know if the pre-commit triggers are actually getting called correctly?
<jamest> Isomer: and more importantly is your name Andrew?
<Isomer> Nope
<jcater> roflmao
<mdean> BSD!
<jamest> jcater: not a clue
<jcater> sigh
Action: jcater doesn't like masta's form too much
<jcater> making me think
<jamest> Isomer: i think 75% of the NZr's I know are named Andr(u|ew)
Action: jcater may have to use some trigger voodoo
<Isomer> ahh
<jamest> jcater: is this the form w/ all the buttons?
<jcater> yes
Action: Isomer is a "Perry"
<jamest> IIRC he wrote this while at Axis
<Isomer> just to make life interesting
<jamest> and it was a pita then too
<jcater> jamest: it actually works, except that he's using an autoincrement field
<jamest> jcater: that's broken!
<jamest> argh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Action: jamest does a panic dash in a circle
<jamest> er, um
Action: Isomer recommends chairs that spin around to jamest, much faster
<jcater> <sigh>
<jcater> don't be so melodramatic
<Isomer> although you tend to bash your knees occasionly
<jamest> lol
<jamest> jcater: anything I can do to help
<jcater> valium?
<jcater> prozac?
<Isomer> 15 minutes for this python rpm
<jcater> I dunno
<Isomer> sigh
<jamest> as I, er, um, promised a windows user they'd have their form tomorrow
<jcater> what d'ya got
<jcater> um
<jcater> what do they need?
<jamest> i didn't write the form so I don't know
<jcater> it to work?
<jamest> but we use autoincrements alot
<jamest> so I imagine i'll get bit
<jcater> do you use it for foreign keys?
<jamest> typically
<jcater> <sigh>
[22:26] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<jcater> (that's a double-sigh)
<jamest> i don't know on this specific form
<jamest> as my assistant wrote it
<jcater> lemme see if I can repopulate the records fairly easily
<jamest> but I do know my school contact database uses autoincrements alot
Action: jcater sees 0.1.0 slowly drifting further into the future
<jamest> dude, I swore I tested this after SF
<Isomer> SF?
<jamest> and didn't have an issue
<jcater> maybe I'm on crack
<jcater> you have something to test against?
<jamest> San Fransisco
<Isomer> ah
<Isomer> do you guys have a test suite to do automated testing?
<jcater> rofl
<jamest> Isomer: it's called "Derek"
<jcater> Isomer: yeah, it's called derek
<Isomer> rofl
<Isomer> x2
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<jamest> damn thing works too well
<chillywilly> I calculated everything and I am $60,000 in debt woohoo!
<jcater> chillywilly: dang boy
<jamest> jcater: I'll modify the states.gfd demo real quick
<jcater> chillywilly: college tuition?
<jamest> those 1-900 numbers really sneak up on you don't they?
<chillywilly> yep + credit cards and other misc. loans
<jcater> rofl
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> $60,000
<jcater> that or he has a secret SAP addiction
<chillywilly> plus I owe my mom lots of money
<Isomer> thats nasty
<chillywilly> how much debt you got jc?
Action: jcater is getting close to debt free
<jcater> except my mortgage
<jcater> but it took 4 long, long years
<jcater> of sack lunches
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> heheh
Action: jcater got a little too credit card happy in the beginning of his marriage
<jcater> but, haven't used one of those for 2 1/2 years now
<jamest> gack
<chillywilly> how debt did you have then?
<jamest> let me get demo from work
<jcater> chillywilly: about 1/3 of what you had... but I was able to pay for college as I went, so no student loans
<jcater> mine was pure, unadulterated (no excuse) debt
<chillywilly> state college?
<jcater> yes
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> that's cheap
<chillywilly> :P
<jcater> I went to a private college one year
<jamest> plus, his being an AI help, he was able to sell spare cycles to SETI users 
<jcater> it was really great
<jcater> but I couldn't afford it
<jcater> so transferred to state
<jamest> i hated private school
<jamest> had full ride there too
<jamest> felt like high school all over again
<chillywilly> well I think someone should've kicked me in the head when I was thinking about MSOE
<Isomer> MSOE?
<chillywilly> Milwaukee School of Engineering
<chillywilly> not M$
<chillywilly> damnit
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> http://www.msoe.edu
<jamest> jcater: hey!
<jamest> i think I dodged the bullet
<jcater> howdy hey
<jamest> looking for an example
<jcater> how so?
<Isomer> Must Spend Outragously and Extravagently? 
<chillywilly> something like that
<chillywilly> I don;t even have th engineering job to show for it
<chillywilly> yay!
lambert (lambert@r-201.168.alltel.net) left irc: Ping timeout for lambert[r-201.168.alltel.net]
<jamest> I'm not finding any entry screens that require the key in a detail
<chillywilly> a total an utter waste of my time
<Isomer> 5 minutes left on python2
<Isomer> but did you enjoy it?
<jcater> jamest: how are your details working then?
<jamest> they all reference data entered on other screens
<jamest> so I may autogenerate a id for a contact
<jcater> so they are lookup/maintain only; not creation
<jamest> right
<jamest> the creation forms are not master/detail
Action: jamest does a happy dance
<jcater> yay
Action: Isomer hands out party hats and turns the music up
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> your approach probably doesn't have the limitations that mine did
<Isomer> when I wrote something similar
<Isomer> it was all revolving around built up SQL statements
<jcater> Isomer: we don't even require an SQL backend :)
<Isomer> yeah
<Isomer> well I had problems when you tried to do updates on multiple tables
<Isomer> particularly if you were updating a foreign key
<ajmitch> evening all ;)
<Isomer> how goes the study?
<chillywilly> 750,00 lines of code for evolution
<ajmitch> like crap
<chillywilly> er, 750,000
<ajmitch> not many
<ajmitch> GNUe gone over 10M yet? ;)
<jcater> ajmitch: well, that's about how many tylenol's we've gone thru
<ajmitch> hehe
<Isomer> heh
<Isomer> at work we can put materials down with jobs
<Isomer> so we've got it configured to say how much coffee, water, beer, sanity, pizza the job required
<chillywilly> heheh
<Isomer> our clients got confused when we billed them for 10% sanity
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> i like it ;)
<ajmitch> Isomer: so you're out working now, and hopefully with GNUe?
<Isomer> I'm at work trying to get python2 installed so I can get GNUe working
<Isomer> so I can give the boss a resonably convincing demo
<ajmitch> hehe, fun
<Isomer> so I can convince him to try and pay me to work on it during work hours :)
Action: ajmitch suggests apt-get install python2
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> Isomer: where do you work?
<derek> yikes lots of back log to read
<chillywilly> ello masta
<jamest> i'll hold his legs, jcater you get the ants
<ajmitch> derek: yeah, i just spent a few min reading thru what;s happened in the last few hours ;)
<derek> hello
<Isomer> chillywilly: Business Systems Developments (obscurely enough a company that does Business Apps under Linux)
<derek> jamest: i didnt know you were so kinky
<chillywilly> plz shoot me so i can get out of debt with the life insurance money ;)
<Isomer> heh
<jamest> gotta love cygwin
<jcater> chillywilly: two words
<jcater> junk bonds
<jcater> j/k
<jamest> it's happily installing cvs when I requested bash
Action: chillywilly has a big fat policy...my grandma started it since I was a baby
<Isomer> that was nice of her
<chillywilly> I am worht more dead anyway
<ajmitch> hehe
<Isomer> rpm -i python2-2.1.1-2.i386.rpm

<Isomer> sigh
<Isomer> this is going to take a while
<chillywilly> gah
<chillywilly> that's why I hate rpm
<Isomer> gimmy apt anyday
<chillywilly> fucking grab those damn packages for me!!!
<Isomer> apt-get install gnue
<Isomer> and we'd be done by now
<chillywilly> apt-get install geas
<chillywilly> works
<ajmitch> pity there's no gnue virtual package
<ajmitch> that has dependendics on gnue-forms, gnue-geas, etc
<ajmitch> who want to be the official packager? ;)
<chillywilly> jbailey is
<chillywilly> silly
<chillywilly> ;)
<derek> damn
<derek> skimmed the log now its already full again 
<chillywilly> he's our official debian bitch
<derek> sigh no chance in catching up tonight
<ajmitch> he is? where are packages? me wants packages in sid now!
<derek> Isomer: do yourself a favor
<jcater> derek: the first part of it was us bitching at you and your form
<derek> compile python from source
<derek> it gets rid of redhat stupid ass dependencies
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> now thats a plan
<jamest> the 2nd part was us bitching just about you
<ajmitch> hehe
<derek> believe me im on rh6.2 on my laptop
<derek> and it has made my life SOOOOOOOOOO much easier going to source for things
<derek> all of gnue dependencies are source for me and i didnt have to upgrade 'anything but the dependencies'
<Isomer> I should upgrade this poor box to 7.2 anyway
<derek> i.e. i just got python, wx, etc etc
<derek> yeah install debian :)
<ajmitch> just go debian :)
<Isomer> can't
<Isomer> we tried that
<Isomer> it makes things real ugly
<ajmitch> oh?
<derek> btw: jcater i see my work is done and i have given you sufficent hell in a single bug report
<Isomer> we've got shared /home 
<ajmitch> debian != ugly
<Isomer> so you end up with things not working on some machines
<ajmitch> ugh
<jcater> derek: three independent bugs from that one bug report!!!!
<jamest> derek: isn't this the form from hell you tourtured me with when you wre in CA?
<derek> rofl
<derek> jamest: me torture forms developers?
<jamest> if so you managed it get a ton of milage out of it
<derek> unheard of. pure blasephmy
<jcater> derek: as opposed to co-dependent bugs :)
<derek> jamest: yes same form :)
<derek> it really is a ball buster
<ajmitch> sounds useful then ;)
<Isomer> we should automate it's testing cycle
<Isomer> :)
<jcater> derek: it works now
<jcater> except for one small detail
<jcater> (i.e., you can't create new people :)
<Isomer> reproduction is overrated
<jcater> but you can create all the new addresses for the existing people that you want
<jcater> actually, that's not entirely true
<jcater> you can create a new person, 
<jcater> you just can't associate an address with them until a later session
<jcater> still working on that though
<Isomer> later session?
<Isomer> or until after they've been committed?
<jcater> the latter
<jcater> kinda sorta
<Isomer> rofl
<jamest> you'd have to commit
<jamest> requery 
<jamest> then add
<derek> :)
<jamest> if I understand correctly
<derek> btw: how you guys like the nice
<derek> ditch gnue come work on compiere post to the list
<jamest> ?
<derek> i have no problem with people doing this but doing it in mass is some what tacky
<ajmitch> derek: heh, yeah
<ajmitch> just read that 30sec ago
<derek> generally if i see someone post a message and someonthing liek that to say i email them personally off list
<derek> but oh well
<jcater> ??
<derek> question is do i respond in whole or in part?
<derek> or ignore
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> depoends
<jcater> are the paying?
<derek> i havent installed compiere so i cant speak too much to it
<ajmitch> he's basically expecting gnue developers to drop all gnue coding & join compoere
<jcater> :)
<derek> but i can say mpl is not best of licenses for MOST developers
<derek> that having to have oracle knocks out most of the rest
<derek> and fact its all java kills another whole group
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> you have to have oracle?
<derek> i assume its rather hard coded stuff with tables to enter variable information (which i think is the OLD way of doing things)
<derek> question is do we respond at all or not
<derek> im firm believer of the best will crawl to the top
<ajmitch> i think maybe respond
<derek> and that there is room for more than one ERP
<Isomer> forced unsub? 
<jamest> re: Kator
<jamest> Oh Yeah!  Well, we'll take our python and go home!
<ajmitch> heh
<Isomer> shrug, multiple competing products are a good idea
<Isomer> look at irc servers :)
<derek> jamest: rofl
<jamest> Isomer: we'd never force unsub
<jamest> especially since I lost the list admin password :)
<Isomer> jamest: yeah, I was only kidding 
<Isomer> rofl!
<ajmitch> Isomer: you have some experience with irc servers... ;)
<Isomer> ajmitch: speak of what you're knowledgable:)
<ajmitch> ;)
<ajmitch> you still maintainer?
<Isomer> currently yes
<ajmitch> ok
<Isomer> we're working on 2.10.11
<Isomer> currently it's having fun desyncing the network
<ajmitch> cool
<ajmitch> sounds like lotsa fun ;)
Action: Isomer thinks coz one of the other coders attempts at desync "repair" went a little too far
<ajmitch> i guess it has to be able to handle high irc loads
<Isomer> I wonder what our peak load of a server is
<ajmitch> with script kiddies flooding, probably quite high ;)
<Isomer> well
<Isomer> we've had 12,000 clients on one server
<Isomer> probably more
<Isomer> -Paris.Fr.Eu.Undernet.Org- Highest connection count: 14948 (14947 clients)
<Isomer> hmm
<ajmitch> quite a few
<Isomer> 15k
<Isomer> most OS's really don't like that many open tcp connections
<ajmitch> what do you run it on?
<Isomer> usually FreeBSD's
<ajmitch> not GNU/Hurd, i bet ;)
<Isomer> although we've got them ranging from solaris through linux to various BSD's
<ajmitch> since it still needs that pfinet rewrite ;)
<Isomer> yah
<Isomer> been looking at zebra
<Isomer> which says it wants to be the routing table translator
<ajmitch> ok
Action: Isomer and a few friends got bored one day
<Isomer> and created ourselves a mini internet
<ajmitch> useful
<Isomer> so we've been teaching ourselves dynamic routing :)
<Isomer> do you have a masquareded network?
<ajmitch> yep, all of two computers at the moment
<Isomer> heh
<ajmitch> getting another one (p133) on saturday
<Isomer> what we do is run software on the gateway that connects to everyone elses gateway machine
<Isomer> via a VPN
<Isomer> then run a dynamic routing protocol over it
<ajmitch> so once i got another monitor or two, i'll have a hurd box to play on ;)
<Isomer> cool
<Isomer> I should turn one our boxen at home to hurd
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> i've got to get install cds, too slow downloading it all
<Isomer> we've got like 12 machines at the flat
<Isomer> I don't think the flatmates will notice another one
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> how many flatmates?
Action: Isomer + 2 more + 1
<Isomer> for a total of 4
<ajmitch> from sunday i'll be flatting, there'll only be 2 of us until february
<ajmitch> we'll only have about 5 machines
<Isomer> we started with like 3
<Isomer> and ran out of ports on the 8 port switch
<ajmitch> yeah, i'm starting with 3 as well :)
<Isomer> and I'm worried that we're going to fill up the 8 port hub
<ajmitch> you're in hamilton, right?
<Isomer> yep
<ajmitch> what's your power bill like there? :)
<Isomer> dunno
<Isomer> I should check
<ajmitch> would be reasonably high with 12 machines
<Isomer> the dec alpha was chewing power like there was no tomorrow :)
<Isomer> t'was fun to play with
<Isomer> hmm
<ajmitch> psu will have fun summarising this thread, entirely off-topic ;)
<Isomer> :)
<Isomer> he's going to have a fun day today :)
<ajmitch> hehe
Action: Isomer has been off topic all day :)
<ajmitch> i should see if i can get my boss interested in GNUe ;)
<ajmitch> would be interesting
<ajmitch> give me a chance to play with it :)
<Isomer> yeah
<Isomer> :)
<ajmitch> sorta what you're trying to do?
<Isomer> yeah
<Isomer> well, theres nothing better than being paid to hack on OSS :)
<jcater> sure... being paid to do absolutely nothing :)
<Isomer> doing absolutely nothing can be boring
<Isomer> coding's more fun
<ajmitch> yeah
<derek> poop did my connectino die?
<ajmitch> dunno
<chillywilly> derek: nice response on the mailing list :)
<chillywilly> freaking java weenies
<chillywilly> that's what both those projects are
<chillywilly> and that one is only semi-free
<chillywilly> if you can call it that
<Isomer> semifree?
<chillywilly> you have to use prop. tools
<ajmitch> good response, derek :)
<ajmitch> oracle... ugh
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> not many people happen to have oracle lying about
Action: Isomer ponders
<ajmitch> postgres is more common
<chillywilly> who wants to haveit lygin about anyway?
<Isomer> doesn't java have jODBC or something?
<ajmitch> "One main differentiation is that complex software like ERP requires additional licenses. For Compiere the following licenses are required:
<ajmitch>     * Database (Oracle 8i)
<ajmitch>     * Reporting (InetSoft)
<ajmitch>     * Rule Engine (ILOG)
<ajmitch> "
<chillywilly> we are defintely not Java fans
<chillywilly> gah
<chillywilly> that is haf assed
<chillywilly> they don't even deserve to use the term Open Source
<chillywilly> ;P
<Mr_You> phpnuke has multiple db support now, so it says
<ajmitch> they use the term free software actually
<chillywilly> much less Free Software
<chillywilly> Mr_You: really?
<chillywilly> kewl
<Mr_You> http://phpnuke.org/downloads.php
<chillywilly> cause it has been a mysql whore for a while now
<ajmitch> you don't like mysql, i take it
<ajmitch> just what is so bad about it? ;)
<chillywilly> ajmitch: I am not alone
Action: ajmitch doesn't know the differences
<chillywilly> no transaction support
<chillywilly> no sub selects
<chillywilly> not very SQL compliant
<chillywilly> admin tools suck too, imho
<Isomer> ajmitch: scroll back
<Isomer> chillywilly: phpmyadmin imho is very very nice
<ajmitch> Isomer: how far?
<Mr_You> there's also a webmin module for SquidGuard ;-)
<ajmitch> Isomer: there is phppgadmin
<Mr_You> in case anyone uses that.. web interface to http blocker
<Isomer> ajmitch: yeah there is, however phpmyadmin has a certain "polish" to it IMHO :)
<chillywilly> mysql is a toy db
<chillywilly> just admit it
<Isomer> on the other hand, it's a nice admin tool to a horrible program :)
<Isomer> toy would be overrating it?
<Isomer> ajmitch: grab back for "<rant "
