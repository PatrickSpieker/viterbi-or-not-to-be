<derek> hello jwserra
jwserra (jwserra@195.174.196.145) left irc: using sirc version 2.211+4KSIRC/1.1
<Isomer> goodbye jwserra
<ajmitch> hmm
<derek> hah
<ajmitch> probably got scared of all the conversation ;)
<jcater> any postgresql freaks out here know how to return the current system date/time???
<Mr_You> usually done within the programming language AFAIK
<derek> date()
<derek> er sorry
<derek> TIMESTAMP
<derek> i think is the function
<jcater> hmm
<derek>  $result = pg_exec ("INSERT INTO client (email, password, created_on)  values ('$email','$hashpwd',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)");
<derek> for example
<derek> CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
<derek> will give you what you need i think
<jcater> yes
<jcater> thanks
<Mr_You> sweet.. someone wants me to call about an SA job
<Mr_You> actually I dunno which job this ones about
<chillywilly> kewl
<Isomer> jobs are always usefu
Isomer (isomer@210-54-84-189.adsl.xtra.co.nz) left irc: $HOME sweet $HOME
Action: chillywilly should file bankruptcy :P
Action: chillywilly just saw a commercial about that
<jcater> chillywilly: IIRC, student loans are exempt from bankruptcy claims
<chillywilly> I know
<chillywilly> but those aren't the ones I wanna get rid of
<chillywilly> :D
<jcater> oh
<jcater> ok
<chillywilly> I am not going to do that though
<ajmitch> heh
<derek> money doesnt grow on trees?
Action: derek could be in trouble here
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> what's a short word
<jcater> for "unsupported"
<jcater> or "nonstandard"
<chillywilly> how much debt you got masta?
<jcater> a lot
<jcater> he owes me a lot for this damn form
<derek> rofl
<derek> house and two cars is all debt i currently carry
<Mr_You> this one guy finally created Virtual Private Servers for Linux.. no one has bothered porting the freebsd jail function yet, probably because its being redone in v5.x
<Mr_You> actually verio and maybe a few might have done it, but no source code released
<Mr_You> not the same as user-mode linux kernel
<Mr_You> he (and I) were surprised someone hadn't ported this to linux yet because it is pretty revolutionary.. he gave one example where they had this old Pentium Classic RH 5.2 box that barely anyone used but they didn't want to get rid of it, so they just moved the file system over and started the services within the VPS and got rid of the machine
<Mr_You> the benefit is that all VPSs can share all resources of the entire machine instead of dedicating RAM and sometimes CPU to a single "VPS"
<Mr_You> s/a single/each/
<chillywilly> derek: you have no credit cards?
<chillywilly> I hate credit cards
<chillywilly> I cut all of mine up
<Mr_You> http://www.solucorp.qc.ca/miscprj/s_context.hc
<Mr_You> chilly: you need atleast one, and its good to have two just in case one doesn't work ;-)
<chillywilly> no way dude
<chillywilly> I have like no credit left on any of them
<derek> chillywilly: i have them
<chillywilly> well maybe one
<Mr_You> oh
<derek> and i use them but i pay them off every month
<chillywilly> but I will not use any of them anymore
<Mr_You> I'm almost out of debt
<chillywilly> they are just debts
<derek> i have one that my broadband gets charged to automatically monthly
<chillywilly> ok
<derek> and the then i have one i make all online purchases w/ as i wont use my debit card on the net
<derek> but i pay it off at end of every month
<derek> when i was younger and more poor
<derek> i ran up about 10k in credit card debit (about 6k of that was for supplies to remodel house)
<chillywilly> I still have that beat :(
<chillywilly> 43,000 in school loans
<Mr_You> my roommate said he was thinking about buying this house, man I wish he would look around first ugggh.. I'd love to move somewhere else
<chillywilly> the rest are  credit cards and misc. loans
<Mr_You> you'll beat it chilly don't worry
<chillywilly> nah, I am workin this job making peanuts
<Mr_You> not forever
<chillywilly> I hope not
<chillywilly> it is just damn depressing
<chillywilly> being this much into debt and nothing to show for it
<chillywilly> accept some damn peiece of paper
<chillywilly> they makes nice toilet paper
<dtm> chillywilly: hi.
<dtm> doesn't sound like a very sturdy degree document.
<Mr_You> hmm this company doesn't have any jobs on their site that fit me..
<chillywilly> dtm: I dun figured out just how much in debt I am and I feel like crying :P
<derek> but when i sold our first house we had about 30k in equity built in it
<dtm> chillywilly: good ol' cheeley
<derek> i had borrowed 15k from my parents so paid them back
<dtm> derek: heh
<chillywilly> heh
<derek> sorry had about 40k in equity
<dtm> derek: equity is good
<derek> paid them back 15
<chillywilly> my mom would never even have 15k lying around
<derek> then paid the credit cards off
<derek> and had a nice chunk of change to put down on the new house
<derek> and swore to never rack credit card debit again
<dtm> if i bought a house these days here in silicon valley (yes it's entirely possible with a sufficient down payment and lease-to-own), in a few years (5-10) it'd be worth way more
<Mr_You> the only two jobs I'll take are: Sun/Linux/FreeBSD/HP Admin or Cisco Network Engineer
<Mr_You> or CGI development
<dtm> my neighbor's house is 20x its original value from the 70's
<dtm> or 80's
<chillywilly> if I can get out of this hole I am gonna scale down to one credut card with a $200 limit :P
<Mr_You> lucky
<dtm> chillywilly: ;)
<derek> in this house in past 3 years probably have built about 10k maybe 15k
<dtm> derek: gerat
<dtm> great
<derek> which isnt bad on a 3 year investment of 25k (my down payment here)
<dtm> yep
<dtm> wow, it'd be neat to have 25k ;)
<dtm> i'd settle for being able to pay last month's bills
<derek> i had it in an accoutn (normal bank) for a bit
<chillywilly> masta how old are you?
<chillywilly> 27?
<derek> while waiting to close
<derek> and i liked seeing the interest checks
<derek> chillywilly: 27
<dtm> derek: did you earn all that yourself with no family help or what
<derek> dont let it fool you though
<Mr_You> my bud talked a house from 133k to 119k last month
<dtm> Mr_You: heh
<derek> i have been smart with money, but i dont have any real savings
<dtm> derek: bummer
<dtm> derek: why no savings?
<derek> other than my state retirement (which isnt bad)
<derek> dtm: i dont carry debt
<dtm> derek: do you work for the state?
<derek> but i have bills that press my income to point where i havent been 'saving' money
<Mr_You> my next debt will be my biz, by that time it should be my only real big debt
<derek> that is my new years resolution
<dtm> derek: yeah that was a silly question for meto ask :)
<dtm> Mr_You: what sorta biz?
<dtm> i've been building a bidness lately
<dtm> i researched small business resources at the county library tonight
<derek> to start my deferred compensation of at least 3% of my salary
<chillywilly> why you all up in my bidness?
<derek> btw: i work for county
<chillywilly> sheeeeet
<dtm> derek: i see
<derek> but we are on same retirement system as the state
<dtm> neat
<derek> the universities, schools, state, city, county all have same retirement system
<Mr_You> dtm: IT, hosting, GNUe, blah blah blah ;-) 
<derek> and it is transferrable to any government
<dtm> derek: so they have mad stock eh?
<dtm> ;)
<dtm> Mr_You: HA!  is that your plan?  ;>
<derek> i.e. if i went to work for the state or even another state it would transfer
<derek> well honestly i was sitting on some cash (about 5k) but am needing to buy a car and went on big fat vacation
<chillywilly> gov't jobs are very cushy
<derek> but i was thinking stocks are so low right now it wouldnt hurt to dump 5k into market on blue chippers
<chillywilly> I need to get me a gov't job
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> and sit back and see them return to value in 2 - 3 years 
<dtm> derek: sounds good
<dtm> chillywilly: hahah
<dtm> chillywilly: gitcha some cheeez?
<chillywilly> plz
<derek> chillywilly: working for govt is very irrating most of the time
<dtm> fromma gubmint
<chillywilly> this is the dairy state dude
<derek> and it pays ok to good
<dtm> derek: hehe
<derek> if for right person, but can pay like crap too
<dtm> derek: what's your summary explanation for its irritation?
<derek> um i have too favorite phrases:
<dtm> Mr_You: any further plans, docs, etc?
<derek> definition of insanity: doing the same thing you have always done and expecting different results
<chillywilly> don let the doro hit ya where the good lord splitcha?
<chillywilly> s/doro/door
<chillywilly> s/don/don't
<derek> maricopa county, we put the FUN in dysFUNctional
<dtm> derek: heh
<derek> seriously, there is a lot of 'we always did it this way' mentality
<dtm> hehehe
<derek> and of course everything that is good has to be expensive
<derek> i.e. they waste money like mad its just sick
<dtm> derek: yep
<derek> i laughed when pentagon spent like what 500 bucks for a toilet seat
<chillywilly> no GNUe solution for maricopa county yet?
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> and thought man someone has to be giving a kick back or somethhing
<derek> but i will tell you for all their bureaucracy stupid stuff like that really happens
<derek> and its not necessarily 'govt officials' out to get public gain
<derek> its just really stupid decisions and vendors taking advantage of it
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> I could've worked for the city
<derek> chillywilly: TRUE STORY
<derek> we were on a conference call with a vendor
<chillywilly> I satyed at L. S. Research and then they let me go
<derek> who i will remain nameless
<chillywilly> stupid thing to do
<chillywilly> oh well
<derek> we were doing contract negotiation
<derek> our lawyers, director of technology, county administrator (CEO basically) with their lawyers and top of the line on conference call
<derek> there was an argument about things and who would do what
<derek> we didnt want to pay their consultants
<derek> we wanted to do some stuff in house and just pay for training
<derek> they THOUGHT they hit mute
<derek> and said something like
<derek> "let them do it, you know how government employees are, we can let them pay for training and when they are too clueless to figure it out, we will just charge them the full price for consulting and tell them told you to do up front in contract"
<derek> that was 'you know how STUPID govt employees are
<derek> our IT director went off
<derek> and it was embarassing for the vendor
<ajmitch> haha
<derek> but you know what is jacked
<derek> we still signed a contract with them
<derek> we paid for the training
<derek> the consulting
<chillywilly> that is stupid
<derek> and then additional consulting and a higher rate later when they broke contract
<derek> its like the govt has no BALLS
<chillywilly> I would have nir eballs
<chillywilly> imho
<derek> btw: erase everythign i said, its a lie
<chillywilly> knowing tha this is the ppl's money
Action: derek forgets this channel is way to public to say such things
<chillywilly> it is not their money
<chillywilly> eveyone fucking apid all those damn taxes
<chillywilly> paid
<chillywilly> oops
<derek> well you know what it was
<derek> the board approved the stuff
<derek> and to drop this vendor and 'redo the RFP' etc
<derek> would have take 8 more months
<derek> and they needed a solution ASAP
<chillywilly> that's all you gotta do dude
<derek> which is why they stuck with vendor
<chillywilly> geta  contract with a gov't office
<chillywilly> you are set
<chillywilly> :D
<derek> then when the contract fouled up
<chillywilly> youc na retire
<derek> they didnt 'argue' cause they didnt want to have a 'bad' relationshiop
<derek> as we are 'locked' to that vendor
<chillywilly> they wanted me to hack on the city tie program
<chillywilly> time
<derek> and if we piss them off then no support and we have to go find a new product and 2 years go down the drain
<derek> pretty said eh
<chillywilly> the program that keeps track of the time all the city of Milwaukee workers use
<derek> and when people say GPL is dumb, this is why i want to smack them :)
<chillywilly> er, work
<ajmitch> which is one rason why you like how GNUe is working?
<ajmitch> s/rason/reason/
<derek> yes
<derek> if you dont like your gnue consultant fire their ass
<derek> hire a internal programmer
<chillywilly> they were a contractor with the city
<derek> or find another cnosultant

<derek> chillywilly: ice fishing is like hunting in the snow, you have to like cold balls to do it
<nickr> I want a ratite preserve

<derek> is the 700 thousand lines of code 'worth bragging about'?
<jamest> ?
<jamest> what are you talking about?
<derek> see above sentence
<jamest> whoops, didn't see it
<derek> after two years of hardwork and more than 700 lines of code....
<derek> er 700 thousands
<jamest> it's C
<derek> i saw that and was like thats nearly a MILLION lines of code
<derek> when i look at evolution it doesnt look THAT complex
<derek> that pygmy email program (much simpler indeed) was like 3 py fles
<derek> files
<derek> none probably over 50 lines of code :)
<derek> i lied pygmy has 9,010 lines total in all its .py files
<jamest> but C gives l33t performance dood!
<jamest> joo know joo n33d l33t perf0rm4nce when r34ding mail from your Gs
<jamest> speed readers might end up waiting on the machine to scroll or something
<derek> i just looked at gnue its interesting
<derek> GNUe Forms src: 5986  GFObjects: 1411 Total:7397
<jamest> a huge chunk of forms has been moved into gnue-common
<jamest> so you have to count that as well
<derek> GNUe Common src: 3261 masks: 2135 drivers/comm: didnt count Total: 5396
<derek> GNUe Reports src: 1978
<derek> GNUe Designer src: 4361
<jamest> you should filter out comments :)
<derek> so about 12,000 lines of code
<derek> for reports, forms and designer :)
<derek> including comments
<derek> guess this is why i kind of gasp at comment of 700,000 lines of code

<derek> however
<derek> look at geas :)
<derek> src: 38661
<jamest> i have no idea what she looks like 
<derek> classdef: 911
<derek> config: 431
<jamest> i think we can get the gnuef code cleaner in the long run too
<derek> datastore: 906
<derek> methods: 1054
<derek> objectcache: 1687
<jamest> but to be fair you should count the db driver code in gnue-common
<jamest> there is a chunk of code in there
<derek> object...: 3656
<derek> oql: 1942
<jamest> yeahaw!
<jamest> aol.com decided i exist again!
<derek> total:49248
<derek> jamest: agree on dbdrivers, i just wanted to get ball park numbers
<derek> and i dont know how to make wc go recursive
<derek> so doing each dir of db drivers would be painful :)
<derek> but at 12,000 add a liberal say 10,000 for db code (to be obnoxious) and 22,000 lines is still miniscule (IMO)
<jamest> db driver are 4309 lines of code
<jamest> for all of them
<derek> well i stuck to engineer fashion and doubled it for estimate :)
<derek> not bad right :)
<derek> i have to run :(
<derek> see ya all in a bit

<reinhard> reinhard: number of lines
<reinhard> crap
<reinhard> silly xchat
<reinhard>  re: number of lines
<reinhard> you should be careful not to count generated code files
<reinhard> we have a lot of them in geas, thus the 50.000 lines
<reinhard> 26924 are orbit-generated, that's more than 50%
<reinhard> probably evolution ppl counted generated code, too
<reinhard> to have a high number of lines to show off :)
<jamest> :)
<jamest> kinda like some packages and their dependencies :)
<reinhard> plus number of lines depends on coding style
<reinhard> like old geas parser code has 4317 lines
<reinhard> new geas parser code (nearly finished) w/ basically identical function has 2088 lines
<reinhard> and i guess the percentage of comments is higher for the new code :)
<jamest> comments? IN the code? ABOUT the code?

<jamest> i'll pick mine up at same time

<dneighbo> jcater i see your newest commits
<jcater> yeah
<dneighbo> i tested last night at like 2am my time and things were still broken
<dneighbo> will try cvs again tonight to see if fixed now
<jcater> la la la
Action: jcater doesn't here you
<jcater> hear even
<dneighbo> you can do a quick test to the most noticeable issue now
<jcater> what was it doing?
<dneighbo> if you have say like 3 records
<dneighbo> go to any record other than the first record
<dneighbo> then go to address
<dneighbo> add a new address
<dneighbo> then press the save button
<dneighbo> (it saves the data and for the right contact)
<dneighbo> HOWEVER, it moves the recordset back to teh first record
<jcater> sigh
<dneighbo> this was before your last commits from this AM
<dneighbo> so it might be fixed now, though it didnt appear the commits where addressing this particular issue (but who i am i to say)
<jcater> no
<jcater> it was actually by design
<jcater> (for the time being)
<jcater> but I will look at it
<jcater> were there any other issues?
<jcater> other than navigational?
<dneighbo> um dont know
<dneighbo> just tested data with right record
<dneighbo> AND
<dneighbo> going back to first record
<dneighbo> 1st one seems fixed, second one still broke, but you note thats by design :)
<dneighbo> but want to verfiy with latest cvs commits form this AM
<dneighbo> before i give it the stamp of approval
<dneighbo> i.e. give me more time to make your life hell
<jcater> lemme makes sure I have this right
<jcater> in all cases, it is committing the correct changes to the database
<jcater> but it's just not behaving like you'd expect after the commit?
<jcater> or is it not committing correctly either?
<jcater> (cause those are two different places to look -- one's a gnue-common problem and the others a gnuef problem)
<jcater> btw, that "by design" didn't necessarily mean that's the way we wanted... just that there were issues we couldn't resolve at the time so that was the "safe" thing to do
<jcater> (if you deleted a record before the current record (or if you deleted the current record), the logic wasn't there to recalculate the new current record)
<jcater> 'course, that was a brain fart on my part
<jcater> it seems blatantly obvious now
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> i THINK the problem is just 'not behaving how i would ike after the commit'
<dneighbo> i.e. my few tests in the wee hours appeared to save data properly, but i would like to give mroe testing before i 100% say that :)
<jcater> lol
<dneighbo> so dig in the other area and see what you can do and this evening i will retest and we will go from there
<jcater> almost finished
<dneighbo> with luck we can release by monday
<dneighbo> plus if i can get mdean to repair the dclgw tree
<dneighbo> and get all new commits in there or even in dcl head
<dneighbo> i might whip some other forms together
<dneighbo> which will be good test on designer
<dneighbo> as well as forms
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> masta creating forms
<jcater> that scares me
<dneighbo> you
<dneighbo> mdean is the one that should be scared
<dneighbo> btw: on reports i was going to compile a comprehensive list of report objects
<dneighbo> which woudl translate to tags/attributes
<dneighbo> from another reporting tool (prop)
<jcater> mdean had a lot of input on that
<dneighbo> to use as a base point for discussion about gnue standards
<jcater> he's used quite a few
<jcater> and his thinking was in line w/mine
<jcater> (not sure what yours is :)
<dneighbo> if you think that is of interest
<jcater> but you might want to solicit his input as well
<dneighbo> probably different :)
<dneighbo> this wasnt meant as a proposal
<dneighbo> merely a 'reference' point to start a discussion
<jcater> well, we need to get the ball rolling
<dneighbo> i mean off top of head i can think of thigns like
<dneighbo> probably 
<jcater> so, please be my guest
<dneighbo> report tag
<dneighbo> header/footer 
<dneighbo> grouping
<dneighbo> sub grouping
<dneighbo> title
<dneighbo> etc etc
<dneighbo> but bound to 'miss' some 'ideals', so was thinking at lookign at another tool to compile whats there to help job our memories of what might be valuable in reporting
<dneighbo> i think we should KISS
<jcater> I agree
<jcater> but a fully functional KISS
<dneighbo> and slowly add things in
<jcater> (don't need a sloppy KISS)
<dneighbo> so say up front most of the 'tags' will be there
<dneighbo> but the 'fine tuning' attributes of that tags will slowly creep in
<dneighbo> as when i look at the prop system its all objects and properties
<dneighbo> the objects would be similar to tags and the properties similar to attributes
<jcater> I'll have to see an example to understand where you're going :)
<dneighbo> and it looks like we would probably need most of the tags to do anything useful but many of the properties/attributes while useful could be ignored for some time and still have a functional reports
<dneighbo> well first i should ask what you and mdean were thinking
<dneighbo> make sure im not wasting my time as you might be doing a totally different approach
<jcater> well, sections with section headers, footers 
<jcater> course, sections can contain sections
<jcater> (these may be what you are calling groups)
<dneighbo> ok we are on same page
<dneighbo> well technically this prop tool calls things
<dneighbo> BANDS
<jcater> ack
<dneighbo> and that is pretty common lingo in reporting
<dneighbo> bands can contain sections
<dneighbo> and sections can contain sections etc
<dneighbo> when i say grouping
ToyMan (stuq@c5300-1-ip165.albany.thebiz.net) left #gnuenterprise (Client Exiting).
<dneighbo> i mean something that tells the report to 'groupby'
<dneighbo> i.e. a section starts over at some grouping point (me is saying this poorly)
<dneighbo> i imagine it will be an 'attribute' of section

<ra3vat> sevik: you here?
<dneighbo> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/reports.txt
<dneighbo> please comment
<dneighbo> can get mdeans response tonight, but would like to forge some standards soon
<dneighbo> so i can look at starting the xslt conversions
<jcater> what is this based on?
<jcater> (just curious)
<jcater> jamest: you here?
<jcater> oh, wait.. it's your lunch hour
<dneighbo> jcater: i could say but i would have to kill you
<dneighbo> it is based on the report package included in delphi (quick reports) i think
<dneighbo> it is similar to crystal and other ones i have used
<jcater> I should've known
<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> btw: before the flames start we used quickreports one time, but the desinger was so horrible we went to a third party instead
<dneighbo> but i think the 'basic elements' are fairly universal among all report tools
<dneighbo> and since i happened to have this on a machine at work i went from there
<dneighbo> i strongly suggest if others have crystal reports etc
<dneighbo> that they compare to this list and see whats missing whats stupid etc
<dneighbo> so we have even a better spot to jump from
<dneighbo> i.e. im not suggesting we implement this (its not a proposal) its 'reference material'
<dneighbo> jcater you are eeriely quiet
<jamest> dneighbo: we're busy ordering our "Delphi Blows" t-shirts
<jamest> not that it does or anything, we just can't like what you do
<jamest> :P
<jcater> dneighbo: there's called users
<jamest> jcater: btw - I'm back 
<jamest> whatcha need
<jcater> I forgot
<jcater> oh, yeah
<jcater> I think we should add a port= attribute to the connections file (and <database> tag)
<jcater> optional of course
<jcater> dneighbo: you have any sample reports done like this?
<dneighbo> yes but in delphi :)
<dneighbo> well i would have to dig to find them as they are old
<dneighbo> the part im torn on is we have two phases
<dneighbo> pre data population
<dneighbo> post data population
<dneighbo> some of these are needed pre and some post and some both
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> not sure what you mean
<dneighbo> im still kind of struggling how the source template will look
<jcater> also, I wander about the expressions
<dneighbo> and what the output will look like
<jcater> would these not be the same as triggers/events?
<dneighbo> well expressions are 'triggers' really
<dneighbo> :)
<jcater> ok
<dneighbo> remember this is reference material 
<dneighbo> ie terminology etc will be different
<jcater> I know... just making sure I understand
<dneighbo> systemdata will be like triggers too
<dneighbo> only it would be nice to have set reportFunctions
<dneighbo> like
<dneighbo> date
<dneighbo> page x of x
<dneighbo> etc
<dneighbo> in systemdata
<jcater> I agree
<jcater> although I wander about that page x of x
<dneighbo> so people dont have to write code really just pick the systemdata type
<dneighbo> jcater : printing is a WHOLE other animal
<jcater> as that's putting output specific stuff in the report
<jcater> xml generation
<dneighbo> exactly :)
<dneighbo> im really torn on all this
<jcater> I have ideas too
<dneighbo> on the page numbers and page orientation etc etc etc
<jcater> and I think they fall in line (basically) with what you have
<dneighbo> i dont think it belongs in the xml files
<jcater> I agree
<dneighbo> well let me rephrase that
<dneighbo> i think some things like orientation etc MIGHT belong there
<dneighbo> for 'default' purposes
<jcater> ('course, I'd like to have something (anything) usable)
<dneighbo> but thats why i say printing, page, printer stuff is still 'fuzzy' to me
<dneighbo> but i think its somewhat secondary at this point
<dneighbo> as more than likely html will be the first output type
<dneighbo> and those things arent as relevant :)
<dneighbo> but soon they will be, im hoping you and mdean have the ideas for that stuff :)
<dneighbo> just seems everyone has been participating a lot past few weeks and i wanted to capitalize on the renewed enthusiam and try to get an spec to somewhat emerge as i think it is one of the things holding reports from being usefull on a larger scale
<jcater> yes
<jcater> and KC seems to be bringing in new ppl
<dneighbo> cool
<jcater> (at least there's been several responses on mailing lists)
<dneighbo> if we release again soon and another kernel cousin it could get scary in here :)
<jcater> although, it's frustrating that people seem to forget this is an all-volunteer effort :(
<jcater> but, so goes the beast
<dneighbo> yip
<dneighbo> its burger king alright, ie you can have it your way
<dneighbo> just unlike BK if you want it your way, you better be willing to cook it yourself :)
<jcater> roflmao
<jcater> we have steak houses like that here
<jcater> you get it your way, but there's an open grill :)
<dneighbo> funny we have them here too
<jcater> I never understood that
<dneighbo> one of the reported 'best burger' spots in phoenix is you walk in and pay 5 bucks for a patty and bun
<dneighbo> and go out to the pit and cook er up
<jcater> If I go out to a restaurant, I want it cooked for me
<jcater> otherwise, why would I go out?
<dneighbo> me too
Action: jcater is just plain cheap
<dneighbo> note thats why i said 'reported'
<dneighbo> if i pay for food, someone else better be making it and serving it :)
<dneighbo> as i can get a pound of ground beef for 1.49 and 8 buns for .49
<dneighbo> so for 2.00 i can get 4 quarter pounders and have two buns left over :)
<dneighbo> why would i pay 5.00 to cook my own at a restaurant :)
Action: dneighbo too is a extremely cheap bastard
<jcater> well, I never realized the extremely cheap part, but that's good to know
<dneighbo> rofl
Action: dneighbo figured the salary masta pays you and jamest would reek of my fortitude in cheapness

<Mr_You> man this morning the leaf vacuums were here.. god they are so loud
<jcater> woohoo
<jcater> we have roughly 26000 lines of python
<Mr_You> heh
<jcater> not that that's any measure of anything
<Mr_You> it measures someone has been doing something ;-)
<jcater> good point
<dneighbo> jcater: this morning i was only measuring 17,000
<dneighbo> wonder where the other 9,000 came from
<jcater> how do you measure?
<dneighbo> that was going on 12,000 on everything outside of gcomm and dbdriver
<dneighbo> jamest said dbdriver had 5k
<dneighbo> wc -l *.py
<dneighbo> is how i counted
<jcater> oh
<jcater> well I like my count better :)
<dneighbo> well you are far from topping 700,000 that evolution is bragging about
<dneighbo> or the 50k that geas holds
<dneighbo> i didnt test your patches, but the form works ;)
<jcater> yeah, but look what those 17,000 (or 26,000) do
<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> whether it works or not it, it works ok
<dneighbo> yes i look at evolution which is a nice piece of software with lots of features
<dneighbo> and think how the hell can that be 700k lines of code?
<dneighbo> maybe they include ever single library included?
<dneighbo> way i look at it when i count lines of code i dont count modules etc
<dneighbo> for example i dont count lines of wxpython or pygresql code etc
<dneighbo> miguel says its so many lines because the 'specs are so complicated for mail and such'
<dneighbo> and i have to think damn they had full calendar code already in gnome calendar
<dneighbo> so all that code shoudl be resuable
<dneighbo> etc etc
<dneighbo> as components
<dneighbo> and there has to be half a billion mail libraries out there
<dneighbo> so either ximian is writing all libraries from scratch (probably)
<dneighbo> or they have some really really really think gui code

<dneighbo> if you guys speak of anything that might be use to others in your russian sessions can you let psu know so he can include in kernel logs or just reiterate the stuff here for him to pickup
<dneighbo> and second
<dneighbo> any chance one of you would be willing to make russian translations of the kernel cousins for gnue :)
<ra3vat> ok, may be me to save other's skills for coding :)
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> no you have to code too :)
<dneighbo> btw: the post to forms list you made was very good
Action: dneighbo is very excited to know we have forms that works with cryllic characters :)
<ra3vat> ok, thanks :)

Nick change: jcater_ -> jcater
<mdean> [18:36:46] <mdean> I do have a quick conceptual ? for you dneighbo
<mdean> [18:36:53] <mdean> about form triggers
<mdean> [18:36:57] <dneighbo> ok
<mdean> [18:37:28] <mdean> if GNUe is to be language independent, how will you implement triggers from a Python form in PHP (for example)
<mdean> [18:37:32] <dneighbo> Maniac um if we tell jcater to stop working on gcomm it might be ready next week, he is AI after all
<mdean> [18:37:39] <mdean> just a curiosity more than anything
<mdean> [18:37:45] <dneighbo> evil question
<mdean> [18:37:47] <Maniac> dneighbo: make it so
<mdean> [18:38:03] <mdean> dneighbo: I've been kicking around an idea tho
<mdean> [18:38:04] <dneighbo> you would be laughing your ass off if you saw jamest, jcater and me in the hotel in SF discussing this topic :)
<mdean> [18:38:15] <dneighbo> and the next day at the booth
<mdean> [18:38:18] <dneighbo> and over breakfast
<mdean> [18:38:24] <dneighbo> and on the wharf
<mdean> [18:38:33] <dneighbo> well let me say this
<mdean> [18:38:55] <dneighbo> the thing we all agreed on was that we want to make a trigger/event system that is shared by the appserver and forms
<mdean> [18:39:14] <dneighbo> so whether you are in two tier or n tier mode its the same and so once a language is supported in one its in the other
<mdean> [18:39:26] <dneighbo> the big contention became....
<mdean> [18:39:37] <mdean> install all supported langs?
<mdean> [18:39:43] <dneighbo> a. how to support oop things in not very good oop languages
<mdean> [18:39:54] <dneighbo> b. how to handle namespacing and forms referencing
<mdean> [18:40:01] <mdean> <cough>xml</cough>
<mdean> [18:40:29] <dneighbo> there was this toyed thought that at first after fleshing it out started to look like we were creating our own language rather than using the 'native' language
<mdean> [18:40:37] <mdean> <cough>xml</cough>
<mdean> [18:40:40] <dneighbo> we did NOT want that
<mdean> [18:40:47] <dneighbo> well we did discuss xml actually
<mdean> [18:40:59] <mdean> d00d!  it could work!
<mdean> [18:41:13] <dneighbo> it just didnt sit right in fleshing it out :)
<mdean> [18:41:33] <mdean> I think it would be ideal
<mdean> [18:41:37] <dneighbo> i think jcater and i were leaning towards trying to be as native to teh language as possi

<chillywilly> dewds, I don't see what the deal is about being language independent
<chillywilly> for triggers/methods
<chillywilly> if you look in the logs I discussed a plugin system that we could use
<chillywilly> with a cache
<chillywilly> an xml cache
<chillywilly> like what gstreamer does
<chillywilly> to find plugins
<jcater> huh?
<chillywilly> you just write a plugin for that language and it searches certain paths and interrogates the plugins, etc......if you look even further back reinhard and I talked about this too
<chillywilly> I don't remember when that was
<chillywilly> it was a wile ago
<chillywilly> while
<jcater> that's fine
<jcater> but that's not what we're talking about
<chillywilly> then what are you talking about?
<jcater> I'd envision languages to be plugins kinda like you are describing
<jcater> we have to have a common way inside those languages to identify our objects
<jcater> i.e.
<chillywilly> GObject bindings ;)
<chillywilly> I think we should use the GObject system in glib
<jcater> say we support gack
<chillywilly> it si nice
<jcater> gack
<jcater> where is a quick readme on the GObject system
<chillywilly> ummm
<jcater> I still think we are discussing 2 different things
<jcater> an executive summary or such :)
<chillywilly> you can get a good feel just by looking at the API docs
<chillywilly> I did anyway
<jcater> you have a link?
<chillywilly> it can load "types" from .so files too
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> sec
<chillywilly> http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gobject/index.html
<chillywilly> check out GTypeModule
<chillywilly> they have a nice run time tye system too
<jcater> argh!
<chillywilly> type
<jcater> time out error on developer.gnome.org :(
<chillywilly> crap!
<jcater> my roadrunner is crappy last 2 weeks
<chillywilly> well that blows chunks
<jcater> half the time I timeout on google
<chillywilly> :(
<jcater> ah
<jcater> working now
<chillywilly> I think the Gnome system is finally gonna get good an most stupid unnecessary dependencies will go away
<jcater> you are looking at technical implimentation details... we haven't even reached that level yet
<chillywilly> you also get
<jcater> however we maintain our object references, we have to answer the question
<jcater> of how will the objects be represented in the language's namespace and how will those references tie back into the forms, geas, or reports instance
<chillywilly> mayeb I am getting ahead
<chillywilly> I dunno
<jcater> I think so
<jcater> gobjects does look awefully cool though
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> well why not language bindings for GObject?
<chillywilly> you could have a python GObject
<chillywilly> if you write some code
<chillywilly> :P
<chillywilly> I dunno though
<jcater> i'm sure
<chillywilly> you got a point
<chillywilly> and I see what you mean
<chillywilly> actually
<chillywilly> what I sorta envision is a GNUeObject or something derived from GObject that is data-aware
<chillywilly> implements ODMG or some OO db abstraction
<jcater> whoa
<chillywilly> is that sane?
<jcater> slow down
<jcater> we are discussing language mapping here :)
<jcater> the "objects" that we are referencing are already implemented
<jcater> (i.e., they are forms, form blocks, form fields, report sections, etc)
<jcater> the question is how do we reference these objects consistently in the individual languages' namespaces
<jcater> err, the question at hand
<chillywilly> well we have some objects too which could be the same object that forms uses just that sometimes those objects are not always in geas but forms has its own layer so it is indepedent
<jcater> (there are, of course, plenty of questions to come later on :)
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<chillywilly> are blocks, fields, etc. ui stuff?
<chillywilly> common should be ui abd backend indepent right?
<chillywilly> and also communication independent
<chillywilly> i.e., "common"
<chillywilly> hehe
<jcater> um
<jcater> I would say they are not UI stuff
<jcater> but they are tool specific
<chillywilly> well you must also realize I know dick about forms
<chillywilly> so plz bare with me
<jcater> (so you are right they are not part of common)
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> a different layer in the forms architecture
<jcater> yes
<jcater> I do think I see where you are going though
<jcater> also, please remember I adhere to the KISS principle as much as possible :)
<chillywilly> we should make an architecture diagram or something :P
<chillywilly> oh yes
<chillywilly> this is just refactoring how things should be right?
<chillywilly> isn't that basically what we are doing now
<chillywilly> trying to figure out how it all shoul fit together
<jcater> um
<Isomer> for a v1.0 release, python only bindings IMHO is perfectly fine.  Add perl, php, C, C++, scheme, visual basic bindings for v2.0 and rev quickly :)
<jcater> Isomer: I agree
<chillywilly> me too
<jcater> visual basic??
<chillywilly> ack
<Isomer> isn't there some delusional group trying to reimlpement VB for *nix?
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> I have no idea about that one
<jcater> yes
<chillywilly> GnomeBasic?
<jcater> I think so
<chillywilly> or something
<jcater> there's gnome-basic and kde-basic IIRC
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> yea
<Isomer> see? told you they were delusional :)
<jcater> I imagine we will do tcl shortly after python (as someone was wanting that and showed me documents on it's libraries :)
<chillywilly> seriously jcater though haven't you been refactoring thing from the get go?
<jcater> we'll probably do scheme shortly thereafter
<jcater> (for political purposes)
<Isomer> heh
<chillywilly> pulling out styff into common, db drivers, etc.
<Isomer> then we can start porting emacs to it :)
<jcater> chillywilly: yip
<jcater> or porting it to emacs, as the case may be :)
<chillywilly> haha
<chillywilly> we need a forms emacs ui driver
<chillywilly> ;P
<jcater> chillywilly: seriously, there's been talk about that
<jcater> as odd as it sounds
<jcater> (it sounds VERY odd to me :)
<chillywilly> I know there has
<chillywilly> and I was only half kidding
<chillywilly> emacs rox
<Isomer> I have a very vague recollection that emacs already has something
<jcater> argh!
<jcater> my son has a tape fetish I think
<jcater> he finds tape anywhere
<jcater> and he wraps everything up in it
<chillywilly> hahah
<chillywilly> kids are awesome
<jcater> I thought we were finally tape-free
<chillywilly> and very netertaining
<chillywilly> entertaining even
<jcater> but he stripped down some old boxes and used
<chillywilly> rofl
<jcater> their tape to wrap our VHS cassettes
<Isomer> he's gonna love Xmas :)
<jcater> yes
<Isomer> and/or the local datawarehous
<jcater> he found our first aid tape
<jcater> and taped up barney
<jcater> he found my masking tape and taped up my computer
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> I love it dude ;)
<chillywilly> I got a story to tell
<chillywilly> we were taking scotty over to his aunt's house when we would go to work
<chillywilly> well caroline's aunt
<chillywilly> anyway, he didn;t like it much there
<chillywilly> so then when she came to the house to visit
<chillywilly> he locked the door on her
<jcater> rofl
<chillywilly> he didn't want her to come in
<chillywilly> also, when she came in
<chillywilly> she was sitting by caroline's mom
<chillywilly> then she got up and went to the bathroom
<chillywilly> scotty moved he rmom's chaor
<chillywilly> when she came back he said,  "you can't sit by my grandma aunty sandy"
<jcater> lol
<jcater> TJ has recently learned how to unlock our interior doors
<jcater> and I don't mean by the little knobs that you normally use
<jcater> you know the little slots you can stick a flat screwdriver in to unlock from the other side?
<jcater> well, he found a toy that 
<jcater> fits in that
<jcater> it's his 'key'
<chillywilly> hehe
<jcater> sigh!
<jcater> no more locking him in the basement
<chillywilly> they aretoo smart dude
<chillywilly> rofl
<jcater> yeah, I can here it in 10 years
<chillywilly> he was just mena to aunt sandy the whole time she was there
<jcater> "dad, you actually used such a low level language as python??"
<jcater> "you mean, it was a typed language?"

Nick change: john_doe -> jcater
<jcater> ??
<jcater> so what d'ya need?
<jamest> i started to add a new function to db drivers

<jamest> a very minor detail but your mentioning records made me think of it :)
<jamest> Isomer: you can install python2 along 1.5.2
<jamest> and I don't think it had too many dependencies required by gnue
<Isomer> not by gnue
<Isomer> mostly python2 deps
<jamest> no more than say gnucash anyway
<jamest> :) j/k
<Isomer> I tried getting rh to do a update
<Isomer> but it didn't like me :)
<jamest> i think I may have applied the proverbial "final straw" on the back of jcater
<chillywilly> does our mailing list stuff go into the KC?
<chillywilly> too
<jamest> do we get mailing list stuff
<jamest> other than spam
<jamest> i don't seem too
<chillywilly> well say I got a bunch of cool ideas
<Isomer>  bc is needed by libgtop-1.0.9-2_helix_1
<Isomer> why?!
<chillywilly> and I post to gnue-discuss
<chillywilly> will it get in the KC?
<Isomer> the KC suggests it does
<Isomer> it mentions it's a summary of "several mailing lists" and "IRC"
<chillywilly> i.e., are they monitoring out lists?
<chillywilly> oh, ok
<derek> jcater: you able to look at the fix ?
<jcater> sorry
<jcater> was putting son to bed
<derek> ok
<jcater> looking now
<jcater> I know where it is
<derek> you are forgiven now get back to work
<jcater> I just called the wrong function
<jcater> maybe I should cut back on that crack
<Isomer> heh
<chillywilly> ok, say we use GObject and we have python bindings to it we should have it so we have a remote version (i.e., GCommon interface (gcd?)) and one where you can download the methods directly and use the GObject directly....thus having a somewhat fat client (sorta like things are now)
<jamest> so KC is on LinuxToday site eh
<chillywilly> yep
<jamest> and I get reported as having been mad goat raped
<jcater> jamest: what function were you talking about??
<chillywilly> er?
<jamest> <sigh>
<jamest> jcater: give me a bit
<jamest> i'll find it
<derek>  /dcc good_crack jamest
<chillywilly> in forms is there a DataObject type abstraction of the various data sources?
<jcater> chillywilly: yeah, GObject
<chillywilly> or does it bang right on the DB?
<jcater> everything is a descendent of GObject
<chillywilly> heheh
<jcater> ah
<chillywilly> nit the *real* GObkect though right ;P
<chillywilly> not
<jcater> chillywilly: no, the *real* gnue-common GObject
<chillywilly> the one from glib 2.0
<jamest> it's real to US
<jamest> :)
<chillywilly> well yea
<chillywilly> but we don;t get a nice run time tyoe system
<jamest> and the data object does it does have a cache system in it
<chillywilly> hmmmm
Action: Isomer thinks I'm going to give up on python2
<jamest> gnue-common has a typecasting system IIRC
<jcater> yip
<chillywilly> I need to look at your obejct absatrctions then as we should all use the smae GObject, iirc
<jamest> i found it when it bit me in the ass one day :)
<jcater> lol
<chillywilly> s/iirc/imho
<chillywilly> dudes
<chillywilly> you knwo that GEAS has a DataObject CORBA interface also?
Action: Isomer ponders if it's easier to backport gnue
<chillywilly> those interfaces shoudl be the same
<chillywilly> wouldn't you think?
<chillywilly> I mena th emethods of the "DataObject"
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<chillywilly> looks like I can see how things should fit together after all
<chillywilly> wow
<chillywilly> unbelievable
<Isomer> quick, draw a ER diagram
Nick change: mdean-[fetchwife] -> mdean
<jamest> chillywilly: we wanted to share w/ geas
<jamest> and move all that into gnue-common
<chillywilly> well we definitely should
<chillywilly> we should all be using GObject
<jamest> it's more a time issue at the moment
<chillywilly> our Gobject or whatever
<chillywilly> GNUeObject
<chillywilly> jamest: yes, it is always the case
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<chillywilly> maybe you guys were already aware of this...guess I am just slow and/or haven't thought about it or looked at your code
<chillywilly> doh
<jamest> we want to share everything possible
<chillywilly> so
<chillywilly> can you stire a GObject to a db?
<chillywilly> store
<derek> come now share the software
<jamest> chillywilly: no , GObjects are lower level than the db
<chillywilly> why?
<chillywilly> that is silly isn't it?
<jamest> GDataObject is IIRC the starting point of our data aware system
<Isomer> hmm
<jamest> no, we have a base object that almost everything uses
<Isomer> you need a UML diagram :)
<jamest> it provides us std features and lets us easly dump xml defs of objects
<chillywilly> jamest: so you are tryint to implement GEAS in forms to some degree also?
<chillywilly> are we gonna have both ways to do things?
<jamest> um, no
<chillywilly> thin client + GEAS
<chillywilly> fat client
<chillywilly> ?
<jamest> not implementing geas in gnuef
<jamest> GObject is internal to our apps
<chillywilly> sure you are....GEAS is essentially GObject and GDataObject if you really think about it
<chillywilly> same tyoes of things
<jamest> jcater: GDataObjects.getRecordCount
<chillywilly> i am not criticzing whatsoever
<jcater> sigh
<chillywilly> for the record
<jcater> I thought that was already implemented?
<jamest> IIRC there was one before based upon the cache contents
<chillywilly> just seeing what is common
<jamest> so if the cache was set to 5 then it'd show up to 5
<jamest> i added something so that it'd show the true number of records
<Isomer> so GDataObject is backed by the SQL database and inherits from GObject?
<jamest> i don't recall if I finished it
<jamest> but it's not work
<jamest> ing some of the time
<jamest> :)
<jcater> it doesn;t
<jamest> jcater: but forget about it
<jcater> DAMN!!!
<chillywilly> GDataObject is just an SQL abstraction?
<jcater> argh!!!
<jcater> I just realized
<jcater> that's what I'm calling and
<chillywilly> maybe it is not as much as GEAS biz objects then
<jcater> is why masta's form isn't working
<jamest> jcater: what?
<chillywilly> not as high level I mean
<jamest> IIRC you had a GetRecordCacheCount or something
<jamest> chillywilly: not as high a level
<chillywilly> jamest, jcater you guys don't just use the object and forget about the DB right?
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> not the same htne is it
<chillywilly> then
<jamest> no
<jamest> if you look in the docs in gnue-common
<jamest> you'll find a descriptino of all this
<derek> commit status?
<jamest> derek: i vote yes
<chillywilly> jamest: would you like a common object system to use that is data aware though or would that kill forms 2-tier?

<jamest> I'm quite happy w/ the data system in gnuef
<jamest> and I think geas driver will fit in nicely w/ what we have
<jcater> sigh
<jamest> jcater: what's up?
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> I think I have to retrace the events in forms
<jamest> to do what?
<jcater>  by the time block.processCommit gets called
<jcater>  the block has navigated to the last record
<jcater> ah, of course
<chillywilly> jamest: so you guys are taking GEAS and adapting it 2-tier style?
<jcater> the Pre-Commit traversals all records
<jcater> err, traverses even
<jamest> chillywilly: yes/no
<jamest> the gnue-common driver has schema discovery routines
<jamest> so it'll be able to query the geas objects and get methods, structure
<chillywilly> I see
<jamest> however i'm pretty sure we won't treat them as true object as honestly geas doesn't treat them as objects anyway
<jamest> unless the API has totally changed
<chillywilly> we have a common DataObject interface

<derek> ok
<jcater> found another bug
<chillywilly> oh great

Action: chillywilly puts on his flame proof underwear
<jcater> derek: you turned my master/detail code on its head
<jcater> I think master/detail will be the best tested feature of gnuef after this :(
<jamest> jcater: i feel (indeed have felt) your pain
<jcater> lol
<jamest> that form was evil
<jcater> was??
<jcater> it uses pre-commit triggers now :)
<jamest> and derek kept whining about deadlines or something
<jcater> lol
<jamest> it's almost like his job depened upon it

<chillywilly> man
<chillywilly> I bet no one votes for rms
<jcater> vote?
<mdean> why does red-carpet downloading channel artwork remind me of a o hell?

<chillywilly> Gnome was born not out of technical need but a conflict of ideology.
<chillywilly> If RMS is chosen it will show that Gnome has continued with it's root cause - creating Free software.
<chillywilly> If RMS is not chosen it will show that Gnome has moved on from a base cause of creating free software and is perhaps a bit more open minded about mere open source.
<chillywilly> This will be interesting to watch. Imagine the diminished relevance of GNU if he doesn't get it!

<jamest> Isomer: w/ what?
<Isomer> is there a recent version on debian?
<Isomer> gnue :P
<jamest> not in deb format
<chillywilly> geas 0.0.6 is in debian sid
<jamest> but all the dependencies are in woody IIRC
<chillywilly> but no forms, reports, or designer
<chillywilly> soon though
<chillywilly> this is what jeff tells us
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> debian has a tool to generate packages striaght from cvs doesn't it?
sacha_ (sacha@chime-a-94.conceptual.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.

<Isomer> hmm

<Isomer> thusly unstable always has the most up to date version
<Isomer> or at least one thats no more than 2 weeks old
<Isomer> and forces people into a very short release cycle style of thought
<jamest> lol
<jamest> i promise you that would not work w/ us
Action: jcater already has a short cycle of thought
<jamest> derek's screamed for over a year for faster releases
<jcater> oh, you said short *release* cycle :)
<jamest> we just ignore him
<jamest> or make fun of him

<jamest> speaking of sigh
<jamest> is derek's form still having it's way with you?
<jcater> yes and no
<jcater> I need a donut
<jcater> I have a precommit trigger

<jcater> why
<jcater> do you need a loaner bitch?
<jcater> I suppose I can put this away and volunteer for you
<jamest> nope
<jamest> just worried about my favorite AI 
<jcater> um

<jamest> I'll buy from them

<jbailey> That way I can find the !@#$ing libraries I need.
<jbailey> Just naming, where they're located.  Also python-base (version 1.5) just got replaced by python (version 2.1) which make this easier, since you guys seem to need that, too.
<chillywilly> well get to work ;)
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> I saw that when I updated last
<jbailey> I *have* been.  That's why I know all this crap about a language I don't plan to ever learn =)

<chillywilly> jbailey: you should not talk crap about python here without riot gear on
<Maniac> chillywilly: scan it instead and post on the internet
<chillywilly> haha
<jamest> you can talk bad about python
<jamest> as it simply sucks less than some other things
<jbailey> chillywilly: I'm not talking crap about python.  I'm just rebelling against learning yet another language. =)  Keeping my skills up in C++ and scheme are hard enough ;)
<chillywilly> C++ is a cluster fuck
<jbailey> C++ is beauty incarnate. ;)
<jamest> you're both right!
<chillywilly> oh come on now
<chillywilly> I like C++ very much
<chillywilly> but I know it ia a cluster fuck
<chillywilly> s/ia/is
<jamest> it's a fucking beautiful cluster fuck

<Maniac> just picture what could happen if the OS on the holodeck wasn't stable.
<jbailey> C++'s problem is less bad language, than clueless programmers.  I'm only just finally starting to get it.
<Maniac> i'm clueless that's why i'm going to try and learn python
<Maniac> keeps me from giving c++ a bad name

<jcater> ?
<chillywilly> jbailey: both of which have nothing to do with any specific langauge
<jbailey> chillywilly: Yeah, but good OO in C looks ugly.  You either have casts all over, or are relying on void pointers all over the place.  
<chillywilly> jbailey: or you use GtkObject/GObject
<chillywilly> which has nice macros
<chillywilly> and a run time type system
<jbailey> The problem with that is that your optimizer doesn't have a chance to do it's job well there.  The native language features are all designed to be optimized away.
<jbailey> (Or mostly.  There's only so much you can do with RTTI)
<chillywilly> some ppl seem to think they can write better code than a compiler
<chillywilly> :P
<chillywilly> they are mental though
<jbailey> What a silly mistake to make. =)  I tell people if they're that good, to go contrib to gcc.  
<jbailey> That way the rest of us can write better code, too. =)

<chillywilly> you ever look at GNU Common C++ jbailey?
<Isomer> I'm baaack!
<ajmitch> hey Isomer
<Isomer> And I'm back at a *real* box
<Isomer> one that has apt :P
<jbailey> chillywilly: not in about a year.  I spoke to dyfet about it a bit, and the idea of creating a 'cpan' type of thing for C++.
<Isomer> that would be funky!
<chillywilly> how many isomers of methacyclohexane are there Isomer?
<jbailey> Then my life got a little complicated, and I had to drop the idea.
<Isomer> chillywilly: er shrug 2?
<chillywilly> I am just messing with you
<jbailey> Isomer: 3.141592653592....
<chillywilly> that is pi silly
Action: chillywilly trout ships jbailey into a frenzy
<chillywilly> whips
<Isomer> 3.141592653589793238462643383
Action: Isomer got bored in math in high school
<jbailey> I want to do a bachelors of math, but I can't find a decent distance ed program for it in Canada.
<jbailey> So many university degrees I want to do, so little time ;)
<jbailey> so little money. =)
<chillywilly> bah
<Isomer> hmm
<chillywilly> uni is a waste of time
<Isomer> someone likes lyx
<chillywilly> a huge waste of time
<ajmitch> argh, don't mention maths
Action: ajmitch has a maths exam tomorrow
<chillywilly> maths
[23:22] Last message repeated 2 time(s).
<chillywilly> study for your math test
<chillywilly> damnit
<jbailey> ajmitch: which math?
<ajmitch> jbailey: algebra & calculus
<jbailey> Not too bad, what year?
<ajmitch> just first year uni stuff :)
<ajmitch> it's the harder part of the course, i did the easy stuff in first semester
<chillywilly> calculus is easy
<jbailey> A friend of mine did one of his first year chem exams on acid.  He pulled a 4.0 that semestre.
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> but that's chem
<jbailey> He's now doing his doctorate in physics, and barely has time to sleep, never mind do any partying. =)
<chillywilly> does he teach?
<jbailey> Yeah.  He was talking about the ESL students not getting any of his jokes.
<chillywilly> ESL?
<jbailey> English as a Second Language.
<chillywilly> heheh
<ajmitch> heh, i got a friend who just finished his chem degree
<ajmitch> he's going over to korea to teach english next year
<Isomer> my flatmate is doing a PhD in compusci
<Isomer> he's currently marking exams
<ajmitch> heh, fun
<Isomer> they had some real interesting answers
<jbailey> I'd love to do a doctorate in OS design.
<Isomer> like IP has a version field that can have a value of "1.0" or "1.1"
<chillywilly> rofl
<Isomer> or, convergance avoidance in routing algo's
<jbailey> avoidance?  That's called "misconfigured RIP"
<jbailey> or discontiguous root zones in OSPF.
<Isomer> they were explaining how convergance avoidance is a good thing.
<jbailey> I get paid to fix networks like those.
<Isomer> which had us in histerics
<jbailey> For the consultants pocket book.
<ajmitch> Isomer: i'd love to see some of the answers to first year programming exams ;)
<Isomer> and the ESL people are usually entertaining to try and figure out if they're even sitting the right exam
<ajmitch> heh
Action: Isomer makes "play" networks to play with things like OSPF and BGP that people otherwise won't let me play with
<Isomer> ahh, cvs co done!
<ajmitch> :)
Action: Isomer has my own mini internet
<chillywilly> how many friggin computers you got networked together?
<ajmitch> only 12 at the flat, right?
<ajmitch> chillywilly: i'm getting another old box tomorrow :)
<Isomer> 10 or so at this machien
<Isomer> and then we VPN to about 20 other networks around the place
<jbailey> I wonder how hard it would be to setup multiple subhurd to emulate networks, and then connect them with routing protocols.
Action: Isomer <- evil
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> jbailey: it'd be an interestin exercise
<Isomer> jbailey: now *that* I would like to do.
<ajmitch> jbailey: what about the idea of 'collectives', which i read about somewhere
<ajmitch> a distibuted set of servers
<jbailey> ajmitch: I'm not familiar with the term.
<Isomer> hmm
<ajmitch> jbailey: i saw it somewhere :)
<Isomer> thats on the gnu.org site about the hurd IIRC?
<Isomer> a Borg collective of Hurds!
<ajmitch> yeah, that's probably where i saw it :)
<Isomer> basically IIRC the idea was that since everything was message passing
<Isomer> you could message pass between machines
<Isomer> and get a nice cluster going
<ajmitch> yeah
<chillywilly> network transparency?
<jbailey> Right now we still need a seperate network card per chroot jail or subhurd. 
<ajmitch> would be interesting to play with :)
<ajmitch> well, i'll install GNU/Hurd on my 'new' box i'm getting, 16MB enough ram?
<Isomer> jbailey: hurd does pty's and slip right?
<jbailey> chillywilly: Transparent network RPC, yet another wild feature of the Mach microkernel.
<jbailey> Isomer: ptys, yes.  PPP, yes.
<chillywilly> yes, I know
<Isomer> so do ppp between them all?
<ajmitch> dunno how well i can play with only 16MB of ram
<jbailey> That way your devices could be on another machine.
<chillywilly> but it doesn't worj with the current hurd for some reason
<jbailey> Isomer: I don't have a good idea what the best way to do it would be.  It's a neat thought, though.
<Isomer> thats why I got interested in hurd in the first place
<Isomer> doing precisely that
<Isomer> but I was just going to run multiple pfinet translators
<ajmitch> hmm, can the hurd use an nfs-mounted / ?
<chillywilly> can't you create multiple dummy or tunnel interfaces?
<chillywilly> and have a "internal" network going
<ajmitch> chillywilly: don't know, nobody is answering me ;)
Action: ajmitch whines like a small child
<Isomer> chillywilly: you shold be able to create ppp links over pty's
<chillywilly> Isomer: neal had 2 ppp interfaces talking to each other
<Isomer> rigth
<chillywilly> that's how he was debugging things
<Isomer> is there any reason that we can run multiple pfinet translators?
<chillywilly> you mean can't?
<Isomer> yeah
<Isomer> is there any reason that we can't run multiple pfinet translators?
Action: ajmitch shrugs
<Isomer> save ourselves a lot of resources avoiding a subhurd
<Isomer> whats the module for python2-disturils ?
<chillywilly> yes you can run multiples pfinets
<chillywilly> that's how neal did it
<jamest> it's built into python2
<jamest> nite
<Isomer> hmm

<jcater> how are you doing?
<madlocke> ok again...
<madlocke> jcater: you are workin' on gnuef too, right?
<jcater> yes, I am
<madlocke> a special part or just where work is needed?
<jcater> heheh.. I'm jamest's partner in crime :)
<jcater> where-ever work is needed
<madlocke> hehe... then i can come with my complaints to you too ;)
Action: jamest blinks
<jamest> madlocke?
<jamest> is it really you?
<jcater> madlocke: yes. I'll take complaints as well
<madlocke> hi jamest... yes this time i am writing from germany...
Action: jamest does a happy dance
<madlocke> was waiting for my phone company to give me better internet connection ... but think i have to wait more time :(
<jamest> forms 0.1.0 is coming out this weekend
<jamest> 0.3.0 (the next major release) is the UI rewrite release
<madlocke> i saw already the new version number in cvs ;)
<jamest> so we would love to get our paws on your code :)
<jamest> i know we have copyright assignment from you
<madlocke> yep you have...
<jamest> so I think it's just a matter of making sure your new stuff is
<jamest>   a) sane (or at least saner than what we have)
<madlocke> i want talk about few things before sending code...
<jamest>   b) able to support all the leet new features
<madlocke> i would call it ... erm ... evil ;)
<jamest> the talks or the code?
<madlocke> the code...
<madlocke> of course it supports already 3d views, a glove, and a support angel...
<madlocke> ... erm... maybe not ;)
<jamest> :)
<jamest> so what you want to talk about?
<madlocke> maybe it is a prob of my configuration here, but:
<madlocke> when i try to use an account for zipcode.gfd and
<madlocke> i use my normal account that also exists in postgres
<madlocke> it works...
<madlocke> for postgres i have no password defined...
<madlocke> for gnuef i can write any password... it accepts everything...
<jamest> yes
<madlocke> when logging in with another user, i.e. root, the account is not excepted...
<jamest> yes
<jamest> this is a postgresql issue
<madlocke> erm.. gr.. not excepted... accepted ;)
<madlocke> argl...
<madlocke> bad...
<jamest> you have a pg_hba.conf file
<jamest> where you setup trust for clients
<jcater> bbs... lunch
<madlocke> a what??? erm... think no
Nick change: jcater -> jcLunch
<madlocke> ok.. i see have to look more at postgres...
<madlocke> another thing...
<jamest> host         all         192.168.1.0   255.255.255.0     crypt  
<jamest> in that file should make it accept crypted passwords from the 192.168.1 network
<madlocke> ok thanks...
<madlocke> another thing...
<jamest> otherwise the normal "trust" option just says if the user is in db and the process connecting is owned by that user then it's ok to let him in
<jamest> yes?
<madlocke> when you write code in UIwxpython
<madlocke> that is used by UIbase
<madlocke> than i think it is a good idea to have
<madlocke> the required things already in a base class
<madlocke> i.e. UILoginHandler
<madlocke> in a base class or as base class ...
<jamest> madlocke: aggreed
<jamest> IIRC i started a bunch of little crap in UIwxpython that would be moved to UIbase
<jamest> but stalled out
<madlocke> ok... then can help you with this as soon as i have cvs write access...
<madlocke> will send you web ui later this day when i am back on windoows...
<jamest> rock
<madlocke> linux not configured correctly at the moment...
<jamest> hey!
<jamest> we can use windows testers too
<jamest> :)
<madlocke> need some packages and connection too slow and to expensive for this
<jamest> gotcha
<madlocke> gr.... i want one more monitor..
<madlocke> or some cables... have a monitor switch but no cables... :((
<jamest> :(
<jamest> I'll be out part of the weekend
<madlocke> think i will be able to solve this.. ;)
<madlocke> out part? sorry don't understand
<jamest> so if it's after 5PM my time (now 11:40AM)
<jamest> I will be away from a computer until late saturday
<madlocke> ah ok...
<jamest> i get to go play Farmer James 
<jamest> for the inlaws as the wifes father just had surgery
<jamest> and they need extra hands to help with the cattle
<madlocke> bad... is hard work i think...
<jamest> thankfully for them I know which end of the cow the food goes in
<madlocke> grin :)
<jamest> of course, that's about all I know about them
<madlocke> good start
<jamest> but I look forward to seeing your code
<jamest> we've got such plans for the new UI
<jamest> bwahahahaa
<madlocke> to use it you will need Webware from sourceforge.net
<madlocke> is there a list of ideas in a file somewhere?
<jamest> i don't think so
<jamest> i keep meaning to start one
<madlocke> btw, can you remove the old dir from cvs? (inside gnuef... it is empty)
<jamest> ?
<madlocke> dir called 'old'
<madlocke> ;)
<jamest> i think it is removed
<jamest> do a cvs update -Pd
<jamest> to remove unneeded dirs
<madlocke> erm... was checking out everything yesterday... (in a new dir)
<jamest> yip, it's not in my cvs updated today
<madlocke> ok :)
<jamest> madlocke: how far along is the UI code btw
<jamest> i knew you had it pulling up forms
<jamest> but was all the widget support there
<madlocke> it can display most things... the last i did was data exchange... some things work... buttons work...
<madlocke> input lines...
<madlocke> ...
<madlocke> i try with trigger.gfd, helloworld2.gfd, zipcode.gfd
<madlocke> another gfd that is important?
<jamest> that is a good start
<jamest> both zipcode examples would be important
<madlocke> ok...
<jamest> states.gfd IIRC
<jamest> and the tourture test 
<jamest> samples/track/forms/contact_manager.gfd
<jamest> which really pushes the backend a bit
<jamest> btw - all the samples in gnuef/samples should work in normal gnuef now
<jamest> bbiab
<madlocke> ok...
<jamest> back
<jamest> did you scrape the event system?
<jamest> scrap
<madlocke> i looked at some things and have some ideas... did not have a computer in russia... so was a bit difficult to work on it...
<madlocke> have more time now...
<jamest> ah
<jamest> we've all been really busy
<jamest> a bit of funny trivia
<jamest> we were planning a 0.1.0 release arround November (of 2000!)
<jamest> so only a year behind
<jamest> :)
<madlocke> hm... like ms ;)
<madlocke> btw does anyone of you know anything of this mono project?
<jamest> derek has followed it a bit

Action: jcater runs away in a fright

<jcater> hey now
<jcater> only my son can do that
<jcater> (and wife, under certain circumstances)
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> too bad
<chillywilly> your my bitch for today
<chillywilly> I ma a creature of the night
<chillywilly> I will drink your blood
<chillywilly> putty rocks my socks
<jcater> ooh
<jcater> you sicko
<chillywilly> sicko?
<chillywilly> look who's talking donut man
<chillywilly> do you want a donut?
<chillywilly> you know you do
<jcater> well, yeah
<nickr> I have doughnuts
<nickr> munchkins actually

<nickr> which is a tradename for donut holes
Action: dneighbo falls over
<dneighbo> its madlock
<dneighbo> e
<dneighbo> btw: mono is crap :)
<dneighbo> imho
<nickr> whyfor?
<dneighbo> um because its just a 'copy' of microsoft
<dneighbo> and with little gain
<dneighbo> let me explain
<dneighbo> IMHO .net is many things
<dneighbo> one of which is something called C#
<dneighbo> when you look at what C# does 98% of it is done in java or python already
<nickr> thats not a reason not to develope it
<nickr> thats like saying we already have email programs why make more?
<nickr> I meuan about c#
<dneighbo> so to me C# is nothing more than m$ trying to take java's market share and screw sun
<dneighbo> then you have the interoperbility of .net
<dneighbo> which says you write something that can be used by say vb, c, etc all using SOAP
<dneighbo> well ask me
<dneighbo> java / python support soap, corba, etc etc
<nickr> true
<dneighbo> ad nausem to do this
<nickr> I'm not satisfied with any object oriented C dialects I've used
<dneighbo> so once again its just M$ trying to CONTROL this
<dneighbo> the last part of .net i see is the 'passport' thing or 'hailstorm' thing
<nickr> that much seems clear, yes
<dneighbo> which i wont even comment on 
<nickr> bad idea
<nickr> there is no authority anywhere
<dneighbo> but mono basically says they are doing the C# and SOAP thing
<dneighbo> which to me is a WASTE
<dneighbo> dotGNU on the other hand is doing a passport equiv
<dneighbo> now why i dont like passport equiv
<dneighbo> i think there is SOME value in trying to make an alterative so microshaft cant control the 'internet' so to speak
<chillywilly> dotgnu is doing it all dude
<nickr> theres already a hailstorm clone
<dneighbo> from what i have seen of mono it is basically a linux implementation of what microsoft is doing minus passport
<nickr> snowstorm or whatever
<chillywilly> postable.net is so they can be downward compatible with .NET
<chillywilly> portable.nety
<dneighbo> which to me is silly and a waste of time
<chillywilly> well
<dneighbo> but i wont go there :)
<chillywilly> mono could be useful
<chillywilly> but they will ot cooperate with dotgnu
<chillywilly> s/ot/not
<nickr> I think someone should make a good OO language
<dneighbo> chillywilly to me it only appears to give credibility to microsoft
<dneighbo> who once controlling hte domain
<nickr> all the power of C with twice the systems modelling  with half the tedium
<dneighbo> will readily shut mono down via legistlature or other means
<chillywilly> well M$ does have come clout don't you think?
<chillywilly> we need to protect ourselves
<dneighbo> just right up front i can see them patenting most of .net
<dneighbo> and fscking ximian to all hell
<chillywilly> yep
<dneighbo> not to MENTION have you seen evolution
<chillywilly> that might happen
<chillywilly> btw
<dneighbo> it looks identical to outlook
<chillywilly> dotgnu ppl expect to get sued ny M$
<dneighbo> now if Apple can sue all these guys for making 'aqua' themes and shut their asses down
<nickr> I think that was the idea
<chillywilly> s/ny/my
<chillywilly> er
<dneighbo> what do you think M$ can do to ximian about evolution?
<chillywilly> s/ny/by
<nickr> All my windows friends LOVE Evolution
<dneighbo> i mean aqua was just graphics
<dneighbo> evolution 2 outlook is down to look, feel, feature
<chillywilly> ximian tends to just copy M$ though
<dneighbo> im sure they have to have 'some patents' on some of that
<dneighbo> and if they dont they could readily get them
<dneighbo> for example
<dneighbo> the way they have the big icons on the left
<dneighbo> that is a windowapi thing called an application frame
<dneighbo> they were the first to do it
<nickr> well if they make legal moves against evolution it'll simply change
<dneighbo> and gave borland rights to it etc
<dneighbo> they patent that
<dneighbo> and bam sue ximian to remove it
<nickr> The presentation is the only thing they could get ximian on, and thats easy to change.
<dneighbo> nickr: yes easy to change but alienate users
<dneighbo> basically i will say m$ has done historically fairly well on UI design
<dneighbo> i dont think free software has
<dneighbo> i wont go naming apps :)
<nickr> True
<nickr> at least gui apps
<dneighbo> so it would be IMO a big blow to make them redo the evolution GUI
<nickr> I don't know
<nickr> I think it could be made different enough yet still very good
<dneighbo> ESPECIALLY if the patent violation mandated that evolution be stopped distributed
<chillywilly> dneighbo do you see dotgnu and GNUe working together as there has been lots of talk about middleware and forms ui on the dotgnu developers list....of course I mentioned GNUe when this was said
<dneighbo> until it was fixed
<dneighbo> it could be months
<jcater> dneighbo: have you tested my changes yet?
<dneighbo> chillywilly i dont care if they choose to work with us or not, im sure they wont
<dneighbo> for us i expect gcomm to encompass that
<chillywilly> dneighbo "they" are "us"
Action: chillywilly is also on the steering committee of dotGNU
<chillywilly> :P
<ajmitch> chillywilly: you are now?
<dneighbo> i.e. if dotGNU has some prop call or procedure stuff gcomm interfaces cna be written to talk to it
<chillywilly> ajmitch well I am working on it\
<dneighbo> its all about choice
<dneighbo> jcater: no dont have cvs access at work
<dneighbo> will have to check tongith
<chillywilly> dneighbo I just see a lot of areas where dotGNU could use GNUe tools as a base
<chillywilly> dunno what will happen though
<jamest> a small victory on the mac os front

<chillywilly> what do you guys think about RMS running for the Gnome Board?
<jcater> halleluah
<jamest> er, wxpython
<jcater> chillywilly: dunno, depends on his motivation
<dneighbo> jcater: i agree
<dneighbo> i think he would be good in sense of keeping them on toes
<dneighbo> but honestly he is so out of touch with gnome it oculd hurt
<chillywilly> I we need RMS there
<dneighbo> as his main focus would probably be on the smaller things
<chillywilly> think
<dneighbo> i.e. i think freedom is important above all else
<chillywilly> he's only going to play a political role
<dneighbo> but crap most of gnome is LGPL
<chillywilly> you know that
<dneighbo> so ximian can do what the hell they want with it as can red hat
<chillywilly> I trust redhat
<nickr> guh
<chillywilly> ximian I don't trust
<dneighbo> so his ability to do 'anything' on that front is limited other than get people mad at him
<dneighbo> i would much rather see alan cox on it
<chillywilly> well he can't force anything but he can use his influence
<dneighbo> as alan is pro GPL
<dneighbo> knows kernel space well
<dneighbo> and is a good 'engineer' and thusly would help them in many areas IMHO
<chillywilly> alan steped down though
<dneighbo> i know
<dneighbo> i said would RATHER see alan
<dneighbo> not we would see alan :)
<dneighbo> most gnomies dont care for RMS so i doubt he will be elected in
<chillywilly> that's not true
<dneighbo> seeing how ximian developers all have votes they probably have over 50 votes
<chillywilly> there are some ximian ppl who are also Free Software guys even
<dneighbo> and im pretty certain the majority seniment there would be to keep him out
<dneighbo> as he is 'bad for business'
<chillywilly> Michael Meeks being one of them
<dneighbo> chillywilly you misquote me
<dneighbo> most gnomies are FSF guys
<dneighbo> HOWEVER being a FSF guy != caring for RMS
<chillywilly> I didn't quote you
<dneighbo> my statement was most gnomies DONT CARE FOR RMS
<dneighbo> not most gnomies dont agree with free software
<dneighbo> for example mmeeks
<dneighbo> i did followup for RMS with him on gnome basic to iron out some details
<chillywilly> dneighbo you yourself has said Gnome needs a real "leader"
<chillywilly> who better than RMS?
<dneighbo> mike said basically tell him i agree to everythign but i refuse to do a webpage on GNU.org and if he cant deal with that to bad im sick of his inane requests
<jcater> chillywilly: I know you are going to flame me
<dneighbo> rms would not make a good gnome leader
<jcater> chillywilly: but I think RMS is a better "philosopher" that a "leader"
<dneighbo> he makes a good free software leader
<dneighbo> in sense that its very 'idealistic'
<dneighbo> and you can be eccentric and idealistic when peddling philosphy
<chillywilly> well RMS is a consulting philospher, imho and not a "leader"
<jcater> yeah, what derel said :)
<jcater> derek, even
<dneighbo> HOWEVER to peddle a desktop to the masses and corporate america you need a much different animal
<dneighbo> i think the leader for gnome needs to be two things
<dneighbo> or they need two leaders
<jcater> 1. big balls
<jcater> 2. lots o patience
<jcater> (sorry)
<dneighbo> one needs a strong vision of where going and how to conquer enterprises (why i dont like him a shining example of this personality is Michael Dell)
<dneighbo> jcater btw that equates to your #1 (big balls)
<dneighbo> and the other quality is someone to clean house in the state of engineering, to make dependencies and architectures soudn and sold and enforce good habits (good examples of this are linus and alan with the kernel)
<chillywilly> i still see no reason why rms input should not be felt as the Gnome Board has nothing to do with hacking it is totally political and PR related
<dneighbo> jcater btw: this relates to your #2 which is lots o patience :)
<jcater> lol
<chillywilly> dneighbo the architecture is getting a lot better now
<jamest> an odd question
<chillywilly> another reason why I will not start using KDE, because I believe Gnome is going in the right direction
<jamest> but RMS won't even use a web browser last I knew
<chillywilly> jamest that totally irrelevant
<dneighbo> not really
<dneighbo> if the man doesnt even use gnome
<jamest> refuses to in fact
<chillywilly> he must be communicating with ppl some how
<dneighbo> its hard to believe he has any clue as to the things going on with in it
<dneighbo> chillywilly he uses lynx OCASSIONAL
<jamest> so I'm not sure he will "get" gnome
<chillywilly> he does "get" gnome
<jcater> how can he "get" it?
<chillywilly> he replied to my message once where I call "Linux" a geeks OS and then mentioned Gnome being an effort to make computers easier for regular ppl
<chillywilly> he gets that muc at least
<jamest> that's boilerplate talk
<chillywilly> much
<jamest> i can say the same thing
<jamest> however if he won't use a browser
<jamest> and if he still has this emacs/lisp fixation
<jamest> (not saying he does, just if)
<jamest> then quite a bit of gnome starts to become nothing more than this grey box
<chillywilly> why does that matter you all said that they need to be put in check with regard to freedom iussues, who better to do that thenm RMS...maybe he can get them off of their damn LGPL kick
<jamest> I'm not saying he's a bad choice
<jamest> but I'm not saying he's a good one
<jamest> he's an interesting one
<chillywilly> are you running?
<jamest> no
<jamest> i don't get gnome either
<jamest> what is really scary
<jamest> is the whole gnuef needs to work in emacs backstory from the fsf
<jamest> imagine if the same requirements were made of gnome 
<jamest> :)
<chillywilly> huh?
<chillywilly> emacs backstory?
<jamest> the fsf was looking at using gnue for some internal stuff
<jamest> however the #1 requirement was that all data entry would be via emacs
<jamest> and all data files had to be maintainable via emacs
<chillywilly> what is your point?
ra3vat (ds@195.239.64.159) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> I am sure RMS doesn't expect Gnome to run in emacs
<jamest> My point is that they had no interest in a graphics setup with complex data storage
<chillywilly> so? they are old school CLI hackers
<jamest> RDBMS, why? just use a ascii file
<jamest> right
<jamest> that is what makes the GNOME thing interesting
<chillywilly> so if you support emacs
<chillywilly> then they will be ahppy
<chillywilly> woppdeedoo
<jamest> chillywilly: I'll do it if you write geas storage system that puts all data in human readable/editable flat file format
<jamest> as that was other requirement
<dneighbo> chillywilly i dont think you are getting the point
<chillywilly> duee
<dneighbo> you say they are old CLI hackers
<dneighbo> which is the point
<chillywilly> OIFML
<chillywilly> -> OIF
<chillywilly> Object Interchange Format
<chillywilly> human readable
<dneighbo> old CLI hackers cant expect to understand all the 'issues' of something like gnome or any gui desktop
<chillywilly> part of ODMG standard
<jamest> chillywilly: wonderfull, now that is your only file format you can use
<dneighbo> i dont think he is a bad choice
<dneighbo> btw
<dneighbo> just saying he is of value in a single place
<jamest> chillywilly: just be sure and whip us up the subsystems required to allow data mining and queries, inserts, locking, etc, etc
<dneighbo> and that is on the political and ethical/moral issues of gnome
<chillywilly> jamest all in the standard
<dneighbo> and thusly not a good 'comprehensive leader' for the gnome project :)
<jamest> great!
<jamest> I'll add emacs ui to the list then 
<dneighbo> i hope he gets on the board, just cause it will be fun to read the meeting notes :)
<chillywilly> what will it say if he does not get on ther board?
<jcater> jamest: not only emacs ui, but apparently an emacs dbdriver :)
<chillywilly> that will be a big blow for GNU
<dneighbo> Cambridge may sue Oracle, KPMG for failed system
<jcater> chillywilly: no, it won't
<nickr> whats wring with lips?
<chillywilly> they might as well rip the GNU out of their name
<nickr> err lisp
<jamest> jcater: nah, we'll use geas's IOF driver
<jamest> OIF
<dneighbo> this is like 5th failed ERP/CRM suing i have heard of in europe recently
<dneighbo> just an interesting note
<dneighbo> chillywilly its ALREADY BAD
<dneighbo> put it this way
<dneighbo> the FSF Manager who took them from 100k in operating revenue to over a Million in operating revenue and assests
<chillywilly> and KDE is more politically aligned with GNU/FSF?
<dneighbo> was mysteriously let go
<dneighbo> he now is the leader of the gnome foundation
<dneighbo> i am good friends with them both
<dneighbo> and at LWCE in SF
<dneighbo> i was used as an 'errand' boy to message things back and forth
<dneighbo> becuase the anomosity wsa still so hostile
<dneighbo> ** PSU please do not include this in the KC ** :)
<dneighbo> in a nutshell FSF had some gnome banners
<dneighbo> they didnt want to pay shipping and drayage on them and wanted to basically dump them on gnome foundation
<dneighbo> but wanted me to relay this 'nicely'
<dneighbo> gnome foundation did blanket thanks but no thanks, we want but have fsf ship to us
<dneighbo> etc etc
<dneighbo> so believe me things are 'tense' regardless of teh outcome of this election :)
<dneighbo> it mildly reminds me of a couple that married while young and had a few children and found out they had different goals in life
<dneighbo> so they decided to split up
<dneighbo> only the children force them to have a common bond
<dneighbo> so they must regularly cross paths
<jcater> heaven forbid gnome should be developed on the basis of providing the best solution...no, it must be a political statement :)
<dneighbo> and at every meeting there is an air of tension and such
<dneighbo> if it were a soap opera
<dneighbo> FSF is the father
<dneighbo> GNOME the mother
<dneighbo> the community of developers are the children
<dneighbo> GNOME leaves FSF
<dneighbo> and soon after shacks up with XIMIAN
<dneighbo> XIMIAN and GNOME have a child mono
<dneighbo> which makes FSF and some of the community upset
<dneighbo> so FSF goes has illegitimate child dotGNU
<dneighbo> dotGNU and mono are hostile towards one another
<dneighbo> many of the shared children (community) of GNOME and FSF dont know what to think and some pick sides, some stay neutral, some say mom and dad are nuts
<dneighbo> now in attempt, FSF is trying to take back custody of first child GNOME
<dneighbo> er wife
<dneighbo> GNOME
<dneighbo> sorry, i think this would be a funny story/analog even with specifics :)

<dneighbo> well FSF doesnt have pc, the abacus still works, dont fight it
<dneighbo> as to the dog gnome and fsf decided such luxuries were not compatiable with philosphy of no material possessions
<jcater> so ximian digitized it and made it an office assistant
<nickr>  hmm
<dneighbo> well the rumor is that ximian has started dabbling in illegal substances (prop software)
<dneighbo> and we all know that such things can be habit forming
<dneighbo> i think this is why FSF is getting so mad, he cant stand to see his ex love, gnome being treated this way
<dneighbo> so he is calling for an 'crisis intervention'
Action: Maniac tickles gnuebot
<jamest> wow
<jamest> dneighbo: think about your example for a second
<dneighbo> ok
<jcater> what are we?
<jamest> GNOMEs got involved with doing monkeys
<jamest> the little tramp
<dneighbo> huh?
<jcater> rofl
<jamest> GNOME was the wife
<jamest> hooked up with ximian and had babies
<jamest> isn't that interspecies stuff one of the rumors about the start of AIDS 
<dneighbo> well i suppose GNUe and any project of GNU is a concubine of FSF in a sense
<nickr> ximians file browser is nice though, wonder when that'll be in the standard gnome
<jamest> jcater: we're the unwanted little bastard neighbor kid that keeps breaking windows with our baseball

<jcater> hehe
<dneighbo> man there are goats on every corner in gilbert
<dneighbo> i finally figured out
<dneighbo> why,
<dneighbo> it started to bother me, as i was feeling paranoid, but it makes sense when you think like a farmer :)
<dneighbo> gilbert is huge for dairies, we have like 20 major ones
<jcater> dneighbo: look in your backyard
<dneighbo> and goats milk is prime source for feeding young calves as supplement for dairy cows
<jcater> I bet yours got loose
<dneighbo> i saw one i must get a picture of for a logo
<dneighbo> he was short compact (little but full of muscle)
<dneighbo> solid black
<dneighbo> with a wicked goatee
<dneighbo> and these long horns that were razor sharp
<jcater> put a red shirt and a baseball cap on him, and we're set
<dneighbo> that looked like they had been combed backwards
<dneighbo> he is at farm on edge of major thoroughfare
<dneighbo> most of the goats shy away to the corner in heavy traffic
<dneighbo> he stood on top of the dog house almost 'taunting' the car's drivers as they passed by
<dneighbo> kind of giving that 'you looking at me?  i know you're not looking at me!" attitude

<jamest> ok, read the i18n mail
<jamest> ra3vat: i see what you're after
<jamest> in the code however I'd like to do i18n native
<jamest> w/o the need for hacks for each language 
<jamest> the "          elif (1728 <= event.KeyCode() <= 1791):" stuff
<jamest> as far as the encoding= attribute I see no problems with that
<ra3vat> me too
<ra3vat> what that native would look like? 
<jamest> native?
<ra3vat>  <jamest> in the code however I'd like to do i18n native
<jamest> ah, my bad
<jamest> I'd like to support i18n with any i18n features built into the UIs and python itself
<jamest> maybe via unicode input scanning
<jamest> on the site.py thing
<ra3vat> so that uiEventTrap need to be rewritten, right?
<jamest> is there anyway we can override that setting in common's GBaseApp.py
<jamest> uiEventTrap needs to go away
<jamest> it's evil :)
<jcater> which setting?
<jamest> Most of the Python distributions I tested define
<jamest> "ascii" as a default encoding
<jamest> It blocks any non ascii simbols entered in label's
<jamest> text in forms (gfd files).
<jamest>  
[16:35] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<jamest> Can be changed if manually edit site.py to let
<jamest> encoding be defined from current locale:
<jamest> <from ra3vat's mail>
<ra3vat> override what setting of default encoding?
<jamest> override the unicode setting in the code you showed us
<ra3vat> but according to site.py setdefaultencoding deleted from namespace
<jamest> rather than edit site.py
<jamest> so that we call sys.setdefaultencoding() in GBaseApp at startup
<jamest> based upon locale info if available
<jcater> I'll look into it right now
<jamest> keep in mind I'm talking out my ass as I just read your mail and have done 0 looking into it
<jamest> jcater: hey now!
<jamest> i thought you wanted to play with the new mcmillan installer issues :)
<jcater> (read as, "I'll do a quick search on google")
<jamest> ah
<jcater> jamest: still setting up win computer
<ra3vat> it may be done through sitecustomize otherwise
Action: ra3vat looks at GBaseApp
<ra3vat> #
<ra3vat> # Remove sys.setdefaultencoding() so that users cannot change the
<ra3vat> # encoding after initialization.  The test for presence is needed when
<ra3vat> # this module is run as a script, because this code is executed twice.
<ra3vat> #
<ra3vat> if hasattr(sys, "setdefaultencoding"):
<ra3vat>     del sys.setdefaultencoding
<ra3vat>  
<ra3vat> </site.py>
<jamest> yes, I just found that in the module docs 
<jamest> so we can't get that
<jamest> however we do have a locale and a unicodedata module
<ra3vat> and last thing about encoding parameter in  def initFont(widget):
<ra3vat> it looks specific for UIwxpython diver
<ra3vat> driver
<jamest> i figure each driver will have a specific implemention 
<jamest> but if we could communicate between in backend and UI in unicode 
<jamest> then I assume we'd be ok
<jamest> except for the data storage issue
<jamest> again, I don't know what I'm talking about 
<ra3vat> ok, i'll look at locale and unicodedata modules
<ra3vat> thanks

<ra3vat> jcater: can't connect to postgres from windows machine
<ra3vat> error says:Exection could not create socket? 
<jcater> ack
<jcater> um
<jcater> what driver are you using?
<jcater> pypgsql or pygresql?
<ra3vat> pypgsql
<jcater> ok
<jcater> have you connected to this postgresql server from other machines?
<ra3vat> I have no other machines at the moment
<ra3vat> shouls I check those postgresql files about access control/
<jcater> did you start postgresql with the -i option (to accept tcp/ip connections)
<ra3vat> yes
<jcater> hmm
<mdean> you might need to set up pg_hba.conf to accept connections from other machines
<jcater> I'm looking
Action: jcater doesn't use postgresql too much, so I'm still learning all this
<mdean> $pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf (host based access) controls what addresses are allowed to connect
<mdean> by default, it only allows localhost on tcp/ip connections IIRC
<ra3vat> trying

<ra3vat> DB001: [C:\PYTHON21\gnue\common\dbdrivers\pypgsql\DBdriver:69]

<chillywilly> "The level of fines that would serve as a
<chillywilly> deterrent for cash rich Microsoft would be difficult to
<chillywilly> fathom, but one might make these fines deter more by
<chillywilly> directing the money to be paid into trust funds that would
<chillywilly> fund the development of free software, an endeavor that
<chillywilly> Microsoft has indicated it strongly opposes as a threat to
<chillywilly> its own monopoly.  This would give Microsoft a much greater
<chillywilly> incentive to abide by the agreement.

<Maniac> Mr_You: the question is, when they come knocking do you have any obligation to let them in?
