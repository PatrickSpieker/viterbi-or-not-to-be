<madlocke> greetings...
<jcater> madlocke: howdy
<jcater> how are you doing?
<madlocke> ok again...
<madlocke> jcater: you are workin' on gnuef too, right?
<jcater> yes, I am
<madlocke> a special part or just where work is needed?
<jcater> heheh.. I'm jamest's partner in crime :)
<jcater> where-ever work is needed
<madlocke> hehe... then i can come with my complaints to you too ;)
Action: jamest blinks
<jamest> madlocke?
<jamest> is it really you?
<jcater> madlocke: yes. I'll take complaints as well
<madlocke> hi jamest... yes this time i am writing from germany...
Action: jamest does a happy dance
<madlocke> was waiting for my phone company to give me better internet connection ... but think i have to wait more time :(
<jamest> forms 0.1.0 is coming out this weekend
<jamest> 0.3.0 (the next major release) is the UI rewrite release
<madlocke> i saw already the new version number in cvs ;)
<jamest> so we would love to get our paws on your code :)
<jamest> i know we have copyright assignment from you
<madlocke> yep you have...
<jamest> so I think it's just a matter of making sure your new stuff is
<jamest>   a) sane (or at least saner than what we have)
<madlocke> i want talk about few things before sending code...
<jamest>   b) able to support all the leet new features
<madlocke> i would call it ... erm ... evil ;)
<jamest> the talks or the code?
<madlocke> the code...
<madlocke> of course it supports already 3d views, a glove, and a support angel...
<madlocke> ... erm... maybe not ;)
<jamest> :)
<jamest> so what you want to talk about?
<madlocke> maybe it is a prob of my configuration here, but:
<madlocke> when i try to use an account for zipcode.gfd and
<madlocke> i use my normal account that also exists in postgres
<madlocke> it works...
<madlocke> for postgres i have no password defined...
<madlocke> for gnuef i can write any password... it accepts everything...
<jamest> yes
<madlocke> when logging in with another user, i.e. root, the account is not excepted...
<jamest> yes
<jamest> this is a postgresql issue
<madlocke> erm.. gr.. not excepted... accepted ;)
<madlocke> argl...
<madlocke> bad...
<jamest> you have a pg_hba.conf file
<jamest> where you setup trust for clients
<jcater> bbs... lunch
<madlocke> a what??? erm... think no
Nick change: jcater -> jcLunch
<madlocke> ok.. i see have to look more at postgres...
<madlocke> another thing...
<jamest> host         all         192.168.1.0   255.255.255.0     crypt  
<jamest> in that file should make it accept crypted passwords from the 192.168.1 network
<madlocke> ok thanks...
<madlocke> another thing...
<jamest> otherwise the normal "trust" option just says if the user is in db and the process connecting is owned by that user then it's ok to let him in
<jamest> yes?
<madlocke> when you write code in UIwxpython
<madlocke> that is used by UIbase
<madlocke> than i think it is a good idea to have
<madlocke> the required things already in a base class
<madlocke> i.e. UILoginHandler
<madlocke> in a base class or as base class ...
<jamest> madlocke: aggreed
<jamest> IIRC i started a bunch of little crap in UIwxpython that would be moved to UIbase
<jamest> but stalled out
<madlocke> ok... then can help you with this as soon as i have cvs write access...
<madlocke> will send you web ui later this day when i am back on windoows...
<jamest> rock
<madlocke> linux not configured correctly at the moment...
<jamest> hey!
<jamest> we can use windows testers too
<jamest> :)
<madlocke> need some packages and connection too slow and to expensive for this
<jamest> gotcha
<madlocke> gr.... i want one more monitor..
<madlocke> or some cables... have a monitor switch but no cables... :((
<jamest> :(
<jamest> I'll be out part of the weekend
<madlocke> think i will be able to solve this.. ;)
<madlocke> out part? sorry don't understand
<jamest> so if it's after 5PM my time (now 11:40AM)
<jamest> I will be away from a computer until late saturday
<madlocke> ah ok...
<jamest> i get to go play Farmer James 
<jamest> for the inlaws as the wifes father just had surgery
<jamest> and they need extra hands to help with the cattle
<madlocke> bad... is hard work i think...
<jamest> thankfully for them I know which end of the cow the food goes in
<madlocke> grin :)
<jamest> of course, that's about all I know about them
<madlocke> good start
<jamest> but I look forward to seeing your code
<jamest> we've got such plans for the new UI
<jamest> bwahahahaa
<madlocke> to use it you will need Webware from sourceforge.net
<madlocke> is there a list of ideas in a file somewhere?
<jamest> i don't think so
<jamest> i keep meaning to start one
<madlocke> btw, can you remove the old dir from cvs? (inside gnuef... it is empty)
<jamest> ?
<madlocke> dir called 'old'
<madlocke> ;)
<jamest> i think it is removed
<jamest> do a cvs update -Pd
<jamest> to remove unneeded dirs
<madlocke> erm... was checking out everything yesterday... (in a new dir)
<jamest> yip, it's not in my cvs updated today
<madlocke> ok :)
<jamest> madlocke: how far along is the UI code btw
<jamest> i knew you had it pulling up forms
<jamest> but was all the widget support there
<madlocke> it can display most things... the last i did was data exchange... some things work... buttons work...
<madlocke> input lines...
<madlocke> ...
<madlocke> i try with trigger.gfd, helloworld2.gfd, zipcode.gfd
<madlocke> another gfd that is important?
<jamest> that is a good start
<jamest> both zipcode examples would be important
<madlocke> ok...
<jamest> states.gfd IIRC
<jamest> and the tourture test 
<jamest> samples/track/forms/contact_manager.gfd
<jamest> which really pushes the backend a bit
<jamest> btw - all the samples in gnuef/samples should work in normal gnuef now
<jamest> bbiab
<madlocke> ok...
<jamest> back
<jamest> did you scrape the event system?
<jamest> scrap
<madlocke> i looked at some things and have some ideas... did not have a computer in russia... so was a bit difficult to work on it...
<madlocke> have more time now...
<jamest> ah
<jamest> we've all been really busy
<jamest> a bit of funny trivia
<jamest> we were planning a 0.1.0 release arround November (of 2000!)
<jamest> so only a year behind
<jamest> :)
<madlocke> hm... like ms ;)
<madlocke> btw does anyone of you know anything of this mono project?
<jamest> derek has followed it a bit
<jamest> i think
<madlocke> before i went to russia, i played a bit with soap... interesting...

<nickr> which is a tradename for donut holes
Action: dneighbo falls over
<dneighbo> its madlock
<dneighbo> e
<dneighbo> btw: mono is crap :)
<dneighbo> imho
<nickr> whyfor?
<dneighbo> um because its just a 'copy' of microsoft
<dneighbo> and with little gain
<dneighbo> let me explain
<dneighbo> IMHO .net is many things
<dneighbo> one of which is something called C#
<dneighbo> when you look at what C# does 98% of it is done in java or python already
<nickr> thats not a reason not to develope it
<nickr> thats like saying we already have email programs why make more?
<nickr> I meuan about c#
<dneighbo> so to me C# is nothing more than m$ trying to take java's market share and screw sun
<dneighbo> then you have the interoperbility of .net
<dneighbo> which says you write something that can be used by say vb, c, etc all using SOAP
<dneighbo> well ask me
<dneighbo> java / python support soap, corba, etc etc
<nickr> true
<dneighbo> ad nausem to do this
<nickr> I'm not satisfied with any object oriented C dialects I've used
<dneighbo> so once again its just M$ trying to CONTROL this
<dneighbo> the last part of .net i see is the 'passport' thing or 'hailstorm' thing
<nickr> that much seems clear, yes
<dneighbo> which i wont even comment on 
<nickr> bad idea
<nickr> there is no authority anywhere
<dneighbo> but mono basically says they are doing the C# and SOAP thing
<dneighbo> which to me is a WASTE
<dneighbo> dotGNU on the other hand is doing a passport equiv
<dneighbo> now why i dont like passport equiv
<dneighbo> i think there is SOME value in trying to make an alterative so microshaft cant control the 'internet' so to speak
<chillywilly> dotgnu is doing it all dude
<nickr> theres already a hailstorm clone
<dneighbo> from what i have seen of mono it is basically a linux implementation of what microsoft is doing minus passport
<nickr> snowstorm or whatever
<chillywilly> postable.net is so they can be downward compatible with .NET
<chillywilly> portable.nety
<dneighbo> which to me is silly and a waste of time
<chillywilly> well
<dneighbo> but i wont go there :)
<chillywilly> mono could be useful
<chillywilly> but they will ot cooperate with dotgnu
<chillywilly> s/ot/not
<nickr> I think someone should make a good OO language
<dneighbo> chillywilly to me it only appears to give credibility to microsoft
<dneighbo> who once controlling hte domain
<nickr> all the power of C with twice the systems modelling  with half the tedium
<dneighbo> will readily shut mono down via legistlature or other means
<chillywilly> well M$ does have come clout don't you think?
<chillywilly> we need to protect ourselves
<dneighbo> just right up front i can see them patenting most of .net
<dneighbo> and fscking ximian to all hell
<chillywilly> yep
<dneighbo> not to MENTION have you seen evolution
<chillywilly> that might happen
<chillywilly> btw
<dneighbo> it looks identical to outlook
<chillywilly> dotgnu ppl expect to get sued ny M$
<dneighbo> now if Apple can sue all these guys for making 'aqua' themes and shut their asses down
<nickr> I think that was the idea
<chillywilly> s/ny/my
<chillywilly> er
<dneighbo> what do you think M$ can do to ximian about evolution?
<chillywilly> s/ny/by
<nickr> All my windows friends LOVE Evolution
<dneighbo> i mean aqua was just graphics
<dneighbo> evolution 2 outlook is down to look, feel, feature
<chillywilly> ximian tends to just copy M$ though
<dneighbo> im sure they have to have 'some patents' on some of that
<dneighbo> and if they dont they could readily get them
<dneighbo> for example
<dneighbo> the way they have the big icons on the left
<dneighbo> that is a windowapi thing called an application frame
<dneighbo> they were the first to do it
<nickr> well if they make legal moves against evolution it'll simply change
<dneighbo> and gave borland rights to it etc
<dneighbo> they patent that
<dneighbo> and bam sue ximian to remove it
<nickr> The presentation is the only thing they could get ximian on, and thats easy to change.
<dneighbo> nickr: yes easy to change but alienate users
<dneighbo> basically i will say m$ has done historically fairly well on UI design
<dneighbo> i dont think free software has
<dneighbo> i wont go naming apps :)
<nickr> True
<nickr> at least gui apps
<dneighbo> so it would be IMO a big blow to make them redo the evolution GUI
<nickr> I don't know
<nickr> I think it could be made different enough yet still very good
<dneighbo> ESPECIALLY if the patent violation mandated that evolution be stopped distributed
<chillywilly> dneighbo do you see dotgnu and GNUe working together as there has been lots of talk about middleware and forms ui on the dotgnu developers list....of course I mentioned GNUe when this was said
<dneighbo> until it was fixed
<dneighbo> it could be months
<jcater> dneighbo: have you tested my changes yet?
<dneighbo> chillywilly i dont care if they choose to work with us or not, im sure they wont
<dneighbo> for us i expect gcomm to encompass that
<chillywilly> dneighbo "they" are "us"
Action: chillywilly is also on the steering committee of dotGNU
<chillywilly> :P
<ajmitch> chillywilly: you are now?
<dneighbo> i.e. if dotGNU has some prop call or procedure stuff gcomm interfaces cna be written to talk to it
<chillywilly> ajmitch well I am working on it\
<dneighbo> its all about choice
<dneighbo> jcater: no dont have cvs access at work
<dneighbo> will have to check tongith
<chillywilly> dneighbo I just see a lot of areas where dotGNU could use GNUe tools as a base
<chillywilly> dunno what will happen though
<jamest> a small victory on the mac os front
<jamest> http://alldunn.com/wxPython/stuff/wxMacPython-Demo.jpg 
<jamest> wxWindows on macOS X
<chillywilly> what do you guys think about RMS running for the Gnome Board?
<jcater> halleluah
<jamest> er, wxpython
<jcater> chillywilly: dunno, depends on his motivation
<dneighbo> jcater: i agree
<dneighbo> i think he would be good in sense of keeping them on toes
<dneighbo> but honestly he is so out of touch with gnome it oculd hurt
<chillywilly> I we need RMS there
<dneighbo> as his main focus would probably be on the smaller things
<chillywilly> think
<dneighbo> i.e. i think freedom is important above all else
<chillywilly> he's only going to play a political role
<dneighbo> but crap most of gnome is LGPL
<chillywilly> you know that
<dneighbo> so ximian can do what the hell they want with it as can red hat
<chillywilly> I trust redhat
<nickr> guh
<chillywilly> ximian I don't trust
<dneighbo> so his ability to do 'anything' on that front is limited other than get people mad at him
<dneighbo> i would much rather see alan cox on it
<chillywilly> well he can't force anything but he can use his influence
<dneighbo> as alan is pro GPL
<dneighbo> knows kernel space well
<dneighbo> and is a good 'engineer' and thusly would help them in many areas IMHO
<chillywilly> alan steped down though
<dneighbo> i know
<dneighbo> i said would RATHER see alan
<dneighbo> not we would see alan :)
<dneighbo> most gnomies dont care for RMS so i doubt he will be elected in
<chillywilly> that's not true
<dneighbo> seeing how ximian developers all have votes they probably have over 50 votes
<chillywilly> there are some ximian ppl who are also Free Software guys even
<dneighbo> and im pretty certain the majority seniment there would be to keep him out
<dneighbo> as he is 'bad for business'
<chillywilly> Michael Meeks being one of them
<dneighbo> chillywilly you misquote me
<dneighbo> most gnomies are FSF guys
<dneighbo> HOWEVER being a FSF guy != caring for RMS
<chillywilly> I didn't quote you
<dneighbo> my statement was most gnomies DONT CARE FOR RMS
<dneighbo> not most gnomies dont agree with free software
<dneighbo> for example mmeeks
<dneighbo> i did followup for RMS with him on gnome basic to iron out some details
<chillywilly> dneighbo you yourself has said Gnome needs a real "leader"
<chillywilly> who better than RMS?
<dneighbo> mike said basically tell him i agree to everythign but i refuse to do a webpage on GNU.org and if he cant deal with that to bad im sick of his inane requests
<jcater> chillywilly: I know you are going to flame me
<dneighbo> rms would not make a good gnome leader
<jcater> chillywilly: but I think RMS is a better "philosopher" that a "leader"
<dneighbo> he makes a good free software leader
<dneighbo> in sense that its very 'idealistic'
<dneighbo> and you can be eccentric and idealistic when peddling philosphy
<chillywilly> well RMS is a consulting philospher, imho and not a "leader"
<jcater> yeah, what derel said :)
<jcater> derek, even
<dneighbo> HOWEVER to peddle a desktop to the masses and corporate america you need a much different animal
<dneighbo> i think the leader for gnome needs to be two things
<dneighbo> or they need two leaders
<jcater> 1. big balls
<jcater> 2. lots o patience
<jcater> (sorry)
<dneighbo> one needs a strong vision of where going and how to conquer enterprises (why i dont like him a shining example of this personality is Michael Dell)
<dneighbo> jcater btw that equates to your #1 (big balls)
<dneighbo> and the other quality is someone to clean house in the state of engineering, to make dependencies and architectures soudn and sold and enforce good habits (good examples of this are linus and alan with the kernel)
<chillywilly> i still see no reason why rms input should not be felt as the Gnome Board has nothing to do with hacking it is totally political and PR related
<dneighbo> jcater btw: this relates to your #2 which is lots o patience :)
<jcater> lol
<chillywilly> dneighbo the architecture is getting a lot better now
<jamest> an odd question
<chillywilly> another reason why I will not start using KDE, because I believe Gnome is going in the right direction
<jamest> but RMS won't even use a web browser last I knew
<chillywilly> jamest that totally irrelevant
<dneighbo> not really
<dneighbo> if the man doesnt even use gnome
<jamest> refuses to in fact
<chillywilly> he must be communicating with ppl some how
<dneighbo> its hard to believe he has any clue as to the things going on with in it
<dneighbo> chillywilly he uses lynx OCASSIONAL
<jamest> so I'm not sure he will "get" gnome
<chillywilly> he does "get" gnome
<jcater> how can he "get" it?
<chillywilly> he replied to my message once where I call "Linux" a geeks OS and then mentioned Gnome being an effort to make computers easier for regular ppl
<chillywilly> he gets that muc at least
<jamest> that's boilerplate talk
<chillywilly> much
<jamest> i can say the same thing
<jamest> however if he won't use a browser
<jamest> and if he still has this emacs/lisp fixation
<jamest> (not saying he does, just if)
<jamest> then quite a bit of gnome starts to become nothing more than this grey box
<chillywilly> why does that matter you all said that they need to be put in check with regard to freedom iussues, who better to do that thenm RMS...maybe he can get them off of their damn LGPL kick
<jamest> I'm not saying he's a bad choice
<jamest> but I'm not saying he's a good one
<jamest> he's an interesting one
<chillywilly> are you running?
<jamest> no
<jamest> i don't get gnome either
<jamest> what is really scary
<jamest> is the whole gnuef needs to work in emacs backstory from the fsf
<jamest> imagine if the same requirements were made of gnome 
<jamest> :)
<chillywilly> huh?
<chillywilly> emacs backstory?
<jamest> the fsf was looking at using gnue for some internal stuff
<jamest> however the #1 requirement was that all data entry would be via emacs
<jamest> and all data files had to be maintainable via emacs
<chillywilly> what is your point?
ra3vat (ds@195.239.64.159) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> I am sure RMS doesn't expect Gnome to run in emacs
<jamest> My point is that they had no interest in a graphics setup with complex data storage
<chillywilly> so? they are old school CLI hackers
<jamest> RDBMS, why? just use a ascii file
<jamest> right
<jamest> that is what makes the GNOME thing interesting
<chillywilly> so if you support emacs
<chillywilly> then they will be ahppy
<chillywilly> woppdeedoo
<jamest> chillywilly: I'll do it if you write geas storage system that puts all data in human readable/editable flat file format
<jamest> as that was other requirement
<dneighbo> chillywilly i dont think you are getting the point
<chillywilly> duee
<dneighbo> you say they are old CLI hackers
<dneighbo> which is the point
<chillywilly> OIFML
<chillywilly> -> OIF
<chillywilly> Object Interchange Format
<chillywilly> human readable
<dneighbo> old CLI hackers cant expect to understand all the 'issues' of something like gnome or any gui desktop
<chillywilly> part of ODMG standard
<jamest> chillywilly: wonderfull, now that is your only file format you can use
<dneighbo> i dont think he is a bad choice
<dneighbo> btw
<dneighbo> just saying he is of value in a single place
<jamest> chillywilly: just be sure and whip us up the subsystems required to allow data mining and queries, inserts, locking, etc, etc
<dneighbo> and that is on the political and ethical/moral issues of gnome
<chillywilly> jamest all in the standard
<dneighbo> and thusly not a good 'comprehensive leader' for the gnome project :)
<jamest> great!
<jamest> I'll add emacs ui to the list then 
<dneighbo> i hope he gets on the board, just cause it will be fun to read the meeting notes :)
<chillywilly> what will it say if he does not get on ther board?
<jcater> jamest: not only emacs ui, but apparently an emacs dbdriver :)
<chillywilly> that will be a big blow for GNU
<dneighbo> Cambridge may sue Oracle, KPMG for failed system
<jcater> chillywilly: no, it won't
<nickr> whats wring with lips?
<chillywilly> they might as well rip the GNU out of their name
<nickr> err lisp
<jamest> jcater: nah, we'll use geas's IOF driver
<jamest> OIF
<dneighbo> this is like 5th failed ERP/CRM suing i have heard of in europe recently
<dneighbo> just an interesting note
<dneighbo> chillywilly its ALREADY BAD
<dneighbo> put it this way
<dneighbo> the FSF Manager who took them from 100k in operating revenue to over a Million in operating revenue and assests
<chillywilly> and KDE is more politically aligned with GNU/FSF?
<dneighbo> was mysteriously let go
<dneighbo> he now is the leader of the gnome foundation
<dneighbo> i am good friends with them both
<dneighbo> and at LWCE in SF
<dneighbo> i was used as an 'errand' boy to message things back and forth
<dneighbo> becuase the anomosity wsa still so hostile
<dneighbo> ** PSU please do not include this in the KC ** :)
<dneighbo> in a nutshell FSF had some gnome banners
<dneighbo> they didnt want to pay shipping and drayage on them and wanted to basically dump them on gnome foundation
<dneighbo> but wanted me to relay this 'nicely'
<dneighbo> gnome foundation did blanket thanks but no thanks, we want but have fsf ship to us
<dneighbo> etc etc
<dneighbo> so believe me things are 'tense' regardless of teh outcome of this election :)
<dneighbo> it mildly reminds me of a couple that married while young and had a few children and found out they had different goals in life
<dneighbo> so they decided to split up
<dneighbo> only the children force them to have a common bond
<dneighbo> so they must regularly cross paths
<jcater> heaven forbid gnome should be developed on the basis of providing the best solution...no, it must be a political statement :)
<dneighbo> and at every meeting there is an air of tension and such
<dneighbo> if it were a soap opera
<dneighbo> FSF is the father
<dneighbo> GNOME the mother
<dneighbo> the community of developers are the children
<dneighbo> GNOME leaves FSF
<dneighbo> and soon after shacks up with XIMIAN
<dneighbo> XIMIAN and GNOME have a child mono
<dneighbo> which makes FSF and some of the community upset
<dneighbo> so FSF goes has illegitimate child dotGNU
<dneighbo> dotGNU and mono are hostile towards one another
<dneighbo> many of the shared children (community) of GNOME and FSF dont know what to think and some pick sides, some stay neutral, some say mom and dad are nuts
<dneighbo> now in attempt, FSF is trying to take back custody of first child GNOME
<dneighbo> er wife
<dneighbo> GNOME
<dneighbo> sorry, i think this would be a funny story/analog even with specifics :)
<jcater> lol

Maniac (user1@anolas01-p131.mts.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> well FSF doesnt have pc, the abacus still works, dont fight it
<dneighbo> as to the dog gnome and fsf decided such luxuries were not compatiable with philosphy of no material possessions
<jcater> so ximian digitized it and made it an office assistant
<nickr>  hmm
<dneighbo> well the rumor is that ximian has started dabbling in illegal substances (prop software)
<dneighbo> and we all know that such things can be habit forming
<dneighbo> i think this is why FSF is getting so mad, he cant stand to see his ex love, gnome being treated this way
<dneighbo> so he is calling for an 'crisis intervention'
Action: Maniac tickles gnuebot
<jamest> wow
<jamest> dneighbo: think about your example for a second
<dneighbo> ok
<jcater> what are we?
<jamest> GNOMEs got involved with doing monkeys
<jamest> the little tramp
<dneighbo> huh?
<jcater> rofl
<jamest> GNOME was the wife
<jamest> hooked up with ximian and had babies
<jamest> isn't that interspecies stuff one of the rumors about the start of AIDS 
<dneighbo> well i suppose GNUe and any project of GNU is a concubine of FSF in a sense
<nickr> ximians file browser is nice though, wonder when that'll be in the standard gnome
<jamest> jcater: we're the unwanted little bastard neighbor kid that keeps breaking windows with our baseball
<dneighbo> jamest: thast more accurate
<dneighbo> the neighbors kid is fitting (pun intended)
<jamest> jcater: we also like to watch the monkey loving going on next door thru our telescope
<jcater> hehe
<dneighbo> man there are goats on every corner in gilbert
<dneighbo> i finally figured out
<dneighbo> why,
<dneighbo> it started to bother me, as i was feeling paranoid, but it makes sense when you think like a farmer :)
<dneighbo> gilbert is huge for dairies, we have like 20 major ones
<jcater> dneighbo: look in your backyard
<dneighbo> and goats milk is prime source for feeding young calves as supplement for dairy cows
<jcater> I bet yours got loose
<dneighbo> i saw one i must get a picture of for a logo
<dneighbo> he was short compact (little but full of muscle)
<dneighbo> solid black
<dneighbo> with a wicked goatee
<dneighbo> and these long horns that were razor sharp
<jcater> put a red shirt and a baseball cap on him, and we're set
<dneighbo> that looked like they had been combed backwards
<dneighbo> he is at farm on edge of major thoroughfare
<dneighbo> most of the goats shy away to the corner in heavy traffic
<dneighbo> he stood on top of the dog house almost 'taunting' the car's drivers as they passed by
<dneighbo> kind of giving that 'you looking at me?  i know you're not looking at me!" attitude
<dneighbo> well off to parent goat conference

<jamest> ok, read the i18n mail
<jamest> ra3vat: i see what you're after
<jamest> in the code however I'd like to do i18n native
<jamest> w/o the need for hacks for each language 
<jamest> the "          elif (1728 <= event.KeyCode() <= 1791):" stuff
<jamest> as far as the encoding= attribute I see no problems with that
<ra3vat> me too
<ra3vat> what that native would look like? 
<jamest> native?
<ra3vat>  <jamest> in the code however I'd like to do i18n native
<jamest> ah, my bad
<jamest> I'd like to support i18n with any i18n features built into the UIs and python itself
<jamest> maybe via unicode input scanning
<jamest> on the site.py thing
<ra3vat> so that uiEventTrap need to be rewritten, right?
<jamest> is there anyway we can override that setting in common's GBaseApp.py
<jamest> uiEventTrap needs to go away
<jamest> it's evil :)
<jcater> which setting?
<jamest> Most of the Python distributions I tested define
<jamest> "ascii" as a default encoding
<jamest> It blocks any non ascii simbols entered in label's
<jamest> text in forms (gfd files).
<jamest>  
[16:35] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<jamest> Can be changed if manually edit site.py to let
<jamest> encoding be defined from current locale:
<jamest> <from ra3vat's mail>
<ra3vat> override what setting of default encoding?
<jamest> override the unicode setting in the code you showed us
<ra3vat> but according to site.py setdefaultencoding deleted from namespace
<jamest> rather than edit site.py
<jamest> so that we call sys.setdefaultencoding() in GBaseApp at startup
<jamest> based upon locale info if available
<jcater> I'll look into it right now
<jamest> keep in mind I'm talking out my ass as I just read your mail and have done 0 looking into it
<jamest> jcater: hey now!
<jamest> i thought you wanted to play with the new mcmillan installer issues :)
<jcater> (read as, "I'll do a quick search on google")
<jamest> ah
<jcater> jamest: still setting up win computer
<ra3vat> it may be done through sitecustomize otherwise
Action: ra3vat looks at GBaseApp
<ra3vat> #
<ra3vat> # Remove sys.setdefaultencoding() so that users cannot change the
<ra3vat> # encoding after initialization.  The test for presence is needed when
<ra3vat> # this module is run as a script, because this code is executed twice.
<ra3vat> #
<ra3vat> if hasattr(sys, "setdefaultencoding"):
<ra3vat>     del sys.setdefaultencoding
<ra3vat>  
<ra3vat> </site.py>
<jamest> yes, I just found that in the module docs 
<jamest> so we can't get that
<jamest> however we do have a locale and a unicodedata module
<ra3vat> and last thing about encoding parameter in  def initFont(widget):
<ra3vat> it looks specific for UIwxpython diver
<ra3vat> driver
<jamest> i figure each driver will have a specific implemention 
<jamest> but if we could communicate between in backend and UI in unicode 
<jamest> then I assume we'd be ok
<jamest> except for the data storage issue
<jamest> again, I don't know what I'm talking about 
<ra3vat> ok, i'll look at locale and unicodedata modules
<ra3vat> thanks
<jamest> oh ra3vat
<jamest> the not sure if you were hear earlier

<chillywilly> Unlike tangible property, ideas and expressions are not susceptible to natural scarcity. As Jefferson wrote of copyright, ?Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.? 
<dtm> [03:18:07] < loic > Milosch: I'm working on re-implementation of Savannah (savannah.gnu.org) to use phpGroupWare as a codebase instead of the SourceForge software.
<dtm> now why in the heck would anybody do that?
<dtm> i'm just curious.
<chillywilly> cause VA Linux is evil, but why phpGW?
<chillywilly> I dunno though
<chillywilly> does phpGW have the  same types of project stuff as SF?
<chillywilly> I also heard that the SF code is a mess
<dtm> well ok, if SF code is such a mess that it's a tossup between SF and phpgw, then i'd take phpgw.
<chillywilly> plus phpGW is a GNU Project :)
<dtm> but i was just curious coz SF already scales
<dtm> but that makes sense
<dtm> thanks for explaining it all to me, bruh

<derek> hi all
<mdean> guten morgen, Herr Neighbors
<jcater> howdy
<derek> moin herr dean
<jcater> masta d
<derek> ich bin der masta
<derek> er
<derek> ich bin der meister
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I understood the second about as well as the first
<jcater> early start, derek?
<derek> iirc 'ich bin' == i am
<mdean> ja
<derek> jcater: the early coder catches the bug
<jcater> you can have it
<jcater> have y'all seen http://www.mosix.org/ ?
<derek> jcater: you see it works like this ...
<mdean> jcater: yup - even before they GPL'd their code
<derek> the masta bird catches the bug then chews it up and spits in it in coders mouth
<jcater> mdean: you used it?
<mdean> jcater: it raised a big fuss in the Linux community
<jcater> oh
Action: jcater keeps out of touch
<mdean> jcater: nope - just kinda follow it once in a while
<mdean> derek: do you have a visual image?
<jcater> lol
<derek> of the catching or the spitting?
<derek> ;)
Action: derek remembers mosix now a bit
<jcater> is this generally the same as beowolf?
<jcater> generally=conceptually
<jcater> mmm
Action: jcater is baking strawberry muffins
<mdean> derek: I had another idea about the trigger language-neutral issue
<mdean> derek: tho I'm think it will not be a very popular idea
<derek> jcater: you suck (wrt to fresh muffins)
<derek> i dont think it is same as beowoulf
<derek> it is same 'concept' of 'clusered linux'
<derek> but i think there are like two or three 'ways' to approach clustering
<derek> iirc beowoulf and mosix approach in different ways
<derek> but i could be wrong
<derek> also there is mission critical linux that does clustering
<derek> and i think turbolinux has some clustering stuff too
<derek> i think most of them are 'kernel' extensions
<derek> except for beowoulf (but i could be grossly mistaken)
<derek> mdean: what is that?
<derek> we live on 'non popular' ideas
<jcater> yes, we do
<jcater> it wouldn't be fun otherwise
<derek> thus our support for J2EE, SOAP, .NET etc
<mdean> http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/
<derek> i told you my xul stories
<derek> so actually im a fairly big fan of mozilla :)
<derek> i think we could 'support spidermonkey'
<mdean> personally, I think that would kick ass - since it would make GNUe web forms triggers almost no-brainer
<derek> but it would just be another language
<jcater> yip, I agree
<mdean> so is there no value in using a more neutral language?
<jcater> what d'ya mean??
<mdean> well - I mean: use spidermonkey as the language the forms triggers are written in
<derek> yes and no
<derek> the idea was to make it so each development haus wouldnt have to learn a 'new language'
<derek> so the perl house could use perl to do rules
<derek> the php house coud php to do rules etc
<mdean> yes but:
<mdean> you are tied to a language currently in your forms
<derek> if we were going to go with one language i would choose python over spidermonkey
<mdean> and you probably don't want to embed triggers in every supported language
<derek> mdean: yes but that is short term only
<derek> our 'standard' language will be python for triggers
<mdean> ok - so I'm missing the big picture then?
<derek> and our base packages will be python triggers but we want to let any language be used
<derek> and im sure some will 'convert'
<derek> so you might see say
<derek> like wxWindows has wxGTK, wxMotif, wxMac etc
<derek> you might see GNUe Accounting (perl)
<derek> GNUe Accounting (python)
<derek> etc
<derek> we would only concentrate on the python rules
<derek> but if someone that just loved ruby or perl or php or javascript wanted to maintain a concurrent langugage we would let them
<mdean> I think that deemphasizes the value of component based apps tho
<derek> yes and no
<derek> believe me i struggle with this one a lot
<derek> i think as far as GNUe applications (from gnue) the SAP rival goes we will ONLY concentrate on python based 
<derek> BUT gnue is also a tool that you can use independently
<derek> here i see value in being able to 'choose' a language
<derek> say i have an existing system written perl, that i have out grown
<derek> if i had separated biz logic i might be able to reuse a good portion of my code in gnue
<derek> as well as not have curve of learning python
<derek> sometimes when i think about it, for speed sake i think (development not execution) i think we are crazy to support more than one
<derek> and think we just support python
<derek> and if we lose a few folks so be it
<mdean> I'm just concerned about reinventing the wheel for the sake of doing it in another language
<derek> i think our stance is we will simply write the ability to couple another language
<derek> and leave it at that
<derek> GNUe core team will not focus energy on adding a bunch of languages
<derek> or 're duplicating' efforts to make sure there is a perl and php and python version of our applications
<mdean> yes, but you don't want to design yourself into a corner either (which I don't think you're doing anyway)
<derek> which is what i think you are saying seems superflous (and with that i agree)
<derek> but some people are STUBBORN and insist on their language 
<derek> in which case if they want to spend the time rewriting all the gnue apps in their language more power to them :)
<derek> just means more choice for the user
<mdean> like assembly language programmers who want their macro assembler written in assembler - pointless ;)
Action: derek vows to beat gnue core members that suggest using their time to do this :)
<jcater> it is worth adding that if someone is simply wanting to extend our packages, they wouldn't have to rewrite the base in their language
<derek> jcater: that is true too
<derek> nothing says you cant mix and match
<derek> i.e. have base with python and add a custom trigger in perl
<mdean> jcater: I realize that - I'm more concerned with having to have the appropriate platform depending on form trigger language
<mdean> and doing this would be a big boost to the web side of forms
<mdean> but
<mdean> feh - children interrupted train of thought

<derek> im not familiar with it
<derek> if its web based
<ra3vat> jcater: w/o password
<derek> and the files are on your postgres server its possible that its not using tcp/ip
<derek> is your postgres server on win32 or on unix?
<ra3vat> derek: no, it's a win32 application
<ra3vat> postgres is on unix machine
<jcater> and the linux machine name is ics? 
<jcater> and the win machine is resolving this name?
<ra3vat> derek: pgadmin.postgresql.org

<Mr_You> I still don't understand your question
<Mr_You> oh
<ra3vat> why is is Access so bad besides it is from MS?
<Mr_You> well... I don't like Access because #1=M$.. and #2 I found out that it randomly loses data.. not sure how they fixed that or if they even have.. cause supposedly fixing the problem could also lose data.. not sure whatever came out of that.. it was a big deal because a lot of doctor offices use Access.. so there are big chances some doctors offices have lost data and don't even realize it
<Mr_You> so those are my reasons.. 
<Mr_You> but probably the biggest reason is I just don't enjoy using M$ products, but I do require an OS on any machine and sometimes it happens to have and M$ OS on it ;-)
<Mr_You> but I stay away from jobs that are majority Windows-work related
<ra3vat> and then they are healing us, it's scary :)
<ra3vat> Mr_You: thanks
<Mr_You> yeah..
<Mr_You> well I would say that most hospitals are probably not using Access..
<Mr_You> unless its super small
<Mr_You> but yeah doctors heal us and their offices could be ;-)
<Mr_You> most major hospitals have used unix servers for years I believe

[21:00] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<jamest> so, did you play w/ mcmillan any?
<jcater> I haven't GNUe'd much at all since we last spoke
<jamest> ah
<jamest> well, today didn't go as planned 
<jcater> I polished designer's menu a little bit
<jamest> so I have a ton of homework for tomorrow
<jcater> ah
<jamest> I'll try and gnue later sunday afternoon or evening
<jcater> ok
<jamest> you worked on the menu eh?
<jcater> Just a little
<jcater> cleaned up a few oddities
<jamest> added the Help->Do my work for me. menu option
<jamest> ?
<jcater> no
<jcater> BUT
<jcater> it will tell you that you have unsaved changes if you try to Close or Exit 
<jcater> :)
<jcater> that's about all I've done
<jcater> well, I spent some time w/ra3vat today
<jamest> :)
<jcater> I had to patch pypgsql's connect script
<jcater> as it worked for you and I under windows
<jamest> again?
<jcater> but not for him
<jamest> damn
<jcater> I changed it to the host::dbname:user:pass:: format
<jcater> and it worked for him
<jcater> (and still worked for me too)
<jcater> in retrospect, I wonder if some of his settings files
<jcater> were not in ASCII
<jcater> and when I modified the DBdriver to do a "%s", it converted
<jcater> I see no reason why old format wouldn't work and the new one would, 
<jcater> but that's how it worked out
<jcater> btw
<jcater> I'm doing a comprehensive README.databases
<jcater> (have been for last 1 1/2 hours)
<jcater> lists all the drivers we support and what they expect in connections.conf
<jamest> um
<jcater> um?
<jamest> you mean that the connect string I originally had worked?
<jamest> and that the new stuff didn't?
<jcater> no
<jcater> not at all
<jamest> so instead of user=%s
<jamest> you have host::dbname:user:pass::
<jamest> as the string?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> that's how there examples are
<jamest> sigh
<jcater> and he used the examples (basic.py IIRC) on his windows machine to verify it was our driver and not
<jcater> some connections problem
<jcater> yes, sigh
<jcater> I spent a few hours going thru the basics
<jcater> (are you sure your dbname is right? can you ping the unqualified host?)
<jcater> but he was using pgAdmin on windows
<jcater> so that kinda disqualified some PostgreSQL problem :)
<jamest> lol
<jamest> has madlocke been arround today?
<jcater> nope
<jamest> drat
<jcater> he said yesterday he'd be back in a week
<jcater> (iirc)
<jcater> well, I'll be!
<jcater> PygreSQL released 3.2
<jcater> and it supports windows
<jamest> ah,
<jamest> but try and find a binary
<jamest> :)
<jcater> :)p
<jamest> they didn't have a 3.2 binary last week
<jcater> nor this week
<jamest> we still want a release this weekend?
<jcater> if possible
<jcater> you have time?
<jamest> i can make time on Sun
<jcater> this README is last thing I plan on doing
<jamest> cool
<jcater> derek's forms passed the test
<jamest> did he then retest the older forms
<jamest> to make sure they still work?
<jcater> I dunno

<Maniac> nickr: hi
<gemcat> hi
<Maniac> nickr: rumour has it you have some concept of a document management system for GNUe?
<gemcat> i have been reading up on xml - what use do you plan to make of it?
<nickr> Maniac: Rumor is correct
<nickr> gemcat: xml is used heavily throughout gnue
<gemcat> well my question was philosophy - what are your aims?
<nickr> philosophy?
<gemcat> i think to be successful you need a very strong database interface - are you using xml for that?
<Isomer> AFAIK no databases support XML transactions
<mdean> MSSQL 2k does
<nickr> the database interface, and most other interfaces, are based on CORBA afaik.
<gemcat> there is a lot of discussion
<gemcat> actually there are several 'engines' that generate xml from databases
<ajmitch> hey Isomer
<gemcat> the ticklish thought is what if you have a really huge set of documents
<reinhard> gemcat: we are doing xml _from_ database in the reports module
<reinhard> and we have looked at the xml query language from the gnome-db project
<reinhard> and we decided to stick with SQL for the db access
<gemcat> i am really excited about what you are doing
<reinhard> because SQL is sufficiently standardized
<reinhard> and supported natively by virtually every db
<gemcat> the sybase interface is sql via the java engine
<gemcat> one feature of that is the ability to choose what is done server side and client side

<nickr> Hi.
<gemcat> has any there been any success recruiting from the many small enterprise related projects at sourceforge?
<gemcat> it looks like several could fit nicely - expecially the fundraiser and the bbs ones
Maniac (darryl@h24-82-132-209.wp.shawcable.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<nickr> I'm terribly board.
<nickr> Is there a guide somewhere to building 2 teir apps with gnuef etc?
<Maniac> nickr: you could explain to me your plans for a doc management sytem :)
<nickr> Maniac: Sure, hmm
<nickr> The basic premise is a system in which each of three componants are intended to be operated by different entities (of course they could all be operated as one also)
<nickr> hrm so theres no internal trust between the componants
<nickr> bascially there are two major elements, and a sort of combinator, there is a Metastore a Physicalstore and the DocuStore
<Maniac> ok
<nickr> The physical storesimply stores blocks of data under a key
<nickr> like a sort of filesystem
<nickr> but without any metadata
<nickr> hrmm, maybe I should go back to hov the system sees documents
<Maniac> ok
<nickr> It sees documents as an identifier wich is associated with several unchangeable instances
<nickr> so its like a permininant versioning system
<nickr> you have, say, document Foo, and Foo has several instances, Bar, Baz and Quux which are considered to be 'versions' of Foo
<nickr> The cananical Foo could notionally be the newest or the oldest or whatever, depending on the application build ons the system
<nickr> Each instance may be created or destroyed or modified until it is 'committed', at which point it becomes immutable
<nickr> so anyway, the metastore indexes and keeps track of certain metadata associated with each document
<nickr> (and each instance)
<nickr> the phystore actually stores the documents themselves
<nickr> well the data associated with the metadata, which could be anything really
<nickr> the docustore is the combinator wihch talks to bothof the other major subsystems
<nickr> hmm
<nickr> this is the underlying layer
<nickr> lots of different apps would be build on top of this system
<nickr> such as an 'organic document system' which would essentially add templating
<nickr> and a 'library' wich would add indexing and 'chick-in/check-out' semantics
<Maniac> ah
<Maniac> so the intention is to build something very extensible and customizable
<nickr> Yes, the overall intention is to provide a robust storage platform for document type apps
<Maniac> this is in concept stage stil yes?
<nickr> I have corba interface definitions for the frontend and some parts of the subsystems
<nickr> I'm still thinking about authentication and such at the call level
<nickr> I'd just as soon impliment it without to get it somewhere then add that later
<gemcat> i use Expedition for engineering document control - it is corba afaik

<Remosi> I don't know any people that do
<mdean> ummmm...no ;-)
<mdean> well, people with little db background like it alot
<mdean> they have yet to be enlightened
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> mdean: what about simpler web-based stuff?
<ra3vat> well, can you point me to good and new postgresql binary for windows, then?
<mdean> ra3vat: install cygwin - I read pgsql is part of the install now
<mdean> ajmitch: pgsql 100%
<ajmitch> mdean: k
<ajmitch> was just chatting to a friend:
<ajmitch> [14:07:23] <ajmitch> btw, what database do you prefer?
<ajmitch> [14:07:48] <crypt> for what I do, mysql.
<ajmitch> [14:08:05] <crypt> it is simple fast and liteweight.
<ra3vat> mdean: thanks
<mdean> ajmitch: I prefer pgsql because I care about my data ;-)
<mdean> ra3vat: np
<ajmitch> mdean: fair enough ;)

<Remosi> you should store your forms in the database :)
<ajmitch> yeah, why not? ;)
<nickr> doowap
<Remosi> then you don't have to distribute your app
<Remosi> you just distribute the ability to access the data the apps using
<Remosi> :)
<Remosi> quiet in here today :)
<jcBusy> Remosi: we do plan on eventually providing the option of storing in the database
<jcBusy> Right now, though, forms can be accessed via URIs
<jcBusy> so you can host your forms definitions behind a webserver
<nickr> ah neat
<nickr> thats convenient

<derek> hello ajmitch
<derek> piss and moan
<derek> how do you do autojoins in xchat?
<nickr> in the err
<derek> i figured it out once and have #gnuenterprise automagically
<ajmitch> in the server window
<nickr> server window, theres a place to put the channels you want to join
<derek> but i saw chilly said you could do , to do more than one
<derek> now i cant fine it :)
<ajmitch> separate multiple channels with commas
<derek> er find even
<ajmitch> xchat, server list
<ajmitch> tick show channels option
<derek> ok thats wehre i went
<derek> but i dont see ti
<ajmitch> ?
<derek> ok clicked that
<derek> the tick
<derek> but it didnt show me anything new
<ajmitch> select the server you want (eg irc.openprojects.net)
<derek> do bart i think i see it
<ajmitch> and then in the text box at the bottom of the window enter the channels
<derek> i cant enter anything there :(
<derek> nevermind
<derek> tis there now
<nickr> you have to go into the channel edit screen
<nickr> yea
<ajmitch> ah well, hit edit ;)
<derek> no offense but that is bad ui design :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<Remosi> rofl
<nickr> I'm not offended, but I think fixing it would be better than complaining :)
<Remosi> telnet -- the one true IRC client :)
<ajmitch> Remosi: whistling down the phone - the one true way to connect to your isp ;)
<derek> nickr: yes but unfortunately its C and Glade
<nickr> that makes it even easier to fix
<nickr> the glade part
<derek> and that is 'appealing' to enhance as having open heart surgery w/o numbing medication or sedation
<derek> sorry glade/c for visual ui design is shit
<Remosi> ajmitch: been there, done that :)

<derek> anyone willing to give nfs lessons?
<derek> or lessons of samba to samba on unix boxes?
<mdean> read up on /etc/exports - nfs is very simple to get going
<jcBusy> derek: what's wrong with your sneakernet?
<jcBusy> showing its age?
<Maniac> there's a decent nfs howto
<mdean> yeah - man exports ;-)
<mdean> worked for slack 3.0 anyway
Action: mdean wonders if Maniac checked dcl cvs...
Action: Maniac was just hittin sf
<Maniac> whilst watching x-files
<Maniac> i like the checkin comment "VERY VERY broken work in progress" :)
<derek> ok
<derek> i will check it out
<derek> need to buy a new pc
<derek> reinstall laptop, new pc and old pc
<derek> then redo my server :)
<derek> slowly over time while moving ot wireless network :)
<derek> good thing is wife has approved it all
<derek> just a time thing
<derek> but my mp3 collection is out growing disk space on laptop
<derek> slowly archive things off to server
<derek> but in process of burning cds from cds (i.e. making copies for the car) which will soon be illegal (sigh)
<derek> and making them to mp3's in the process so i can take to work
<derek> all PERFECTLY LEGAL usage rights
<derek> soon to be lost ... :(
<derek> i started listening to POD via 'loaned' mp3
<derek> and subsequently was going to buy album
<derek> but now im thinking of just getting the album digitally and mailing a check to the band
<mdean> new POD?
<derek> but have no idea how that would work
<derek> POD == Payable On Death
Nick change: jcBusy -> jcater
<mdean> ja - the new one?
<derek> they are a San Diego Band that finally made it. :)
<mdean> new one is good - much better than older stuff
<derek> i like it all :)
<jcater> did anyone get to look at my README.databases
<mdean> as long as it says "MySQL is #1", it's ok ;-)
<Remosi> don't let psu hear you :)
<mdean> really - I'll have to start sending XML sarcasm fragments around 80% of my statements
<jcater> mdean: rofl
<derek> any sysadmins here?
<derek> with ls
<derek> i can do ls -lh to get size in human form
<derek> and ls -lhR to get size in human form recursively
<derek> but how do i get TOTAL size?
<derek> i.e. if i do ls -lh
<mdean> du
<Remosi> du -sh *
<derek> how do i get it to tell me size of all files in the ls as well as indvidually
<Remosi> or du -sh .
<Remosi> du -h *
<derek> sweet
<derek> danke
<derek> gulp, my 'trimmed down' mp3 directory tree sits at 1 gig
<derek> thanks for the du knowledge 
<Remosi> np :)
<Remosi> at work we've got a 40g drive for "stuff"
<Remosi> mostly ogg's/mp3's

<derek> ;)
<Remosi> rofl
<Maniac> heh
<mdean> errr - and I had to trim out 3 of them for size , so you missed out on more :)
<Maniac> derek: mdean did that over a lunch break
<derek> well we have GNUe developer on payroll now i believe
<Remosi> payroll?

<ra3vat>  not part now
<derek> ok well scoop is we have some one graciously paying a developer
<derek> to work on gnue in lithuania now

<jamest> you play with the mcmillan stuff at all?
<jcater> no
<jcater> I fixed a few oddities in GFClient, though
<jcater> and did my comprehensive README.databases

<jcater> I can do the mcmillan stuff today I'm sure

<jcater> yes
<jcater> I thought I should include that to better distinguish the drivers they need to download
<jcater> maybe I wasn't clear

<jamest> annother plane went down?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> heading towards JFK
<jamest> accident or intentional?
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> cnn.com is down
<jcater> but the airports in NY are closed
<jcater> NEW YORK (AP) - A plane crashed Monday morning in the Queens section of New York, and buildings reportedly were on fire in the neighborhood. 
<jamest> cnn has next to nothing on it
<jamest> 3 sentences
<jcater> I think that's cause no one knows anything yet
<jcater> The Dow index dropped 200 points on hearing the news. 
<jamest> lol
<jamest> paniced, the hurd thunders headlong off a cliff
<jcater> :)
<jcater> are you adding a blurb to the README about database tests, or should I?
<jcater> I have time, btw
<jamest> the only ones I know that work are the postgresql ones
<jamest> so if you know the others then go ahead
<jamest> I have to head across campus for a bit anyway

<chillywilly> hey guys
<chillywilly> what do you think of XForms W3C standard
<chillywilly> ?
<chillywilly> is it feature filled enough for gfd format?
<jamest> and they work
<jamest> which means we're one step closer to setup.exe on windows machiens
<chillywilly> anyone hear me?
<jamest> chillywilly: it may be over filled

<neilt-lunch> hey cw, how are you
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> how are you?
<jamest> too much complexity for our target application
<chillywilly> it is not that complex
<chillywilly> imho
<neilt-lunch> good, but busy
<chillywilly> it is a "better" html forms
<chillywilly> just provides like a data model
<chillywilly> separates ui from data

<derek> xforms, we have looked at this
<derek> it looks similar to gnue
<chillywilly> you have?
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> well it is a standard
<derek> it didnt really exist when we started
<chillywilly> so I figured it would bbe nice to adopt a standard
<derek> and BTW its FAR from a standard
<chillywilly> instead of creating your own thing

<derek> its standard in sense its submitted to a 'standards body'
<derek> its not standard in the sense no one is using it

<chillywilly> mozilla is implemtneing XForms
<derek> chillywilly: hmmmmmmm
<chillywilly> hmmm I thought you guys didn't care for XUL?
<derek> we can certainly look at it
<derek> chillywilly: i like xul
<chillywilly> ok
<derek> i dont think it fits with what we are doing 
<derek> it had 'issues'

<derek> with me its not 'cut and dry'
<chillywilly> it never is with you :P
<chillywilly> then you couldn't torture the coders as much

<ov> Hi folks
<reinhard> hey ov
<jcater> howdy
<reinhard> i guess you are oliver vecernik?
<ov> Zunchst einmal Gre an Reinhard aus Hernstein! Ja, ich bin es.
<reinhard> Hernstein?
<ov> Hernstein liegt sdlich von Baden bei Wien.
<reinhard> ah
<ov> But lets continue in English.
<reinhard> yep :)
<ov> As I wrote in my mail and applying your help everthing seems to work fine.
<Mr_You> heh, the leaked internal M$ memo is funny
<Mr_You> http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/22770.html
<reinhard> ov: error message is gone?
<ov> But... I changed a class in test.gcd. I don't understand how to init this.
<reinhard> init == default values for fields in a class
<reinhard> or init == load new definition for the class?
<ov> reinhard: no more error messages.
<reinhard> k
<reinhard> good :)
<ov> first of all I'd like to load new definition for a class (update tables).
<reinhard> that is done every time you restart geas-server
<ov> ah
<reinhard> in geas.conf there is a line like
<reinhard> # mainlog geas.log
<reinhard> when you uncomment this line you get a log of all db changes
<ov> ok, next question: where can I find a howto for gcd-files? 
<reinhard> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~neilt/GNUeModuleGuide/main/x369.html
<reinhard> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~neilt/sc.html contains some pointers to good documentation
<reinhard> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/ is a more "official" address :)
<ov> yep, after restarting geas, I found my new table. Somewhere in the docs I read, that methods are not yet implemented. Still?
<reinhard> to be 100% honest
<reinhard> methods are already implemented
<reinhard> but in a way we are not happy with
<reinhard> and we want to redo the implementation
<reinhard> so we don't tell you :)
<ov> Grrrr... ;-)
<jamest> :)
<ov> as I found on the web GEAS, Forms is Alpha stage. A fundamental question:: is there a release plan?
<reinhard> yes of course
<reinhard> for example forms 0.1.0 is planned for october 2000
<reinhard> umm.....
<reinhard> seriously
<reinhard> forms and reports seems usable
<reinhard> in the state they are now
<reinhard> GEAS was contributed by a company and we are now in the process
<reinhard> of going through the code and adapting it to our needs
<reinhard> wrt maintainability, performance etc.
<ov> my question was aiming at the release plan, because I consider
<ov> doing some real work with it, but I'm not sure
<ov> to do so.
<ov> What would you recommend?
<jamest> run
<jamest> and don't look back
<ov> seriously?
<reinhard> i would say
<reinhard> with forms/reports yes
<reinhard> with geas: not yet
<jamest> sorry
<jamest> back
<jamest> forms works
<jamest> reports is starting to work
<jamest> geas works but IIRC is slow
<ov> realisation should take place Q2 next year. what do you think about?
<jamest> the forms/geas driver is broken
<ov> okay, 2 tier is my friend. ;-)
<jamest> then forms will work for you
<jamest> we're ready to release a 0.1.0 hopefully today
<jamest> hammering out the details on a setup.exe install for windows clients
<reinhard> ov: may i ask what kind of company you work for?
<ov> I've my own one!
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> web page?
<ov> have a look at http://members.aon.at/vecernik

<ov> I'm dealing in barcode readers, thermal printers and mobile data equipment
<ov> very important is curses support with forms (for my terminals)
<ov> does it work now (I read somewhere it was broken)?
<jamest> it is still broken
<jamest> however
<jamest> the 0.1.0 release paves the way for 0.3.0 to start
<ov> :-(
<jamest> which is the UI rewrite release
<jamest> so I'd expect it functional soon
<ov> :-)
<jamest> on the list of todos for forms
<jamest> 0.1.x - fix current driver issues as found (this includes the geas one)
<jamest> 0.3.0 - UI rewrite to support curses, web, enhanced UI features, better integration with designer
<ov> is there a possibility to write businessobjects for 2 tier and
<ov> port them to geas sometimes?
<jamest> depends
<jamest> we're going to try and share trigger/method system
<jamest> if it works then I think you could at least share the methods
<jamest> the object definition isn't possible now
<chillywilly> I think we also need to share the object system
<chillywilly> and the objects need to be data aware
<chillywilly> would make forms a little fatter but then forms could play with objects too and they can execute on the client side
<chillywilly> or you can go with GEAS
<chillywilly> or some configuration like that
<chillywilly> actually you shouldn't even have to know that the objects are remote objects or not
<chillywilly> imho
<chillywilly> just use the GComm object and if it is remote it will take care of loading the ORB and or SOAP or whatever
<ov> I don't know what the GComm object is, but the idea is great! Possible?
<chillywilly> it is just or name for common
<chillywilly> GNUe Common package

<reinhard> wasn't the answer
<reinhard> 21?
<jcater> jamest: the answer is, "No"
<jamest> argh!
<jamest> ok
<jamest> sorry
<jamest> back
<jamest> we can now have a setup.exe for forms and designer
<jamest> however
<jamest> we should probably come up with a default install behaviour for gnue tools on windows machines
<jamest> fwiw: gnuef is weighing in at about 4.5MB w/ no other install requirements
<reinhard> we should be compatible with other windows installed programs
<jamest> most of which I'm certain is wxPython
<reinhard> so we should install 80% of the files under WINDOWS/SYSTEM
<jamest> rofl
<jamest> I'll adjust the install scripts immediately
<reinhard> 5% under PROGRAM FILES/GNUE SHARED/GNUE COMMON
<jamest> I guess what I'm asking is what do we want
<ajmitch> reinhard: fill up C:\ as well (even if installing on D:)
<jamest> gee, this is all great input 
<jcater> jamest: what d'ya mean?
<jcater> the target directory?
<jcater> I'm not sure what you're asking
<jamest> right now gnuef goes in (default) c:\program files\GNUe Forms Client
chillywilly_ (danielb@d151.as1.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) left irc: Read error to chillywilly_[d151.as1.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net]: EOF from client
<jamest> and it has an {app}/etc/*.conf
<jamest> and it has an {app}/shared/images/*.png
<jamest> in there
<jamest> designer would work similar
<jamest> I was wondering if we wanted to do something like
<jamest> C:\program files\gnue\gnue forms client
<jamest> C:\program files\gnue\designer
<jamest> C:\program files\gnue\etc
<jamest> C:\program files\gnue\shared
<jamest> etc, etc
<jcater> I vote for the latter
<reinhard> metoo
<Isomer_> doesn't MS have some guide lines for this kinda thing?
Nick change: Isomer_ -> Isomer
<jamest> as do i
<jamest> however, we still have issues
<reinhard> i would even say
<reinhard> s/gnue forms client/forms
<reinhard> so the path is
<reinhard> c:\program files\gnue\forms
<jamest> ok
<jamest> standing issues then
<jamest>   which package contains gnue.conf
<jamest> :)
<reinhard> common?
<reinhard> is that a package of itself?
<jcater> an alternative installation scheme would be to have two installation .exes, a "GNUe Client Environment" and a "GNUe Development Environment" in which GNUe Client would only contain like gfclient (and grrun when available), whereas the Development environment has all the .exe's
<jcater> I'm not saying I'm pushing that
<jcater> but something to consider
<jcater> then you don't have conflicting gnue.conf's
<jcater> 'course, the only problem there is what happens if stuff isn't released concurrently
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> we need a setup mgr app
<jamest> that can run and update all this crap for us
<jcater> (btw, if we stick w/Designer install and Forms install, I'd vote for the conf stuff to go into gfclient
<jcater> )
<jcater> as it's the least common denominator
<jcater> jamest: we're not helping much, are we?
<jamest> ok
<jamest> now I've got gnuef in gnue\forms
<jamest> and a gnue/shared and gnue/etc
<jamest> however
<jamest> I need a method of setting the INSTALL_PREFIX and GNUE_CONNECTIONS
<jamest> unless we make the clients look in some thing like exedir/../etc
<jamest> as I don't seem to have a way to tell the installer to alter autoexec.bat
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> can the setup program run a script or executable as part of the install?
<Isomer> you shouldn't be setting environmental variables for the windows install
<jamest> jcater: yes
<jamest> Isomer: it should go in the registry 
<Isomer> precisely
<jamest> but we don't support that :(
<jcater> jamest: please don't say that
<Isomer> when in rome....
<jcater> I want to be able to do a samba install 
<jamest> jcater: I mean a single entry for gnue pointer
<jamest> jcater: yes, that is other bad things
<jcater> jamest:??
<jamest> as it sets we _should_ be able to network install this puppy
<jamest> registry hacks make than tougher
<jcater> that's why I don't want to see a registry hack :)
<jamest> I think I'd be happy if the client apps (gnuef, designer, reports) looked in their executable is located in
<jamest> .....in the dir their .....
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I'd be fine with that if
<Isomer> how does hacking autoexec.bat help network installs?
<jamest> from there go ../etc/gnue.conf
<jamest> i doesn't
<jamest> it
<jamest> this is my problem
<jamest> everything is ugly
<Isomer> it's microsoft, what do you expect? :)
<jcater> I'd be fine with that if later on we added an include = line to the config files
<jcater> (read that LATER ON part :)
<jcater> jamest: at least for 0.1.0, I don't think we can do better than looking in the exec dir/../etc
<jcater> that's my vote
<jamest> jcater: any chance I could con you into adding it 
<jamest> as I leave in about 45 min
<jamest> and want to get this installer functional
<jamest> or I can checkin what we have
<jamest> and you can play w/ it while I add it

<nickr> chillywilly: thanks
<nickr> ajmitch: hehe
<chillywilly> organicly?
<Mr_You> what about inn?
<ajmitch> chillywilly: hacked :)

<Mr_You> rtfm? ;-)
<nickr> the fine manuals that it comes with are no help
<Isomer> heh
<Mr_You> http://www.isc.org/products/INN/
<Mr_You> its been so long since I ran inn.. hmm 6+ years
<Mr_You> we had the worse news server ever.. big full height 9GB HD on a P100
<Mr_You> it just grinded all day and night
<Mr_You> semi-full newsfeed
<nickr> It shouldn't be this hard to setup an exclusively local news system
<Mr_You> hehe.. thats debatable ;-)
<nickr> No it isn't!
<Mr_You> there are other solutions.. not sure which... dnews I know
<nickr> It should be 'these are the gorups I want and how long they live and who can post to them'
<Mr_You> nickr: with inn it is ;-)
<nickr> I tried cnews, its way more crusty
<Isomer> you should try bnews :)
<Isomer> back when it was written in shell scripts :)
<nickr> I want *less* crusty, not more crusty :)
<Mr_You> wish I could help, yeah it should't be too hard, inn is just a cluster of weirdness.. use to be anyways..
<nickr> hmm
<nickr> well the weird thing is that the nnewsgroups I added show up in the list, I just can't read or post to them
<nickr> tin reports 'Newsgroup does not exist on this server'
<Mr_You> I think you have to set options (maybe another file) that states what is allowed
<nickr> I was actually slightly afraid of that
<nickr> because the file I believe you're referring to is freaky
<jcater> anyone at a windows machine????

<Mr_You> no, I have access.. but will only admit it in a certain context ;-)

Action: Mr_You pulls a Bill Gates and quickly removes the jcaters seat resulting in a fall similar to a Windows app crashing..
<Mr_You> what installer?
<jcater> inno
<Mr_You> what is that?
<Mr_You> anyone tried the evolution RC1?
<derek> hmm once a fellow i know tried to lube a pineapple and put up his arse, i hear that evolution RC1 gives you same effect with half the mess....
<derek> yes im j/k
<Mr_You> geez hehe
<Mr_You> I'm looking forward to a M$ Outlook solution for linux.. evolution or mozilla
<Mr_You> or the other few
<Mr_You> aethena I think
<Isomer> mutt?
<derek> wait you might be confusing things
<derek> you looking for 'outlook' solution or 'exchange' solution?
<Mr_You> evolution enables outlook like features without exchange
<Mr_You> which hardly anyone seems to use anyways hehe
<Mr_You> but could be useful
<derek> um i disagree
<derek> evolution isnt even 5% as powerful as exchange services
<Mr_You> IIRC, evolution uses p2p technology to send scheduled events
<derek> and disagree that no one uses the exchange services
<derek> the county LIVES off outlook calendaring (shared calendars)
<Mr_You> this p2p is probably just via STMP and IMAP and interpreting the email as a calendar event
<derek> as well as a few other features
<Mr_You> yeah.. thats what I want to use and seems evolution has accomplished that.. last I checked year ago or so I guess
<derek> exchange is CRAP for a mail server, but some of its groupware services are decent (just poorly implemented at times)
<stbain> outlook like features
<derek> Mr_You: its not on par with exchange services
<Mr_You> what other features besides calendar does exchange do? my groups never used them
<derek> they might say they have 'implemented' shared calendars but im not seeing it on level of exchange
<derek> first off i dont think you can have true shared calendars in p2p mode and be effective
<derek> it works for small numbers with dedicated connections, but after that the updated of the nodes will be delayed and scheduling cant have that
<stbain> It supports peer-to-peer calendaring with users on products that support iCalendar, 
<stbain> evolution, that is
<derek> also the key feature used at county by high level officials is 'delegation'
<derek> i.e. you can delegate some to read / respond to your email as well as calendars
<Mr_You> imap should do that
<derek> btw: i think that we (GNUe) will start looking into groupware services
<derek> so that you could use your GEAS logic in such things
<derek> but thats another discussion
<Mr_You> like what kind of application for example?
<derek> btw: last time i was with the ximian folks, their secretaries (nat and miguels)
<derek> used outlook on windows
<derek> because evolution couldnt handle delegation at all
<derek> and it was too hard to 'train' her to use linux outside of that
<derek> and most of the 'investors' used windows
<derek> jade and i gave her some SERIOUS SERIOUS SERIOUS crap
<Mr_You> I think its possible
<derek> since they had to use our bandwidth for a week :)
<derek> we did get like 10 shirts, 5 monkeys, free dinner and some roller coaster rides out of it though :)
<Mr_You> not p2p in the sense of another protocol but p2p using smtp/imap
<Mr_You> ie. email apps "messages" will be sent via email and auto parsed and interpreted and deleted.
<Mr_You> I think thats how iCalendar works but I dunno
<Mr_You> delegation could be done by sending the encrypted imap password to allow switching of identities and/or reading others imap folders
<Mr_You> you have an example of a GNUe groupware app?  most orgs seem fine with email/mailing list or newsgroups.. to which any web or desktop interface could provide access too..
<Mr_You> tie everything into LDAP
<stbain> don't forget workflow, document storage, community calendaring, etc
<jcater> sigh!! well, installed new software on my Win98 station, therefore I must reboot...
<Mr_You> community calendaring is groupware, but I dunno about document management and workflow.. maybe I'm wrong.. I think of groupware as communication methods
jcater (jason@w202.z065105010.mem-tn.dsl.cnc.net) left irc: 
<Mr_You> definitely GNUe could be useful for community calendaring, workflow, and document management..and many other ERP-type apps
<Mr_You> I'm even thinking about Content Management System for webcontent from GNUe, but I don't consider that groupware
<ajmitch> CMS sounds sorta like what chillywilly is gonna do :)
<Mr_You> in the end tho, I guess it would be cool to have everything authenticate through GEAS 
<Mr_You> he must be keeping it a secret then ;-)
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> what comes under the topic of CMS?
<Mr_You> really webware could be "everything web" for GNUe..
<ajmitch> yes
<derek> Mr_You: yes 
<Mr_You> that way you could (hopefully) tie in any webware module into GNUe
<ajmitch> i (and chillywilly) are going to write a phpnuke-like forum using webware
<stbain> given the python-centric nature of GNUe, it seems like cmf.zope.org would fit right in
<derek> i see groupware of gnue integrating nicely into GNUe Workflow and Document Management
<derek> as well as offering shared calendars, contacts etc
<ajmitch> what about phpGroupware?
<derek> ajmitch: no comment
<Mr_You> ajmitch: "should" only require porting one to webware I guess
<ajmitch> wasn't something happening with that & GNUe?
<derek> other than i refuse to use a phpMiddleWare with GNUe
<ajmitch> ah, ok
<ajmitch> using webware stuff seems quite useful tho
<derek> subsitute i with we as the gnue core team isnt into using phpmiddleware and authentication services :)
<ajmitch> :)
<stbain> we're already running everything off of python objects, right?
<Mr_You> ok, I'm gonna be a little upset if I wasted all this time on this debian mirror.. considering its almost 60GBs now
<ajmitch> Mr_You: wow
<Mr_You> I should have just hacked at the broken scripts
<Mr_You> ajmitch: thats without source, just debs of US-debian
<Mr_You> tweaking my rsync exclude again

<ajmitch> so what are you looking at doing with webware & GNUe? planning to talk to the webware ppl?
<derek> um
<Mr_You> madlocke already has code working or something
Action: ajmitch is curious about what toys he can play with ;)
<derek> looking to use webware for UI driver for UIhtml.py
<ajmitch> ok
<derek> that madlocke is working on
<derek> forms is designed to abstract UI like it to abstract databases
<derek> i.e. you simply provide a UI driver
<derek> now the killer thing is if you use something python based you can use all underlying objects
<ajmitch> yep
<derek> and just reimplement UIdriver.py
<derek> i believe madlocke has UIhtml.py and some updates to the objects
<derek> that would give us basic functionality for a web version of forms
<ajmitch> but madlocke has been AWOL for a little while?
<Mr_You> he's back
<derek> our agents have tracked him down
<Mr_You> hehe
<ajmitch> ah ok
<derek> only a matter of time before we can extract the code ;)
Action: Mr_You suddenly hears in the distance "I'll never tell..."
<ajmitch> you've smuggled him back to the GNUe compound for interrogation?

<derek> problems with a gnu machine, i cant believe that :)
<ajmitch> probably a problem at jamest's end
<jcater> jamest: ah, you'rer back

<derek> mainly cause it took a year for me to get an account that worked for ssh :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> i can't update cvs from here

<jamest> it no longer accepts my key
<ajmitch> damn

<ajmitch> upgraded ssh lately?
<jamest> no

<jcater> sigh
<jcater> yes
<jamest> that good eh?
<jcater> inno works great :)
<Mr_You> bbl
<jcater> but the resulting install doesn't
<jamest> yes it does
Action: Mr_You &
<jamest> it worked fine on my last build
<jamest> except for the environment vars not being set
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> forms worked for me except the environ vars
<jamest> of course
<jcater> but designer said critical system dlls were missing
<jcater> :(
<jamest> now I'm locked out of cvs
<jamest> designer was never tested
<jcater> but, first things first.. I'm trying to figure out the environ vars
<jamest> ever
<jcater> btw
<jcater> did you know mcmillan forces the __file__ of our imported stuff to be
<jcater> located at c:\python21\
<jcater> fsck!
<jamest> no, i didn't see that
<jamest> i thought it put everything in dist_gf*
<jcater> if you do a gfclient.exe -d10
<jcater> you see all the [mymodule:linenum] Messages
<jcater> have /python21/gnue/common/something
<jcater> as the mymodule
<jcater> I'm trying to see if that's causing it to make the install prefix as c:\python21
<jcater> sigh
<jamest> um
<jamest> that is set in gnue.conf

<jamest> at least on my setup
<jcater> yeah, but remember, you had me do a fix before you left
<jcater> it now uses the base director of gfclient/../etc

<jcater> but close, oh so close
<jcater> jamest: btw, I hope you don't mind.. I added to the inno setup file so it'd associate GFD's with gfclient (so you can double-click a form and run it)
<jcater> also, you can right-click a GFD and click "Edit" and open it in designer
<jamest> cool
<jamest> i wanted to do that but ran out of time
<chillywilly> wtf is inno?
<jcater> it's the "in" versionn of "mono"
<jamest> a free installer for windows
Action: chillywilly beats jcater with a trout
<jamest> takes a script and makes a setup.exe from a bunch of files
<jamest> with the files we have gnuef and designer are setup.exe's
<jamest> that install and uninstall nicely
<jamest> just got to work some kinks out of the system
<chillywilly> we can't have that
<chillywilly> then everyone will expect easy installs
<chillywilly> :P
<jamest> don't worry chiilly
<jamest> if the user name contains dan in it
<jamest> it falls back to a mode that's a royal bitch to install
<chillywilly> great!
<jcater> crap crap crap
<jamest> we knew you'd like it like that

<stbain> ok... so if, for example, I have Python2.1 and wxWindows installed... the installer will complete the rest ofthe required tasks for installing GNUe?
<jamest> stbain: on windows you require nothing
<jamest> it's a single setup.exe
<jamest> no python, no db drivers, no wxpython, etc, etc
<stbain> where is this setup.exe?
<jamest> um, we're working on it
<stbain> ;)
<stbain> I see
<stbain> can I help?
<jamest> it almost works
<jamest> you may be able to test in a bit
<stbain> are you running into any specific problems?
<jamest> yeah, it don't work
<Isomer> rofl
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> how very descriptive of you
<stbain> yes... I know how to fix that one
Action: chillywilly beats jamest with a trout
<jcater> dang
<jcater> no slapping?
<chillywilly> no, just beating damnit
<jcater> what did you do jamest to deserve a beating instead of a slapping?
<chillywilly> youg to one too

<jamest> i think once we nail down all the gotchas i'll be cake

<Isomer> on redhat 7.2 libpq-fe.h is in /usr/lib/pgsql/libpq-fe.h
<jamest> honestly if someone wants to maintain gnue windows installer
<jamest> i think they should let us hammer out the errors first
<Isomer> so therefore the #include needs #include <pgsql/libpq-fe.h> or you need -I/usr/include/pgsql
<jamest> then it should be as simple as making sure they have latest db/ui drivers
<jamest> and running a bat file
<jamest> then a inno script

<jamest> i have a gnuef setup.exe that works out of the box
<jamest> at least for postgresql
<jamest> i need to find all the binary drivers i can
<stbain> wouldn't it be best to use ODBC connectivity with all of the windows clients?
<jamest> ODBC is supported
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> are boxes not containers?
<jamest> not at this time
<Isomer> theres no way to resize the labels on the property box?
<Isomer> so there are two rows "foreign_key...."
<Isomer> but I can't see what differentiates them?
<jcater> jamest: you will only be able to install stuff like postgresql, mysql, sap-db IIRC
<jcater> I know I tried oracle at work, 
<jcater> but the oracle drivers require oci.dll
<jcater> (which IIRC we can't distribute :(
<derek> jamest: im willing to test the windows install at work tomorrow

<jamest> yip minor
<jamest> let me commit
<jamest> when the icon on the desktop is created it doesn't have a form 
<jamest> so it fails as gnuef always wants a form
<jamest> we need a very basic "Welsome to gnuef" form that shows some of the features (all non-data bound of course)
<jamest> that we can attempt to tie to that icon
<jcater> lol
<jcater> call it <base>/forms/GFClient.py
<jcater> err, call it <base>/forms/GFClient.gfd
<jcater> as it looks for that anyway

<jamest> some inno issues
<jamest> the working dir isn't set unless to specify it in the iss file
<jamest> and mcmillan apps assume they're running in the dir they installed to

<Isomer> derek: the installer program
<jamest> free windows installer
<jamest> makes setup.exe
<Isomer> now that I think I understand how to get this program going and doing it's thing
<Isomer> I might do a cvs update :)
<jamest> it's the only free one I could find
<jamest> so I used it

<jamest> very nice
<jcater> yes it is
<jcater> I'm gonna switch NCS's stuff to it
<jamest> gnue now installed into start-programs-gnue

<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> still can't parse that file
<jamest> which file Isomer
<Isomer> well, any xml file by my guess
<jamest> what is the command you're giving (and which platform)
<Isomer> python2 `which gfdesigner` ./helloworld2.gfd
<Isomer> running on rh7
<Isomer> I think the reason is that I've botched the install of PyXML
<Isomer> after looking closer
<Isomer> coz it's occuring inside there
<jamest> hmmm

Nick change: cjcater -> jcater
<Remosi> does that mean that the drive for gnue isn't installed? the drive gnue uses isn't installed? or the driver python uses isn't installed or?
<jcater> the latter
<Remosi> ah hmm
<Mr_You> man my dev box sure is slow
<Mr_You> P166MMX I think
<Mr_You> or P150MMX, 133 overclocked
<Remosi> DB000:   File "/usr/local/gnue/lib/python/gnue/common/__init__.py", line 58, in dyn_import
<Remosi> DB000:     mod = getattr(mod, comp)
<Remosi> DB000: AttributeError: 'gnue.common.dbdrivers' module has no attribute 'pypgsql'
<Remosi> thats a new error message?
<jcater> um
<jcater> what os you running on?
<Remosi> RH7.2
<jcater> are you running a copy of CVS, or a download?
<Remosi> CVS
<Remosi> recently cvs updated
<jcater> is there a pypgsql directory in /usr/local/gnue/lib/python/gnue/common/dbdrivers/
<Remosi> [perry@saturn gnue]$ ls -d /usr/local/gnue/lib/python/gnue/common/dbdrivers/pypgsql/
<Remosi> ./usr/local/gnue/lib/python/gnue/common/dbdrivers/pypgsql/
<jcater> how did you install?
<Remosi> install which?
<jcater> using the setup.py in the gnue/ directory?
<jcater> or the ./setup.py in each tool directory
<Remosi> each one in the tool directory
<jcater> which version of python are you running?
<Remosi> 2.1
<Remosi> ahh
<Remosi> I found out why it says that
<Remosi> the first time I click "Continue" in the wizard
<Remosi> it says "no such driver" (which is false, but never mind)
<Remosi> the second time it says "has no attribute 'pypgsql'
<jcater> oh
<jcater> sigh
<Remosi> so it is a bug
<jcater> yes
<Remosi> but uh, not the one that's making this fail
<Remosi> [perry@saturn gnue-common]$ python2 -c 'import pyPgSQL'
<Remosi> that succeeds
Action: Remosi ponders why it's saying the pyPgSQL module doesn't work
<jcater> have you installed mxDateTime, per chance?
<jamest> his above import would have failed IIRC
<Remosi> ah ha!
<Remosi> jcater: you're correct
<Remosi> mx was installed for 1.5 not 2.0
<Remosi> just figured that myself
Action: Remosi goes back to cursing
<jamest> lol
<jamest> you on a debian box?
<jamest> nevermind
<jamest> sigh
<Remosi> nope
<jamest> rh72 != debian
<Remosi> didn't work on the debian box either :/
<Remosi> oh well

<jamest> I notice we still have a python21 setting in our gnue.conf :)
<jamest> whoops

<jcater> we probably should make the pointsize 12 instead of 14
<jcater> as this is large :)

<jamest> 2.3.1
<jamest> and the toolbar is corrupted
<jamest> it's an old bug
<jamest> that 2.3.2 seems to fix

<jamest> all my wxPythons are hybrid

<ToyMan> jamest: you around?
<jamest> sort of
<ToyMan> dneighbo sez you're an nfs mount guru
<jamest> um, ok
<ToyMan> could you spare some hints?
<ToyMan> trying 2 different things:
<ToyMan> 1. mount the fs /home/~ dir to newworkstation /home/~
<ToyMan> 2. mount fs /usr/ports/distfiles to workstation/ports/distfiles
<ToyMan> so the ports collection only has to download once..
<ToyMan> i think my /etc/export line is foobar
<ToyMan> it reads /home /usr/ports/distfiles/ -alldirs -maproot=0 172.16.0.109
<jamest> ?
<jamest> what OS
<ToyMan> fbsd
<ToyMan> i'm getting permission denied
<jamest> adn there is not /etc/exportfs 
<ToyMan> um, in fbsd it's /etc/exports
<ToyMan> adn?
<ToyMan> and??
<ToyMan> hmmm. well, back to the man pages..
<dneighbo> ToyMan he is getting old..... probably either stilling trying to remember what he was going to say :)
<ToyMan> cleaning his dentures ;)
<jamest> sorry
<ToyMan> no problemo
<jamest> i have not done fbsd exports in a long, long, um long time
<jamest> IIRC after you setup the exports file
<jamest> you have to run shareall 
<jamest> IIRC
<ToyMan> oh well, it's the learning curve thing
<ToyMan> IIRC? <- what's this?
<ToyMan> havn't seen a ref to shareall, maybe things have changed a bit
<jamest> If I Recall Correctly
<jamest> hmmm
<ToyMan> ahhh.  always wondered what that one meant
<jamest> could you try the command
<jamest> exports
<jamest> to see if it says something?
<ToyMan>  Command not found.
<jamest> export<tab>
<ToyMan> /etc/exports is a file where you set up your exports
<ToyMan> nada
<jamest> and you don't have anything firewalled?
<ToyMan> it's a local mount
<ToyMan> inter network..
<ToyMan> not intra
<ToyMan> or did i get the prefixes backwords?
<ToyMan> heh, nfs mount over a 28.8 modem...
<ToyMan> that would be painful
<ToyMan> kinda like windoze file sharing ;)
<jamest> :)
<jamest> and portmap is running?
<ToyMan> yep
<ToyMan> I'm pretty sure it's my exports file..
<ToyMan> I had just /home/stuq and it worked
<ToyMan> mount -w bucky:/home/stuq /mnt <- no prob
<ToyMan> but when I add additional mount points in /etc/exports
<ToyMan> it coughs
<ToyMan> well, gotta go, thanks for trying

<dneighbo> hmmm we got an HR proposal today... very interesting
madlocke (nomail@141.82.19.37) joined #gnuenterprise.
<madlocke> hi...
<madlocke> somebody told me you need windows testers... oh dear why did I try this ;)
<madlocke> jamest: you are here?
<jamest> :)
<jamest> hi
<jamest> madlocke: did you send those files?
<madlocke> not yet... have to change some things... to this later... first some more important things...
<madlocke> I tried to work with windows as I already said
<madlocke> using WinCVS to checkout...
<madlocke> cvs converts everything from lf to cr+lf
<madlocke> ok so far... but not for image files... 
<dneighbo> quick grab him, bolt him to the chair... muhahahhaa
<madlocke> these files are not marked binary in cvs...
<dneighbo> madlocke i think we need to make the cvs server do this
<dneighbo> i.e. extension types of .... automatically check them in as binary
<dneighbo> if we are not already 
Action: dneighbo is vaguelly remembering this on another project where i used wincvs
<jamest> madlocke: we need windows testers of the files in www.gnuenterprise.org/~jamest/pre-release :)
<madlocke> dneighbo: would be great to handle this automatically. manually it works by adding with -kb option
<dneighbo> madlocke is there anyway you can tar/gz your current work with webware and email to jamest or info@gnue.org
<jamest> the designer one is known broken btw
<dneighbo> even if its not complete or is getting more done to it?
<dneighbo> it would make the natives here much less restless. :)
<madlocke> jamest: I have to talk about gfd files with you first...
<madlocke> jamest: one bad example for a gfd file is ./samples/location/zipcode_maint.gfd
<madlocke> jamest: can you open this so it is easier talking about it...?
Isomer (~isomer@210-86-58-79.jetstart.xtra.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> rofl, you want a really bad example look for ./samples/track/forms/contact_manager.gfd
<Isomer> mornin' all!
<madlocke> dneighbo: not bad because it is big... another prob...
<jamest> madlocke: talk away, but I'm kinda busy
<madlocke> jamest: you see maybe that there are 3 labels and after this the list of entries...
<jamest> so responce may be a bit slow
<ajmitch> hey madlocke
Action: dneighbo digs for that smelly crappie basket he has at work... to get a good one to thwap jamest with 
<madlocke> jamest: the only relation between labels and entries is position on screen in x,y coordinates... you understand the prob?
<madlocke> hi ajmitch
<ajmitch> info cvs, it talks about binary files
<dneighbo> there was talk of binding a label to an entry
<jamest> madlocke: that is correct
<madlocke> dneighbo: it is already easier if the label tag is near the entry tag...
<dneighbo> or basically autocreating the lable based off a property of entry
<madlocke> because if I just ignore any positions and read from top to bottom, the relation is still there (if order is correc)
<dneighbo> yes
<Isomer> where can I find "mx" ?
<madlocke> jamest: can you install webware and then I send the files and do installation together with you? maybe it is easier because probably if have to write less text ;)
<madlocke> some words about installtion on windows system...
<madlocke> yes after some hours I had my first form on the screen ;)
<dneighbo> installing postgres drivers eh Isomer :)
<Isomer> dneighbo: yeah :/
<jamest> madlocke: I'll have to install webware at home, i'll try and get done tonight or tomorrow
<dneighbo> look in the README or INSTALL file
<dneighbo> it has the url there
<dneighbo> madlocke if you can be here in like 3 hours or so
<jamest> madlocke: : the files in pre-release are setup.exe's
<dneighbo> i will do the webware install with you
<jamest> it takes minutes
<dneighbo> and fully document
<dneighbo> so we can get documented for others
<jamest> no python, drivers, etc needed
<dneighbo> we should get hte webware version installed on ash as well :)
<madlocke> dneighbo: if I can still sit on my chair in 3 hours, then yes... ;) at the moment it is 23:00 here ;)
<jamest> Isomer: http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/mxDateTime.html
<madlocke> jamest: id did a cvs co and then used the install scripts...
<madlocke> jamest: ok maybe not the right way for good install ;)
<ajmitch> webware is running on my box here...
<madlocke> jamest: but... in setup.py you are changing/creating gfclient file
<madlocke> jamest: in this file there are some pathes... but there are other pathes in gnue.conf
<madlocke> jamest: these I had to change manually... why?
<madlocke> jamest: another question: why installing everything in python path?
<madlocke> jamest: why not something like ".\program files\gnue" and add the according pathes to PYTHON_PATH at startup
<madlocke> jamest: I think finding modules, etc is a more general problem in gnue not only for gnuef, so maybe there can be a solution in gnue-common
<jamest> madlocke: try the setup.exe's
<jamest> they address most of what you speak of
<jamest> everything is now in Program Files\gnue
<jamest> the old setup was our first attempt just to prove she'd run
<madlocke> ok
<madlocke> so the setup will change later in cvs too?
<madlocke> because maybe someone tries the same ?
<jamest> nope
<jamest> cvs on win32 is a developers install
<jamest> then in each packages doc/installer
<jamest> are instructions/files for building the exe's which are installed for a user properly
<madlocke> great this helps I think
<jamest> the plus side of this is the setup.exe's _should_ be networkable
<jamest> where as python itself doesn't support network installs
<jamest> :)
<madlocke> :)
<madlocke> how are the exes created? with py2exe?
<jamest> nope
<jamest> it doesn't support PyXML so py2exe files
<jamest> fails
<jamest> McMillian Installer and Inno
<jamest> it's all in the README
<jamest> fwiw: we just got this up last night
<madlocke> ok... like all the time... rftm.. understand... :) it's just new for me that there is any doc ;)
<jamest> lol
<jamest> we promise it won't happen again

<dneighbo> bad coder, no donut
<dneighbo> you hear that jason NO DONUT
<chillywilly> what did jcater do now?
<dneighbo> documentation
<chillywilly> aaaah!
<chillywilly> how dare you do such a vile and evil thing'
<jamest> yeah jcater!  how could you document the windows setup.exe stuff!  It's all your doing! 
Action: jamest sneaks out the back while they flog jcater
<dneighbo> actually he wrote db driver docs
<dneighbo> just your installer docs reminded me of his punishment
<dneighbo> btw: masta is testing windows installer so running is probably better than sneaking at this point
Action: jamest puts it in "haul ass" mode
<dneighbo> self preservation is a good thing(tm)
<dneighbo> i cant tell if it worked
<dneighbo> installed yes
Action: jamest tosses pieces of jcater code on ground behind him to hopefully slow the beast
<dneighbo> but if i click on icon it opens dos shell flashes somethign and closes dos shell
<dneighbo> same from menu
<jamest> that's cause you don't have a filename
<jamest> double click on a .gfd file
<jamest> or alter properties to add a gfd file after the exe
<jamest> i was hoping someone <cough>derek<cough>
<jamest> would do up a little intro form 
<jamest> saying welcome, here are a few features (no db links)
<jamest> that we could put on that icon
<dneighbo> i can do that
<dneighbo> BUT one thing where did it install the samples?
<dneighbo> i dont see them under the tree
<jamest> it doesn't yet
<jamest> i can add them, just a sec
<dneighbo> if you add them then i will verify it works
<dneighbo> and then whip up a simple little form or rather SET of forms :)
<dneighbo> one form that has a list of different things
<dneighbo> then when you click on the button it opens that sample
<dneighbo> like the wxWindows sampler does
<jcater> dneighbo: I think he meant something that could be finished in, say, the next 5 minutes :)
<dneighbo> i think that only takes 5 minutes
<dneighbo> if designer was working on windows :)
Action: dneighbo is like microsoft, doing a compliment and a slam in same sentence, though i didnt require payment....hmmm guess that leaves room for improvement
<jamest> dneighbo: new designer uploading now that works
<jcater> :)
<jcater> or, :)p
<jamest> jcater: get ready to time him
<madlocke> someone did already some work an a geometry engine?
<madlocke> an a = on a
<jamest> yes, but we never saw/got the code
<madlocke> who did it?
<jamest> one of the reasons we got nervous when you left 
<jamest> :)
<madlocke> understand...
<jamest> dneighbo: new .exe's in that pre-release dir
<jamest> madlocke: perlpoet iirc
<madlocke> hm... never saw him....
<jcater> jamest: I'm thinking we should rename the <Right Click>|edit feature to <Right Click>|Open in Designer
<jamest> ok
<jamest> with me
<jamest> as for adding the samples
<jamest> I can do that
<jamest> however
<jamest> we should get a "real" group of samples first
<jamest> as right now we have a mess :)
<jcater> ok
<jcater> how are the two related?
<jamest> huh?
<jamest> two what?
<jcater> sorry
<jcater> missed the

<Isomer> I tried installing them

<jcater> Isomer: I fixed the second problem in CVS
<madlocke> chilly: some parts still live... yes ;)
<jcater> but as for the first one, we do need better error handling in that part
<Isomer> excellent :)
<Isomer> if you want to be really nice
<Isomer> you can put a "? Help" button on the dialog
<chillywilly> madlocke: you got some code for those web forms? ;)
<Isomer> that sends you  to www.gnuenterprise.org/errors/no.such.provider.html

<madlocke> oh dear... I want my faster connection... :( bad phone company...
<madlocke> hope tomorrow I'll get it...
<dneighbo> hell yes designer windows install works and it kicks SERIOUS ASS
<dneighbo> looks better on windows :)
<dneighbo> cept for the pink icon back grounds :)
<jcater> rofl
<jcater> good, I'm not mental
<dneighbo> where did you put the samples?
<Isomer> rofl
<dneighbo> im too lame to find them
<chillywilly> jcater: that's open to debate
<jamest> argh!
<jamest> i don't get it
<dneighbo> i do have an old form on here
<jamest> I fixed the pink icons 
<dneighbo> i thin there is a python issue
<dneighbo> as it says cant find form 'c:\\somepath\\otherpath\\form.gfd
<dneighbo> instead of c:\form\path\form.gfd
<dneighbo> when calling it do you have to do c:/form/path/form.gfd
<dneighbo> or
<dneighbo> c:\\form\\path\\form.gfd
<dneighbo> also where are samples :)
<jamest> no samples in setup.exe yet

<dneighbo> i need to run will be back in an hour or so

<jcater> sigh
<jcater> are those large files?
<jcater> edit your c:\program files\gnue\etc\gnue.conf and change prefix from c:\python21 to c:\program files\gnue (jamest forgot to do that before making the EXE's)
<jcater> or have you already done that?
ajmitch (me@p1-max3.dun.ihug.co.nz) left irc: Ping timeout: 181 seconds
<dneighbo> no i havent done that 
<dneighbo> and probably explains some of the problems :)
<jcater> yes
<jcater> that bit me too
<jcater> I yelled at him enough for the both of us
<jcater> :)
ajmitch (~me@p32-max3.dun.ihug.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> yes that fixed the problem :)
<dneighbo> btw: shouldnt that be DYNAMIC
<dneighbo> as you can choose WHERE to install iirc
<dneighbo> so hardcoding the gnue.conf could cause issues if someone picks a custom install location
<dneighbo> or so it would seem
<jcater> well
<jcater> we were discussing that
<dneighbo> or just doing baby steps for now :)
<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> ok right off bat i can think of a few things
<dneighbo> one is installing the desktop icon is pointless
<jcater> for gfclient, you mean?
<dneighbo> i think it should install it but have the default sample form pointed too
<dneighbo> so if someone clicks it they get a formt
<dneighbo> that says edit this to point to form of your choice :)
<dneighbo> or somethign
<dneighbo> OR
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> we need to make it so that if you run gfclient
<dneighbo> and do not pass it a form file name
<jcater> that is what jamest wanted that intro form for
<dneighbo> it opens a dialog asking you to choose a form with a file chooser
<dneighbo> this would be helpful i think
<dneighbo> anyhow
<dneighbo> even on linux
<dneighbo> but making these suckers double clickable is pretty sweet and kills most of that need :)
<dneighbo> so maybe scratch that idea
<dneighbo> anyhow must run will look at making an 'intro' form whne i get home

<stbain> ok
<jamest> or add a gfd file to the end of the exe line in the icon's properties

<chillywilly> just gotta code it

<jamest> derek: you gnue'ing?
<derek> so people dont click and go damn its broke
<derek> jamest either gnue'ing or simcity'ing
<derek> :)
<chillywilly> ajmitch: ?
<jamest> derek: I mentioned that one w/ hopes you'd make the intro form
<derek> well i have a few hcs hacks to apply first and then i was going to gnue
<jamest> we need to decide what we still need for release
<derek> but 3 new dvd's came today so i might get called into movie action :)
<jamest> i'm thinking a simple users guide would be nice
<derek> i will look at a form and we should include the tech ref
<derek> and we need to make a 'manual' for designer
<derek> that has 'pictures'
<derek> etc
<jamest> dang
<derek> i will look into some of this end of week
<jcater> sigh
<derek> for now our 0.1.0 can live w/o it
<jcater> yay!
<derek> just including techref will be enough
<jamest> good
<derek> imho
<derek> as unlike the source we can readily post docs to website and have people grab
<jamest> we have the installer and a URL link to the docs
<jamest> in the startup menu
<derek> and not have them risk damaging too much :)
<jamest> then they are always up to date :)

<jamest> no

<jamest> i think it had grand ideas at the start
<jcater> that'd be my analysis: it's a desktop framework :)
<jamest> the whole Network Object Model gNOMe
<jamest> but i don't think that's what she became
<jamest> I don't have a problem working well w/ gnome but gnue will not require gnome
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> 'k
Action: Isomer should learn more about gnome
<nickr> that'd be cool if there was a Bonobo adapter for gaes, embed gnue objects into your spreadsheet
<Isomer> yeah!
<ajmitch> nickr: you volunteering? ;)
<jcater> nickr: that'll be possible with our GComm layer
<nickr> ajmitch: talk to me in 3 months when I'm done with my first gnue projcet :)
<jcater> someone'll just have to write an adapter (which won't be difficult)
<ajmitch> or what about a bonobo forms client?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> that'd be especially useful
<Isomer> ajmitch: now, that could be funky
<nickr> bleh, I'm really disillusioned about existing programming languages
<derek> hahaha on the gnome comments
<derek> jamest i have lots of ideas for ENDUSER manual
<Isomer> and besides
<derek> and it includes lots of pictures (Seriously)
<Isomer> you guys seem to be collecting dependancies at the moment :)
<jamest> derek: I've started the manual
<nickr> enduser manual?
<nickr> hmm
<jamest> and it includes pictures :)
<jamest> and it's in <gasp!> lyx
<jamest> yes
<nickr> what do end users see?
<jamest> derek: I'm no longer alone!
<Isomer> .html, .dvi, .ps, .pdf
<Isomer> I guess :)
<jamest> jcater has entered my docbook hell
<derek> im sorry
<jcater> sigh
<derek> the more i use lyx i think its evil
<jamest> as I made the lyx docs in docbook format
<derek> i prefer raw docbook xml
<derek> i like lyx concept
<jamest> and guess what
<derek> but xforms dependency and HAVING to have lyx to do transformations licks bag
<jamest> the fucking (it's too personal to misspell) docbook won't install on his machine
<derek> but lyx docs are better than no docs :)
<derek> jamest: point being he doesnt need docbook neither do you
<derek> emacs will work
<jamest> I've written 3 chapters of a manual
<jamest> while he's trying to just get the dependencies
<derek> or any text editor
<jamest> working
<derek> and goats or some other location with docbook can create the files
<derek> :)
<derek> but thats besides the point, lyx is acceptable
<derek> perfectlable acceptable :)
<jcater> :)
Action: jcater prefers .txt files
<jamest> derek: you have a URL w/ docbook rpms for jcater?
<jamest> he needs it to create the output
<jcater> my headache is getting worse
<jamest> lyx files are just latex, they can be hand edited as well :)
<jamest> anyway, old battle
<jcater> ok
<jcater> what's the debian apt-get ?
Action: jcater cranks out his old laptop
<derek> yeah
<derek> dcm's sight
<derek> er site even let m e dig it up
Action: derek shudders at hand edit of lyx 
<derek> er latex
<jamest> ?
<jamest> no worse than docbook IMHO
<jamest> of course I deal w/ it more
<derek> frick
<derek> he redid his site
<Isomer> hmm
<derek> and moved the docbook stuff
<jcater> vi techref.lyx
<jcater> sorry
<jcater> wrong window
<nickr> argh, pringles are the product of satan
<derek> if you want i can put the rpms i have on this machine on goats
<jcater> nak
<derek> actually
<derek> http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=docbook
<derek> rpmfind its a slow apt-get :)
<derek> for rpm
<derek> if you are on a redhat system though
<derek> go get the cd you installed from
<derek> it has docbook on the cd
<derek> i.e. its part of the distribution
<jcater> slackware
<derek> jcater ah, why did jamest ask for rpms?
Action: derek wonders about guys that use slackware ;)
<derek> is ports collection available for slack yet?
Action: jcater trout slaps derek
Action: derek turns the other cheek
Action: derek slaps stbain with a smelly old crappie
Action: derek slaps gnuebot with a smelly old crappie
Action: derek slaps ajmitch with a smelly old crappie
Action: derek slaps bigbrother with a smelly old crappie
Action: derek slaps chillywilly with a smelly old crappie

Action: derek slaps Mr_You with a smelly old crappie
Action: derek slaps nickr with a smelly old crappie
<Isomer> !
<derek> dang thats wicked :)
<derek> i have buttons to do things in xchat, i found you can highlight more than one user and do multiple application 
<derek> muhahahaha
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> this is your masta
<derek> an instant crappie slap to the whole channel
<jcater> this is your masta on drigs
<jcater> drugs
<derek> rolf
<jcater> any questions?
<derek> is how you know im on drugs :)
<jamest> i thought you used rh? 
<jcater> I have an unfortunate server at work that has redhat on it
Action: jcater 's gonna start a debian install before he goes to bed
<nickr> mm
<nickr> sweet sweet apt
<derek> good coder, extra donuts
<jcater> course, I really do miss my freebsd
<nickr> be strong
<derek> they are toast (freebsd) state of confusion w/ windriver hanging them out to dry (IMO)
<jamest> ok, it's not much
<derek> if you must BSD i suggest netBSD ;)
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> been meaning to install that in my fridge
<jcater> one of those honeydo's
<nickr> yea, what was up with that Wind River thing?
<jcater> jamest: what's not much?
<derek> we need to test GNUe on our toaster anyhow, so having someone that is netBSD friendly could be of use :)
<jamest> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jamest/pre-release/gnuef-users-guide/
<nickr> netbsd is funky monkey
<derek> looking at netbsd 'platforms' is truly amazing
<nickr> yea
<jamest> jcater: you'll notice some stuff in there I'm sure
<derek> algor     alpha     amiga     amigappc  arc       arm26     arm32     atari     bebox     cats     cesfic   cobalt    dnard    dreamcast  evbsh3    hp300     hpcarm    hpcmips   hpcsh     i386      luna68k   mac68k    macppc    mipsco    mmeye     mvme68k   netwinder  news68k   newsmips  next68k   ofppc     pc532     playstation2  pmax      prep      sandpoint  sgimips   sparc     sparc64   sun2      sun3      vax       walnut    x68
<derek>   x86_64   
<derek> to name a few
<nickr> netbsd runs on a peice of tinfoil and a wet napkin
<nickr> a port to your ass in in progress
<derek> jamest/jcater what did the netBSD dudes tshirts say?
<jcater> it had an up arrow pointing to his head
<jcater> and said, "my brain runs on netbsd" (IIRC)
<derek> yes i think you are correct
<nickr> ho ho
<derek> sigh
<jcater> jamest: what's the apt-get to get docbook working?
<derek> 'minor' gripe and i will get flamed
<jamest> apt-get install smgltools-lite
<derek> but i dont like that our screen shots are running a theme that obviously one desktop over another :)
Action: jamest whips out the bbw grill
<jamest> bbw = bbq
<jcater> lol
<jcater> we have new screenshots?
<jamest> derek: ?
<jcater> jamest: this in cvs?
<derek> a bbw bbq, um ill let you play that one
<derek> by the way screenshot == image in the new doc :)
<jcater> derek: well, you got your pictures, didn't you?
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> just got to that point
<jamest> you wanna keep all those looser gnome themes consistant in the screenshot section there ya ximian lover?
Action: jcater is reading pretty closely
<derek> yeah the bbw at the bbq are great, got any with pantyhose though??
Action: derek and those fetishes you know
<jamest> is that a good flame?
<derek> jamest: rofl, im not saying the screenshots have to be made on gnome, just use themes that are neutral
<derek> i.e. on both gnome and kde so we dont piss off either camp :)
<jamest> huh?
<derek> hell piss em both off and do all screen shots in windows
<jcater> jamest: I think he is saying do all screenshots in lwm
<jamest> you mean someone polluted kde's theme's with sawfish lookalikes?!?!?
<jamest> flame count: 2
<jamest> i have twm at work
<derek> fovl
<jamest> i can do there
<derek> er rofl
<derek> i just mean use a theem w/o a K in the corner
<jamest> hell, it's X
<derek> or a FOOT in the corner :)
<jamest> I'll startup in failsafe w/o any window manager
<derek> sigh its not worth discussing was just something that popped in head
<jcater> there ya go
<derek> i dont want to be a GNU/Linux'er
<jamest> sigh, if you think it's a big deal we can change
<derek> there are definitely more important issues:)
<derek> and there is nothing wrong with KDE
<derek> just want to avoid the wars in here later on, from one camp or the other
<jcater> of course not... we need something usable on linux
Action: jcater ducks
<jamest> but honestly I figured we'd have lots of different ones 
<jamest> btw - how we hide the "windows" ones
<jamest> flame count: 3
<derek> jcater then stay away from ximian by all means :)
<Isomer> do the entire thing in fvwm
<derek> i mean ONLY in the docs
<derek> not talking screenshots on website
<jamest> ah, ok
<derek> sorry for bad term in the beginning
<jamest> i can do that
<jamest> :)
<jamest> anyway, it's the start of a users guide
<jamest> as my users need one
<jamest> if people don't like it, it's in cvs, change at will
<derek> im all for making the screenshots on the website come from as MANY diff setups as possible, shows flexibility of gnue :)
<jamest> honestly lots of our docs are out of date
<jamest> :(
<jamest> i noticed that tonight reading them
<jcater> report's docs are current
<derek> where im really thinking is like gnome documentation project makes all document shots use the same theme and window theme
<jamest> txt and lyx  both
<derek> which is nice for consistency
<derek> but i wont go there :)
<derek> jamest: i will look at updateing docs
<derek> i read the developers guide and was like, ouch
<jamest> i'll let you guy figure that out, as I promised I'd be in bed at 10PM
<Isomer> hmm
<derek> need to change some stuff :)
<jamest> and it's um, a little after
<derek> it was amazingly still pretty consistent
<derek> just some new pieces have been added etc
Action: derek is ready to go into masta mode
Action: jcater needs to go to bed too
<jcater> I hate docbook
<derek> dcl and coder whipping, documentation slave and 'alpha' as in lead tester
<Isomer> provide a form:  Window Manager: [ Gnome  v]  WMTheme: [ Eggplant Yellow v]  Toolkit Theme: [ Wooden v]   [ Generate ScreenShot ]
<jcater> it even bombed out of apt-get
<derek> jcater: it had bad things to say about you too
<jamest> jcater: but, but, it almost runs on all linux compatible systems!
<jamest> jcater: almost
<derek> its just not 'hick' compatiable yet :)
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I guess that's it
Action: jamest is a very verbal docbook hater
<jamest> but anyway
<jcater> sigh
<jamest> oooooooooooooo!
<jcater> jamest: but you are making me install it
<jamest> lets do them all in openoffice
<derek> jcater: im ashamed as we always just assumed jamest was doing apt-get docbuc
Action: jamest ducks
<derek> and we didnt have the heart to tell him to check his spelling
<jcater> jamest: fine with me
<jamest> jcater: I'm not making you, honest
<jamest> I'm in the same boat as you
<jamest> in trying to stay compatible w/ the docbook std for gnue :(
<ajmitch> grr, no python debs in sid
<jamest> I don't wanna have to "program" my docs
<jcater> ajmitch: should be
<jamest> anyway, i really need to run
<jamest> l8r
<jcater> run!
jamest (jamest@fh-dialup-201085.flinthills.com) left irc: "[x]chat"
<ajmitch> jcater: not hurd
<jcater> lol
<jcater> oh
<jcater> derek: btw, we have samples in the windows setup.exe now
<jcater> it's a selectable component
<derek> cool
<jcater> so you can deselect it
<derek> i have LOTS o questions on new setup
<jcater> our windows setup rocks!
<derek> does it search for existing python, wx etc?
Action: Isomer will make sure psu quotes you on taht jcater
<Isomer> s/taht/that/
<jcater> it's a standalone setup
<derek> or does it not care and use dll's regardless
<jcater> it does not use a local installation
<jcater> even if it's there
<derek> jcater: ok, thats what i thought
<derek> guess that makes life easier and puts us in more control
<derek> wish we could make the unix setup that damn clean and good looking
<jcater> sigh
<Isomer> derek: isn't that what "apt-get" is all about?
<derek> kind of
<derek> apt-get is not universal
<ajmitch> it's not?
<derek> i.e. it would meet needs of our debian users
<derek> but debian is only 1 of many distributions
<derek> and 9 out of the top ten used distros dont use .deb's or apt
<derek> so that would go against the grain of gnue by making it hard to use for a majority of our audience
<Isomer> isn't that what redcarpet is for?
<Isomer> or whatever they call it?
<derek> redcarpet and other rpm based apt knock offs are prop at best
<derek> i.e. they are not well licensed and need the software in them to be part of 'partner agreements' from the content providers
<derek> which i think is something we would like to avoid
<derek> i dont see why a setup.sh is so evil
<derek> i just installed SimCity3000 for linux
<derek> sh setup.sh
<derek> and 3rd most beautiful install i have ever done
<derek> behind rail road tycoons 2 and civilization call to power
<nickr> yea, loki puts out good stuff
<derek> open office has a nice install too
<jcater> nite
jcater (jason@HubA-mcr-24-165-193-222.midsouth.rr.com) left irc: "later"
<derek> nite
<Isomer> setup.sh isn't a bad way either
Action: Isomer just thinks that there has to be even nicer ways :)
<Isomer> however, as you point out they're all non-standard and reasonably evil
<derek> im not saying there is only one way to skin a cat either
chillywilly (danielb@d8.as2.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> what disadvantages do you precieve just providing a .rpm?
<ajmitch> loki's installer is available under the GPL, iirc
<nickr> I believe that you are correct
<ajmitch> of course ;)
<ajmitch> http://www.lokigames.com/development/setup.php3
<derek> cool
<derek> btw: how do you get x to run on another display?
<ajmitch> derek: how do you mean? get X apps to run elsewhere?
<nickr> export the display on the client side, set the server side to accept the clients
<derek> nickr: ok how
<derek> basically i just normally do startx
<derek> but now i want x on more than one display on same machine
<derek> i.e. in past i let X run on diplay 0
<ajmitch> startx -- :1
<derek> then use ctrl-alt f2-6 to play around
<ajmitch> gets X to start up on :1
<derek> ok let me try it
<ajmitch> if that don't work use xinit -- :1
<derek> aj think you :)
<derek> i was trying 
<derek> startx --client :2
