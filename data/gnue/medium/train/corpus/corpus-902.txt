<nickr> hey cw
<Maniac> nickr: hi
<gemcat> hi
<Maniac> nickr: rumour has it you have some concept of a document management system for GNUe?
<gemcat> i have been reading up on xml - what use do you plan to make of it?
<nickr> Maniac: Rumor is correct
<nickr> gemcat: xml is used heavily throughout gnue
<gemcat> well my question was philosophy - what are your aims?
<nickr> philosophy?
<gemcat> i think to be successful you need a very strong database interface - are you using xml for that?
<Isomer> AFAIK no databases support XML transactions
<mdean> MSSQL 2k does
<nickr> the database interface, and most other interfaces, are based on CORBA afaik.
<gemcat> there is a lot of discussion
<gemcat> actually there are several 'engines' that generate xml from databases
<ajmitch> hey Isomer
<gemcat> the ticklish thought is what if you have a really huge set of documents
<reinhard> gemcat: we are doing xml _from_ database in the reports module
<reinhard> and we have looked at the xml query language from the gnome-db project
<reinhard> and we decided to stick with SQL for the db access
<gemcat> i am really excited about what you are doing
<reinhard> because SQL is sufficiently standardized
<reinhard> and supported natively by virtually every db
<gemcat> the sybase interface is sql via the java engine
<gemcat> one feature of that is the ability to choose what is done server side and client side
Action: chillywilly wants to look at OQL

<nickr> Hi.
<gemcat> has any there been any success recruiting from the many small enterprise related projects at sourceforge?
<gemcat> it looks like several could fit nicely - expecially the fundraiser and the bbs ones
Maniac (darryl@h24-82-132-209.wp.shawcable.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<nickr> I'm terribly board.
<nickr> Is there a guide somewhere to building 2 teir apps with gnuef etc?
<Maniac> nickr: you could explain to me your plans for a doc management sytem :)
<nickr> Maniac: Sure, hmm
<nickr> The basic premise is a system in which each of three componants are intended to be operated by different entities (of course they could all be operated as one also)
<nickr> hrm so theres no internal trust between the componants
<nickr> bascially there are two major elements, and a sort of combinator, there is a Metastore a Physicalstore and the DocuStore
<Maniac> ok
<nickr> The physical storesimply stores blocks of data under a key
<nickr> like a sort of filesystem
<nickr> but without any metadata
<nickr> hrmm, maybe I should go back to hov the system sees documents
<Maniac> ok
<nickr> It sees documents as an identifier wich is associated with several unchangeable instances
<nickr> so its like a permininant versioning system
<nickr> you have, say, document Foo, and Foo has several instances, Bar, Baz and Quux which are considered to be 'versions' of Foo
<nickr> The cananical Foo could notionally be the newest or the oldest or whatever, depending on the application build ons the system
<nickr> Each instance may be created or destroyed or modified until it is 'committed', at which point it becomes immutable
<nickr> so anyway, the metastore indexes and keeps track of certain metadata associated with each document
<nickr> (and each instance)
<nickr> the phystore actually stores the documents themselves
<nickr> well the data associated with the metadata, which could be anything really
<nickr> the docustore is the combinator wihch talks to bothof the other major subsystems
<nickr> hmm
<nickr> this is the underlying layer
<nickr> lots of different apps would be build on top of this system
<nickr> such as an 'organic document system' which would essentially add templating
<nickr> and a 'library' wich would add indexing and 'chick-in/check-out' semantics
<Maniac> ah
<Maniac> so the intention is to build something very extensible and customizable
<nickr> Yes, the overall intention is to provide a robust storage platform for document type apps
<Maniac> this is in concept stage stil yes?
<nickr> I have corba interface definitions for the frontend and some parts of the subsystems
<nickr> I'm still thinking about authentication and such at the call level
<nickr> I'd just as soon impliment it without to get it somewhere then add that later
<gemcat> i use Expedition for engineering document control - it is corba afaik

<nickr> cool
<chillywilly> it increases blood flow and gives you a good cardiovascular workout
<chillywilly> :P
<Mr_You> http://www.paul.boddie.net/

<chillywilly> does XForms have any limitations?
<chillywilly> they are talking about the W3C standard right?
<chillywilly> yep they are
<chillywilly> I wodner if GNUe would benefit form using that standard
<Mr_You> It would replace our Forms client methods?
<Mr_You> probably wouldn't be hard to integrate X-Forms clients at somepoint, or redo GNUe Forms to use X-Forms methods instead
<chillywilly> yes, but I dunno if they would do it though
<chillywilly> :P
<Mr_You> BTW, I mainly do CGI perl coding.. so python should be cool
<Mr_You> X-Forms might be limiting for what we need, dunno
<chillywilly> well neither do I

<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> he wasn't on much
<jamest> ah
<jamest> ok
<jamest> you play with the mcmillan stuff at all?
<jcater> no
<jcater> I fixed a few oddities in GFClient, though

<jcater> I can do the mcmillan stuff today I'm sure

<jcater> yes
<jcater> I thought I should include that to better distinguish the drivers they need to download
<jcater> maybe I wasn't clear

<jamest> annother plane went down?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> heading towards JFK
<jamest> accident or intentional?
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> cnn.com is down
<jcater> but the airports in NY are closed
<jcater> NEW YORK (AP) - A plane crashed Monday morning in the Queens section of New York, and buildings reportedly were on fire in the neighborhood. 
<jamest> cnn has next to nothing on it
<jamest> 3 sentences
<jcater> I think that's cause no one knows anything yet
<jcater> The Dow index dropped 200 points on hearing the news. 
<jamest> lol
<jamest> paniced, the hurd thunders headlong off a cliff
<jcater> :)
<jcater> are you adding a blurb to the README about database tests, or should I?
<jcater> I have time, btw
<jamest> the only ones I know that work are the postgresql ones
<jamest> so if you know the others then go ahead
<jamest> I have to head across campus for a bit anyway

<ov> first of all I'd like to load new definition for a class (update tables).
<reinhard> that is done every time you restart geas-server
<ov> ah
<reinhard> in geas.conf there is a line like
<reinhard> # mainlog geas.log
<reinhard> when you uncomment this line you get a log of all db changes
<ov> ok, next question: where can I find a howto for gcd-files? 
<reinhard> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~neilt/GNUeModuleGuide/main/x369.html
<reinhard> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~neilt/sc.html contains some pointers to good documentation
<reinhard> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/ is a more "official" address :)
<ov> yep, after restarting geas, I found my new table. Somewhere in the docs I read, that methods are not yet implemented. Still?
<reinhard> to be 100% honest
<reinhard> methods are already implemented
<reinhard> but in a way we are not happy with
<reinhard> and we want to redo the implementation
<reinhard> so we don't tell you :)
<ov> Grrrr... ;-)
<jamest> :)
<ov> as I found on the web GEAS, Forms is Alpha stage. A fundamental question:: is there a release plan?
<reinhard> yes of course
<reinhard> for example forms 0.1.0 is planned for october 2000
<reinhard> umm.....
<reinhard> seriously
<reinhard> forms and reports seems usable
<reinhard> in the state they are now
<reinhard> GEAS was contributed by a company and we are now in the process
<reinhard> of going through the code and adapting it to our needs
<reinhard> wrt maintainability, performance etc.
<ov> my question was aiming at the release plan, because I consider
<ov> doing some real work with it, but I'm not sure
<ov> to do so.
<ov> What would you recommend?
<jamest> run
<jamest> and don't look back
<ov> seriously?
<reinhard> i would say
<reinhard> with forms/reports yes
<reinhard> with geas: not yet
<jamest> sorry
<jamest> back
<jamest> forms works
<jamest> reports is starting to work
<jamest> geas works but IIRC is slow
<ov> realisation should take place Q2 next year. what do you think about?
<jamest> the forms/geas driver is broken
<ov> okay, 2 tier is my friend. ;-)
<jamest> then forms will work for you
<jamest> we're ready to release a 0.1.0 hopefully today
<jamest> hammering out the details on a setup.exe install for windows clients
<reinhard> ov: may i ask what kind of company you work for?
<ov> I've my own one!
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> web page?
<ov> have a look at http://members.aon.at/vecernik

<ov> I'm dealing in barcode readers, thermal printers and mobile data equipment
<ov> very important is curses support with forms (for my terminals)
<ov> does it work now (I read somewhere it was broken)?
<jamest> it is still broken
<jamest> however
<jamest> the 0.1.0 release paves the way for 0.3.0 to start
<ov> :-(
<jamest> which is the UI rewrite release
<jamest> so I'd expect it functional soon
<ov> :-)
<jamest> on the list of todos for forms
<jamest> 0.1.x - fix current driver issues as found (this includes the geas one)
<jamest> 0.3.0 - UI rewrite to support curses, web, enhanced UI features, better integration with designer
<ov> is there a possibility to write businessobjects for 2 tier and
<ov> port them to geas sometimes?
<jamest> depends
<jamest> we're going to try and share trigger/method system
<jamest> if it works then I think you could at least share the methods
<jamest> the object definition isn't possible now
<chillywilly> I think we also need to share the object system
<chillywilly> and the objects need to be data aware
<chillywilly> would make forms a little fatter but then forms could play with objects too and they can execute on the client side
<chillywilly> or you can go with GEAS
<chillywilly> or some configuration like that
<chillywilly> actually you shouldn't even have to know that the objects are remote objects or not
<chillywilly> imho
<chillywilly> just use the GComm object and if it is remote it will take care of loading the ORB and or SOAP or whatever
<ov> I don't know what the GComm object is, but the idea is great! Possible?
<chillywilly> it is just or name for common
<chillywilly> GNUe Common package

<jcater> jamest: the question?
<Isomer_> about life universe and everything?
<rm-away> lol
Nick change: rm-away -> reinhard
<reinhard> wasn't the answer
<reinhard> 21?
<jcater> jamest: the answer is, "No"
<jamest> argh!
<jamest> ok
<jamest> sorry
<jamest> back
<jamest> we can now have a setup.exe for forms and designer
<jamest> however
<jamest> we should probably come up with a default install behaviour for gnue tools on windows machines
<jamest> fwiw: gnuef is weighing in at about 4.5MB w/ no other install requirements
<reinhard> we should be compatible with other windows installed programs
<jamest> most of which I'm certain is wxPython
<reinhard> so we should install 80% of the files under WINDOWS/SYSTEM
<jamest> rofl
<jamest> I'll adjust the install scripts immediately
<reinhard> 5% under PROGRAM FILES/GNUE SHARED/GNUE COMMON
<jamest> I guess what I'm asking is what do we want
<ajmitch> reinhard: fill up C:\ as well (even if installing on D:)
<jamest> gee, this is all great input 
<jcater> jamest: what d'ya mean?
<jcater> the target directory?
<jcater> I'm not sure what you're asking
<jamest> right now gnuef goes in (default) c:\program files\GNUe Forms Client
chillywilly_ (danielb@d151.as1.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) left irc: Read error to chillywilly_[d151.as1.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net]: EOF from client
<jamest> and it has an {app}/etc/*.conf
<jamest> and it has an {app}/shared/images/*.png
<jamest> in there
<jamest> designer would work similar
<jamest> I was wondering if we wanted to do something like
<jamest> C:\program files\gnue\gnue forms client
<jamest> C:\program files\gnue\designer
<jamest> C:\program files\gnue\etc
<jamest> C:\program files\gnue\shared
<jamest> etc, etc
<jcater> I vote for the latter
<reinhard> metoo
<Isomer_> doesn't MS have some guide lines for this kinda thing?
Nick change: Isomer_ -> Isomer
<jamest> as do i
<jamest> however, we still have issues
<reinhard> i would even say
<reinhard> s/gnue forms client/forms
<reinhard> so the path is
<reinhard> c:\program files\gnue\forms
<jamest> ok
<jamest> standing issues then
<jamest>   which package contains gnue.conf
<jamest> :)
<reinhard> common?
<reinhard> is that a package of itself?
<jcater> an alternative installation scheme would be to have two installation .exes, a "GNUe Client Environment" and a "GNUe Development Environment" in which GNUe Client would only contain like gfclient (and grrun when available), whereas the Development environment has all the .exe's
<jcater> I'm not saying I'm pushing that
<jcater> but something to consider
<jcater> then you don't have conflicting gnue.conf's
<jcater> 'course, the only problem there is what happens if stuff isn't released concurrently
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> we need a setup mgr app
<jamest> that can run and update all this crap for us
<jcater> (btw, if we stick w/Designer install and Forms install, I'd vote for the conf stuff to go into gfclient
<jcater> )
<jcater> as it's the least common denominator
<jcater> jamest: we're not helping much, are we?
<jamest> ok
<jamest> now I've got gnuef in gnue\forms
<jamest> and a gnue/shared and gnue/etc
<jamest> however
<jamest> I need a method of setting the INSTALL_PREFIX and GNUE_CONNECTIONS
<jamest> unless we make the clients look in some thing like exedir/../etc
<jamest> as I don't seem to have a way to tell the installer to alter autoexec.bat
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> can the setup program run a script or executable as part of the install?
<Isomer> you shouldn't be setting environmental variables for the windows install
<jamest> jcater: yes
<jamest> Isomer: it should go in the registry 
<Isomer> precisely
<jamest> but we don't support that :(
<jcater> jamest: please don't say that
<Isomer> when in rome....
<jcater> I want to be able to do a samba install 
<jamest> jcater: I mean a single entry for gnue pointer
<jamest> jcater: yes, that is other bad things
<jcater> jamest:??
<jamest> as it sets we _should_ be able to network install this puppy
<jamest> registry hacks make than tougher
<jcater> that's why I don't want to see a registry hack :)
<jamest> I think I'd be happy if the client apps (gnuef, designer, reports) looked in their executable is located in
<jamest> .....in the dir their .....
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I'd be fine with that if
<Isomer> how does hacking autoexec.bat help network installs?
<jamest> from there go ../etc/gnue.conf
<jamest> i doesn't
<jamest> it
<jamest> this is my problem
<jamest> everything is ugly
<Isomer> it's microsoft, what do you expect? :)
<jcater> I'd be fine with that if later on we added an include = line to the config files
<jcater> (read that LATER ON part :)
<jcater> jamest: at least for 0.1.0, I don't think we can do better than looking in the exec dir/../etc
<jcater> that's my vote
<jamest> jcater: any chance I could con you into adding it 
<jamest> as I leave in about 45 min
<jamest> and want to get this installer functional
<jamest> or I can checkin what we have
<jamest> and you can play w/ it while I add it
Action: jamest is getting antsy
<jamest> :)
<jamest> nevermind
<jamest> I'll do it real quick

<Mr_You> and perl cgi
<stbain> so Zope vs. Webware?
<Mr_You> well.. if you want.. but most people just choose whatever works for them
<stbain> no... I meant does anyone know the pros and cons of webware vs. zope?
<Mr_You> webware is still beta, and early in the big scheme of things
<Mr_You> I think they are listed lessons they have learned and goals of webware on the site
<Maniac> zope is too complicated webware fits the brain :)
<Maniac> there maybe a doc on the webware site somewhere that gives pros vs zope
<Maniac> zope is complicated to get up and running with
<jcater> zope is very powerful though
<jcater> we use it inhouse
<Mr_You> it was a nice surprise to here someone has a somewhat working webware+GNUe code
<jcater> ('course, at the time, I didn't know about webware)
<stbain> zope is complicated to get up and running with?
<stbain> I found it quite simple to download and install
<jcater> I had no problem
<stbain> dtml is a snap
<jcater> I was generating reports from my Oracle database with dtml in no time at all
<Mr_You> I found a doc on workflow written by a python coder.. posted it last night.. www.paul.boddie.net

<Mr_You> I have a new idea for a band/label.. gonna be sonicalchemy.org ;-)
<chillywilly> nice name
<Mr_You> focus will be non-profit company with a philosophy on providing donations to many orgs from the income it brings.. also will focus on featuring individuals with good musicianship, improvisation, and creativity..  not solo acts, but bands, or sitins from musicians for super-group type situation
<jcater> I have a new country song...
<Mr_You> FSF is one org I'm considering ;-)

<Mr_You> jcater: hehe
<chillywilly> jcater: lol
<Mr_You> chilly: thanks, I like it too.. "stole" it from this latest Pink Floyd mercial that has been on about the greatest hits or somethin

<ajmitch> hi chillywilly ;)
<chillywilly> hi
Action: chillywilly is gonna play mario cart now
<chillywilly> with zsnes
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> zsnes.sourceforge.net
<nickr> didn't I ask you guys to remind me never to ask on #debian questions?
<ajmitch> nickr: what happened?
<nickr> its just a worthless waste of time
<ajmitch> chillywilly: hehe, i been playing with dgen-sdl (sega megadrive emulator)
<nickr> because its all newbies arguing about stupid things
<nickr> anyone here know anything about INN?
<ajmitch> nope
<ajmitch> this a a GNUe channel, ask debian questions in #debian ;)
<chillywilly> nickr: #debian is useless plz NEVER ask any questions  :P
<nickr> organicly grown software is so confusing
Action: ajmitch hears nickr scream in frustration
<nickr> chillywilly: thanks
<nickr> ajmitch: hehe
<chillywilly> organicly?
<Mr_You> what about inn?
<ajmitch> chillywilly: hacked :)
<nickr> Mr_You: I'm trying to setup a local news gorup heirarchy
<nickr> chillywilly: like sendmail and INN, big frankenstein monsters
<Mr_You> rtfm? ;-)
<nickr> the fine manuals that it comes with are no help
<Isomer> heh
<Mr_You> http://www.isc.org/products/INN/
<Mr_You> its been so long since I ran inn.. hmm 6+ years
<Mr_You> we had the worse news server ever.. big full height 9GB HD on a P100
<Mr_You> it just grinded all day and night
<Mr_You> semi-full newsfeed
<nickr> It shouldn't be this hard to setup an exclusively local news system
<Mr_You> hehe.. thats debatable ;-)
<nickr> No it isn't!
<Mr_You> there are other solutions.. not sure which... dnews I know
<nickr> It should be 'these are the gorups I want and how long they live and who can post to them'
<Mr_You> nickr: with inn it is ;-)
<nickr> I tried cnews, its way more crusty
<Isomer> you should try bnews :)
<Isomer> back when it was written in shell scripts :)
<nickr> I want *less* crusty, not more crusty :)
<Mr_You> wish I could help, yeah it should't be too hard, inn is just a cluster of weirdness.. use to be anyways..
<nickr> hmm
<nickr> well the weird thing is that the nnewsgroups I added show up in the list, I just can't read or post to them
<nickr> tin reports 'Newsgroup does not exist on this server'
<Mr_You> I think you have to set options (maybe another file) that states what is allowed
<nickr> I was actually slightly afraid of that
<nickr> because the file I believe you're referring to is freaky
<jcater> anyone at a windows machine????
<ajmitch> jcater: sure, gnome looks like windows here ;)
<jcater> crap... nevermind
<Mr_You> (only if it involves GNUe and Windows) ;-)))
Action: Isomer finds it mildly entertaining that noones at a windows machine
<Isomer> I've got a VNC to one
<Isomer> is that enough?
<Mr_You> no, I have access.. but will only admit it in a certain context ;-)
<ajmitch> Isomer: this is a GNU channel, most ppl use GNU/linux i guess (apart from the rare GNU/Hurd users)
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I'm sitting at one now
<ajmitch> jcater: my condolences
<ajmitch> trying to get the installer sorted?
<jcater> yes
<stbain> jcater: I'm on a Win2K Laptop from work
Action: Mr_You pulls a Bill Gates and quickly removes the jcaters seat resulting in a fall similar to a Windows app crashing..
<Mr_You> what installer?
<jcater> inno
<Mr_You> what is that?
<Mr_You> anyone tried the evolution RC1?
<derek> hmm once a fellow i know tried to lube a pineapple and put up his arse, i hear that evolution RC1 gives you same effect with half the mess....
<derek> yes im j/k
<Mr_You> geez hehe
<Mr_You> I'm looking forward to a M$ Outlook solution for linux.. evolution or mozilla
<Mr_You> or the other few
<Mr_You> aethena I think
<Isomer> mutt?
<derek> wait you might be confusing things
<derek> you looking for 'outlook' solution or 'exchange' solution?
<Mr_You> evolution enables outlook like features without exchange
<Mr_You> which hardly anyone seems to use anyways hehe
<Mr_You> but could be useful
<derek> um i disagree
<derek> evolution isnt even 5% as powerful as exchange services
<Mr_You> IIRC, evolution uses p2p technology to send scheduled events
<derek> and disagree that no one uses the exchange services
<derek> the county LIVES off outlook calendaring (shared calendars)
<Mr_You> this p2p is probably just via STMP and IMAP and interpreting the email as a calendar event
<derek> as well as a few other features
<Mr_You> yeah.. thats what I want to use and seems evolution has accomplished that.. last I checked year ago or so I guess
<derek> exchange is CRAP for a mail server, but some of its groupware services are decent (just poorly implemented at times)
<stbain> outlook like features
<derek> Mr_You: its not on par with exchange services
<Mr_You> what other features besides calendar does exchange do? my groups never used them
<derek> they might say they have 'implemented' shared calendars but im not seeing it on level of exchange
<derek> first off i dont think you can have true shared calendars in p2p mode and be effective
<derek> it works for small numbers with dedicated connections, but after that the updated of the nodes will be delayed and scheduling cant have that
<stbain> It supports peer-to-peer calendaring with users on products that support iCalendar, 
<stbain> evolution, that is
<derek> also the key feature used at county by high level officials is 'delegation'
<derek> i.e. you can delegate some to read / respond to your email as well as calendars
<Mr_You> imap should do that
<derek> btw: i think that we (GNUe) will start looking into groupware services
<derek> so that you could use your GEAS logic in such things
<derek> but thats another discussion
<Mr_You> like what kind of application for example?
<derek> btw: last time i was with the ximian folks, their secretaries (nat and miguels)
<derek> used outlook on windows
<derek> because evolution couldnt handle delegation at all
<derek> and it was too hard to 'train' her to use linux outside of that
<derek> and most of the 'investors' used windows
<derek> jade and i gave her some SERIOUS SERIOUS SERIOUS crap
<Mr_You> I think its possible
<derek> since they had to use our bandwidth for a week :)
<derek> we did get like 10 shirts, 5 monkeys, free dinner and some roller coaster rides out of it though :)
<Mr_You> not p2p in the sense of another protocol but p2p using smtp/imap
<Mr_You> ie. email apps "messages" will be sent via email and auto parsed and interpreted and deleted.
<Mr_You> I think thats how iCalendar works but I dunno
<Mr_You> delegation could be done by sending the encrypted imap password to allow switching of identities and/or reading others imap folders
<Mr_You> you have an example of a GNUe groupware app?  most orgs seem fine with email/mailing list or newsgroups.. to which any web or desktop interface could provide access too..
<Mr_You> tie everything into LDAP
<stbain> don't forget workflow, document storage, community calendaring, etc
<jcater> sigh!! well, installed new software on my Win98 station, therefore I must reboot...
<Mr_You> community calendaring is groupware, but I dunno about document management and workflow.. maybe I'm wrong.. I think of groupware as communication methods
jcater (jason@w202.z065105010.mem-tn.dsl.cnc.net) left irc: 
<Mr_You> definitely GNUe could be useful for community calendaring, workflow, and document management..and many other ERP-type apps
<Mr_You> I'm even thinking about Content Management System for webcontent from GNUe, but I don't consider that groupware
<ajmitch> CMS sounds sorta like what chillywilly is gonna do :)
<Mr_You> in the end tho, I guess it would be cool to have everything authenticate through GEAS 
<Mr_You> he must be keeping it a secret then ;-)
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> what comes under the topic of CMS?
<Mr_You> really webware could be "everything web" for GNUe..
<ajmitch> yes
<derek> Mr_You: yes 
<Mr_You> that way you could (hopefully) tie in any webware module into GNUe
<ajmitch> i (and chillywilly) are going to write a phpnuke-like forum using webware
<stbain> given the python-centric nature of GNUe, it seems like cmf.zope.org would fit right in
<derek> i see groupware of gnue integrating nicely into GNUe Workflow and Document Management
<derek> as well as offering shared calendars, contacts etc
<ajmitch> what about phpGroupware?
<derek> ajmitch: no comment
<Mr_You> ajmitch: "should" only require porting one to webware I guess
<ajmitch> wasn't something happening with that & GNUe?
<derek> other than i refuse to use a phpMiddleWare with GNUe
<ajmitch> ah, ok
<ajmitch> using webware stuff seems quite useful tho
<derek> subsitute i with we as the gnue core team isnt into using phpmiddleware and authentication services :)
<ajmitch> :)
<stbain> we're already running everything off of python objects, right?
<Mr_You> ok, I'm gonna be a little upset if I wasted all this time on this debian mirror.. considering its almost 60GBs now
<ajmitch> Mr_You: wow
<Mr_You> I should have just hacked at the broken scripts
<Mr_You> ajmitch: thats without source, just debs of US-debian
<Mr_You> tweaking my rsync exclude again
jcater (jason@w202.z065105010.mem-tn.dsl.cnc.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> so what are you looking at doing with webware & GNUe? planning to talk to the webware ppl?
<derek> um
<Mr_You> madlocke already has code working or something
Action: ajmitch is curious about what toys he can play with ;)
<derek> looking to use webware for UI driver for UIhtml.py
<ajmitch> ok
<derek> that madlocke is working on
<derek> forms is designed to abstract UI like it to abstract databases
<derek> i.e. you simply provide a UI driver
<derek> now the killer thing is if you use something python based you can use all underlying objects
<ajmitch> yep
<derek> and just reimplement UIdriver.py
<derek> i believe madlocke has UIhtml.py and some updates to the objects
<derek> that would give us basic functionality for a web version of forms
<ajmitch> but madlocke has been AWOL for a little while?
<Mr_You> he's back
<derek> our agents have tracked him down
<Mr_You> hehe
<ajmitch> ah ok
<derek> only a matter of time before we can extract the code ;)
Action: Mr_You suddenly hears in the distance "I'll never tell..."
<ajmitch> you've smuggled him back to the GNUe compound for interrogation?

<ajmitch> afternoon jamest
Action: ajmitch tries a cvs up
<Mr_You> worked for me a little while ago
<ajmitch> anoncvs works for me
<derek> problems with a gnu machine, i cant believe that :)
<ajmitch> probably a problem at jamest's end
<jcater> jamest: ah, you'rer back
<derek> probably a lsh problem
<jamest> derek: can you cvs update via your ssh 
<jamest> key
<derek> i.e. pserver always works 
<derek> its a SECURE connection that is down most of hte time
<derek> jamest: i still pserver
<derek> for the gnue box
<derek> er gnu
<ajmitch> i see
<jcater> jamest: up for me
<derek> mainly cause it took a year for me to get an account that worked for ssh :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> i can't update cvs from here
Action: ajmitch guesses he couldn't use ssh for cvs ;)
<jamest> yip
<jamest> it no longer accepts my key
<ajmitch> damn
<jamest> as since I don't have a password on pserver anymore I'm locked out
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> upgraded ssh lately?
<jamest> no
<chillywilly> ack
<ajmitch> hey chillywilly
<chillywilly> subverisons ssh support blows
<chillywilly> goats even
<jamest> anyone play w/ the inno setup stuff?
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> yes
<jamest> that good eh?
<jcater> inno works great :)
<Mr_You> bbl
<jcater> but the resulting install doesn't
<jamest> yes it does
Action: Mr_You &
<jamest> it worked fine on my last build
<jamest> except for the environment vars not being set
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> forms worked for me except the environ vars
<jamest> of course
<jcater> but designer said critical system dlls were missing
<jcater> :(
<jamest> now I'm locked out of cvs
<jamest> designer was never tested
<jcater> but, first things first.. I'm trying to figure out the environ vars
<jamest> ever
<jcater> btw
<jcater> did you know mcmillan forces the __file__ of our imported stuff to be
<jcater> located at c:\python21\
<jcater> fsck!
<jamest> no, i didn't see that
<jamest> i thought it put everything in dist_gf*
<jcater> if you do a gfclient.exe -d10
<jcater> you see all the [mymodule:linenum] Messages
<jcater> have /python21/gnue/common/something
<jcater> as the mymodule
<jcater> I'm trying to see if that's causing it to make the install prefix as c:\python21
<jcater> sigh
<jamest> um
<jamest> that is set in gnue.conf
ajmitch_ (ajmitch@p45-max5.dun.ihug.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.

ajmitch (me@p45-max5.dun.ihug.co.nz) left irc: http://www.freedevelopers.net
<jcater> on my machine
<jcater> I'm talking about in gfclient.py and gfdesigner.py
<jcater> so it knows where to find gnue.conf
<jcater> I'm wondering if that's still basing it off of c:\python21
<jamest> well, that's where it initally installs
<jamest> at least on my setup
<jcater> yeah, but remember, you had me do a fix before you left
<jcater> it now uses the base director of gfclient/../etc
<jamest> oh! I misunderstood the problem
<Isomer> hmm
Action: jcater is tired, so isn't coherent
<Isomer> how goes the windows installer?
<jamest> close, i think

<Isomer> rofl
<jcater> but close, oh so close
<jcater> jamest: btw, I hope you don't mind.. I added to the inno setup file so it'd associate GFD's with gfclient (so you can double-click a form and run it)
<jcater> also, you can right-click a GFD and click "Edit" and open it in designer
<jamest> cool
<jamest> i wanted to do that but ran out of time
<chillywilly> wtf is inno?
<jcater> it's the "in" versionn of "mono"
<jamest> a free installer for windows
Action: chillywilly beats jcater with a trout
<jamest> takes a script and makes a setup.exe from a bunch of files
<jamest> with the files we have gnuef and designer are setup.exe's
<jamest> that install and uninstall nicely
<jamest> just got to work some kinks out of the system
<chillywilly> we can't have that
<chillywilly> then everyone will expect easy installs
<chillywilly> :P
<jamest> don't worry chiilly
<jamest> if the user name contains dan in it
<jamest> it falls back to a mode that's a royal bitch to install
<chillywilly> great!
<jcater> crap crap crap
<jamest> we knew you'd like it like that
<chillywilly> good work jamest
<jcater> sigh
<Isomer> when are you doing a setup.sh for *nix? :)
<Isomer> shar style? :)
<jcater> Isomer: are you volunteering?
<jamest> Isomer: mcmillan supports a setup file for unix too
<jcater> jamest: I think we found a volunteer :)
Action: Isomer hasn't got it working under linux yet unfortunately
<Isomer> so I'm the worst person to ask :)
<chillywilly> dpkg -i gnue-forms.deb
<chillywilly> weee
<Isomer> heh
<stbain> ok... so if, for example, I have Python2.1 and wxWindows installed... the installer will complete the rest ofthe required tasks for installing GNUe?
<jamest> stbain: on windows you require nothing
<jamest> it's a single setup.exe
<jamest> no python, no db drivers, no wxpython, etc, etc
<stbain> where is this setup.exe?
<jamest> um, we're working on it
<stbain> ;)
<stbain> I see
<stbain> can I help?
<jamest> it almost works
<jamest> you may be able to test in a bit
<stbain> are you running into any specific problems?
<jamest> yeah, it don't work
<Isomer> rofl
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> how very descriptive of you
<stbain> yes... I know how to fix that one
Action: chillywilly beats jamest with a trout
<jcater> dang
<jcater> no slapping?
<chillywilly> no, just beating damnit
<jcater> what did you do jamest to deserve a beating instead of a slapping?
<chillywilly> youg to one too
<chillywilly> you got
<jcater> or is that chillywilly's way of getting kinky?
Action: chillywilly trout whips jcater

<derek> and is it order by
<mdean> limit is only in mysql and pgsql AFAIK, tho you can use tricks in others to accomplish the same thing - but not always
<derek> :)

<stbain> hrmmm
<stbain> what are you looking for in the way of a win32 install maintainer
<stbain> ?
<stbain> skillwise
<jamest> someone who hates themself
<jamest> and is willing to put up with a world of pain making this shit work
<jamest> as it's being a bitch
<jamest> i think once we nail down all the gotchas i'll be cake
<jamest> but right now I'm sick of it :)
<Isomer> on redhat 7.2 libpq-fe.h is in /usr/lib/pgsql/libpq-fe.h
<jamest> honestly if someone wants to maintain gnue windows installer
<jamest> i think they should let us hammer out the errors first
<Isomer> so therefore the #include needs #include <pgsql/libpq-fe.h> or you need -I/usr/include/pgsql
<jamest> then it should be as simple as making sure they have latest db/ui drivers
<jamest> and running a bat file
<jamest> then a inno script
<Isomer> whoooohoo! I got gfdesigner to segfault!
<derek> hmmm
Action: jamest blinks 
<jamest> chillywilly: could you slap me w/ a trout please
<jamest> i need to make sure I'm not dreaming

[21:37] Last message repeated 4 time(s).
<jamest> ok, I'm not dreaming
<derek> darn sticky mouse key
<Isomer> why would you be dreaming?
Action: jamest digs himself out from under an excessive pile of smelly old crappie
<jamest> i have a gnuef setup.exe that works out of the box
<jamest> at least for postgresql
<jamest> i need to find all the binary drivers i can
<stbain> wouldn't it be best to use ODBC connectivity with all of the windows clients?
<jamest> ODBC is supported
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> are boxes not containers?
<jamest> not at this time
<Isomer> theres no way to resize the labels on the property box?
<Isomer> so there are two rows "foreign_key...."
<Isomer> but I can't see what differentiates them?
<jcater> jamest: you will only be able to install stuff like postgresql, mysql, sap-db IIRC
<jcater> I know I tried oracle at work, 
<jcater> but the oracle drivers require oci.dll
<jcater> (which IIRC we can't distribute :(
<derek> jamest: im willing to test the windows install at work tomorrow
<jcater> so it rejected the Oracle drivers
<jamest> do they require it at build time?
<jamest> or only at run time?

<jamest> :)
<jamest> ok, the install works
<jamest> w/ some minnor issues to work out
<jcater> minor?
<jamest> got some masta work
<jamest> yip minor
<jamest> let me commit
<jamest> when the icon on the desktop is created it doesn't have a form 
<jamest> so it fails as gnuef always wants a form
<jamest> we need a very basic "Welsome to gnuef" form that shows some of the features (all non-data bound of course)
<jamest> that we can attempt to tie to that icon
<jcater> lol
<jcater> call it <base>/forms/GFClient.py
<jcater> err, call it <base>/forms/GFClient.gfd
<jcater> as it looks for that anyway
<jcater> :)
<jamest> some inno issues
<jamest> the working dir isn't set unless to specify it in the iss file
<jamest> and mcmillan apps assume they're running in the dir they installed to
<jcater> hmm
<jamest> so no working dir = failed w/ unable to find ddl files
<jamest> dll
<jamest> updates checked in
<jamest> i didn't touch designer yet :(
<jamest> jcater: you stable yet?
<jamest> :)
<derek> what is this inno stuff?
<derek> and when did we decide to you use it?
<Isomer> derek: the installer program
<jamest> free windows installer
<jamest> makes setup.exe
<Isomer> now that I think I understand how to get this program going and doing it's thing
<Isomer> I might do a cvs update :)
<jamest> it's the only free one I could find
<jamest> so I used it
<jamest> and it's nice
<jamest> very nice
<jcater> yes it is
<jcater> I'm gonna switch NCS's stuff to it
<jamest> gnue now installed into start-programs-gnue
<jamest> each app gets an icon, uninstall icon, web link
<jcater> jamest: you test double-clicking a GFD?
<jamest> nope
<jamest> hang on
<jamest> does not work
<jamest> :(
<jamest> gnuef fails missing dlls
<jcater> crap crap crap
<Isomer> DB000:     if self.parser.Parse(buf, 0) != 1:

<Isomer> is that fixed?
<jamest> that's a new one to me
<jcater> me too
<jamest> how'd you manage that?
<jcater> crap
<Isomer> happens when I try and load a form
<jcater> this sucks
<Isomer> in the designer
<jcater> anyone know of CVS programs for Win98????
<Isomer> there is wincvs
<jamest> ssh and samba
<jamest> or a home server
<jcater> jamest: I had to boot into Win98 mode to 
<jcater> test this win install stuff
<jcater> first time in months :(
<jamest> that's what wifes pc is for
<jamest> :)
<jcater> well, wx crashes it, remember?
<jcater> :(
<jamest> oh yeah
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I guess I can ssh into work and email a setup.py sdist :(
<jamest> btw - cvs commited
<jcater> grabbing now :)
<jamest> i can't find win32 binaries for interbase on the url given in the file
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> still can't parse that file
<jamest> which file Isomer
<Isomer> well, any xml file by my guess
<jamest> what is the command you're giving (and which platform)
<Isomer> python2 `which gfdesigner` ./helloworld2.gfd
<Isomer> running on rh7
<Isomer> I think the reason is that I've botched the install of PyXML
<Isomer> after looking closer
<Isomer> coz it's occuring inside there
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> i would think that'd work
<jamest> on thing to remember is that you need to install PyXML under python2.1
<jamest> er, 2.x

<jcater> are you running a copy of CVS, or a download?

<ToyMan> jamest: you around?
<jamest> sort of
<ToyMan> dneighbo sez you're an nfs mount guru
<jamest> um, ok
<ToyMan> could you spare some hints?
<ToyMan> trying 2 different things:
<ToyMan> 1. mount the fs /home/~ dir to newworkstation /home/~
<ToyMan> 2. mount fs /usr/ports/distfiles to workstation/ports/distfiles
<ToyMan> so the ports collection only has to download once..
<ToyMan> i think my /etc/export line is foobar
<ToyMan> it reads /home /usr/ports/distfiles/ -alldirs -maproot=0 172.16.0.109
<jamest> ?
<jamest> what OS
<ToyMan> fbsd
<ToyMan> i'm getting permission denied
<jamest> adn there is not /etc/exportfs 
<ToyMan> um, in fbsd it's /etc/exports
<ToyMan> adn?
<ToyMan> and??
<ToyMan> hmmm. well, back to the man pages..
<dneighbo> ToyMan he is getting old..... probably either stilling trying to remember what he was going to say :)
<ToyMan> cleaning his dentures ;)
<jamest> sorry
<ToyMan> no problemo
<jamest> i have not done fbsd exports in a long, long, um long time
<jamest> IIRC after you setup the exports file
<jamest> you have to run shareall 
<jamest> IIRC
<ToyMan> oh well, it's the learning curve thing
<ToyMan> IIRC? <- what's this?
<ToyMan> havn't seen a ref to shareall, maybe things have changed a bit
<jamest> If I Recall Correctly
<jamest> hmmm
<ToyMan> ahhh.  always wondered what that one meant
<jamest> could you try the command
<jamest> exports
<jamest> to see if it says something?
<ToyMan>  Command not found.
<jamest> export<tab>
<ToyMan> /etc/exports is a file where you set up your exports
<ToyMan> nada
<jamest> and you don't have anything firewalled?
<ToyMan> it's a local mount
<ToyMan> inter network..
<ToyMan> not intra
<ToyMan> or did i get the prefixes backwords?
<ToyMan> heh, nfs mount over a 28.8 modem...
<ToyMan> that would be painful
<ToyMan> kinda like windoze file sharing ;)
<jamest> :)
<jamest> and portmap is running?
<ToyMan> yep
<ToyMan> I'm pretty sure it's my exports file..
<ToyMan> I had just /home/stuq and it worked
<ToyMan> mount -w bucky:/home/stuq /mnt <- no prob
<ToyMan> but when I add additional mount points in /etc/exports
<ToyMan> it coughs
<ToyMan> well, gotta go, thanks for trying

<dneighbo> hmmm we got an HR proposal today... very interesting
madlocke (nomail@141.82.19.37) joined #gnuenterprise.
<madlocke> hi...
<madlocke> somebody told me you need windows testers... oh dear why did I try this ;)
<madlocke> jamest: you are here?
<jamest> :)
<jamest> hi
<jamest> madlocke: did you send those files?
<madlocke> not yet... have to change some things... to this later... first some more important things...
<madlocke> I tried to work with windows as I already said
<madlocke> using WinCVS to checkout...
<madlocke> cvs converts everything from lf to cr+lf
<madlocke> ok so far... but not for image files... 
<dneighbo> quick grab him, bolt him to the chair... muhahahhaa
<madlocke> these files are not marked binary in cvs...
<dneighbo> madlocke i think we need to make the cvs server do this
<dneighbo> i.e. extension types of .... automatically check them in as binary
<dneighbo> if we are not already 
Action: dneighbo is vaguelly remembering this on another project where i used wincvs
<jamest> madlocke: we need windows testers of the files in www.gnuenterprise.org/~jamest/pre-release :)
<madlocke> dneighbo: would be great to handle this automatically. manually it works by adding with -kb option
<dneighbo> madlocke is there anyway you can tar/gz your current work with webware and email to jamest or info@gnue.org
<jamest> the designer one is known broken btw
<dneighbo> even if its not complete or is getting more done to it?
<dneighbo> it would make the natives here much less restless. :)
<madlocke> jamest: I have to talk about gfd files with you first...
<madlocke> jamest: one bad example for a gfd file is ./samples/location/zipcode_maint.gfd
<madlocke> jamest: can you open this so it is easier talking about it...?
Isomer (~isomer@210-86-58-79.jetstart.xtra.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> rofl, you want a really bad example look for ./samples/track/forms/contact_manager.gfd
<Isomer> mornin' all!
<madlocke> dneighbo: not bad because it is big... another prob...
<jamest> madlocke: talk away, but I'm kinda busy
<madlocke> jamest: you see maybe that there are 3 labels and after this the list of entries...
<jamest> so responce may be a bit slow
<ajmitch> hey madlocke
Action: dneighbo digs for that smelly crappie basket he has at work... to get a good one to thwap jamest with 
<madlocke> jamest: the only relation between labels and entries is position on screen in x,y coordinates... you understand the prob?
<madlocke> hi ajmitch
<ajmitch> info cvs, it talks about binary files
<dneighbo> there was talk of binding a label to an entry
<jamest> madlocke: that is correct
<madlocke> dneighbo: it is already easier if the label tag is near the entry tag...
<dneighbo> or basically autocreating the lable based off a property of entry
<madlocke> because if I just ignore any positions and read from top to bottom, the relation is still there (if order is correc)
<dneighbo> yes
<Isomer> where can I find "mx" ?
<madlocke> jamest: can you install webware and then I send the files and do installation together with you? maybe it is easier because probably if have to write less text ;)
<madlocke> some words about installtion on windows system...
<madlocke> yes after some hours I had my first form on the screen ;)
<dneighbo> installing postgres drivers eh Isomer :)
<Isomer> dneighbo: yeah :/
<jamest> madlocke: I'll have to install webware at home, i'll try and get done tonight or tomorrow
<dneighbo> look in the README or INSTALL file
<dneighbo> it has the url there
<dneighbo> madlocke if you can be here in like 3 hours or so
<jamest> madlocke: : the files in pre-release are setup.exe's
<dneighbo> i will do the webware install with you
<jamest> it takes minutes
<dneighbo> and fully document
<dneighbo> so we can get documented for others
<jamest> no python, drivers, etc needed
<dneighbo> we should get hte webware version installed on ash as well :)
<madlocke> dneighbo: if I can still sit on my chair in 3 hours, then yes... ;) at the moment it is 23:00 here ;)
<jamest> Isomer: http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/mxDateTime.html
<madlocke> jamest: id did a cvs co and then used the install scripts...
<madlocke> jamest: ok maybe not the right way for good install ;)
<ajmitch> webware is running on my box here...
<madlocke> jamest: but... in setup.py you are changing/creating gfclient file
<madlocke> jamest: in this file there are some pathes... but there are other pathes in gnue.conf
<madlocke> jamest: these I had to change manually... why?
<madlocke> jamest: another question: why installing everything in python path?
<madlocke> jamest: why not something like ".\program files\gnue" and add the according pathes to PYTHON_PATH at startup
<madlocke> jamest: I think finding modules, etc is a more general problem in gnue not only for gnuef, so maybe there can be a solution in gnue-common
<jamest> madlocke: try the setup.exe's
<jamest> they address most of what you speak of
<jamest> everything is now in Program Files\gnue
<jamest> the old setup was our first attempt just to prove she'd run
<madlocke> ok
<madlocke> so the setup will change later in cvs too?
<madlocke> because maybe someone tries the same ?
<jamest> nope
<jamest> cvs on win32 is a developers install
<jamest> then in each packages doc/installer
<jamest> are instructions/files for building the exe's which are installed for a user properly
<madlocke> great this helps I think
<jamest> the plus side of this is the setup.exe's _should_ be networkable
<jamest> where as python itself doesn't support network installs
<jamest> :)
<madlocke> :)
<madlocke> how are the exes created? with py2exe?
<jamest> nope
<jamest> it doesn't support PyXML so py2exe files
<jamest> fails
<jamest> McMillian Installer and Inno
<jamest> it's all in the README
<jamest> fwiw: we just got this up last night
<madlocke> ok... like all the time... rftm.. understand... :) it's just new for me that there is any doc ;)
<jamest> lol
<jamest> we promise it won't happen again

<dneighbo> bad coder, no donut
<dneighbo> you hear that jason NO DONUT
<chillywilly> what did jcater do now?
<dneighbo> documentation
<chillywilly> aaaah!
<chillywilly> how dare you do such a vile and evil thing'
<jamest> yeah jcater!  how could you document the windows setup.exe stuff!  It's all your doing! 
Action: jamest sneaks out the back while they flog jcater
<dneighbo> actually he wrote db driver docs
<dneighbo> just your installer docs reminded me of his punishment
<dneighbo> btw: masta is testing windows installer so running is probably better than sneaking at this point
Action: jamest puts it in "haul ass" mode
<dneighbo> self preservation is a good thing(tm)
<dneighbo> i cant tell if it worked
<dneighbo> installed yes
Action: jamest tosses pieces of jcater code on ground behind him to hopefully slow the beast
<dneighbo> but if i click on icon it opens dos shell flashes somethign and closes dos shell
<dneighbo> same from menu
<jamest> that's cause you don't have a filename
<jamest> double click on a .gfd file
<jamest> or alter properties to add a gfd file after the exe
<jamest> i was hoping someone <cough>derek<cough>
<jamest> would do up a little intro form 
<jamest> saying welcome, here are a few features (no db links)
<jamest> that we could put on that icon
<dneighbo> i can do that
<dneighbo> BUT one thing where did it install the samples?
<dneighbo> i dont see them under the tree
<jamest> it doesn't yet
<jamest> i can add them, just a sec
<dneighbo> if you add them then i will verify it works
<dneighbo> and then whip up a simple little form or rather SET of forms :)
<dneighbo> one form that has a list of different things
<dneighbo> then when you click on the button it opens that sample
<dneighbo> like the wxWindows sampler does
<jcater> dneighbo: I think he meant something that could be finished in, say, the next 5 minutes :)
<dneighbo> i think that only takes 5 minutes
<dneighbo> if designer was working on windows :)
Action: dneighbo is like microsoft, doing a compliment and a slam in same sentence, though i didnt require payment....hmmm guess that leaves room for improvement
<jamest> dneighbo: new designer uploading now that works
<jcater> :)
<jcater> or, :)p
<jamest> jcater: get ready to time him
<madlocke> someone did already some work an a geometry engine?
<madlocke> an a = on a
<jamest> yes, but we never saw/got the code
<madlocke> who did it?
<jamest> one of the reasons we got nervous when you left 
<jamest> :)
<madlocke> understand...
<jamest> dneighbo: new .exe's in that pre-release dir
<jamest> madlocke: perlpoet iirc
<madlocke> hm... never saw him....
<jcater> jamest: I'm thinking we should rename the <Right Click>|edit feature to <Right Click>|Open in Designer
<jamest> ok
<jamest> with me
<jamest> as for adding the samples
<jamest> I can do that
<jamest> however
<jamest> we should get a "real" group of samples first
<jamest> as right now we have a mess :)
<jcater> ok
<jcater> how are the two related?
<jamest> huh?
<jamest> two what?
<jcater> sorry
<jcater> missed the

<jcater> good, I'm not mental
<dneighbo> where did you put the samples?

<jamest> argh!
<jamest> i don't get it
<dneighbo> i do have an old form on here

<dneighbo> as it says cant find form 'c:\\somepath\\otherpath\\form.gfd

<dneighbo> yes that fixed the problem :)
<dneighbo> btw: shouldnt that be DYNAMIC

<dneighbo> or so it would seem
<jcater> well
<jcater> we were discussing that
<dneighbo> or just doing baby steps for now :)
<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> ok right off bat i can think of a few things
<dneighbo> one is installing the desktop icon is pointless
<jcater> for gfclient, you mean?
<dneighbo> i think it should install it but have the default sample form pointed too
<dneighbo> so if someone clicks it they get a formt
<dneighbo> that says edit this to point to form of your choice :)
<dneighbo> or somethign
<dneighbo> OR
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> we need to make it so that if you run gfclient
<dneighbo> and do not pass it a form file name
<jcater> that is what jamest wanted that intro form for
<dneighbo> it opens a dialog asking you to choose a form with a file chooser
<dneighbo> this would be helpful i think
<dneighbo> anyhow
<dneighbo> even on linux
<dneighbo> but making these suckers double clickable is pretty sweet and kills most of that need :)
<dneighbo> so maybe scratch that idea
<dneighbo> anyhow must run will look at making an 'intro' form whne i get home

<stbain> jamest: you alive?
<jamest> yip
<stbain> I downloaded the setup.exe
<stbain> and installed it
<stbain> would you like to see the error I get when I fire up gfclient.exe?
<jamest> you bet
<stbain> DB000: Traceback (most recent call last):

<jcater> stbain: you need to edit c:\program files\gnue\etc\gnue.conf and change prefix=c:\python21 to c:\program files\gnue
<jcater> that was a small tafu on our part
<stbain> no problemo
<jbailey> Why do I always think of that as the girlfriend client? =)
<jcater> rofl
<jcater> that'd explain the crashing :)
<jamest> nope
<jamest> it's the gnue.conf error jcater spoke of
<jamest> argh!
<jamest> wait
<stbain> [forms]
<stbain> prefix=C:\program files\gnue
<stbain> FormDir =%(prefix)s/forms
<stbain> there
<stbain> that should do it?
<jamest> you're running it from the icon right?
<stbain> right
<jamest> that icon won't work :)
<stbain> lol
<stbain> ok
<stbain> from the command line?
<jamest> find a .gfd file and double click on it
<stbain> ahhh
<stbain> ok
<jamest> or add a gfd file to the end of the exe line in the icon's properties
<jamest> as gnuef will not run unless given a file
<stbain> ok
<stbain> hrmmm.... doesn't look like any gfd files shipped in the setup.exe
<jamest> nope
<jamest> oversight on my part
<jamest> jcater! you're back

<chillywilly> Isomer: a simulation library I am writing
<Isomer> ah
<Isomer> what are you simulating?
<chillywilly> it is a generic library for discrete event simulation
<chillywilly> you can simulate all sorts of things
<chillywilly> just gotta code it
<chillywilly> I saw a simuation of CSMA/CD
<chillywilly> simulation
<chillywilly> Simulation *
<chillywilly> Simulation::Instance ()
<chillywilly> {
<chillywilly>   // First check
<chillywilly>   if (instance == NULL)
<chillywilly>     {
<chillywilly>       // Ensure serialization

<chillywilly>   lock.LeaveMutex ();

<chillywilly> that should be thread safe right ;)
Action: chillywilly borrowed that
<chillywilly> well looks like I just need more debugging statements until I can figure out where it is hanging/deadlocked
<chillywilly> :(
<Isomer> is it me
<Isomer> or are you leaving the mutex more often than your entering it?
<chillywilly> it is only once
<chillywilly> calling leave twice doesn't hurt
<chillywilly> but it is only called once
<chillywilly> I got that methods from C++ journal
<chillywilly> method
<chillywilly> or some crap
<chillywilly> accept I am using the Mutex class in GNU Common C++
<chillywilly> GSim will be GNU Sim soon I hope
<ajmitch> maybe...
<chillywilly> maybe?
<chillywilly> you doubt me?>
<ajmitch> yes
<derek> zup j's
<jamest> getting ready to leave
<derek> jamest did you read backlog and get my messages?
<jamest> no
<derek> i think jcater beat you enough on the hardcoded gnue.conf entry
<derek> the other one was making the desktop icon and other link call a sample form
<jamest> derek: you gnue'ing?
<derek> so people dont click and go damn its broke
<derek> jamest either gnue'ing or simcity'ing
<derek> :)
<chillywilly> ajmitch: ?
<jamest> derek: I mentioned that one w/ hopes you'd make the intro form
<derek> well i have a few hcs hacks to apply first and then i was going to gnue
<jamest> we need to decide what we still need for release
<derek> but 3 new dvd's came today so i might get called into movie action :)
<jamest> i'm thinking a simple users guide would be nice
<derek> i will look at a form and we should include the tech ref
<derek> and we need to make a 'manual' for designer
<derek> that has 'pictures'
<derek> etc
<jamest> dang
<derek> i will look into some of this end of week
<jcater> sigh
<derek> for now our 0.1.0 can live w/o it
<jcater> yay!
<derek> just including techref will be enough
<jamest> good
<derek> imho
<derek> as unlike the source we can readily post docs to website and have people grab
<jamest> we have the installer and a URL link to the docs
<jamest> in the startup menu
<derek> and not have them risk damaging too much :)
<jamest> then they are always up to date :)
<derek> that would work :)

<jcater> Then a summary of a basic user session? like describing what committing, inserting record, creating record, etc do

<jamest> um
Action: jcater grumbles under his breath
<jamest> it's all good
<jamest> any luck?
<jcater> well, I have openjade and sgmltools-lite installed
<jcater> but still no docbook support in lyx
<jamest> you have to edit->reconfigure
<jamest> _if_ you have the docbook stylesheets properly installed
<jamest> then she should pick them up and you're set
<jcater> sigh
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> gnue uses corba?
<ajmitch> at the moment
<jamest> geas does
<Isomer> does it also use the gnome corba stuff?
<Isomer> ie, does this integrate well with gnome?
<ajmitch> it uses ORBit
<jamest> no
<ajmitch> dunno what you mean about integrating with gnome :)
<jamest> there will be no depedencies on a desktop
<jamest> as some of us have headless servers
<ajmitch> and eventually no dependencies on CORBA, too
Action: ajmitch wonders why someone would run gnome on a server...
<Isomer> is gnome only a desktop?
<Isomer> I had the sneaking suspicion that gnome was a framework
<Isomer> which people had used for a desktop
<ajmitch> it's sorta a desktop framework :)
<jamest> i think it had grand ideas at the start
<jcater> that'd be my analysis: it's a desktop framework :)
<jamest> the whole Network Object Model gNOMe
<jamest> but i don't think that's what she became
<jamest> I don't have a problem working well w/ gnome but gnue will not require gnome
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> 'k
Action: Isomer should learn more about gnome
<nickr> that'd be cool if there was a Bonobo adapter for gaes, embed gnue objects into your spreadsheet
<Isomer> yeah!
<ajmitch> nickr: you volunteering? ;)
<jcater> nickr: that'll be possible with our GComm layer
<nickr> ajmitch: talk to me in 3 months when I'm done with my first gnue projcet :)
<jcater> someone'll just have to write an adapter (which won't be difficult)
<ajmitch> or what about a bonobo forms client?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> that'd be especially useful
<Isomer> ajmitch: now, that could be funky
<nickr> bleh, I'm really disillusioned about existing programming languages
<derek> hahaha on the gnome comments
<derek> jamest i have lots of ideas for ENDUSER manual

<jamest> jcater has entered my docbook hell
<derek> im sorry

<derek> the more i use lyx i think its evil
<jamest> as I made the lyx docs in docbook format
<derek> i prefer raw docbook xml
<derek> i like lyx concept
<jamest> and guess what
<derek> but xforms dependency and HAVING to have lyx to do transformations licks bag
<jamest> the fucking (it's too personal to misspell) docbook won't install on his machine
<derek> but lyx docs are better than no docs :)
<derek> jamest: point being he doesnt need docbook neither do you
<derek> emacs will work
<jamest> I've written 3 chapters of a manual
<jamest> while he's trying to just get the dependencies
<derek> or any text editor
<jamest> working
<derek> and goats or some other location with docbook can create the files
<derek> :)

<jcater> and said, "my brain runs on netbsd" (IIRC)
<derek> yes i think you are correct
<nickr> ho ho
<derek> sigh
<jcater> jamest: what's the apt-get to get docbook working?
<derek> 'minor' gripe and i will get flamed
<jamest> apt-get install smgltools-lite
<derek> but i dont like that our screen shots are running a theme that obviously one desktop over another :)
Action: jamest whips out the bbw grill
<jamest> bbw = bbq
<jcater> lol
<jcater> we have new screenshots?
<jamest> derek: ?
<jcater> jamest: this in cvs?
<derek> a bbw bbq, um ill let you play that one
<derek> by the way screenshot == image in the new doc :)
<jcater> derek: well, you got your pictures, didn't you?
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> just got to that point
<jamest> you wanna keep all those looser gnome themes consistant in the screenshot section there ya ximian lover?
Action: jcater is reading pretty closely
<derek> yeah the bbw at the bbq are great, got any with pantyhose though??
Action: derek and those fetishes you know
<jamest> is that a good flame?
<derek> jamest: rofl, im not saying the screenshots have to be made on gnome, just use themes that are neutral
<derek> i.e. on both gnome and kde so we dont piss off either camp :)
<jamest> huh?
<derek> hell piss em both off and do all screen shots in windows
<jcater> jamest: I think he is saying do all screenshots in lwm
<jamest> you mean someone polluted kde's theme's with sawfish lookalikes?!?!?
<jamest> flame count: 2
<jamest> i have twm at work
<derek> fovl
<jamest> i can do there
<derek> er rofl
<derek> i just mean use a theem w/o a K in the corner
<jamest> hell, it's X
<derek> or a FOOT in the corner :)
<jamest> I'll startup in failsafe w/o any window manager
<derek> sigh its not worth discussing was just something that popped in head
<jcater> there ya go
<derek> i dont want to be a GNU/Linux'er
<jamest> sigh, if you think it's a big deal we can change
<derek> there are definitely more important issues:)
<derek> and there is nothing wrong with KDE
<derek> just want to avoid the wars in here later on, from one camp or the other
<jcater> of course not... we need something usable on linux
Action: jcater ducks
<jamest> but honestly I figured we'd have lots of different ones 
<jamest> btw - how we hide the "windows" ones
<jamest> flame count: 3
<derek> jcater then stay away from ximian by all means :)
<Isomer> do the entire thing in fvwm
<derek> i mean ONLY in the docs
<derek> not talking screenshots on website
<jamest> ah, ok
<derek> sorry for bad term in the beginning
<jamest> i can do that
<jamest> :)
<jamest> anyway, it's the start of a users guide
<jamest> as my users need one
<jamest> if people don't like it, it's in cvs, change at will
<derek> im all for making the screenshots on the website come from as MANY diff setups as possible, shows flexibility of gnue :)
<jamest> honestly lots of our docs are out of date
<jamest> :(
<jamest> i noticed that tonight reading them
<jcater> report's docs are current
<derek> where im really thinking is like gnome documentation project makes all document shots use the same theme and window theme
<jamest> txt and lyx  both
<derek> which is nice for consistency
<derek> but i wont go there :)
<derek> jamest: i will look at updateing docs
<derek> i read the developers guide and was like, ouch
<jamest> i'll let you guy figure that out, as I promised I'd be in bed at 10PM
<Isomer> hmm
<derek> need to change some stuff :)
<jamest> and it's um, a little after
<derek> it was amazingly still pretty consistent
<derek> just some new pieces have been added etc
Action: derek is ready to go into masta mode
Action: jcater needs to go to bed too
<jcater> I hate docbook
<derek> dcl and coder whipping, documentation slave and 'alpha' as in lead tester
<Isomer> provide a form:  Window Manager: [ Gnome  v]  WMTheme: [ Eggplant Yellow v]  Toolkit Theme: [ Wooden v]   [ Generate ScreenShot ]
<jcater> it even bombed out of apt-get
<derek> jcater: it had bad things to say about you too
<jamest> jcater: but, but, it almost runs on all linux compatible systems!
<jamest> jcater: almost
<derek> its just not 'hick' compatiable yet :)
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I guess that's it
Action: jamest is a very verbal docbook hater
<jamest> but anyway
<jcater> sigh
<jamest> oooooooooooooo!
<jcater> jamest: but you are making me install it
<jamest> lets do them all in openoffice
<derek> jcater: im ashamed as we always just assumed jamest was doing apt-get docbuc
Action: jamest ducks
<derek> and we didnt have the heart to tell him to check his spelling
<jcater> jamest: fine with me
<jamest> jcater: I'm not making you, honest
<jamest> I'm in the same boat as you
<jamest> in trying to stay compatible w/ the docbook std for gnue :(
<ajmitch> grr, no python debs in sid
<jamest> I don't wanna have to "program" my docs
<jcater> ajmitch: should be
<jamest> anyway, i really need to run
<jamest> l8r

<jcater> oh
<jcater> derek: btw, we have samples in the windows setup.exe now
<jcater> it's a selectable component
<derek> cool
<jcater> so you can deselect it
<derek> i have LOTS o questions on new setup
<jcater> our windows setup rocks!
<derek> does it search for existing python, wx etc?
Action: Isomer will make sure psu quotes you on taht jcater
<Isomer> s/taht/that/
<jcater> it's a standalone setup
<derek> or does it not care and use dll's regardless
<jcater> it does not use a local installation
<jcater> even if it's there
<derek> jcater: ok, thats what i thought
<derek> guess that makes life easier and puts us in more control
<derek> wish we could make the unix setup that damn clean and good looking
<jcater> sigh
<Isomer> derek: isn't that what "apt-get" is all about?
<derek> kind of
<derek> apt-get is not universal
<ajmitch> it's not?
<derek> i.e. it would meet needs of our debian users
<derek> but debian is only 1 of many distributions
<derek> and 9 out of the top ten used distros dont use .deb's or apt
<derek> so that would go against the grain of gnue by making it hard to use for a majority of our audience
<Isomer> isn't that what redcarpet is for?
<Isomer> or whatever they call it?
<derek> redcarpet and other rpm based apt knock offs are prop at best
<derek> i.e. they are not well licensed and need the software in them to be part of 'partner agreements' from the content providers
<derek> which i think is something we would like to avoid
<derek> i dont see why a setup.sh is so evil
<derek> i just installed SimCity3000 for linux
<derek> sh setup.sh
<derek> and 3rd most beautiful install i have ever done
<derek> behind rail road tycoons 2 and civilization call to power
<nickr> yea, loki puts out good stuff
<derek> open office has a nice install too

<Isomer> setup.sh isn't a bad way either

<derek> im not saying there is only one way to skin a cat either

<derek> cool
<derek> btw: how do you get x to run on another display?
<ajmitch> derek: how do you mean? get X apps to run elsewhere?
<nickr> export the display on the client side, set the server side to accept the clients
<derek> nickr: ok how
<derek> basically i just normally do startx
<derek> but now i want x on more than one display on same machine
<derek> i.e. in past i let X run on diplay 0
<ajmitch> startx -- :1
<derek> then use ctrl-alt f2-6 to play around
<ajmitch> gets X to start up on :1
<derek> ok let me try it
<ajmitch> if that don't work use xinit -- :1
<derek> aj think you :)
<derek> i was trying 
<derek> startx --client :2

<ra3vat> if I need to pass additional commands to database after get connection is it a good idea to put it into _postConnect() def
<dneighbo> ra3vat you not using forms?
<dneighbo> i.e. you just using common?
<jcater> um
<dneighbo> or you using forms and making a new trigger type of postConnect?
<jcater> dneighbo: that's a gnue-common DBdriver command
<jcater> ra3vat: what are you trying to accomplish?
<jcater> yes, that's the place things like that would go if working on a new driver
<jcater> but if you are having to customize one of our drivers for your environment, 
<jcater> then we may need to do something else
<ra3vat> it was done some days in old postgresql driver
<dneighbo> as jason stated what are you trying to achieve 
<ra3vat> I need for example to
<dneighbo> i.e. what do you plan to do in teh postConnect code?
<ra3vat>  c = self._dataConnection.cursor()
<ra3vat>     c.execute("SET CLIENT_ENCODING TO 'WIN'")
<jcater> ooh
<dneighbo> jcater you think this should be another item in the connection file?
<jcater> wht does that do?
<jcater> dneighbo: ues
<dneighbo> like
<jcater> err, yes
<dneighbo> client_encoding = WIN
<jamest> jcater: sets postgresql locale
<ra3vat> and it is what ENCODING param in gnue.conf is for
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> ra3vat would it be acceptable to just have this as a value in in your connections file?
<dneighbo> jcater remind me to talk to mdean about date/time stuff 
<ra3vat> if client and database encoding are different it gives postgresql info to recode data on the fly
<ra3vat> dneighbo: yes, may be connections.conf would be better

<dneighbo> php nuke is forked and php somethign else is its place
ajmitch (~me@p32-max10.dun.ihug.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> jamest: originally php nuke was closed source but free
<dneighbo> then the guy opened it up
<Mr_You> Mandrake is supporting it?
<ra3vat> post-nuke
<dneighbo> and he got funding
<dneighbo> and he got ego issues
<dneighbo> and closed the source back up
<dneighbo> post-nuke (thanks ra3vat) made a fork of the code
<dneighbo> and has started to maintain the free version
<Mr_You> post-nuke doesn't do multi-DBs tho yet :-(
<dneighbo> basically hosing the original author (his own fault admittedly)
<Mr_You> ok, well bbl
Action: Mr_You &
<jamest> i thought nuke was gpl?
<dneighbo> i guess not originally
<dneighbo> but regardless a copyright holder can change their mind :)
<ra3vat> is ./setup.py devel appropriate command for gnue-common?
Action: dneighbo was thinking
<jcater> no!
<dneighbo> if president bush extended a bbq offer to president putin
derek (derek@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: Ping timeout: 181 seconds
<dneighbo> shouldnt we extend that offer to ra3vat and the other russians on the list?:
derek (~derek@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> i mean we could show them REAL barbeque (memphis or kansas city) style none of this hokey smokey texas tenderloin :)
<dneighbo> plus i figure jcater couldnt pass up an offer to bbq
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> :)
<jcater> NCS' president wins at practically every BBQ cookoff in the country
<dneighbo> so gnue meeting at ncs this summer, its final
<dneighbo> thanks for inviting us
<jcater> lol
<jcater> I still vote on vegas
<jamest> ra3vat: you don't need to do that in common
<jamest> only in forms and designer
<jamest> they include common as part of the devel setup
<dneighbo> if you are serious im WAY game to vegas
<dneighbo> its close, its cheap and my wife would have a blast
Action: ra3vat was invited already to one banquet passed last monday in Tusla
<dneighbo> hey tulsa is close too
<jcater> hey
<jcater> I can fly to vegas ~100
<jcater> as that's a popular destination
<dneighbo> works for me.... jamest?
Action: dneighbo knows jamest has ability to get the 'time' off :)
<dneighbo> comdex is next week in vegas you know 
<dneighbo> show up on friday and hand out gnue literature why combing the floors then spend the weekend gnue'ing ;)
<dneighbo> unrealistic of course, but it sounds fun
<dneighbo> btw the windwos installer looks pretty good
<dneighbo> getting ready to test on another machine
<dneighbo> we still looking for a sample form?
<jcater> lol
<jcater> I was originally suposed to go to comdex
<dneighbo> hmm mlooks like still 0.1.0a out there
<jcater> but things got wierd around here
<dneighbo> i thought a new one was made that included samples?
<dneighbo> was it just never 'posted'?
<dneighbo> if someone can build and post pretty quick i will gladly test
<jamest> not created yet
<jamest> please make a introduction form if you have time
<jamest> maybe something that is on tabbed pages
<dneighbo> i will right now
<jamest> with a button example, a trigger example
<dneighbo> if you can make an install :)
<dneighbo> for .exe and post
<dneighbo> as im behind firewall
<jamest> a page or two of text
<dneighbo> and want to test anyhow :)
<jamest> can you use current exe's 
<dneighbo> does odbc work with windows?
<jamest> or do you need more
<dneighbo> i would like a new one with the samples :)
<jamest> I'm in the middle of a fire
<jamest> but will try and make something in a bit
<dneighbo> also if possible packaging jcaters odbc code
<dneighbo> as then i can test DB2 for real
<dneighbo> via ODBC
<dneighbo> against the mainframe :)
<dneighbo> which would seem fairly impressive to some
<dneighbo> gnue forms windows client
<jamest> :)
<dneighbo> talking to OS/390 on DB2 fetching 100,000 records in xx seconds
<dneighbo> would help prove we are serious about supporting real enterprises (a la mainframe) as well as supporting non linux clients and hetereogenous environments. :)
<ra3vat> anyone seen this:
<ra3vat> DB000: IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/local/gnue///usr/local/gnue/shared/images/gnue-splash.png'
<jamest> yip
<jamest> gnue.conf changed in cvs
<jamest> paths are now relative
<ra3vat> ok
<jamest> the sample.gnue.conf has been updated to reflect the change
<jamest> sorry about that
<jamest> we no longer require different gnue.conf for windows or *nix clients
<dneighbo> cause we are studs ;)
<ra3vat> jamest: seems that quick hack in UIwxpython.py does not work anymore:
<ra3vat>           elif (1728 <= event.KeyCode() <= 1791):
<ra3vat>             offset = 1536
<ra3vat>             action = GFEvent('requestKEYPRESS',chr(event.KeyCode()-offset))
<ra3vat> but new one:
<ra3vat>           elif (192 <= event.KeyCode() <= 255):
<ra3vat>             action = GFEvent('requestKEYPRESS',chr(event.KeyCode()))
<ra3vat> works well for both windows and unix
<ra3vat> with current tools
<jamest> um
<jamest> thats odd
<ra3vat> odd?
<jamest> why would the input codes have changed?
<ra3vat> those in range 1728-1791 looked very strange
<ra3vat> in range 192-255 looks better for one-byte encoding
<ra3vat> and chr() deals only with 0-255 range covering most of pre-unicode encoding 
<Mr_You> derek, I'm sorry but you are mistaken..
<Mr_You> the only REAL BBQ comes from NC!!!
<Mr_You> ;-)
<jamest> ra3vat: this is russian support only change right?
<dneighbo> Mr_You now now
<dneighbo> jamest: dont you wish you knew :)
<Mr_You> my dad acquired an awesome BBQ chicken recipe.. drool
<ra3vat> jamest: should be appropriate for others non-latin1 but I can't test
<jamest> ra3vat: feel free to commit a patch 
<jamest> i think you have cvs access right?
<ra3vat> ok
<jamest> ra3vat: can you also test this on windows?
<Mr_You> main diff between texas and eastern BBQ, I guess, is that Texas has a bunch of sauce... and eastern is more marinated
<ra3vat> jamest: i'll do tomorrow
<ra3vat> and ask others to test also
<Mr_You> some of us north carolinians are passionate about our BBQ hehe
<Mr_You> if its pig BBQ and not marinated.. gotta have the Texas Pete handy (a NC hot sauce).... if its chicken marinated rocks
<Mr_You> enough of my ranting
<ra3vat> jcater: please take a look at the designer/src/Instance.py (def saveForm) I need something like:
<ra3vat>     fileHandle = open(location,'w')
<ra3vat>     enc = sys.getdefaultencoding()
<ra3vat>     if enc == 'ascii':
<ra3vat>         fileHandle.write('<?xml version="1.0"?>\n\n')
<ra3vat>     else:
<ra3vat>         fileHandle.write('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="%s"?>\n\n' % (enc))
<jcater> ra3vat: have you tested that? does it work?
<ra3vat> it does not work without that
<ra3vat> if I have form with non ascii labels for example and "encoding" in xml header
<jcater> ok, committed
<ra3vat> designer erase "encoding" and then can't load that form again itself
<ra3vat> problem is that same encodings named differently in different tools (in different places)
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I'm still not sure how to handle this long term
<dneighbo> jcater : with a big ugly stick
<dneighbo> ra3vat you realize you are putting a real cramp on us to not be american biased
<dneighbo> and we love you for it :)
<ra3vat> :)

<chillywilly> I don't care
<chillywilly> she's being irrational
<ajmitch> you should!
<chillywilly> and aillogical
<chillywilly> illogical
<Mr_You> phpGroupware is moving from sf to savannah, guess ya'll knew that
<Mr_You> yeah some women are completely illogical and don't tell you why.. you just have to always keep in your mind what the hidden message is hehe
<Mr_You> such as "I realized I fudged up but I'm not going to admit it yet, but just bitch"
<dneighbo> hmmm... i dont think i would want a 'logical' wife
Action: Mr_You knows very little about women.
<jcater> hehe
<chillywilly> dneighbo: why not?
<jcater> a logical wife is no wife at all
<chillywilly> what?
<dneighbo> i wouldnt have any fun, man / wife is about complimenatary traits
<Mr_You> yeah
<dneighbo> you logic offsets her illogical patterns and vice versa
<dneighbo> i cant tell you how many times my wife's 'intuition' has saved my butt
<dneighbo> to me it seemed illogical to just go on a 'feeling' but ill be darned if her feeling wasnt right
<dneighbo> if you watch old star treks or new ones
<dneighbo> we laugh at the vulcans logic, but often times look in the mirror and thats us :)
<Mr_You> hehe
<dneighbo> now thats not to say illogically behavior cnat be frustrating as hell at times, but imagine how your logical behavior probably enfuriates her :)
<chillywilly> dneighbo: that's highly illogical
<reinhard> well i would say
<reinhard> fascinating
<reinhard> :)
<ajmitch> heh
<chillywilly> man I want to kill her
<chillywilly> fuck this
<ajmitch> no you don't
<chillywilly> why do I even bother to talk to her anymore
<chillywilly> she says the same shit over and over
<ajmitch> cos you still love her
<reinhard> chillywilly: there's only one way to get along with illogical, irrational women
<jcater> hehe
Action: ajmitch checks out gnue
<jcater> cause you keep doing the same wrong thing over and over
<reinhard> chillywilly: love them
<reinhard> chillywilly: anything else is bound to fail
Action: ajmitch guesses GEAS won't run too well on this box
<reinhard> ajmitch: what kinda box?
<ajmitch> reinhard: p100, 16mb ram, GNU/Hurd ;)
<reinhard> why not?
<ajmitch> you should see how slow it is ;)
<reinhard> maybe slow
<reinhard> but it should run
<chillywilly> I wish I wa s a hermit
<ajmitch> if ORBit is compiled for it
<reinhard> damn orbit dependency
<ajmitch> yeah
<Mr_You> man sucks, my roommate is sorta being played by this girl/friend who he use to date.. everyone knows it cept him
