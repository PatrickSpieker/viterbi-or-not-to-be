<nickr> O Brother Where Art Thou is funny funky
<chillywilly> hey it said in sme tabloid that looking at boobs is good for your health according to the new england journal of medicine
<nickr> cool
<chillywilly> it increases blood flow and gives you a good cardiovascular workout
<chillywilly> :P
<Mr_You> http://www.paul.boddie.net/
<nickr> it releases endorphins that increase the efficiency of your immune system
<chillywilly> so next time your gf gets mad at you going to the nudie bar just say, "don't you care about my health"
<chillywilly> does XForms have any limitations?
<chillywilly> they are talking about the W3C standard right?
<chillywilly> yep they are
<chillywilly> I wodner if GNUe would benefit form using that standard
<Mr_You> It would replace our Forms client methods?
<Mr_You> probably wouldn't be hard to integrate X-Forms clients at somepoint, or redo GNUe Forms to use X-Forms methods instead
<chillywilly> yes, but I dunno if they would do it though
<chillywilly> :P
<Mr_You> BTW, I mainly do CGI perl coding.. so python should be cool
<Mr_You> X-Forms might be limiting for what we need, dunno
<chillywilly> well neither do I
<Mr_You> I like this "O Death" song tho its used in a KKK ralley in the movie heh
<Mr_You> first heard it from this "Beethoven" band... ferget their name

<jamest> so, what's up w/ release?
<jcater> I'm ready
<jamest> derek test all his forms?
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> he wasn't on much
<jamest> ah
<jamest> ok
<jamest> you play with the mcmillan stuff at all?
<jcater> no
<jcater> I fixed a few oddities in GFClient, though
<jcater> and did my comprehensive README.databases
<jcater> (which I'd appreciate if someone looked over)
<jcater> I can do the mcmillan stuff today I'm sure
<jamest> where is it?
<jcater> gnue-common/README.databases
<jamest> ok, just saw it
<jcater> I did tars and zip files yesterday
<jamest> was looking in the doc dircs
<jcater> just to make sure setup.py sdist was working
<jcater> (had to make some minor adjustments to get that working again)
<jamest> sigh
<jcater> sigh?
<jamest> that sdist broke
<jamest> did you rebuild the html txt docs
<jcater> no
<jcater> just testing basic functions
<jamest> gotcha
<jcater> btw, I broke sdist, not you :)
<jamest> did the db2 driver from bryan lee get updated
<jamest> IOW is this the driver from the ibm guy
<jamest> that was for old system or is it a new one
<jcater> Bryan Lee is the dude that wrote the db2.py driver
<jcater> I rewrote a good chunk of it
<jamest> ah, gotcha
<jamest> these are not the authors of our support but of the driver itself
Action: jamest isn't too swift today
<jcater> yes
<jcater> I thought I should include that to better distinguish the drivers they need to download
<jcater> maybe I wasn't clear
<jcater> btw, you'll have to show me all you do for a release so I can be better help later on

<jamest> ok,
<jamest> have all these drivers been tested?
<jcater> no, not all
<jamest> we may want to add that info to the readme as well
<jamest> annother plane went down?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> heading towards JFK
<jamest> accident or intentional?
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> cnn.com is down
<jcater> but the airports in NY are closed
<jcater> NEW YORK (AP) - A plane crashed Monday morning in the Queens section of New York, and buildings reportedly were on fire in the neighborhood. 
<jamest> cnn has next to nothing on it
<jamest> 3 sentences
<jcater> I think that's cause no one knows anything yet
<jcater> The Dow index dropped 200 points on hearing the news. 
<jamest> lol
<jamest> paniced, the hurd thunders headlong off a cliff
<jcater> :)
<jcater> are you adding a blurb to the README about database tests, or should I?
<jcater> I have time, btw
<jamest> the only ones I know that work are the postgresql ones
<jamest> so if you know the others then go ahead
<jamest> I have to head across campus for a bit anyway
<jcater> ok

<jcater> what version if debian potato? 2.2?
<jamest> testing
<jamest> er, woody
<jamest> we also need to point out that python 2.x required
<jamest> i may have added this last week 
<jamest> damn memory
<jamest> it's faulty
<jamest> un friggen believable
<jamest> the main login dialog on some of my win98 machines have a box that is , i assume autochecked for "save password"
<jamest> looks like I missed unchecking it last friday
<jamest> so when I booted the machine up all I had to do was put in my username as the password box was already filled

<chillywilly> is it feature filled enough for gfd format?

<chillywilly> it is a "better" html forms

<derek> xforms, we have looked at this
<derek> it looks similar to gnue
<chillywilly> you have?
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> well it is a standard
<derek> it didnt really exist when we started

<ov> Hi folks
<reinhard> hey ov
<jcater> howdy
<reinhard> i guess you are oliver vecernik?
<ov> Zunächst einmal Grüße an Reinhard aus Hernstein! Ja, ich bin es.
<reinhard> Hernstein?
<ov> Hernstein liegt südlich von Baden bei Wien.
<reinhard> ah
<ov> But lets continue in English.
<reinhard> yep :)
<ov> As I wrote in my mail and applying your help everthing seems to work fine.
<Mr_You> heh, the leaked internal M$ memo is funny
<Mr_You> http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/22770.html
<reinhard> ov: error message is gone?
<ov> But... I changed a class in test.gcd. I don't understand how to init this.
<reinhard> init == default values for fields in a class
<reinhard> or init == load new definition for the class?
<ov> reinhard: no more error messages.
<reinhard> k
<reinhard> good :)
<ov> first of all I'd like to load new definition for a class (update tables).
<reinhard> that is done every time you restart geas-server
<ov> ah
<reinhard> in geas.conf there is a line like
<reinhard> # mainlog geas.log
<reinhard> when you uncomment this line you get a log of all db changes
<ov> ok, next question: where can I find a howto for gcd-files? 
<reinhard> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~neilt/GNUeModuleGuide/main/x369.html
<reinhard> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~neilt/sc.html contains some pointers to good documentation
<reinhard> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/ is a more "official" address :)
<ov> yep, after restarting geas, I found my new table. Somewhere in the docs I read, that methods are not yet implemented. Still?
<reinhard> to be 100% honest
<reinhard> methods are already implemented
<reinhard> but in a way we are not happy with
<reinhard> and we want to redo the implementation
<reinhard> so we don't tell you :)
<ov> Grrrr... ;-)
<jamest> :)
<ov> as I found on the web GEAS, Forms is Alpha stage. A fundamental question:: is there a release plan?
<reinhard> yes of course
<reinhard> for example forms 0.1.0 is planned for october 2000
<reinhard> umm.....
<reinhard> seriously
<reinhard> forms and reports seems usable
<reinhard> in the state they are now
<reinhard> GEAS was contributed by a company and we are now in the process
<reinhard> of going through the code and adapting it to our needs
<reinhard> wrt maintainability, performance etc.
<ov> my question was aiming at the release plan, because I consider
<ov> doing some real work with it, but I'm not sure
<ov> to do so.
<ov> What would you recommend?
<jamest> run
<jamest> and don't look back
<ov> seriously?
<reinhard> i would say
<reinhard> with forms/reports yes
<reinhard> with geas: not yet
<jamest> sorry
<jamest> back
<jamest> forms works
<jamest> reports is starting to work
<jamest> geas works but IIRC is slow
<ov> realisation should take place Q2 next year. what do you think about?
<jamest> the forms/geas driver is broken
<ov> okay, 2 tier is my friend. ;-)
<jamest> then forms will work for you
<jamest> we're ready to release a 0.1.0 hopefully today
<jamest> hammering out the details on a setup.exe install for windows clients
<reinhard> ov: may i ask what kind of company you work for?
<ov> I've my own one!
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> web page?
<ov> have a look at http://members.aon.at/vecernik

<ov> I'm dealing in barcode readers, thermal printers and mobile data equipment
<ov> very important is curses support with forms (for my terminals)
<ov> does it work now (I read somewhere it was broken)?
<jamest> it is still broken
<jamest> however
<jamest> the 0.1.0 release paves the way for 0.3.0 to start
<ov> :-(
<jamest> which is the UI rewrite release
<jamest> so I'd expect it functional soon
<ov> :-)
<jamest> on the list of todos for forms
<jamest> 0.1.x - fix current driver issues as found (this includes the geas one)
<jamest> 0.3.0 - UI rewrite to support curses, web, enhanced UI features, better integration with designer
<ov> is there a possibility to write businessobjects for 2 tier and
<ov> port them to geas sometimes?
<jamest> depends
<jamest> we're going to try and share trigger/method system
<jamest> if it works then I think you could at least share the methods
<jamest> the object definition isn't possible now
<chillywilly> I think we also need to share the object system
<chillywilly> and the objects need to be data aware
<chillywilly> would make forms a little fatter but then forms could play with objects too and they can execute on the client side
<chillywilly> or you can go with GEAS
<chillywilly> or some configuration like that
<chillywilly> actually you shouldn't even have to know that the objects are remote objects or not
<chillywilly> imho
<chillywilly> just use the GComm object and if it is remote it will take care of loading the ORB and or SOAP or whatever
<ov> I don't know what the GComm object is, but the idea is great! Possible?
<chillywilly> it is just or name for common
<chillywilly> GNUe Common package

<jcater> jamest: the question?
<Isomer_> about life universe and everything?
<rm-away> lol
Nick change: rm-away -> reinhard
<reinhard> wasn't the answer
<reinhard> 21?
<jcater> jamest: the answer is, "No"
<jamest> argh!
<jamest> ok
<jamest> sorry
<jamest> back
<jamest> we can now have a setup.exe for forms and designer
<jamest> however
<jamest> we should probably come up with a default install behaviour for gnue tools on windows machines
<jamest> fwiw: gnuef is weighing in at about 4.5MB w/ no other install requirements
<reinhard> we should be compatible with other windows installed programs
<jamest> most of which I'm certain is wxPython
<reinhard> so we should install 80% of the files under WINDOWS/SYSTEM
<jamest> rofl
<jamest> I'll adjust the install scripts immediately
<reinhard> 5% under PROGRAM FILES/GNUE SHARED/GNUE COMMON
<jamest> I guess what I'm asking is what do we want
<ajmitch> reinhard: fill up C:\ as well (even if installing on D:)
<jamest> gee, this is all great input 
<jcater> jamest: what d'ya mean?
<jcater> the target directory?
<jcater> I'm not sure what you're asking
<jamest> right now gnuef goes in (default) c:\program files\GNUe Forms Client
chillywilly_ (danielb@d151.as1.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) left irc: Read error to chillywilly_[d151.as1.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net]: EOF from client
<jamest> and it has an {app}/etc/*.conf
<jamest> and it has an {app}/shared/images/*.png
<jamest> in there
<jamest> designer would work similar
<jamest> I was wondering if we wanted to do something like
<jamest> C:\program files\gnue\gnue forms client
<jamest> C:\program files\gnue\designer
<jamest> C:\program files\gnue\etc
<jamest> C:\program files\gnue\shared
<jamest> etc, etc
<jcater> I vote for the latter
<reinhard> metoo
<Isomer_> doesn't MS have some guide lines for this kinda thing?
Nick change: Isomer_ -> Isomer
<jamest> as do i
<jamest> however, we still have issues
<reinhard> i would even say
<reinhard> s/gnue forms client/forms
<reinhard> so the path is
<reinhard> c:\program files\gnue\forms
<jamest> ok
<jamest> standing issues then
<jamest>   which package contains gnue.conf
<jamest> :)
<reinhard> common?
<reinhard> is that a package of itself?
<jcater> an alternative installation scheme would be to have two installation .exes, a "GNUe Client Environment" and a "GNUe Development Environment" in which GNUe Client would only contain like gfclient (and grrun when available), whereas the Development environment has all the .exe's
<jcater> I'm not saying I'm pushing that
<jcater> but something to consider
<jcater> then you don't have conflicting gnue.conf's
<jcater> 'course, the only problem there is what happens if stuff isn't released concurrently
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> we need a setup mgr app
<jamest> that can run and update all this crap for us
<jcater> (btw, if we stick w/Designer install and Forms install, I'd vote for the conf stuff to go into gfclient
<jcater> )
<jcater> as it's the least common denominator
<jcater> jamest: we're not helping much, are we?
<jamest> ok
<jamest> now I've got gnuef in gnue\forms
<jamest> and a gnue/shared and gnue/etc
<jamest> however
<jamest> I need a method of setting the INSTALL_PREFIX and GNUE_CONNECTIONS
<jamest> unless we make the clients look in some thing like exedir/../etc
<jamest> as I don't seem to have a way to tell the installer to alter autoexec.bat
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> can the setup program run a script or executable as part of the install?
<Isomer> you shouldn't be setting environmental variables for the windows install
<jamest> jcater: yes
<jamest> Isomer: it should go in the registry 
<Isomer> precisely
<jamest> but we don't support that :(
<jcater> jamest: please don't say that
<Isomer> when in rome....
<jcater> I want to be able to do a samba install 
<jamest> jcater: I mean a single entry for gnue pointer
<jamest> jcater: yes, that is other bad things
<jcater> jamest:??
<jamest> as it sets we _should_ be able to network install this puppy
<jamest> registry hacks make than tougher
<jcater> that's why I don't want to see a registry hack :)
<jamest> I think I'd be happy if the client apps (gnuef, designer, reports) looked in their executable is located in
<jamest> .....in the dir their .....
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I'd be fine with that if
<Isomer> how does hacking autoexec.bat help network installs?
<jamest> from there go ../etc/gnue.conf
<jamest> i doesn't
<jamest> it
<jamest> this is my problem
<jamest> everything is ugly
<Isomer> it's microsoft, what do you expect? :)
<jcater> I'd be fine with that if later on we added an include = line to the config files
<jcater> (read that LATER ON part :)
<jcater> jamest: at least for 0.1.0, I don't think we can do better than looking in the exec dir/../etc
<jcater> that's my vote
<jamest> jcater: any chance I could con you into adding it 
<jamest> as I leave in about 45 min
<jamest> and want to get this installer functional
<jamest> or I can checkin what we have
<jamest> and you can play w/ it while I add it
Action: jamest is getting antsy
<jamest> :)
<jamest> nevermind
<jamest> I'll do it real quick

<jamest> um
<jamest> yip
<jamest> :)
<stbain> I think I still have the GNU forms somewhere
<stbain> I'll sign them and get them in the mail tomorrow
<jamest> I'd pitch the old ones
<jamest> oh, those forms
<stbain> ?!
<jamest> ok
<stbain> hehe
<stbain> yes... those forms

<stbain> enlighten me

<Mr_You> webware.sf.net ... aims to "replace" zope.. has goals from lessons learned from zope.. AFAIK
<ajmitch> it is quite good, from what i've seen
<Mr_You> python server pages are part of the webware project if I understand correctly
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> similar syntax to JSP, it says

<ajmitch> i dunno JSP, but PSP seems pretty useful
<Mr_You> I've just used php
<stbain> hrmmm
<Mr_You> and perl cgi
<stbain> so Zope vs. Webware?
<Mr_You> well.. if you want.. but most people just choose whatever works for them
<stbain> no... I meant does anyone know the pros and cons of webware vs. zope?
<Mr_You> webware is still beta, and early in the big scheme of things
<Mr_You> I think they are listed lessons they have learned and goals of webware on the site
<Maniac> zope is too complicated webware fits the brain :)
<Maniac> there maybe a doc on the webware site somewhere that gives pros vs zope
<Maniac> zope is complicated to get up and running with
<jcater> zope is very powerful though
<jcater> we use it inhouse
<Mr_You> it was a nice surprise to here someone has a somewhat working webware+GNUe code
<jcater> ('course, at the time, I didn't know about webware)
<stbain> zope is complicated to get up and running with?
<stbain> I found it quite simple to download and install
<jcater> I had no problem
<stbain> dtml is a snap
<jcater> I was generating reports from my Oracle database with dtml in no time at all
<Mr_You> I found a doc on workflow written by a python coder.. posted it last night.. www.paul.boddie.net
<jcater> (btw I'm not pushing zope over webware; but, I say use the right tool for the right job, whichever that may be)
<Mr_You> exactly

<Mr_You> anyone tried the evolution RC1?
<derek> hmm once a fellow i know tried to lube a pineapple and put up his arse, i hear that evolution RC1 gives you same effect with half the mess....
<derek> yes im j/k
<Mr_You> geez hehe
<Mr_You> I'm looking forward to a M$ Outlook solution for linux.. evolution or mozilla
<Mr_You> or the other few
<Mr_You> aethena I think
<Isomer> mutt?
<derek> wait you might be confusing things
<derek> you looking for 'outlook' solution or 'exchange' solution?
<Mr_You> evolution enables outlook like features without exchange
<Mr_You> which hardly anyone seems to use anyways hehe
<Mr_You> but could be useful
<derek> um i disagree
<derek> evolution isnt even 5% as powerful as exchange services
<Mr_You> IIRC, evolution uses p2p technology to send scheduled events
<derek> and disagree that no one uses the exchange services
<derek> the county LIVES off outlook calendaring (shared calendars)
<Mr_You> this p2p is probably just via STMP and IMAP and interpreting the email as a calendar event
<derek> as well as a few other features
<Mr_You> yeah.. thats what I want to use and seems evolution has accomplished that.. last I checked year ago or so I guess
<derek> exchange is CRAP for a mail server, but some of its groupware services are decent (just poorly implemented at times)
<stbain> outlook like features
<derek> Mr_You: its not on par with exchange services
<Mr_You> what other features besides calendar does exchange do? my groups never used them
<derek> they might say they have 'implemented' shared calendars but im not seeing it on level of exchange
<derek> first off i dont think you can have true shared calendars in p2p mode and be effective
<derek> it works for small numbers with dedicated connections, but after that the updated of the nodes will be delayed and scheduling cant have that
<stbain> It supports peer-to-peer calendaring with users on products that support iCalendar, 
<stbain> evolution, that is
<derek> also the key feature used at county by high level officials is 'delegation'
<derek> i.e. you can delegate some to read / respond to your email as well as calendars
<Mr_You> imap should do that
<derek> btw: i think that we (GNUe) will start looking into groupware services
<derek> so that you could use your GEAS logic in such things
<derek> but thats another discussion
<Mr_You> like what kind of application for example?
<derek> btw: last time i was with the ximian folks, their secretaries (nat and miguels)
<derek> used outlook on windows
<derek> because evolution couldnt handle delegation at all
<derek> and it was too hard to 'train' her to use linux outside of that
<derek> and most of the 'investors' used windows
<derek> jade and i gave her some SERIOUS SERIOUS SERIOUS crap
<Mr_You> I think its possible
<derek> since they had to use our bandwidth for a week :)
<derek> we did get like 10 shirts, 5 monkeys, free dinner and some roller coaster rides out of it though :)
<Mr_You> not p2p in the sense of another protocol but p2p using smtp/imap
<Mr_You> ie. email apps "messages" will be sent via email and auto parsed and interpreted and deleted.
<Mr_You> I think thats how iCalendar works but I dunno
<Mr_You> delegation could be done by sending the encrypted imap password to allow switching of identities and/or reading others imap folders
<Mr_You> you have an example of a GNUe groupware app?  most orgs seem fine with email/mailing list or newsgroups.. to which any web or desktop interface could provide access too..
<Mr_You> tie everything into LDAP
<stbain> don't forget workflow, document storage, community calendaring, etc
<jcater> sigh!! well, installed new software on my Win98 station, therefore I must reboot...
<Mr_You> community calendaring is groupware, but I dunno about document management and workflow.. maybe I'm wrong.. I think of groupware as communication methods
jcater (jason@w202.z065105010.mem-tn.dsl.cnc.net) left irc: 
<Mr_You> definitely GNUe could be useful for community calendaring, workflow, and document management..and many other ERP-type apps
<Mr_You> I'm even thinking about Content Management System for webcontent from GNUe, but I don't consider that groupware
<ajmitch> CMS sounds sorta like what chillywilly is gonna do :)
<Mr_You> in the end tho, I guess it would be cool to have everything authenticate through GEAS 
<Mr_You> he must be keeping it a secret then ;-)
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> what comes under the topic of CMS?
<Mr_You> really webware could be "everything web" for GNUe..
<ajmitch> yes
<derek> Mr_You: yes 
<Mr_You> that way you could (hopefully) tie in any webware module into GNUe
<ajmitch> i (and chillywilly) are going to write a phpnuke-like forum using webware
<stbain> given the python-centric nature of GNUe, it seems like cmf.zope.org would fit right in
<derek> i see groupware of gnue integrating nicely into GNUe Workflow and Document Management
<derek> as well as offering shared calendars, contacts etc
<ajmitch> what about phpGroupware?
<derek> ajmitch: no comment
<Mr_You> ajmitch: "should" only require porting one to webware I guess
<ajmitch> wasn't something happening with that & GNUe?
<derek> other than i refuse to use a phpMiddleWare with GNUe
<ajmitch> ah, ok
<ajmitch> using webware stuff seems quite useful tho
<derek> subsitute i with we as the gnue core team isnt into using phpmiddleware and authentication services :)
<ajmitch> :)
<stbain> we're already running everything off of python objects, right?
<Mr_You> ok, I'm gonna be a little upset if I wasted all this time on this debian mirror.. considering its almost 60GBs now
<ajmitch> Mr_You: wow
<Mr_You> I should have just hacked at the broken scripts
<Mr_You> ajmitch: thats without source, just debs of US-debian
<Mr_You> tweaking my rsync exclude again

<ajmitch> so what are you looking at doing with webware & GNUe? planning to talk to the webware ppl?
<derek> um
<Mr_You> madlocke already has code working or something
Action: ajmitch is curious about what toys he can play with ;)
<derek> looking to use webware for UI driver for UIhtml.py
<ajmitch> ok
<derek> that madlocke is working on
<derek> forms is designed to abstract UI like it to abstract databases
<derek> i.e. you simply provide a UI driver
<derek> now the killer thing is if you use something python based you can use all underlying objects
<ajmitch> yep
<derek> and just reimplement UIdriver.py
<derek> i believe madlocke has UIhtml.py and some updates to the objects
<derek> that would give us basic functionality for a web version of forms
<ajmitch> but madlocke has been AWOL for a little while?
<Mr_You> he's back
<derek> our agents have tracked him down
<Mr_You> hehe
<ajmitch> ah ok
<derek> only a matter of time before we can extract the code ;)
Action: Mr_You suddenly hears in the distance "I'll never tell..."
<ajmitch> you've smuggled him back to the GNUe compound for interrogation?

<jamest> is cvs down?
<ajmitch> afternoon jamest
Action: ajmitch tries a cvs up
<Mr_You> worked for me a little while ago
<ajmitch> anoncvs works for me
<derek> problems with a gnu machine, i cant believe that :)
<ajmitch> probably a problem at jamest's end
<jcater> jamest: ah, you'rer back
<derek> probably a lsh problem
<jamest> derek: can you cvs update via your ssh 
<jamest> key
<derek> i.e. pserver always works 
<derek> its a SECURE connection that is down most of hte time
<derek> jamest: i still pserver
<derek> for the gnue box
<derek> er gnu
<ajmitch> i see
<jcater> jamest: up for me
<derek> mainly cause it took a year for me to get an account that worked for ssh :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> i can't update cvs from here
Action: ajmitch guesses he couldn't use ssh for cvs ;)
<jamest> yip
<jamest> it no longer accepts my key
<ajmitch> damn
<jamest> as since I don't have a password on pserver anymore I'm locked out
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> upgraded ssh lately?
<jamest> no
<chillywilly> ack
<ajmitch> hey chillywilly
<chillywilly> subverisons ssh support blows
<chillywilly> goats even
<jamest> anyone play w/ the inno setup stuff?
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> yes
<jamest> that good eh?
<jcater> inno works great :)
<Mr_You> bbl
<jcater> but the resulting install doesn't
<jamest> yes it does
Action: Mr_You &
<jamest> it worked fine on my last build
<jamest> except for the environment vars not being set
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> forms worked for me except the environ vars
<jamest> of course
<jcater> but designer said critical system dlls were missing
<jcater> :(
<jamest> now I'm locked out of cvs
<jamest> designer was never tested
<jcater> but, first things first.. I'm trying to figure out the environ vars
<jamest> ever
<jcater> btw
<jcater> did you know mcmillan forces the __file__ of our imported stuff to be
<jcater> located at c:\python21\
<jcater> fsck!
<jamest> no, i didn't see that
<jamest> i thought it put everything in dist_gf*
<jcater> if you do a gfclient.exe -d10
<jcater> you see all the [mymodule:linenum] Messages
<jcater> have /python21/gnue/common/something
<jcater> as the mymodule
<jcater> I'm trying to see if that's causing it to make the install prefix as c:\python21
<jcater> sigh
<jamest> um
<jamest> that is set in gnue.conf
ajmitch_ (ajmitch@p45-max5.dun.ihug.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> hardcoded to c:\python21
<jcater> I changed that for the Inno setup
ajmitch (me@p45-max5.dun.ihug.co.nz) left irc: http://www.freedevelopers.net
<jcater> on my machine
<jcater> I'm talking about in gfclient.py and gfdesigner.py
<jcater> so it knows where to find gnue.conf
<jcater> I'm wondering if that's still basing it off of c:\python21
<jamest> well, that's where it initally installs
<jamest> at least on my setup
<jcater> yeah, but remember, you had me do a fix before you left
<jcater> it now uses the base director of gfclient/../etc
<jamest> oh! I misunderstood the problem
<Isomer> hmm
Action: jcater is tired, so isn't coherent
<Isomer> how goes the windows installer?
<jamest> close, i think

<Isomer> rofl
<jcater> but close, oh so close
<jcater> jamest: btw, I hope you don't mind.. I added to the inno setup file so it'd associate GFD's with gfclient (so you can double-click a form and run it)
<jcater> also, you can right-click a GFD and click "Edit" and open it in designer
<jamest> cool
<jamest> i wanted to do that but ran out of time
<chillywilly> wtf is inno?
<jcater> it's the "in" versionn of "mono"
<jamest> a free installer for windows
Action: chillywilly beats jcater with a trout
<jamest> takes a script and makes a setup.exe from a bunch of files
<jamest> with the files we have gnuef and designer are setup.exe's
<jamest> that install and uninstall nicely
<jamest> just got to work some kinks out of the system
<chillywilly> we can't have that
<chillywilly> then everyone will expect easy installs
<chillywilly> :P
<jamest> don't worry chiilly
<jamest> if the user name contains dan in it
<jamest> it falls back to a mode that's a royal bitch to install
<chillywilly> great!
<jcater> crap crap crap
<jamest> we knew you'd like it like that
<chillywilly> good work jamest
<jcater> sigh
<Isomer> when are you doing a setup.sh for *nix? :)
<Isomer> shar style? :)
<jcater> Isomer: are you volunteering?
<jamest> Isomer: mcmillan supports a setup file for unix too
<jcater> jamest: I think we found a volunteer :)

<Isomer> so I'm the worst person to ask :)
<chillywilly> dpkg -i gnue-forms.deb

<Isomer> heh
<stbain> ok... so if, for example, I have Python2.1 and wxWindows installed... the installer will complete the rest ofthe required tasks for installing GNUe?
<jamest> stbain: on windows you require nothing
<jamest> it's a single setup.exe
<jamest> no python, no db drivers, no wxpython, etc, etc
<stbain> where is this setup.exe?
<jamest> um, we're working on it
<stbain> ;)
<stbain> I see
<stbain> can I help?
<jamest> it almost works
<jamest> you may be able to test in a bit
<stbain> are you running into any specific problems?
<jamest> yeah, it don't work
<Isomer> rofl
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> how very descriptive of you
<stbain> yes... I know how to fix that one
Action: chillywilly beats jamest with a trout
<jcater> dang
<jcater> no slapping?
<chillywilly> no, just beating damnit
<jcater> what did you do jamest to deserve a beating instead of a slapping?
<chillywilly> youg to one too
<chillywilly> you got
<jcater> or is that chillywilly's way of getting kinky?
Action: chillywilly trout whips jcater

<Isomer> mysql is a relational database, without the "relational", and looses your data, which leaves "base", and we all know that all your base are belong to us!

<Isomer> except it won't connect to our database :)
Action: Isomer curses mysql once more
<Isomer> DB000: gnue.common.GDataObjects.ProviderNotSupportedError: No database driver found for provider type 'pypgsql'
<Isomer> well
<Isomer> thats one better than mysql
<Isomer> it didn't just crash
<jamest> Isomer: you have the mysql driver?
jcater (jason@HubA-mcr-24-165-193-222.midsouth.rr.com) left irc: rebooting
<derek>  jamest: we need to change that mysql error to
<derek> 'we are sorry, gnue only works with real databases'
<derek> ;)
<ajmitch> hehe
<Isomer> jamest: apparently not :)
<jamest> :)
<jamest> if anyone hates themselves
<jamest> we're currently looking for a win32 install maintainer
<derek> oooooohhhh ooooooohhhhhh
<derek> me me me me me me 
Action: derek just watched shrek and is reminded of the donkey being the only volunteer to go with shrek :)
<derek> btw: im teasing i dont want the windows install maintenance hell er job
<Isomer> psu: time of KC!

<stbain> hrmmm
<stbain> what are you looking for in the way of a win32 install maintainer
<stbain> ?
<stbain> skillwise
<jamest> someone who hates themself
<jamest> and is willing to put up with a world of pain making this shit work
<jamest> as it's being a bitch
<jamest> i think once we nail down all the gotchas i'll be cake
<jamest> but right now I'm sick of it :)
<Isomer> on redhat 7.2 libpq-fe.h is in /usr/lib/pgsql/libpq-fe.h
<jamest> honestly if someone wants to maintain gnue windows installer
<jamest> i think they should let us hammer out the errors first
<Isomer> so therefore the #include needs #include <pgsql/libpq-fe.h> or you need -I/usr/include/pgsql
<jamest> then it should be as simple as making sure they have latest db/ui drivers
<jamest> and running a bat file
<jamest> then a inno script
<Isomer> whoooohoo! I got gfdesigner to segfault!
<derek> hmmm
Action: jamest blinks 
<jamest> chillywilly: could you slap me w/ a trout please
<jamest> i need to make sure I'm not dreaming
Action: derek slaps jamest with a smelly old crappie
[21:37] Last message repeated 4 time(s).
<jamest> ok, I'm not dreaming
<derek> darn sticky mouse key
<Isomer> why would you be dreaming?
Action: jamest digs himself out from under an excessive pile of smelly old crappie
<jamest> i have a gnuef setup.exe that works out of the box
<jamest> at least for postgresql
<jamest> i need to find all the binary drivers i can
<stbain> wouldn't it be best to use ODBC connectivity with all of the windows clients?
<jamest> ODBC is supported
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> are boxes not containers?
<jamest> not at this time
<Isomer> theres no way to resize the labels on the property box?
<Isomer> so there are two rows "foreign_key...."
<Isomer> but I can't see what differentiates them?
<jcater> jamest: you will only be able to install stuff like postgresql, mysql, sap-db IIRC
<jcater> I know I tried oracle at work, 
<jcater> but the oracle drivers require oci.dll
<jcater> (which IIRC we can't distribute :(
<derek> jamest: im willing to test the windows install at work tomorrow
<jcater> so it rejected the Oracle drivers
<jamest> do they require it at build time?
<jamest> or only at run time?
<jcater> well
ajmitch (me@p45-max5.dun.ihug.co.nz) left irc: Read error to ajmitch[p45-max5.dun.ihug.co.nz]: EOF from client

<jcater> mcmillan rejects them because they fail the import

<jamest> ?
<jamest> talking to yourself again?
<jcater> you didn't get the =lil= message?
<jcater> err, =lilo=
<jcater> again? how'd you hear me earlier?
Action: jcater gets paranoid with his PC
<jamest> :)
<jamest> ok, the install works
<jamest> w/ some minnor issues to work out
<jcater> minor?
<jamest> got some masta work
<jamest> yip minor
<jamest> let me commit
<jamest> when the icon on the desktop is created it doesn't have a form 
<jamest> so it fails as gnuef always wants a form
<jamest> we need a very basic "Welsome to gnuef" form that shows some of the features (all non-data bound of course)
<jamest> that we can attempt to tie to that icon
<jcater> lol
<jcater> call it <base>/forms/GFClient.py
<jcater> err, call it <base>/forms/GFClient.gfd
<jcater> as it looks for that anyway
<jcater> :)
<jamest> some inno issues
<jamest> the working dir isn't set unless to specify it in the iss file
<jamest> and mcmillan apps assume they're running in the dir they installed to
<jcater> hmm
<jamest> so no working dir = failed w/ unable to find ddl files
<jamest> dll
<jamest> updates checked in
<jamest> i didn't touch designer yet :(
<jamest> jcater: you stable yet?
<jamest> :)
<derek> what is this inno stuff?
<derek> and when did we decide to you use it?
<Isomer> derek: the installer program
<jamest> free windows installer
<jamest> makes setup.exe
<Isomer> now that I think I understand how to get this program going and doing it's thing
<Isomer> I might do a cvs update :)
<jamest> it's the only free one I could find
<jamest> so I used it
<jamest> and it's nice
<jamest> very nice
<jcater> yes it is
<jcater> I'm gonna switch NCS's stuff to it
<jamest> gnue now installed into start-programs-gnue
<jamest> each app gets an icon, uninstall icon, web link
<jcater> jamest: you test double-clicking a GFD?
<jamest> nope
<jamest> hang on
<jamest> does not work
<jamest> :(
<jamest> gnuef fails missing dlls
<jcater> crap crap crap
<Isomer> DB000:     if self.parser.Parse(buf, 0) != 1:
<Isomer> DB000: SystemError: Python/compile.c:265: bad argument to internal function
<Isomer> is that fixed?
<jamest> that's a new one to me
<jcater> me too
<jamest> how'd you manage that?
<jcater> crap
<Isomer> happens when I try and load a form
<jcater> this sucks
<Isomer> in the designer
<jcater> anyone know of CVS programs for Win98????
<Isomer> there is wincvs
<jamest> ssh and samba
<jamest> or a home server
<jcater> jamest: I had to boot into Win98 mode to 
<jcater> test this win install stuff
<jcater> first time in months :(
<jamest> that's what wifes pc is for
<jamest> :)
<jcater> well, wx crashes it, remember?
<jcater> :(
<jamest> oh yeah
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I guess I can ssh into work and email a setup.py sdist :(
<jamest> btw - cvs commited
<jcater> grabbing now :)
<jamest> i can't find win32 binaries for interbase on the url given in the file
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> still can't parse that file
<jamest> which file Isomer
<Isomer> well, any xml file by my guess
<jamest> what is the command you're giving (and which platform)
<Isomer> python2 `which gfdesigner` ./helloworld2.gfd
<Isomer> running on rh7
<Isomer> I think the reason is that I've botched the install of PyXML
<Isomer> after looking closer
<Isomer> coz it's occuring inside there
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> i would think that'd work
<jamest> on thing to remember is that you need to install PyXML under python2.1
<jamest> er, 2.x
<Isomer> DB000:   File "/usr/lib/python2.1/site-packages/_xmlplus/sax/drivers/drv_pyexpat.py", line 67, in parseFile
<Isomer> DB000:     if self.parser.Parse(buf, 0) != 1:
<Isomer> DB000: SystemError: Python/compile.c:265: bad argument to internal function
<Isomer> yeah
<Isomer> I know
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> looks like you did

<Remosi> does that mean that the drive for gnue isn't installed? the drive gnue uses isn't installed? or the driver python uses isn't installed or?
<jcater> the latter
<Remosi> ah hmm
<Mr_You> man my dev box sure is slow
<Mr_You> P166MMX I think

<Remosi> thats a new error message?
<jcater> um
<jcater> what os you running on?
<Remosi> RH7.2
<jcater> are you running a copy of CVS, or a download?
<Remosi> CVS
<Remosi> recently cvs updated
<jcater> is there a pypgsql directory in /usr/local/gnue/lib/python/gnue/common/dbdrivers/

<jcater> how did you install?
<Remosi> install which?
<jcater> using the setup.py in the gnue/ directory?
<jcater> or the ./setup.py in each tool directory
<Remosi> each one in the tool directory
<jcater> which version of python are you running?
<Remosi> 2.1
<Remosi> ahh
<Remosi> I found out why it says that
<Remosi> the first time I click "Continue" in the wizard
<Remosi> it says "no such driver" (which is false, but never mind)
<Remosi> the second time it says "has no attribute 'pypgsql'
<jcater> oh
<jcater> sigh
<Remosi> so it is a bug
<jcater> yes
<Remosi> but uh, not the one that's making this fail
<Remosi> [perry@saturn gnue-common]$ python2 -c 'import pyPgSQL'
<Remosi> that succeeds
Action: Remosi ponders why it's saying the pyPgSQL module doesn't work
<jcater> have you installed mxDateTime, per chance?
<jamest> his above import would have failed IIRC
<Remosi> ah ha!
<Remosi> jcater: you're correct
<Remosi> mx was installed for 1.5 not 2.0
<Remosi> just figured that myself

<jamest> you on a debian box?
<jamest> nevermind
