<jamest> i saw we dock his pay

<dneighbo> wicked cool
<dneighbo> im interested
<dneighbo> though i dont want to admit it 
<dneighbo> what is free ODBC?
<jcater> the free python odbc adapter :)
<dneighbo> for those freaking out (chilly)
<dneighbo> the reason this is cool as now we know integrator can be made to convert people from access to postgres :)
<jamest> lol

<dneighbo> i wonder how you got from there to here and here to there and back again
<dneighbo> most interesting
<ra3vat> if I need to pass additional commands to database after get connection is it a good idea to put it into _postConnect() def
<dneighbo> ra3vat you not using forms?
<dneighbo> i.e. you just using common?
<jcater> um
<dneighbo> or you using forms and making a new trigger type of postConnect?
<jcater> dneighbo: that's a gnue-common DBdriver command
<jcater> ra3vat: what are you trying to accomplish?
<jcater> yes, that's the place things like that would go if working on a new driver
<jcater> but if you are having to customize one of our drivers for your environment, 
<jcater> then we may need to do something else
<ra3vat> it was done some days in old postgresql driver
<dneighbo> as jason stated what are you trying to achieve 
<ra3vat> I need for example to
<dneighbo> i.e. what do you plan to do in teh postConnect code?
<ra3vat>  c = self._dataConnection.cursor()
<ra3vat>     c.execute("SET CLIENT_ENCODING TO 'WIN'")
<jcater> ooh
<dneighbo> jcater you think this should be another item in the connection file?
<jcater> wht does that do?
<jcater> dneighbo: ues
<dneighbo> like
<jcater> err, yes
<dneighbo> client_encoding = WIN
<jamest> jcater: sets postgresql locale
<ra3vat> and it is what ENCODING param in gnue.conf is for
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> ra3vat would it be acceptable to just have this as a value in in your connections file?
<dneighbo> jcater remind me to talk to mdean about date/time stuff 
<ra3vat> if client and database encoding are different it gives postgresql info to recode data on the fly
<ra3vat> dneighbo: yes, may be connections.conf would be better

<dneighbo> jamest: originally php nuke was closed source but free

<Mr_You> Mandrake is supporting it?
<ra3vat> post-nuke
<dneighbo> and he got funding
<dneighbo> and he got ego issues
<dneighbo> and closed the source back up
<dneighbo> post-nuke (thanks ra3vat) made a fork of the code
<dneighbo> and has started to maintain the free version
<Mr_You> post-nuke doesn't do multi-DBs tho yet :-(
<dneighbo> basically hosing the original author (his own fault admittedly)
<Mr_You> ok, well bbl
Action: Mr_You &
<jamest> i thought nuke was gpl?
<dneighbo> i guess not originally
<dneighbo> but regardless a copyright holder can change their mind :)
<ra3vat> is ./setup.py devel appropriate command for gnue-common?

<dneighbo> plus i figure jcater couldnt pass up an offer to bbq
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> :)
<jcater> NCS' president wins at practically every BBQ cookoff in the country
<dneighbo> so gnue meeting at ncs this summer, its final
<dneighbo> thanks for inviting us
<jcater> lol
<jcater> I still vote on vegas
<jamest> ra3vat: you don't need to do that in common
<jamest> only in forms and designer
<jamest> they include common as part of the devel setup
<dneighbo> if you are serious im WAY game to vegas
<dneighbo> its close, its cheap and my wife would have a blast
Action: ra3vat was invited already to one banquet passed last monday in Tusla
<dneighbo> hey tulsa is close too
<jcater> hey
<jcater> I can fly to vegas ~100
<jcater> as that's a popular destination
<dneighbo> works for me.... jamest?
Action: dneighbo knows jamest has ability to get the 'time' off :)
<dneighbo> comdex is next week in vegas you know 
<dneighbo> show up on friday and hand out gnue literature why combing the floors then spend the weekend gnue'ing ;)
<dneighbo> unrealistic of course, but it sounds fun
<dneighbo> btw the windwos installer looks pretty good
<dneighbo> getting ready to test on another machine
<dneighbo> we still looking for a sample form?
<jcater> lol
<jcater> I was originally suposed to go to comdex
<dneighbo> hmm mlooks like still 0.1.0a out there
<jcater> but things got wierd around here
<dneighbo> i thought a new one was made that included samples?
<dneighbo> was it just never 'posted'?
<dneighbo> if someone can build and post pretty quick i will gladly test
<jamest> not created yet
<jamest> please make a introduction form if you have time
<jamest> maybe something that is on tabbed pages
<dneighbo> i will right now
<jamest> with a button example, a trigger example
<dneighbo> if you can make an install :)
<dneighbo> for .exe and post
<dneighbo> as im behind firewall
<jamest> a page or two of text
<dneighbo> and want to test anyhow :)
<jamest> can you use current exe's 
<dneighbo> does odbc work with windows?
<jamest> or do you need more
<dneighbo> i would like a new one with the samples :)
<jamest> I'm in the middle of a fire
<jamest> but will try and make something in a bit
<dneighbo> also if possible packaging jcaters odbc code
<dneighbo> as then i can test DB2 for real
<dneighbo> via ODBC
<dneighbo> against the mainframe :)
<dneighbo> which would seem fairly impressive to some
<dneighbo> gnue forms windows client
<jamest> :)
<dneighbo> talking to OS/390 on DB2 fetching 100,000 records in xx seconds
<dneighbo> would help prove we are serious about supporting real enterprises (a la mainframe) as well as supporting non linux clients and hetereogenous environments. :)
<ra3vat> anyone seen this:
<ra3vat> DB000: IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/local/gnue///usr/local/gnue/shared/images/gnue-splash.png'
<jamest> yip
<jamest> gnue.conf changed in cvs
<jamest> paths are now relative
<ra3vat> ok
<jamest> the sample.gnue.conf has been updated to reflect the change
<jamest> sorry about that
<jamest> we no longer require different gnue.conf for windows or *nix clients
<dneighbo> cause we are studs ;)
<ra3vat> jamest: seems that quick hack in UIwxpython.py does not work anymore:
<ra3vat>           elif (1728 <= event.KeyCode() <= 1791):
<ra3vat>             offset = 1536
<ra3vat>             action = GFEvent('requestKEYPRESS',chr(event.KeyCode()-offset))
<ra3vat> but new one:
<ra3vat>           elif (192 <= event.KeyCode() <= 255):
<ra3vat>             action = GFEvent('requestKEYPRESS',chr(event.KeyCode()))
<ra3vat> works well for both windows and unix
<ra3vat> with current tools
<jamest> um
<jamest> thats odd
<ra3vat> odd?
<jamest> why would the input codes have changed?
<ra3vat> those in range 1728-1791 looked very strange
<ra3vat> in range 192-255 looks better for one-byte encoding
<ra3vat> and chr() deals only with 0-255 range covering most of pre-unicode encoding 
<Mr_You> derek, I'm sorry but you are mistaken..
<Mr_You> the only REAL BBQ comes from NC!!!
<Mr_You> ;-)
<jamest> ra3vat: this is russian support only change right?
<dneighbo> Mr_You now now
<dneighbo> jamest: dont you wish you knew :)
<Mr_You> my dad acquired an awesome BBQ chicken recipe.. drool
<ra3vat> jamest: should be appropriate for others non-latin1 but I can't test
<jamest> ra3vat: feel free to commit a patch 
<jamest> i think you have cvs access right?
<ra3vat> ok
<jamest> ra3vat: can you also test this on windows?
<Mr_You> main diff between texas and eastern BBQ, I guess, is that Texas has a bunch of sauce... and eastern is more marinated
<ra3vat> jamest: i'll do tomorrow
<ra3vat> and ask others to test also
<Mr_You> some of us north carolinians are passionate about our BBQ hehe
<Mr_You> if its pig BBQ and not marinated.. gotta have the Texas Pete handy (a NC hot sauce).... if its chicken marinated rocks
<Mr_You> enough of my ranting
<ra3vat> jcater: please take a look at the designer/src/Instance.py (def saveForm) I need something like:
<ra3vat>     fileHandle = open(location,'w')
<ra3vat>     enc = sys.getdefaultencoding()
<ra3vat>     if enc == 'ascii':
<ra3vat>         fileHandle.write('<?xml version="1.0"?>\n\n')
<ra3vat>     else:
<ra3vat>         fileHandle.write('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="%s"?>\n\n' % (enc))
<jcater> ra3vat: have you tested that? does it work?
<ra3vat> it does not work without that
<ra3vat> if I have form with non ascii labels for example and "encoding" in xml header
<jcater> ok, committed
<ra3vat> designer erase "encoding" and then can't load that form again itself
<ra3vat> problem is that same encodings named differently in different tools (in different places)
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I'm still not sure how to handle this long term

<Mr_You> hmm wonder how you do a /part msg
<chillywilly> man!
<chillywilly> women just do NOT get it!
<chillywilly> baaah!
<Mr_You> get what?
<chillywilly> anything
<chillywilly> they do not think rationally
<jcater> trying to explain to wife why you spend more time with us than her again?
<chillywilly> I don't spend time with your wife
<chillywilly> :P
<ajmitch> hehe
<jcater> haha
<jcater> I'd feel sorry for you if you did
<chillywilly> uuuh
<chillywilly> nah
<chillywilly> I got it just as bad I am sure
<chillywilly> ok, I geta  joint checking account right
<chillywilly> then I put some money in there
<chillywilly> mena while we put some money in hers to cover bills as we didn;t have checks yet
<chillywilly> gah
<chillywilly> she's claling me back
<ajmitch> ;)
<ajmitch> run!
<chillywilly> man she's so friggin lame
Action: ajmitch hopes she doesn't read the irc logs
<chillywilly> I don't care
<chillywilly> she's being irrational
<ajmitch> you should!
<chillywilly> and aillogical
<chillywilly> illogical
<Mr_You> phpGroupware is moving from sf to savannah, guess ya'll knew that
<Mr_You> yeah some women are completely illogical and don't tell you why.. you just have to always keep in your mind what the hidden message is hehe
<Mr_You> such as "I realized I fudged up but I'm not going to admit it yet, but just bitch"
<dneighbo> hmmm... i dont think i would want a 'logical' wife
Action: Mr_You knows very little about women.
<jcater> hehe
<chillywilly> dneighbo: why not?
<jcater> a logical wife is no wife at all
<chillywilly> what?
<dneighbo> i wouldnt have any fun, man / wife is about complimenatary traits
<Mr_You> yeah
<dneighbo> you logic offsets her illogical patterns and vice versa
<dneighbo> i cant tell you how many times my wife's 'intuition' has saved my butt
<dneighbo> to me it seemed illogical to just go on a 'feeling' but ill be darned if her feeling wasnt right
<dneighbo> if you watch old star treks or new ones
<dneighbo> we laugh at the vulcans logic, but often times look in the mirror and thats us :)
<Mr_You> hehe
<dneighbo> now thats not to say illogically behavior cnat be frustrating as hell at times, but imagine how your logical behavior probably enfuriates her :)
<chillywilly> dneighbo: that's highly illogical
<reinhard> well i would say
<reinhard> fascinating
<reinhard> :)
<ajmitch> heh
<chillywilly> man I want to kill her
<chillywilly> fuck this
<ajmitch> no you don't
<chillywilly> why do I even bother to talk to her anymore
<chillywilly> she says the same shit over and over
<ajmitch> cos you still love her
<reinhard> chillywilly: there's only one way to get along with illogical, irrational women
<jcater> hehe
Action: ajmitch checks out gnue
<jcater> cause you keep doing the same wrong thing over and over
<reinhard> chillywilly: love them
<reinhard> chillywilly: anything else is bound to fail
Action: ajmitch guesses GEAS won't run too well on this box
<reinhard> ajmitch: what kinda box?
<ajmitch> reinhard: p100, 16mb ram, GNU/Hurd ;)
<reinhard> why not?
<ajmitch> you should see how slow it is ;)
<reinhard> maybe slow
<reinhard> but it should run
<chillywilly> I wish I wa s a hermit
<ajmitch> if ORBit is compiled for it
<reinhard> damn orbit dependency
<ajmitch> yeah
<Mr_You> man sucks, my roommate is sorta being played by this girl/friend who he use to date.. everyone knows it cept him
<ajmitch> chillywilly: get working on removing those dependencies ;)

<chillywilly> should that be acceptable for a GNU project?

<chillywilly> Maniac: you make no fscking sense
<Maniac> :)
<jcater> chillywilly: basically, given the time frame we are in, it's either LyX documentation with this release, or no documentation for a while (until we can get some other stinking system in place)
<jcater> pick one :)
<chillywilly> use docbook then
