<SachaS> ra3vat if you like :) please
<ra3vat> SachaS: i'm using db driver but not xml-rpc, so it's rather db-odbc. but db is not involved in my question above

<SachaS> ok thanks. forms connects straight to database or goes via gnue common. oh not important atm.

<derek> jcater: you around
<derek> anyone here using win4lin or crossover plugin?
<dsmith> derek: I wish I could help. My (old) boss uses both, but I don't.
<dsmith> derek: He loves viewing all those quicktime trailers.
<derek> apt-get install mplayer fixes that
<derek> my problem is all the wife's coupon sites have moved to some evil activex control system
<derek> where by they shove the coupon to the printer automagically w/o prompts
<derek> 'so you cant print more than one'
<derek> she is pretty happy with GNU/Linux so doesnt want windows
<derek> but is frustrated she cant print these things
Action: psu recalls the urban legend about Bill Gates holding up the grocery line whilst looking for a 50c off coupon
<dsmith> derek: Hmm. Well, this might help: we got ie working under crossover (not the plugin).
<dsmith> But that's probably illegal to do now.
<derek> grrrr win4lin doesnt support debian :(
<derek> i thought jcater said they did at one time
<dsmith> derek: Yeah, we used it.
<dsmith> derek: Go ahead and mail bgaiser@altustech.com with any questions,  tell him Dale Smith sent you.

<btami> hi
<psu> hi btami
<btami> hi psu
Action: psu understands lots of kool things are happening with win32 & GNUe
<btami> :)
<psu> Your screenshot of the multi forms rox my sox especially
<btami> i think the win32 forms driver is ready for a 0.5.1 release
<btami> but i like if others tha ra3vat and me do some test on win32 before release
Action: btami thinks maybe psu is in "others" :)
Action: ra3vat has run to update his win32 installation
<btami> ra3vat: thanks :)
<ra3vat> :)
<psu> is it possible to get some pre-release setup.exes for people scared of CVS?
<btami> yes, but i can upload only next week (from office):(
<btami> and don't know how jcater feels designer...
<ra3vat> btami: from what he said yesterday, seems he is ok about 0.5.1
<ra3vat> btami: do you use reports under win32?
<btami> you can use --ui win32 , if you don't want wx for login
<btami> i don't use reports, just testing it
<ra3vat> btami: ok, btw, forms(win32) looks better from when i tested it last time
<btami> ok
<btami> and i want to make a GDI report filter later, when jcater goe on with reports
<btami> s/goe/goes
<ra3vat> GDI report filter?
<btami> now i'm plaing with GDI for SimpleTabulation
<btami> yes, for win32
<btami> you know there are cheap winprinters (like winmodems), and
<btami> these printers talk only GDI
<btami> no PCL or ESC/P or anything else
<btami> and unfortunately they are getting popular
<ra3vat> btami: dropdown boxes looks thicker then regular entries, is that mandatory look&feel for them?
<btami> can you upload a screenshot?
<btami> i seems ok for me
<btami> s/i/it
<ra3vat> btami: if you place entries and dropdowns on a neighbor lines you will see
<ra3vat> http://ics.elcom.ru/~ds/finics2.png 
<ra3vat> look where town_id placed
reinhard (~reinhard@M1259P028.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: "All things being equal, fat people use more soap"
<ra3vat> someone said that there is problem with wxpython to fix that
<ra3vat> but the same look we have with win32 driver
<btami> maybe it's some windows problem
<btami> here wx and win32 is all ok 
<btami> are you use localised win?
<btami> using
<ra3vat> btami: i have that in linux and win32, how could it be my settings?
<btami> ah
<ra3vat> btami: can you give a screenshot where it's ok?
<btami> wx version ?
<ra3vat> btami: w2k
<ra3vat> non localized
<ra3vat> strange
Action: btami has no idea
<ra3vat> [ds@ics ds]$ rpm -qa |grep wx
<ra3vat> wxPythonGTK-2.3.3.1-alt1
<ra3vat> wxGTK-2.2.9-alt2
<ra3vat> what wx version i use? is that ok that versions are not equal?
<btami> in sarge both 2.4.0.8
<ra3vat> but if I use win32 driver?
<btami> wxPython is 2.4.0.7 here on my XP
<btami> you get the same with the native win32 driver?
<ra3vat> how does wxpython involved if I use win32 driver?
<ra3vat> yes
<btami> sorry, i was confused
<btami> please, can you upload the win32 screenshot too?
<ra3vat> doing now

<ra3vat> btami: compare the gap zipcode-addr and town-addr (where town is dropdown)
<btami> i think the pointSize is too small, and checkbox and dropdown has a lower limit in size on windows
<btami> to show the check mark and the little arrow in dropdown
<btami> try pointSize=somethong greater 
<btami> something
<ra3vat> currently pointSize is set to 12
<ra3vat> with 14 it is only relatively better
<ra3vat> btami: what is a check mark?
<btami> mybe this is not the right word
<ra3vat> strange is that dropdown button part is less than entry part of the widget
<btami> i see the problem, but i think this is not a gnue,wx problem, but gui in general, if

<jamest> i didn't even know we supported explicitfields
<derek> jcater: you still using win4lin
<jamest> he is
<jamest> he's running the newly released 5.0, I'm running 4.0
<Vee2d2> I'm using the crossover plugin 1.2.1
<jcater> I'm using both
<derek> is 5.0 any good?
<derek> can it access windows printing system?
<jamest> yes
<jcater> it is windows
<derek> cool
<jamest> you install win4lin
<jcater> windows printing
<derek> well ethernet, printing etc wasnt so sure
<jcater> windows networking
<jamest> it askes for a windows cd
<jamest> it installs windows
<jcater> only thing... it doesn't support USB outside of what linux kernel supports
<derek> i.e. devices thtat GNU/Linux uses also wasnt sure how it dealt with
<derek> its parallel printer
<jamest> i print from win4lin to a samba server
<jcater> and games that heavily uses directx won't work
<derek> coupons are killing me
<jamest> as the windows print server is shit
<jamest> jcater: i thought that was fixed in 5.0
<derek> no
<derek> uses directx
<jamest> directx support 
<jcater> jamest: they support basic directx
<derek> but no directx that talks to hardware
<derek> so 'heavily uses' is the distinguisher there :)
<jcater> but not hardware directx, which some highend games need iirc
<jamest> ah
<jcater> not that I have time to play games at work
<jcater> it runs all the apps I need at work
<jcater> seemlessly
<derek> my biggest concern is Debian is not listed as supported on win4lin site
<jamest> it works 
<derek> im thinking of installing it as there are a few things the wife needs windows for (activeX controls on websites)
<jamest> they support lindows directly which is debian based
<derek> and then maybe i could play sims and other stuff someday
<derek> also xandros
<derek> my fear is that upgrading the kernel
Action: derek refuses to compile kernels
<jamest> they don't offer debian kernels, i asked about that
<jcater> then you are sol
<derek> sigh i was fearful of that
<derek> on non debian systems do you have to?
Action: derek was considering buying wife new pc
<jamest> it seems to have something to do with the phase of the moon, or jupiter being in the sign of mars, or maybe it was something incompatible with the sock gnomes that live in your washer
<jcater> no, on redhat, et al, it's installer installs a new kernel
<derek> actually i suppose i will just FIGHT around it
<derek> hmmm
<derek> my fear isnt in compiliing kernel
<jamest> jcater also read the reply I got so maybe he could offer more insight into the win4lin teams reasons
<derek> its compiling kernel likely will break tons of crap i have working
<jamest> as they were completely incomprehensible to me
<jcater> jamest: made no sense to me
<derek> they support xandros and lindows
Action: jcater thinks it was a misunderstanding of initrd
<jamest> derek : you grab the kernel-package
<derek> both debian variants
<derek> well i will have to sleep on it
<jamest> you apply the patches
<derek> if i buy wife new pc
<jcater> derek: they view initrd as a problem apparently
<derek> i will have no problem recompiling kernel
<jcater> I suppose xandros and lindows use stock, regular kernels
<jamest> you copy your existing debian  kernel config setting
<derek> as it will be fresh machine/install
<jamest> they are part of the install
<derek> in fact i might beg one of you to make me a package off your kernel :)
<jamest> then issue one command
<jamest> and you get the same kernel you have with a win4li support
<jamest> it's not hideous
<derek> oh
<derek> that would be cool
<derek> and looks like its officially supported in #gnuenterprise
<derek> which beats the hell out of commercial support ;)
<jamest> lol, actually my win4lin install moved to RH
<jamest> as a last ditch effort to get dual athlon win4lin stable
<jamest> which did not work
<derek> so how does win4lin EULA work
<derek> if i buy one copy can i install on all my home machines
<jamest> shutting off a cpu fixed it but i've not migrated back to debian yet (lack of time)
<jamest> dunno
<derek> i suspect not
<derek> but that was more 'do they have a way to prevent it' question ;)
<jamest> i suspect not
<derek> is there way to 'try' win4lin w/o buying
<jamest> i can run multiple instances of wts (their multiuser setup) on different machines
<derek> maybe if you guys are around today i will try to install on my laptop
<derek> if i can get it working i will buy it
<jamest> as I do that when moving from one machine to another
<jcater> I can run multiple sessions of their single user too
<jcater> not that I do
<ra3vat> derek: they give one month key to try
<jcater> ah, yeah
<jcater> I forgot about that
<jamest> that way my users didn't lose windows access when I moved them around trying different dual athlon boxes
<derek> how long does it take to redo kernel?
<derek> 30 minutes?
<jcater> highly depends on speed of your machine
<jcater> took me about half an hour on my Athlon 1600
<derek> p3 500mhz 512mb RAM
<derek> can it be done unattended?
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> definitely
<derek> want to start me on the process?
<derek> before i run off to church (if one of you will be around later or if it doesnt force me to use new kernel right away)
<jcater> which kernel are you going top use?
<jcater> c/top/to
<jcater> also, is this debian unstable or woody?
<derek> unstable
<jcater> actually
<jcater> since I don't want to go thru derek support hell
<jcater> how about I compile it for your machine and send you a tarball
<derek> ii  kernel-image-2 2.4.18-5       Linux kernel image 2.4.18 on PPro/Celeron/PI
<derek> is what im using now
<jcater> lsmod
<derek> if you want to compile for my machine and send me deb that would be AWESOME
<derek> chilly always claims making a .deb out of custom kernel is a snap
<jcater> yeah, I learned how to do that Thursday
<jcater> it is easy
<jcater> my one concern --- does that .deb contain the modules?
<jcater> or just the kernel?

<jcater> it's actually recommended

<ra3vat> btami: gui in general? how is that?
<btami> moment, phone call...
<btami> ra3vat: i think this problem is exist on win32 (win32 api) and on linux too (gtk)
<ra3vat> but it can't be a bug in widget library
<btami> it can :)
<btami> try a simple form with 2 entry(1 normal, 1 dropdown)
<btami> with gtk2,wx on linux
<btami> then with qt
<btami> with pointSize=10
<btami> you will see, qt is OK !
<ra3vat> ok, i'll try today
<ra3vat> what about native win32 driver?
<btami> it's same as wx
<ra3vat> may it be in gnue code? 
<btami> i don't hink
<btami> proof: try pointsize= 10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26
<btami> and you will see, that the problem disappears with higher pointsizes
<ra3vat> ok
<ra3vat> what do you think could be done to solve this for smaller pointsizes?
<btami> finish qt driver :)
<ra3vat> i just do not understand how qt is better than native win32 for windows?
<btami> i think they gui toolkit (qt), is independent from standard win32 gui API
<btami> s/they/theirs
<btami> i'v just committed a small bugfix to gtk2 driver, so
<btami> you can try the above '"test" with -u gtk2 too
<ra3vat> i'm in a hurry now, will try later
<btami> ok

<siesel> hi all :)
<reinhard> hi siesel
<siesel> hi reinhard
<reinhard> currently, the default for rpctype is "pw_xmlrpc"
<reinhard> could we change that to "xmlrpc"?
<reinhard> IIRC that would be the one normally used because it's in woody
<siesel> should be no problem.
<reinhard> ok thanks
<reinhard> i'll do it
<reinhard> just wanted to ask if you object
<reinhard> another question
<reinhard> a bit more complicated
<siesel> you mean use the xmlrpc driver instead of the pw_xmlrpc driver or do you mean renaming pw_xmlrpc driver to xmlrpc
<reinhard> i mean use the xmlrpc driver instead of pw_xmlrpc
<reinhard> in case no config file exists (or the option is not mentioned in config file)
<reinhard> are we still on the same page?
<siesel> Then I would recommend to leave the pw_xmlrpc driver as default option, because its the only one working on windows in server mode and its included in the default python distro
<siesel> page?
<reinhard> um
<reinhard> are we on the same page == do we talk about the same
<reinhard> its included in default python distro?
<reinhard> starting at which version?
jbailey (~jbailey@atlas.fundserv.com) left #gnuenterprise ("Client exiting").
<siesel> yep. since python2.1 or so
Action: siesel is checking documentation
<reinhard> because i use python2.1 and i seem to not have it
<siesel> or so means = new in python 2.2 ;)
<reinhard> ah ok
<reinhard> hmmm
<reinhard> i don't like our default to not work on standard debian stable
<reinhard> on the other hand, i don't like our default to not work on standard windows, either
<siesel> ok, what about a fall back list, or better: what about moving both drivers into one, and add an option to choose between the two in case both are installed
<reinhard> actually i would like the fallback list better
<reinhard> i'm not sure if moving both drivers into one makes much sense
<reinhard> i mean what do we need driers for, then?
<reinhard> drivers
<siesel> it would look similar like the actual dbdriver implementation, i.e. all postgres drivers are down in the postgresql directory
<reinhard> don't i have to tell which postgresql driver i want?
Action: reinhard remembers something about a popy driver and a pygresql driver and so on
Action: reinhard is out of sync however so this might have changed
<siesel> I'm not shure what happens if I choose a popy driver and it doesn't exist, but with the new structure it should be possible (if it doesn't exist allready) to add such fallback code into the driver choosing allgorithm 
<jcater> um
<jcater> 0.5.0 introduced a fallback mechanism
<jcater> if you say
<jcater> provider=oracle
<jcater> it tries the dcoracle2, then the cx_oracle
<jcater> likewise w/postgres, etc
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> jcater: thanks
<jcater> it may not be working perfectly as this was the first release
<jcater> but it's there
<jcater> (patches are welcome if its not :)
<reinhard> i think we can use this for rpc driver fallback
<reinhard> siesel: what would you think?
<jcater> oops
<jcater> I saw popy
<jcater> and thought y'all were talking about dbdrivers
<jcater> I didn't realize you were talking about rpc drivers
<reinhard> yes and no
<reinhard> we were talking about rpc drivers
<reinhard> and siesel said there is a fallback mechanism in db drivers
<reinhard> so we discussed if we could do the same for rpc
<siesel> reinhard: great idea, I'll implement that for rpc too. 
<reinhard> siesel: cool
<jcater> that's what I get for walking into the middle of a conversation :)
Action: jcater feels like derek now
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> jcater: you were helpful
<reinhard> thanks again :)
<reinhard> siesel: now second question
<siesel> yes
Action: jcater is away: painting kid's room
<reinhard> in appserver i can request a list of objects
<reinhard> i can have two lists "open" at the same time for the same class
<reinhard> like in a db i can have 2 cursors on the same table
<reinhard> now our current definition is that for updating and inserting data
<reinhard> we don't tell which list should be affected by that transaction
<reinhard> i see 3 possibilities
<reinhard> a) no list is affected -- current status quo
<reinhard> b) all lists are affected -- could be problematic f.e. for an insert
<reinhard> c) all lists are affected f.e. by an insert where the new record fits the conditions
<reinhard> d) we add a parameter to tell which list should be affected
<reinhard> --
<reinhard> um
<reinhard> 4 possibilities
<reinhard> :)
<siesel> hmm
<reinhard> a makes no sense imho
<reinhard> as if i have a "grid" in a form and i add a record i want to see it in the grid
<reinhard> c) can also be different from what the user would expect
<reinhard> as i can select a list of german customers
<reinhard> then viewing that list i add an austrian customer
<reinhard> and as soon as i press "save" the record would disappear
<siesel> I don't get the difference between c and b 
<reinhard> ok i have two lists
<reinhard> list 1 has all german customers
<reinhard> and list 2 has all u.s. customers
<reinhard> i add a german customer
<reinhard> b) means the new record is visible in both lists
<siesel> ok, got it.
<reinhard> c) means the new record is only visible in list 1
<siesel> so A and B doesn't really make sense
<reinhard> agree
<siesel> I would prefer C as I think that it requires (in case of postgres) multiple database connections to implement D
<reinhard> speaking about implementation D is by far the easiest to implement
<reinhard> as it is exactly what common's dbdriver's do
<siesel> Sorry, I got it wrong again.
<reinhard> yeah, i figured that it could be too late to ask this question ;-)
<siesel> lol
<siesel> IMHO it all depends on the way we implement the "list".
<reinhard> "list" is like a wrapper around dbdriver's resultset
<siesel> that is status quo.
<reinhard> however
<reinhard> i don't think the decision what is "right" should depend on implementation
<siesel> that's "right" ;)
<reinhard> i started to think about this when jcater talked about ACID principles in database
<reinhard> especially when thinking about the I = isolation
<siesel> yes. 
<reinhard> i think d) would be "right"
<siesel> C "hurts" isolation
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> and we have to consider that _within_ a session there can be code from different authors that don't even know each other
<siesel> But A would be fully ok with ACID
<reinhard> if we consider the modularity
<reinhard> yes but a) is close to unusable in pracice
<reinhard> because when i enter a new record i want to see it after i'm finished entering it :)
<siesel> Hmmm, I don't think so. 
<reinhard> well we have a at the moment
<reinhard> and i tried to write some little tiny test
<siesel> If we use forms, the forms dbdriver stores newly inserted records at the place where they were inserted in the list
<reinhard> and i can tell you
<reinhard> it sucks :-)
<reinhard> ok gotcha
<reinhard> but what happens if i go back to that record and change something?
<reinhard> does that work
<reinhard> wrt UPDATE vs. INSERT
<reinhard> ?
<siesel> the record is stored on client side till an COMMIT
<reinhard> it is?
<reinhard> so in forms i couldn't trigger a bound procedure before committing
<reinhard> ?
<siesel> If a commit happens, the new record is inserted (remote) and its new gnue_id should be added to its representation in the local cache
<siesel> yes. thats the drawback.
<reinhard> hmmm
<reinhard> ok but after the commit
<reinhard> the record stays in the list on client side, doesn't it?
<reinhard> and it would disappear on server side
<siesel> It could even be inserted at once, but it would not have any records pre/post
<siesel> yes
<siesel> I mean: yes, it will never appear on the list on server side
<reinhard> yes correct
<reinhard> it has never been and will never be
<reinhard> so client list and server list will be out of sync
<reinhard> which could lead to a mess when for example fetching further (previously unfetched) records
<siesel> that all depends on the implementation on the database side
<reinhard> aside from all those considerations
<reinhard> i still think that d) is "right"
<siesel> if the cursor on db side will fetch new records written after its creation,
drochaid (~drochaid@pc2-kirk1-3-cust16.renf.cable.ntl.com) left irc: "Client exiting"
<reinhard> and the fact that form's dbdriver could "hide" the drawbacks of a)
<reinhard> i still don't think a) is correct
<reinhard> yes it depends on whether we have cursor stability
<reinhard> or how this is called in isolation level terminology
<reinhard> well
<reinhard> i probably won't work on it until next week
<siesel> hmmm, I don't like a either, but I think its not the best solution to allways use this cursor model
<reinhard> as i will be away 29 to 31
<siesel> holiday?
<reinhard> kinda
<reinhard> go to vienna, visit some customers and make holiday at the same time :)
<reinhard> so i'd love to give you some more time to think about it
<reinhard> also if we are lucky derek will comment
<reinhard> ;-)
<siesel> hoho  
Action: reinhard is happy he moved his backup cron job from 23:30 to 3:00...
<siesel> I think I prefer a combination of A and C. I don't like D because it makes our simple API too complicated
<reinhard> hmmmm
<reinhard> it just adds a single parameter to "save" and "delete"
<siesel> with C you could have kind of transaction domains (i.e. sessions) in which all changes directly affect everything in the domain
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> first i liked c also very much
<reinhard> but then
<reinhard> it still can make a just inserted record disappear
<reinhard> if it doesn't fit the original conditions
<reinhard> apart from that
<reinhard> there might be states where the "original conditions" aren't even defined
<reinhard> for example when you just opened a form and inserted a record without selecting something first
<siesel> reinhard, we shouldn't mix forms point of view with the concept of a cursor.
<reinhard> yeah well
<reinhard> it's too late for me, too :)
<siesel> I had a look in the postgres user manual and there is no way to insert a record into a cursor or remove a record from a cursor
<reinhard> hmmm
<reinhard> so that would mean A is exactly what a pure database would do
<reinhard> right?
<siesel> A database with a high isolation level
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> i think we nearly agree that we must do either A or D
<reinhard> you really made me unsure about A or D
<reinhard> i'm still convinced that we won't do B or C
<siesel> that's  what discussion is about :)
<reinhard> we at least want to be _better_ as a database :-)
<reinhard> better than IIRC, not better as
<siesel> hmmm, I think that A and C should be supported options, depending on the isolation level set.
<reinhard> i herewith propose to delay the decision
<reinhard> sorry i'm dog tired
<siesel> then we still could kind of emulate D by opening subsessions for each "list"
<siesel> good idea.
<reinhard> :)
<reinhard> i think i'm here tomorrow evening
<reinhard> i'm leaving wednesday 21:00 so you won't see me till sunday after that
<siesel> ok. I will try to be here too.
<reinhard> ok
