<andrey> hi
<andrey> i'm trying gnue and i've got a problem with gnue-designer 0.5:
<andrey> I can't see property labels in property editor
<andrey> is it a known problem?
<andrey> is there any workarounds?
<jcater> it is a weird problem we are having with wx
<jcater> the graphical toolkit we use
<andrey> i've got wx2.4
<jcater> we are changing the way we do the property editor in the next release (0.5.1) to rectify the situation
<andrey> ok, is the fix available in cvs?
<jcater> I'm actually working on that as we speak
<jcater> so, no
<jcater> sorry :(
<jcater> probably will be tonight though
<andrey> ok...
<andrey> anyway, is this problem depends on wx version?
<jcater> no
<jcater> at least, as far as I can tell
<andrey> so everybody cannot see those labels?
<andrey> i mean is there any conditions, when labels are shown?
<jcater> I've only had that issue with large fonts
<jcater> with certain themes
<jcater> it looks fine on my work machine
<jcater> but unreadable at home
<andrey> i see... thanks for clarification..
<andrey> jcater: and which theme do you use at work?
<jcater> I use the default gtk theme at both places
<jcater> (I'm a KDE person :)
<jcater> but for some reason, GTK is using larger fonts at home
<andrey> well, it seems this problem has nothing to do with themes...
<andrey> i see no labels with default theme
<andrey> and default font...
<jcater> any chance you could do a screenshot, just to make sure we're talking about the same thing?
Action: jcater is trying to get all these oddball bugs fixed for 0.5.1
<andrey> ok
<andrey> check out: http://micro.lt/~andrey/files/gnue-designer.png
<andrey> the similar thing was with gnue-designer 4.1
dimas (~dimas@195.218.177.46) left irc: Read error: 54 (Connection reset by peer)
<jcater> oh, weird
<jcater> you literally can't see the labels
<jcater> on mine, the labels were cut off
<jcater> so you could only read half of them
<andrey> yep..:(
<andrey> I also get warnings when starting gnue-designer:
<andrey> Warning: No event tied to File|New|Form
<andrey> Warning: No event tied to File|Save
<andrey> Warning: No event tied to Edit|Insert|Label
<andrey> Warning: No event tied to Edit|Insert|Unbound Entry
<andrey> Warning: No event tied to Edit|Insert|Drop Down Entry
<andrey> Warning: No event tied to Edit|Insert|Button
<andrey> Warning: No event tied to Edit|Insert|Box
<andrey> but they are no problem actually
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> those can be ignored
<jcater> the warning has been removed in cvs 
<jcater> and were harmless all along

<lupo_> jcater: did you make any substantial changes in designer in the past 2 weeks that require a re-installation of cvs? (userspace)
<lupo_> there is some issue with line 100 of designer/src/base/ToolPanel.py
<lupo_> on starting designer, python refuses to take "border=2" as an argument; is this new in wx 2.4?
<jamest> jcater is working heavy on designer at the moment
<lupo_> i know
<lupo_> it would just be nice if he fixed that small bug so i can run designer without modifying my files
<lupo_> and if i'm right, this bug would mean that designer wouldn't run on woody

<chillywilly> what are you using Vee2d2?
<chillywilly> a fax machine?
<Vee2d2> well.. the problem, I'm sure, is with my scanner settings. My test fax was made from openoffice.. so I printed it and scanned it.. that'll be a better test.. =)
<chillywilly> ok
<Vee2d2> did that go through, jcater?
<Vee2d2> Your facsimile job to 1901-763-3688 was not sent because:
