<derek> chillywilly_: i figured it out last night there is a qt6codecs package in marliatt (sp) debian repository that worked
<jamest> pr0n issues?
<derek> no wanted to oddly enough see a commerical
<jbailey> I usually use that package for movie trailers, etc.
<derek> band i have tracked since they were very small indie got signed by a major
<derek> and their new album has commercial spots on mTV
<derek> i dont watch mTV so i wanted to see the commericial
<Vee2d2> you no watchy the eMpTyV?
<jamest> but, but, but
<jamest> how do you keep up on the real life stories of common folks like those on "the real world" if you don't watch MTV?
<Vee2d2> I cant handle how a station purporting to be a "music" channel goes so far off that focus with shows like that.. 
<Vee2d2> Vee get mad.. Vee Smash! Vee Crash! 
<derek> sorry their commericials will be on Mtv2
<derek> which actually does play music (but i still dont watch it)
<derek> jamest: the only Mtv show i find myself watching (if i happen to see it while surfing) is punk'd with ashton kutcher
<Vee2d2> I dont get that, must be on the cable company's 'digital' plan
<derek> any vcd makers here?
<derek> i turned an .avi into a vcd, but it made a few files
<derek> if i burn to cd what do i need to do?
<jamest> a cd burner
<jamest> a blank cd
<jamest> maybe k3b?
<derek> imean i have a videocd.bin and videocd.cue
<derek> and gtoaster
<derek> is there any 'special' things i have to do
<jamest> sigh
<derek> or do i just burn them
Action: jamest read that as goatster
<derek> i tried cdeasybakeoven and k3b originally neither worked
<jamest> ah, then I don't know
<derek> unable to copy cd2cd which i do most of the time
<jamest> apt-cache search vcd
<jamest> gives us
<derek> gtoaster while sucky seemed to do the job
<derek> i ahve all the vcd stuff
<jamest> vcdtools - Creates Video CD (VCD) filesystem images
<jamest> but I've not done it
<derek> never mind i found jcater's cheat sheet
<derek> cdrdao write --device 0,0,0 --speed 4 videocd.cue
<derek> but i am not sure what parameters to use for --device
<derek> grr anyone know how to convert an wmv to an avi?
<jamest> nope
<jbailey> mencoder I think can do it.
Action: derek goes to look for mencoder
<derek> jbailey: to open a can of uncontainable worms
<derek> think you can .debianize the latest dcl release?
<derek> and yes i still plan on making it a GNU Enterprise tool
<derek> OR
<derek> plan on you helping me understand packaging enough to take it over so you arent wasting time maintaining something you are not directly involved with
<jbailey> You can't upload it, so there's no point in you maintaining it.
<jbailey> The ideal is that you should find a DD that cares about DCL.
Action: jbailey pokes ajmitch.
<derek> jbailey: i want to become a DD
<derek> so i mean as part of the process wanting to maintain it will help me meet that goal :)
<jbailey> I can work on it after I finish the GNUe updates, which is waiting on me finishing the cdbs hacking that I started yesterday.
<derek> rofl
Action: derek understands
Action: derek isnt in a huge hurry
<jbailey> derek: Your first 3 steps are:
<jbailey> 1) Get your GPG key signed by a DD
<jbailey> 2) Read the packaging and policy manuals.
<jbailey> 3) Find a sponsor.
<jbailey> I can do #3 if you have #1 and #2 done.
<derek> maybe over the weekend you can tell me how to do it (and i can do and send to you for upload) this way in future i can do and send to you for upload until i get my steps done
<derek> jbailey: you were going to check a database to find a developer near me to sign my key
<jbailey> You're just a demanding little shit, aren't you? =)
<wtg> can someone explain how the web ui driver is going to be done ? ... are you guys thinking of running a mini web server to server the forms up or some other way ?
<jamest> DD?
<jbailey> derek: The DCL packaging is annoying because it's a PHP app.
<jamest> debian developer?
<jbailey> t
<jbailey> derek: What's the time frame for turning it into a real app?
Action: jamest feels an almost unimaginable amount of pity for the current DDs known that DN will be in their midst
<jbailey> jamest: 'sokay.  We'll see if he makes it in or not. =)
<jbailey> jamest: You have to have an unbeleivably thick skin for politics. =)
<jbailey> (and flameage)
<jamest> dn: yeah, that apt thing is broken.  apt-get update reformts the hd

<derek> ajmitch: is it easy to use>?
<ajmitch> dunno :)
<derek> looks like wget has 'redirection' issues

<derek> jcater you familiar with wget or curl
Action: derek is FIGHTING trying to get eitehr to download all the files from a yahoo group :(
<derek> seems they have bugs
<chillywilly> wget -r doesn't work?
<derek> no
<chillywilly> wget -r http://whatever.com
<chillywilly> wget -r http://whatever.com/goat-pr0n/
<chillywilly> ;)
<derek> Redirection cycle detected.
<chillywilly> heh
<derek> seems some sites that redirect back to themselves confuses wget
<chillywilly> there's an option that says only go so deep I think
<derek> http://www.google.com/search?num=20&hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&safe=off&q=%22redirection+cycle+detected%22&btnG=Google+Search
<chillywilly> l,  --level=NUMBER       maximum recursion depth (inf or 0 for infinite).
<derek> how long should it take to make a vcd of like a 5 minute avi?
<chillywilly> I dunno how the heck you would do that
<chillywilly> I had the matrix reloaded in SVCD format already
<chillywilly> weas just .bin and .cue files
<chillywilly> I picked burn image in nero burning rom and pointed it at the cue
<chillywilly> file
<chillywilly> and it burnt the .bin onto the disk
<derek> hmm it was about 18meg video
<derek> i finally stopped it on like hour 2
<derek> will try it overnight
Action: derek cant believe he is compiling wget
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> http://www.mail-archive.com/wget@sunsite.dk/msg04085.html
<chillywilly> that's what that dude said to do
<chillywilly> you pull cvs?
<derek> well cvs doesnt get same error
<derek> but not sure how to fix this
<derek> seems its not 'logging in'
<derek> grrr passing it a cookies.txt file
<derek> gets me further but says im not a member
<derek> sigh i was logged in as wife for galeon but didnt check 'save on this computer' so it was trying to login as me
<derek> ok chillywilly now i need help :)
<derek> it recognized the login
<derek> it grabbed the index.html page
<derek> how do i get it download all the 'links'
<derek> i.e. to follow the links
<derek> i used -r
<derek> the problem is there is a url
<derek> myurl.com/files/
<derek> that has a single index.html with a bunch of links
<derek> i want to read that index.html and ahve it go grab the files
<chillywilly> -r should do that
<chillywilly> it's a recursive web-suck
<derek> hmm its not doing it
<derek> /home/dneighbo/cvs/wget/src/wget -r -v --load-cookies /home/dneighbo/.galeon/mozilla/galeon/cookies.txt http://groups.yahoo.com/group/undercovercoupons/files/
<derek> is what i do and i get
<derek>  groups.yahoo.com/group/undercovercoupons/files/index.html as only return
<jbailey> You still on that?
<jbailey> You'd think by now you'd have just pulled up a browser. =)
<derek> well there are a crap load of files
<derek> and want to update regularly (this is for wife)
<derek> so cron job updates coupons nightly
<jbailey> Ah.
<derek> btw: i cant help it if wget is buggy :)
<derek> i.e. cvs seems to work but not current debian package :)
<derek> that was half the fight
<derek> the other half was my stupidity about what data was in the cookie
<derek> now that those are solved i think its just lack of understanding on how to control wget to do what i want :)
<derek> hmmm
<derek>  While doing that,
<derek>        Wget respects the Robot Exclusion Standard (/robots.txt).
<derek> i wonder if this is the problem
