<takikrd> hello everybody
<takikrd> is there someone?
<ra3vat> hello takikrd
<takikrd> i'm discovering GNUE
<takikrd> since a week
<takikrd> and i have to develop a computing production management system
<takikrd> and i think that it could be a good solution
<takikrd> the problem is that i'm trying to test GNUe under windows for example
<takikrd> and i don't find tutorials that could help me from the beginning to the realisation of a little project for example
<takikrd> u see?
<ra3vat> someones here do that too
<takikrd> do u know if something already exists?
<ra3vat> i was using Developers Guide for Forms
<takikrd> Yes but how do u connect to a database...
<takikrd> set a new language...
<takikrd> it's not very easy i mean
<takikrd> i knox it's a huge project
<takikrd> but...........
<ra3vat> for connection with db you need to look into connections.conf file
<takikrd> are u under linux?
<ra3vat> i have gnue installed under windows
<takikrd> oki
<takikrd> and do u have a real experience using GNUe?
<takikrd> or is it just for tests?
<ra3vat> other men using my forms under windows
<ra3vat> so it is not just my tests
<takikrd> ok
<ra3vat> i used cvs tree i have on linux box to install under windows
<ra3vat> it was not installation from .exes
<takikrd> ok
<takikrd> and does GNUe suits your needs?
<takikrd> in fact, i'm wondering wether i propose or not GNUe to my employee instead a little ERP or an entire developpement by a computing developper?
<ra3vat> takikrd: there are no completed gnue-based ERP applications currently 
<lupo> ra3vat: there is
Action: lupo is back
<ra3vat> it is more like framework to help you develop your own 
<takikrd> okay
<lupo> you forgot project papo

<takikrd> and is there a lot to develop for a little application?
<ra3vat> lupo: sure i remember papo, doing cvs up from time to time :)
<lupo> takikrd: you can develop data-driven applications quite rapidly

<lupo> everything in Python
<lupo> which is much simpler than C++
<takikrd> oh shit
<takikrd> i don't know Python
<lupo> i was afraid of using python, too
<lupo> but you don't have to do much with it
<lupo> it's more like javascript "done right"
<lupo> usually, 98% of a gnue based application is written in XML
<lupo> you don't "program" an app, you describe it
<ra3vat> takikrd: in little application near everything is in xml
<takikrd> ok
<takikrd> can i tell me what do u use GNUe for?
<takikrd> do u think it's really used in companies?
<lupo> i don't use it currently, nor at a customer site, but i regularly play with it, try to fix this or that bug, because i think seen from a long-term perspective, i will be able to write powerful applications with it
<takikrd> so u think that i can let it down for the moment?
<takikrd> i mist code everything myself, with my own errors ;-)
<takikrd> or propose them an ERP?
<takikrd> the dream falls down...
<ra3vat> i use it for contact managemant db mostly
<takikrd> and... no problems?
<ra3vat> no
<takikrd> what can i do???
<takikrd> i finish my internship in 2 months

<lupo> gnue isn't an install-and-start-right-now ERP, at the moment
<lupo> reinhard: hi
<takikrd> an d i must propose them wether to buy an ERP or to develop a personalized solution?
<lupo> takikrd: there are some guys who continue work on nola, i don't remember the name of the group
<takikrd> do u  think it's realistic to think at a GNUe solution?
<takikrd> euh... what is nola?
<lupo> it depends what modules you want for an ERP
<ra3vat> yes 
<takikrd> just manufacturing
<takikrd> and
<lupo> nola is a web-based free ERP from noguska. development has stopped and some other group took it over.
<takikrd> a basic part of customer
<lupo> hm
<ra3vat> papo is targeting manufacturing
<lupo> what always helped me was working out a database scheme for the application, whether you write it yourself or buy an external one
<lupo> because you get a better impression of the requirements
<lupo> is your application data-intensive or logic-intensive?
<takikrd> what do u mean?
<lupo> do you have to write an application which is mainly about displaying and maintaining data, or are there a lot of computations?
<takikrd> displaying and maintaining data,
<takikrd> i just found ossuite which is an integration of NOLA (ERP), osCommerce (e-commerce) and CRM
<takikrd> do u know that?
<lupo> never heard of that
<lupo> you need an e-commerce interface too?
<ra3vat> takikrd: if you have your data organized already, you can design forms to maintain and display
<lupo> yes
<takikrd> for info http://www.ossuite.org/
<lupo> personally i think creating the database is more complicated than writing a form in gnue, as long as you don't have complex computations (=logic).
<takikrd> that's just the beginning of my internship 
<takikrd> nothing is done
<ra3vat> takikrd: we have developers of arias.sf.net coming here lately
<takikrd> don't know their goals... sorry
<takikrd> i'm trying to install nola...

<takikrd> and i test the demo on their website...

<takikrd> what a work !!!
<lupo> yeah
<lupo> the old old problem :)
<takikrd> lets' imagine i decide to develop a solution based on GNUe, which kind of web-site can i browse? where can i find more info?
<takikrd> for example where can i find a class diagram of their application? does it exist?
<takikrd> do i have to read all the code to understand what they have designed?
<ra3vat> what application?
<takikrd> just a question before
<takikrd> because perhaps am i all wrong
<takikrd> To my mind the framework of a traditional process is already done
<ra3vat> you'd better try gnue designer to make new forms for your db (any db)
<takikrd> the creation of a product goes through a process divide in tasks...
<takikrd> Is this already designed, or do i have to implement it?
<takikrd> ok for the db
<takikrd> but after the connection at the product table
<takikrd> an object is created?
<takikrd> I use to work with Java and postgreSQL for example
<ra3vat> i use postgresql too
<lupo> it is even simpler
<takikrd> U mean tha ti just have to connect my db
<takikrd> creating my forms base on a table of the database
<takikrd> and i can for example create a new Product?
<lupo> of course, you can modify db entries with code, but usually you do it through data-aware widgets.
<ra3vat> when you get your very simple form running with your db, you'll see how much it can do for you - select, update, search, ... 
<takikrd> but when they talk about framework in GNUe what do they mean?
<takikrd> or base packages like Supply Chain for example what is it for?
<lupo> framework is the tools family - GNUe forms, GNUe reports, GNUe designer, GNUe navigator, GNUe appserver
<takikrd> ah okay
<takikrd> and base packages?
<lupo> packages are SCM, CRM, etc. but they are not done now, there are only some proposals
<takikrd> sorry for the time you luse to explain me... i understand quickly but i must explain me a long time ;-)
<takikrd> that's not very clear...
<ra3vat> ?
<takikrd> are u sure?
<takikrd> when i read that part of the doc...
<takikrd> examples of use http://www.gnuenterprise.org/project/docs/DevelopersIntroduction/c31.html#AEN33
<takikrd> We'll first start at the local car dealership where Carl 
<takikrd> Installs GNU Enterprise - Core 
<takikrd> Installs the Car Dealer template(s)/package(s) which were created by some other car dealership. And, in the spirit of sharing uploaded to the GNU Enterprise package(s)/template(s) library. The template(s)/package(s) specifically.... 
<takikrd> Modifies the CRM module included in the GNU Enterprise install to include a field to track a customers favorite type of car. 
<takikrd> Installs the needed components, modules, and packages to provide an auto maintenance history system to the repair shop. 
<takikrd> Tweaks the generic inventory module to handle issues specific to automobiles 
<takikrd> Installs the needed components, modules, and packages to maintain an auto parts counter 
<takikrd> is says modifies the CRM module
<takikrd> !!!!
<lupo> yes
<takikrd> so?
<lupo> the docs are ahead of gnue's time :)
<lupo> i'm sorry that they mislead you into thinking the packages were ready

<takikrd> i won't disturb you anymore, to conclude, you mean that GNUe can be sum up to a set of tools in order to design an application
<takikrd> is this what u mean?
<lupo> at the moment, yes
<lupo> gnue is not a complete ERP solution yet
<takikrd> what a desillusion for me !!!!!!!!!!!!!

<lupo> i'm sorry

<takikrd> ;-)
<takikrd> c déjà pas mal en tout cas
<lupo> merci
<takikrd> so
<takikrd> i think i'm gonna try to develop it with Java
<takikrd> and shit !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<lupo> java sucks
<takikrd> why?
<lupo> because it takes a long time to develop with
<lupo> i have been more productive with nearly every other language
<lupo> python made me very productive
<jamest_> takikrd: i can't think of an app I'd do in java now that I'm helping maintain one
<takikrd> visual basic?
<takikrd> jamest_: what do u use?
<ra3vat> gnue i think :)
<jamest_> python and gnue :)
<lupo> python combines the simplicity of modern BASIC variants with the expressiveness of Pascal.
<jamest_> but I'm bias
<jamest_> bbiab
<takikrd> what is bias?
<takikrd> i don't understand bbiab?
<lupo> takikrd: avoir des préjuges
<takikrd> thx
<takikrd> lupo
<jamest_> if I were to write something today that had to run on a regular computer I'd try to do in python
<jamest_> if it did not perform well I'd profile it and examine my code
<jamest_> if I still had issues I'd rewrite the performance critical stuff in c/c++ and use swig to wrapper it so I could still use it in python
<ra3vat> and rewrite it in python again
<jamest_> it'd be a python/C(++) blend
<jamest_> as I find python amazingly productive compared to c|c++|java|perl|tcl/tk
<jamest_> if I was to start a system from scratch that couldn't be done in python then I might consider using java as long as I had nice hardware to back it up
<takikrd> i will have a look at this language
<jamest_> but my gut tells me that I won't ever run into such a case :)
<jamest_> be back later
<lupo> takikrd: olivier berger a écrit un introduction: http://perso.club-internet.fr/olberger/python/index.html

<takikrd> thx lupo, ra3vat and jamest_ for your patience and i will try to find a solution before the end...
<takikrd> c u
<lupo> see you

<jamest> do you really think I'd waste my time on a 32 year old slightly overweight computer nerd?
<lupo> erm
<lupo> is this a rhetorical question?
<jamest> not telling
<jcater> well, if you define slighly overweight as 110lbs and computer nerd as Claudia Schiffer, then, yes, yes I do think you would
<lupo> #define slightly_overweight_as_110lbs_and_computer_nerd Claudia_Schiffer
<lupo> why not?
