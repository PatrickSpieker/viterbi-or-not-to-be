<cy83rpunk> any how Ill look over gnue but this turn may push me to mutate things a bit more, though I would still open co development.. 
<cy83rpunk> Im not sure gnue's server end is the right direction for the db.. 
<cy83rpunk> but more ADODB / modularization / pdf templating / and generalization of the data base.. IE make account data types that users can modify to suit their needs..
<cy83rpunk> ADODB'ing should allow linkage to gnue's data or other db types..
<cy83rpunk> and the rest, is well ,,, evolution..
<cy83rpunk> If aria cuts out from mysql / oracle I may splinter it.. but I would always be open to explaining what I build..  so that aria would have the same abilities..
<cy83rpunk> (this is all assuming I find real time to work on it..)
<cy83rpunk> Ugg my old profile.. its been tooo long..
<cy83rpunk> any how, Ill check out the latest cvs of aria, and look into this whole gnue bit.. 
<cy83rpunk> maybe Ill make a new sourceforge account if they wont re config my old one.. and submit some feature requests and what not..
<cy83rpunk> OHHH I see now gnue is all python / wc based.. thus its actually just a bunch of scripts..
<cy83rpunk> ok I will delve deeper.. lates guys..

<wtg> i'm curious ... will there be any web support for gnue thourgh forms ? ... or is the plain just to run the web stuff seperatly ?
<wtg> Sacha: what do you mean in Perth atm ? ... do you make it over to the east coast much ?
<derek> wtg: yes there 'will' be web support
<derek> just not today
<derek> er there is web support today
<dcmwai> todya?
<derek> there is not html support today but there will be
<dcmwai> today...
<dcmwai> there will be...
<derek> well technically with ssh tunnel to the database
<dcmwai> HAR...
<derek> you can run forms over the internet to a backend
<derek> not HAR
<derek> i do it all the time
<derek> it's not my fault the world equates 'web' with HTML
<dcmwai> I do it as well.. but
<wtg> and how will that work ? ... will forms run a mini server to dish the forms out ... or some other way ?
<derek> you use a broswer i use a forms client
<derek> but anyhow
<derek> same way webservices now have to be .NET
<dcmwai> ?
<derek> but things like CDDB has existed for years
<derek> and last i checked it was a 'web service' to me :)
<dcmwai> it is a CGI services :)
<wtg> whhooo ... you guys have lost me ... isn't the idea of forms to run on multiple platforms/gui environments from the same *.gfd files ?
<dcmwai> Yes it should and it will
<wtg> how am i going to be able to view a *.gfd file through a browser ? wouldn't there need to be a web server runing some where ?
<dcmwai> that I'm thinking...
<wtg> or will forms just parse the *gfd file and convert it to a *.html file to put on an apache server ?
<dcmwai> an AppServer will ease the design jobs but will effect the AppServ Performanc
<dcmwai> wtg: can't really do that..
<dcmwai> s/effect/affect
<Sacha> wtg: going back to europe at the end of this year
<wtg> i see Sacha ... so your not australian ?
<Sacha> wtg nope.

<Sacha> wtg are you from the east coast?
<wtg> yes
<Sacha> wtg yes i like it here
<Sacha> no way! which city?
<wtg> haven't been to Perth but i will one day

<wtg> my best mate i go to uni with is a kiwi ... so that sort of entitles me to put crap on them =)

<siesel> hi wtg
<siesel> wtg: /me read in the backlog, that you talked about how a .gfd file could be displayed in a browser
tripz__ (~ville@as13-5-6.ld.bonet.se) left irc: "using sirc version 2.211+KSIRC/1.2.4"
<siesel> Using Javascript this is no problem, there is already a forms client written in javascript working together with appserver to access the database
flax07 (~flax07@81.5.147.130) left irc: Read error: 54 (Connection reset by peer)
<dcmwai> siesel: So that is possible How should the server be configured? (apache and appserv)
flax07 (~flax07@81.5.147.130) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> the comunication between appserver and the forms client in the webbrowser is using XMLRPC, which can just connect to the same host/port where the web page was downloaded, so there are two possible configurations:
<siesel> 1. load forms client + gfd's from apache and connect to appserver via xmlrpc proxy
<siesel> 2. load forms client + gfd's directly from appserver
ra3vat (~ds@ics.elcom.ru) got netsplit.
ra3vat (~ds@ics.elcom.ru) returned to #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> wb ra3vat :)
<siesel> dcmwai: the last version of the javascript forms client can be found at www.gnuenterprise.org/~jan/jsclient/, at the moment the gfd parser is broken, but it is possible to pre-generate webpages with gnue-designer, which include the jsclient code
<siesel> its fully compatible to the standart forms client, except, that its missing dropdowns, date/time masks and multiple row support
<siesel> cf. your idea (backlog) about using appserver as an "possible" backend for database access, there is an php client for appserver which just needs to be updated to the newest Appserver API
<siesel> last but not least, ?????? 
<dcmwai> Oh that is real good options
<dcmwai> about the communication I would like the 1 way. It make the Configuration More Extensible but more difficult.
<dcmwai> But something I'm not sure, How is the DB communicating?
<dcmwai> Anyway, I'm going home :) And going offline now. Will be here at 00:00 (GMT+8)
<dcmwai> See you soon siesel
<siesel> the javascript client sends login/create cursor/fetch dataset etc requests to appserver...
<siesel> cu
<dcmwai> siesel: so Javascript and appserver is as a bridge to the DB...
<siesel> yep.
Action: dcmwai still here ... because of siesel
<dcmwai> siesel: Will that make the appserver performance drop? (If say I've 30 user :)
<siesel> you mean switching between configuration 1 and 2. ?
<siesel> or communication via XMLRPC
<dcmwai> siesel: Will you be here 5 hours after now?
<dcmwai> comminucation vis XMLRPC
<siesel> yes, I can be here
<dcmwai> Then please be here :) Thank You
<dcmwai> I really have to go now ;)

<revDeke> item 1 for me is are you willing to assign copyright to FSF on all future works?
<jafgon> im game for that
<revDeke> item 2 is are you willing to break all NOLA compatiablity and dependencies
<revDeke> if the answer to 1 and 2 are yes thats half the battle in working together :)
<jafgon> item 2 is a little tricky :)
<dcmwai> I'll do that and provided them a upgrade path if possible
<revDeke> dcmwai: let me phrase it this way.. .how many nola customers do you currently have that you need to upgrade?
<jafgon> i am willing to break for a better solution but not just for the sake of breaking 
<revDeke> if the answer is none, then well its silly to fixate on it
<dcmwai> I'm not sure... but from the download ... I'm thinking there are only about 10~50
<revDeke> if the answer is 1 or more, depending on the number will depend on amount of time needed 
Action: revDeke would rather see us build things right and not be 'constrainted' by legacy (that none of us are using)
<revDeke> and offer 'services' to help people upgrade
gregs_ (~greg@195.239.64.141) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dcmwai> I my self is using aria and nola in the company so either way... the upgrade path is important to me ... Just to do it manually or automatically :)
<revDeke> i.e. have the first guy wanting to upgrade maybe pay a gnue consultant to do the upgrade and have the resulting work GPL'ed for others
<revDeke> ok dcmwai then i would say you have upgrade path and if you feel strongly provide the upgrade scripts
Action: revDeke is willing to help you
<revDeke> jafgon: i think we HAVE to break it
<revDeke> their inventory, invoicing etc is WAY too print shop specific
<jafgon> that would require me to fully understand your future vision
<revDeke> the HR and Base Accounting (ledgers) we might be able to not gut too severely
<dcmwai> It is really  Bad way... to customize :(
<jafgon> in which i am wnating to do :)
<revDeke> well the gnue vision is pasted all over our website
<dcmwai> wait. their account also have a problem...
<revDeke> gnue is a framework
<revDeke> so business analysts can customize and not need programmers
<dcmwai> opening and closing isn't there and isn't possible to implement
<revDeke> think SAP or Peoplesoft instead of Quickbooks or Peachtree
<revDeke> that said SAP and Peoplesoft deliver 'base' packages
<jafgon> i will check out both solutions
<revDeke> i see gnue-sb as being a 2-tier small/medium enterprise base package
<dcmwai> ...
<revDeke> so you would get basic invoicing that works 80% of your needs
<revDeke> then a non programmer can modify forms/tables as necessary to meet the other 20%
<dcmwai> That would be good enough.
<revDeke> for the vertical industry you are in
<dcmwai> follow thr rules of 80- 20 :)
<revDeke> yes
<revDeke> also we are about keep it simple stupid for gnue-sb
<revDeke> we want something quickly
<revDeke> not something perfect
<revDeke> gnue proper (the official gnue ERP packages) are available for those wishing to over design a system
<jafgon> ok so lets assume we are on all board
<revDeke> gnue-sb belongs to get something out to meet basic needs
<jafgon> lets discuss step one
<dcmwai> Just if we have got the correct way Or the Best way of doing things it will be no problem for futher...
<dcmwai> Step one :)
<dcmwai> ... I'm waiting :)
<revDeke> ok step one ( i dont know what you had in mind) what i wsa thinking was 
<revDeke> porting all arias changes back into acclite (as its easier to patch than move directories in cvs)
<revDeke> however i slurped cvs for both last night
<revDeke> and started doing some comparision it would be a good amount of man hour work to do patching this way
<dcmwai> or ... can be do it in reverse..?
<revDeke> i wanted to talk to jcater and see what his effort was originally in moving NOLA to acclite
<revDeke> if it was under 8 hours
<dcmwai> change acclite back into arias.
<revDeke> it is probably easier to checkout arias and restructure it 
<revDeke> then check into gnue-sb cvs or some fresh cvs
<dcmwai> Yes.. that will be alot more eisier.
Action: revDeke hates sourceforge
<jafgon> i am not a big fan myself
<dcmwai> why (leave it for later session)
<jafgon> i was just bitching to chan about it
<revDeke> plus with all the directory moving its probably easier to start new cvs than fudge with the cvs directories
<dcmwai> This was my first project :)
<revDeke> but that will depend on jcater's response
<jafgon> i myself would still keep ARIA on SF
<jafgon> and offer minor supprt
<jafgon> but concentrate most efforts on this
<jcater> sorry
<jcater> was on the phone
<jcater> and had 2 people in my office
<dcmwai> waiting for you
<jafgon> lol ..... damn work
<jcater> um
<jcater> I think I spent a saturday night on the restructuring
<jcater> so it's probably not a big deal to do it again if need be
<jafgon> jcater: by restructuring you mean the directory change?
<jcater> yes
<jafgon> ok
<jcater> and mysql<->postgres changes
<revDeke> back
<dcmwai> jcater: you need the CVS right isn't?
<revDeke> dcmwai: he can get via anon cvs
<dcmwai> oh :)
<revDeke> if you still wanted to host arias on sf that is cool
<revDeke> but i see (sorry if this sounds brutal) arias dying and merging into gnue-sb
<dcmwai> I agree..
<jafgon> not not at all
<dcmwai> ? listening.
<jafgon> not all people will like the new change
<jafgon> some will still want aria
<jafgon> so for posterity i will keep it up
<revDeke> true but for how long would you want to support that?
<jafgon> its not like im being charged to do so :)
<revDeke> i would say kill the sf page, but i wouldnt expect us to make changes to both cvs trees
<jafgon> by "support" i pretty much mean answering SOS emails
<revDeke> ok i agree with that
<jafgon> of course there would be a new heading in the ARIA page about GNU-sb :)
<revDeke> i suspect it will take a little time to get gnue-sb up and usable so ARIAS still is an option until that time (another reason not to cut it off)
<jafgon> "You like ARIA ... try GNU-sb"
<jafgon> something like that
<dcmwai> I think we will make note that we are changing to gnue-sb and during the time ... let people experience gnuse on airas how about that?
<revDeke> well i would say the first effort is to restructure arias and get in gnue-sb cvs
<dcmwai> If you find that you love arias, you will love gnue-sb more :)
<revDeke> jafgon: / dcmwai you will want to login to savannah
<jafgon> so sump our code into your new hierarchy?!
<revDeke> and create accounts and upload your ssh keys
<revDeke> jafgon: yip and remove ms font dependencies
<revDeke> once that is done
<revDeke> we can pump the script into a database and use a tool (that i think jcater has already)
<revDeke> to write out a gnue schema file
<revDeke> we can do some testing that things still work
<revDeke> and create an action plan on where to go from there
<dcmwai> revDeke: Did we have any schema now? Working the best way
<revDeke> i have some product and contact stuff in gnue-sb that is working
<revDeke> i will likely revisit comparing those tables to arias and suggest changes
Action: dcmwai is too lazy to fix the inventory on arias ... and try to get gnue-sb as the replacement :)
<revDeke> but until its in a decent directory structure its impossible for me to deal with (im lazy that way)
<jcater> http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/gnue-sb-discuss/2003-03/msg00007.html
<jcater> were my notes/requirements for GL and AP
<jafgon> Rev:n what was your model for the gnu-sb dir structure??
<jcater> which is the direction GNUe-SB was going to go in
<revDeke> yes we will need incorporate those changes as well
Action: revDeke wants to start simple
<jcater> I'm not necessarily tied to that schema
<revDeke> 1. get dir structure over
Action: jbailey is away: lunch
Action: dcmwai will have alot to read...
<revDeke> 2. get schema converted to gnue schema format
<revDeke> 3. look at getting gnue-sb product stuff moved over and supported
<revDeke> 4. look at getting gnue-sb contact stuff moved over and supported
<revDeke> 5. look at getting jcater accounting spec supported
<revDeke> 3 - 5 are in no particular order
<revDeke> so who wants to volunteer to restructure the directories
<jafgon> i can do that no problem
Action: revDeke is willing but jcater might be best candidate as he has done once already
<dcmwai> product stuff and contact stuff what are they?
Action: dcmwai is busy to the inventory until he find a replacement ..
<revDeke> once that is done i can work on getting the schema converted to a gnue schema format
<revDeke> then items 3 - 5 can be addressed incrementally
<dcmwai> ETF will be one weeks more...
<dcmwai> Hey.. jafgon ... do you remember something...
<jafgon> ??
<dcmwai> arias like nola getting files information from the SQL database...
<jafgon> yes
<jcater> I did not like that
<siesel> revDeke: gnue-designer has an introspection template to create a schema and store it in a gsd. the conversion should take no more than 5 min.
<revDeke> ok im running short on time do we all have agreement (jcater)
<dcmwai> meaning that if the dir change the databse will need to change as well
<jcater> how tied to that were you guys?
<jcater> to me, that was a PITA
<revDeke> siesel: i stated that already
<jafgon> nto "tied" personally
<revDeke> but i dont fully trust it so there will be lots of testing involved
<jafgon> but the file to DB stuff offered user control access
Action: dcmwai is lost in time...
<jafgon> ok here we go
<jafgon> unless jcater wants to
<jafgon> i will restructure
<jafgon> according to the acclite standard correct?
<jcater> either way
<jafgon> ok
<jafgon> how diff is the gnu schemea then current aria?
<jcater> we started from scratch for the gnue-sb stuff
<jcater> but we aren't tied to that
<jafgon> and who will do that?
<jcater> so we can start w/the current aria
<dcmwai> I think I'll be the one ...
<jafgon> ok
<dcmwai> as all people have their jobs :)
<jafgon> am i using the acclite directory standard correct?
<jafgon> of ap,gl,admin
<jcater> that'd probably be the easiest
<jafgon> ok good
<dcmwai> Make it one way... so it will be simple and fast.
<jafgon> then i estimate to have it done over the next 48 hours
<jafgon> sooner but damn work
<dcmwai> That fast?
<jafgon> its not difficult
<jafgon> just elbow grease :)
<dcmwai> well, just touch invenroty at the last place ok :)
<jafgon> okie dokie
<dcmwai> HAHA :-D
<jafgon> rev & cater: you want me to use the ARIA code in its whole
<jafgon> or do you have bugfixes i should look at first
gregs_ (~greg@195.239.64.141) left irc: "Вышел из XChat"
<jafgon> and merge them with our code
<dcmwai> jafgon: after the directory restructure we will do a compare..... and apply the correct changes
<jafgon> sounds good enough
<jafgon> with that said i will get busy
<dcmwai> If I'm not mistaken they will not have the calander changes...
<jafgon> i thought you fixed calendar?
<dcmwai> I did... but they didn't :)
<jafgon> i see
<jafgon> i will need an account on savannah-run correct derek?
<dcmwai> and you know the calendar compare is already 100~300 line :(
<jafgon> yes
<jcater> we don't have bugfixes
<jcater> we strictly started out restructuring
<jafgon> jcater: ok that will make my job quicker
<jcater> so I think you can ignore acclite completely
<jafgon> wow this sounds like good timing :)
<revDeke> grrr people in my office
<dcmwai> then what we are doing on the dir change?
<jcater> revDeke: start farting and they'll leave
<dcmwai> s/what/why
<jcater> at least, that works for me
<jcater> erm, I mean
<jafgon> dcmwai: see the acclite tarball for example
<jcater> I think it would work...
<dcmwai> I'll
<jafgon> you sign sign up on savannah run ???
<revDeke> please hold on
<jafgon> k
<revDeke> ok so jafgon is doing the change
<revDeke> gnue schema and arias have NO difference
<revDeke> all i mean by 'convert to gnue schema'
<revDeke> is change from hard schema to XML gnue schema format so we can support multiple databases (i hate mysql)
<jafgon> i figured as micj
<jafgon> much 
<jafgon> that is good
dsmith (h0gangpdvo@oh-strongsvillecadent1-1d-165.clvhoh.adelphia.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> yes you will need savannah account as noted plesae sign up there and upload your ssh keys
<jafgon> oh .... but we will still support MySQL will we not?
<revDeke> let me know when you have that done and i will add you to gnue-sb project
<revDeke> jafgon: yes
<jafgon> ok good
<jafgon> i will sign up today
<revDeke> jafgon: you will learn gnue philosophy we support everything, even things we hate ;)
<jafgon> and get busy tonight after work
<revDeke> i.e. we support windows
<jafgon> i support windows
<jafgon> just dont use it 
<revDeke> you will stick to the acclite structure correct?
<jafgon> yes indeed
<revDeke> i think the only real change jcater made other than restructuring was removal of ms fonts
<jafgon> dcmwai: remember to create a savannah account
<dcmwai> Hey how about mac os :)
<revDeke> that will be mandatory before checking into savannah
<dcmwai> am doing :)
<revDeke> other than that arias is probably much cleaner (bug cleaning wise)
<jafgon> ok i will contact jcater with the details on that
<revDeke> and no need to do 'compares' back to acclite
<dcmwai> sure... ( I think mandatory before checkin is better) :)
<jafgon> its getting there :)
<revDeke> just steal the directory structure concept
<revDeke> and remove font dependenices and that will be good enough to check in to cvs
<jafgon> ok then with that said I will get busy
<dcmwai> jafgon: get the SQL statement also...
<jafgon> SQL statement?
<revDeke> dcmwai: no need to do that
<dcmwai> revDeke: Why?
<revDeke> dcmwai: they were minimal and postgres has changed a bit
<dcmwai> the postgresql support will be broken...
<revDeke> would rather just keep arias as is, directory structure changed and fonts removed
<dcmwai> Okok ... get it..
<revDeke> i will then use the wizards to make gnue schema definitions
<dcmwai> that is a better way
<revDeke> run them to make postgres scripts
<dcmwai> good point
<revDeke> and then do some testing
<revDeke> fixing as i find issues and committing to cvs
<jafgon> guys ...we have an install script you might want to lok at
<revDeke> i.e. i want this is cvs sooner than later :)
<revDeke> jcater: did you get my email on training classes?
<revDeke> if so how long till next gnue release (i can help)
<revDeke> and we will need to get jbailey and btami to package
<jcater> revDeke: yes, I got that
<revDeke> as i ahve now about 15 natives ready to roll
<jcater> um, honestly
<revDeke> and wanting to install and play around before first class
<jafgon> ok i will contact you all via email until next meeting
<jcater> I think designer is at one of those points that I can just stop at any given time
<jafgon> must get busy now
<revDeke> cool
<jcater> though I think I want at least another week
<revDeke> jcater: you be around tonight?
<jcater> if possible
<jcater> as I'm on a roll
<revDeke> another week works
<jcater> revDeke: I don't know
<revDeke> im on vacation next week
<jafgon> ciao all. looking forward to progress
<jcater> I'm in the middle of remodeling our 9,500 sqft
<dcmwai> jafgon: So luckly you can have classes :)
<revDeke> so wont be doing training until at least the first part of july
<jcater> getting ready to move my business in
<revDeke> understand
<jcater> I'll try to be
<revDeke> speaking of which i need to run
<jcater> but won't promise

<chillywilly> gee, I wonder why it si disabled...
<chillywilly> s/si/is/
Action: wtg hides round under nearest table .... to much hostility in the air =)
<jbailey> chillywilly: Because perhaps the xchat authors have a different oppinion than I?

<siesel_> hey, jcater, you're commited while I wrote the changelog message
Action: siesel_ won't write long changelogs anymore ;)
<jcater> sorry
Action: jcater shouldn't be in forms/ any more today
<siesel_> no prob.
<jcater> more designer goodness is in store for today
<siesel_> btw. have you already defined a key shortcut for switching between different widgets?
<jcater> ?
Action: siesel_ searched for a while until I found out that ALT+Cursor resizes a widget
<jcater> ah
<jcater> no
<jcater> right now you have to go to the property editor
<jcater> I haven't given that much more thought
<siesel_> what about just use TAB to switch between widgets?
<jcater> oh, I see what you mean
<jcater> I thought you meant a shortcut to change from entry to combo box, or combo box to check box
<jcater> but that's not what you mean
<jcater> yeah, tab makes sense
<jcater> I'll add to my outstanding TODO list
<siesel_> ok.
<siesel_> what about deactivate CTRL + Cursor ?
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I didn't even know Ctrl+cursor worked
<siesel_> Its quite confusing if just CURSOR, CURSOR+SHIFT and CTRL + Cursor does all the same
<jcater> I'll change
<jcater> anything else?
<siesel_> hmmm
<jcater> (my list seems to grow faster than it shrinks :)
<siesel_> seems like thats it
<siesel_> for now ;)
<siesel_> but if you don't mind, i can commit that CURSOR+X stuff
<jcater> have you already done it?

<jcater> I've seen this before
<jcater> MetaDown() doesn't do what you think

<TheDru|D> how it works (shortly) ?
<siesel_> there is a main forms programm and uidriver for wxwindows, win32, gtk2, qt, curses..
<TheDru|D> client under win32 gets XML from database and generate window ?
<siesel_> at the moment it loads XML from file or web or X and connects to the database to get/change data
<ra3vat> TheDru|D: not db but file
<TheDru|D> it mean i need store predesigned forms on local disk?
<TheDru|D> or i can take forms from ftp or over http?
<siesel_> yes.
<siesel_> but ftp/http etc work too.
<siesel_> f.e. gnue-forms http://gnue.org/my_super_form.gfd
<TheDru|D> no such link http://gnue.org/my_super_form.gfd
<TheDru|D> ok
<TheDru|D> www.gnue.org :))
<TheDru|D> Not Found! HTTP Error 404
<TheDru|D> http://www.gnu.org/my_super_form.gfd
<TheDru|D> ??
<siesel_> sorry, just a stupid example :(

<TheDru|D> hmm.. can i construct form with filter...
<TheDru|D> like "all people with name like A...." ?
<siesel_> yes, you can add that to the form itself (with <Conditions> ..</Conditions>) 
<siesel_> but you can do simple querys by just writing 'A%' into one field before you execute a query

<TheDru|D> hmm.. be cool if in future we can write SQL syntax and view result..

<siesel_> hi jamest
<jamest> hi
<TheDru|D> guys.. can i add some function by action ? (press button) ?
<ra3vat> TheDru|D: sure
<siesel_> there are trigger for everything: focus in, focus out, ...
<TheDru|D> nice.. in what lang ? php? perl? c/cpp ?
<TheDru|D> wau!
<ra3vat> python
<siesel_> python, but new languages can be _easily_ added
<TheDru|D> good..
<TheDru|D> i don't know python...
<TheDru|D> and prefer C/CPP or Perl..
<jcater> I'm sure perl support will be one of the first additional languages added
reinhard (~reinhard@M1259P028.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: "The chance of forgetting something is directly proportional to ... to ... aehm ..."
<jcater> but I don't think C/CPP would be a good fit for scripting events
<jcater> but I imagine it'll be only python for the foreseeable future
<jcater> (just because resources are being put into other parts of the system and not extra language support)
<TheDru|D> :) ok.. you right.. C/CPP is not optimal for scripting
<TheDru|D> maybe PHP.. PHP have many useful features and interfaces...
<jcater> I imagine scheme will be the first implemented, followed by perl et al
<TheDru|D> can prel return value from Function() ?
<TheDru|D> how much people write this project ?

<siesel_> jamest: you there?
<chillywilly> siesel_: 
<chillywilly> with a tail
Action: chillywilly pulls on siesel_
<chillywilly> siesel_'s tail
<chillywilly> yoink!
<siesel_> uhh, oink
Nick change: siesel_ -> siesel
<chillywilly> oh crap it came off ;)
<siesel> lol
<ra3vat> siesel: have you tried btami's win32 driver?
<siesel> yes, but some time ago.
<siesel> If I remember right it doesn't support unicode
<ra3vat> what should one do with:
<ra3vat> cvs server: [19:07:07] waiting for anoncvs's lock in /cvsroot/gnue/gnue/integrator/doc
<ra3vat> ?
<siesel> seems like somebody is trying to fetch that file.
<siesel> I get the same error message since yesterday.
<siesel> you can just press Ctrl-C, and still get the newest version of forms,common,designer
<ra3vat> seems i find workaround with my i18n issue
<TheDru|D> good luck

<ra3vat> is i use simpleQuery to select some data recode to windows encoding works
<ra3vat> if i use F8-F9 it does not
<ra3vat> too late to dig for it now
<ra3vat> or too early..
<siesel> I've prepared some patches to switch gnue to use unicode internaly
<siesel> I'll commit that after the next release, i.e. in 2-3 weeks
<siesel> that could fix that problem
<ra3vat> will you convert your db data to unicode too?
<siesel> I allways have used unicode as db encoding, but that doesn't matter, as it should be possible to define a database encoding AND a forms output/input encoding
<siesel> besides the postgresql client encoding f.e.
<ra3vat> what's wrong with postgresql?
<siesel> nothing, but it should be possible to define f.e. postgresql client encoding to iso8859-1 and database input encoding to utf-8 in case you have populated you datasource in the wrong encoding

<siesel> Jason: I've written a new widget type to display any datatype through OLE/Bonobo etc.
<siesel> I thought of naming it GFComponent, do you have any better ideas?
