<aRJAy> ello
<aRJAy> anyone around?
<Mr_You> hi
<aRJAy> :-)
<aRJAy> I have just been to the web site: www.gnuenterprise.org
<aRJAy> was doing a search on CRM software
<aRJAy> are you familiar with this aspect ?
<Mr_You> do you have a question?
<aRJAy> sure
<Mr_You> I'm tired, won't be here too much longer.
<aRJAy> is there a stand-alone CRM package that can be viewed on the website ?
<aRJAy> ok
<aRJAy> I am looking for this type of application to suit our needs
<Mr_You> GNUe is in alpha or beta stages depending on which tool you are using
<aRJAy> IC
<Mr_You> but it is in production use 
<aRJAy> well.. it comes up well in the search engines :)
<aRJAy> ok..
<Mr_You> there are no real complete packages yet.. 
<aRJAy> is there a site where I am able to view the interface ?
<aRJAy> k
<Mr_You> you would need to create your own, which is what most businesses do anyways
<aRJAy> ah ha
<aRJAy> hm.. that was not what I was counting on really..
<Mr_You> yes there are screen shots
<aRJAy> was looking for a generic set up
<Mr_You> if you are looking for complete packages it may take a while for GNUe to do that.. but the purpose of GNUe is to make applications very easily.. the designer interface is easy to use
<aRJAy> is there a working version that can be viewed, or do I need to download it and install ?
<Mr_You> and if you like you can contribute your CRM package back to GNUe if approved ;-)
<aRJAy> ok.. let's make this easy on you... I'm a windows user, and definately not a programmer at all..
<aRJAy> k
<Mr_You> well, you can install GNUe and run sample apps.. but they are not useful apps really
<aRJAy> hmm.. was looking for something that was readily made up..
<aRJAy> k
<Mr_You> actually DCL is very useful
<aRJAy> I appreciate the feedback..
<Mr_You> check out DCL for something to actually use at the moment..
<aRJAy> have you heard of OPT ?
<Mr_You> no
<aRJAy> well.. that's another package that is very useful for business applications...
<Mr_You> you can easily edit some variables in DCL so that it presents data in words other than trouble-ticket-like based.. but it depends on what type of CRM software you need..
<aRJAy> I will get the URL for you..
<aRJAy> preferably something that integrates with MS Outlook..
<Mr_You> you want CRM for internal tracking purposes or do you want CRM for customer access to internal data?
<aRJAy> contact management system
<aRJAy> both
<Mr_You> well DCL can handle internal tracking.. with remote customers submitting tickets/work orders.. 
<aRJAy> I can tell you that I speak on behalf of a number of people in small business who use MS Outlook.. something that integrates nicely with it would be superb :)
<aRJAy> ok
<aRJAy> is that still beta ? or?
<Mr_You> the rest of GNUe can accomplish the latter, but its custom to any company.
<Mr_You> DCL is production quality, very good tool
<Mr_You> its on the website
<Mr_You> its a part of GNUe
<Mr_You> customer accessible web forms client is alpha or beta, I'm planning to try it out soon for that purpose
<Mr_You> its written in php
<aRJAy> ok.. we are set up for PHP.. that's a good start :)
<Mr_You> you could try that.. if it works, it should be the easiest way to create apps
<aRJAy> I'm looking for the URL for you..
<Mr_You> all you do is create an XML file with the designer and make sure the db has all the tables correctly..
<aRJAy> it's really quite an interesting package for project management
<Mr_You> well I prefer Free Software
<aRJAy> http://sourceforge.net/projects/outreach
<aRJAy> you and I are the same then :)
<aRJAy> are you one of the developers ?
<Mr_You> no
<aRJAy> nice package.. even for a beta :)
<aRJAy> (talking of outreach)
<Mr_You> hmm would like to see whats it like, but their website is down.. feature wise it seems very similar to DCL
<aRJAy> ok
<Mr_You> working now
<Mr_You> dcl.sf.net I think
<aRJAy> well.. I have looked around for some time for different appz.. came across Outreach, and it was by far the most advanced that I'd seen
<aRJAy> k
<aRJAy> looking at that URL you gave me..
<Mr_You> I also prefer postgresql over mysql
<aRJAy> we're on MySql
<aRJAy> hmm.. cannot seem to log into that demo site..
<aRJAy> do you have an instance of that s/w running ?
<Mr_You> trying to remember this other package
<Mr_You> yes
<aRJAy> are you able to grant me guest access, or?
<aRJAy> I'll understand if you say no :)
<aRJAy> just interested in having a look at it
<Mr_You> http://keystone.whitepj.net/
<Mr_You> keystone is Free* not Free Software
<Mr_You> no sorry
<aRJAy> hmm.. forget it then :)  We don't have the money for buying more s/w right now :(
<aRJAy> just bought Ensim WEBpplication
<Mr_You> the DCL demo works fine for me
<aRJAy> hmm.. not for me 
<Mr_You> I just used support/support
<aRJAy> nope.. I tried all of them... Invalid username and password
<aRJAy> pfft
<aRJAy>  :)
<aRJAy> very odd really
<aRJAy> anyway...by the looks of the screenshots, the OPT is a lot more developed... and has a lot more features..
<Mr_You> you have caps on?
<Mr_You> caps lock

<Arturas> Hello
<Mr_You> hi
<Mr_You> yeah its working fine
<aRJAy> nope.. no caps on.. thats for sure
<Mr_You> maybe cookies?

<aRJAy> I'll try a different browswer perhaps..
<Mr_You> hi
<aRJAy> hmm.. could be cookies. but dont think so
<aRJAy> ra3vat: hi
<ra3vat> aRJAy: there is binary build of gnue tools for win32 you can easily get working in a minutes
<aRJAy> ra3vat: thanks... I might have a d/l and play.. as I explained though, I'm no developer :|
<aRJAy> phark... even tried with a different browser.. not working
<Arturas> what is not working?
Action: aRJAy notices a typo... <aRJAy> I'll try a different browswer perhaps..
<aRJAy> BROWSWER! ?
<aRJAy> heh
<aRJAy> what the..?
<aRJAy> Arturas: nope.. still not working
<Arturas> aRJAy: WHAT is still not working?? :)
<aRJAy> Arturas: I was talkigng with Mr_You about a site that we're looking at.. dcl.sourceforge.net/dcl
<aRJAy> cannot manage to get into the demo area
<Arturas> i can see login screen
<Arturas> but can't get further (don't have login there :)

<ajmitch> hi jamest
<jamest> hello again
<Arturas> good morning jamest :)
<jamest> i almost dont believe it
<jamest> but I think I'm going to get to GNUe again
<ajmitch> ooh?
<psu> i thought appserver was the oo-bit? ;-)
<jamest> :)
<ajmitch> hmm has there been a week in the last 6 months where i'm not quoted in KC?
Action: ajmitch is spending too much time in here
<jamest> you should get out more
<jamest> spend some time with the sheep
<jamest> er, family
<psu> bah!
<Arturas> :)
<jamest> or you'll end up like psu and write summaries all the time
<jamest> poor guy
<ajmitch> nah
<jamest> i guess that is a bit extreme
<ajmitch> can you imagine me doing something useful?
<jamest> oooo, good point
<jamest> i'm in the same boat
<jamest> i don't recall the last commit I made
<ajmitch> you've done a lot more than i have

<psu> jamest 18 July, according to commit-gnue
<jamest> wow
<jamest> that recent
Action: ajmitch never :)
<jamest> musta been one of my other personalities
<psu> probably jamest_ or even jamest__
<psu> ajmitch: I think your gadfly driver counts ;-)
<psu> has that been commited yet?
<ajmitch> psu: nah, that's a piece of crap
<ajmitch> yeah it's committed
<jamest> isn't that part of our coding standards though?
<ajmitch> jamest: it's non-functional with forms, due to gadfly being a POS still :)
Action: psu even got a code commit this week 
<jamest> whoa
<jamest> i've been gone too long
<ajmitch> i haven't worked around it in the driver or in gadfly
<ajmitch> psu: you?
<psu> well, sorta. jcater did the actuall commit, and his code was much better 
<ajmitch> nice
<psu> than what I wrote originally
<psu> nothing earth-shattering, just doing the tech notes indexes as .html as well as .txt
<ajmitch> yeah, i see
<psu> so I can rip #em off for the website
<ajmitch> gnue has been quite for a few days
Remosi (dahoose@port-62-131.jet.net.nz) returned to #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> main committers lately have been jcater & siesel
<psu> and arturas
<ajmitch> and arturas
Action: ajmitch was getting to it :)
<Arturas> if we are talking about commits - how long does it usually take up for the patch, sent through info@gnue.org to appear in source?
Action: Arturas is eager to see the biggest change in GNUe :)
<jamest> lol
<jamest> with ash down I get NO mail from gnuenterprise anymore
<psu> Arturas: remember that the @gnue.org addresses are'nt delivering at the moment
<jamest> and jcater is swamped with that real life
<Arturas> hrrrrrrrrr
<jamest> hopefully real soon
<psu> if you sent it recently,  I would re-send to jamest and jason 
<jamest> i have my kids this weekend but will be GNUe'n as time allows
<psu> at their "real" e-mail addresses
<Arturas> sent sometime this week :/
<jamest> jamest@math.ksu.edu is your best bet for me 
<Arturas> about 3 days ago
<Arturas> or more
<jamest> ash has been off line since the 1st IIRC
<jamest> what did the patch do?
<Arturas> GFDisplayHandler.py file
<Arturas> completely rewrited class
<Arturas> responsible for handling dates
<Arturas> dates should be i18n'ed
<Arturas> or maybe i can simply commit to cvs? this is a big change, but it's form specific and it works (at least for me :)
<jamest> i'm really not one to say on that
<jamest> as i have no idea what's going on in displayhandler
<jamest> can you send it to jamest@math.ksu.edu
<Arturas> ok, thank you
<jamest> i'm thinking the only thing we should do before you commit it is run it past jcater as he's "da man" in the display handler section
<Arturas> would you like me to send as cvs diff
<Arturas> or include whole changed file?
<jamest> whole file is fine w/ me
<Arturas> ok

<wokan> In the install FAQ, 3.4 - 3.8 are all listed as (todo)
<Mr_You> yes
<Mr_You> mainly its just a script you run that installs everything
<wokan> Thanks.  Didn't want to waste time d/l'ing if it was going to be a guessing game.
<wokan> What about configuring a postgresql database for gnue to work with?  Are those instructions in common?
<Mr_You> well
<Mr_You> I'm not sure what you mean.
<Mr_You> Postgresql has its own setup/configure docs
<Mr_You> the files to connect to pgsql are in common and common/doc/Connections.txt

<ra3vat> aRJAy: if wxPython works there - gnue should also do
<aRJAy> ra3vat: not sure what wxPython is
<ra3vat> it is something gnue gui driver is based on
<aRJAy> oic
<aRJAy> and needs to be installed prior to running anything?
<ra3vat> binary build for win32 includes everything needed
<aRJAy> well... it was looking for phthon something in C:\
<aRJAy> didn't find it..
<aRJAy> I think that was with the forms program
<ra3vat> have you got problem with binary build?
<aRJAy> could be
<aRJAy> not too sure..
<aRJAy> If I load something and it doesn't work straight away, I uninstall and delete it
<aRJAy> :)
<ra3vat> separate forms package have some prerequisites, binary build does not
<aRJAy> ahh
<aRJAy> it all looks a little hard for me... to tell you the truth
<ra3vat> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/forms/GNUe-Forms-0.1.1.exe - have you being installed this?
<aRJAy> yes
<aRJAy> tried that./.
<aRJAy> that's the file I had problems with
<ra3vat> hm, can't test it right now
<aRJAy> no probs
<aRJAy> it can wait
<dneighbo_> a couple of things if you philosophy is install and doesnt work straight away GNUe will probably never be for you
<dneighbo_> just like SAP or such wouldnt be
<dneighbo_> i.e. its more complex than a desktop app
<dneighbo_> i.e. even if it installs fine you have to do some config to get it to see your database/appserver and such
<aRJAy> dneighbo: I think that you may infact be right..
<dneighbo_> but certainly a 0.3.0 release is not going to be smooth sailing :)
<aRJAy> dneighbo: I'm no programmer at all
<dneighbo_> if you are willing to work a little im sure we could quickly get it working for you on XP
<dneighbo_> but you would have to be willing to leave it installed and do a little trouble shooting :)
<aRJAy> It looks all well and good, but time is of the essence really.. and I don't have much of it :)
<dneighbo_> sounds to me like the python pathing is hosed up, XP probably did away with DOS stuff heavily so there is probably alternative way to do pathing of sorts?
<aRJAy> could be so..
<aRJAy> still has a semi-dos base in it.. 
<aRJAy> a dummy shell if you like

<jcater> ya
<dneighbo_> jcater: i think imap is great but i think its horse crap too
<dneighbo_> i am trying to prep laptop to leave
<dneighbo_> and so installed evolution (figured i would give it a chance w/ imap mail) as slypheed is irrating me with IMAP
<dneighbo_> couldnt figure out how to get it to see my folders
<dneighbo_> then i thought wait these guys (ximian) do things the m$ way
<dneighbo_> so i shut down the app and restarted it 
<dneighbo_> and VOILA they appeared
<dneighbo_> here is my gripe
<dneighbo_> if i 'pull myself offline' i have no access to my imap stuff
<dneighbo_> that KILLS a mobile user
<dneighbo_> i suspected (for better or worse) that it was caching that crap locally so if disconnect
<dneighbo_> i couldnt 'rescan' the folders and such
<dneighbo_> but at least i would have access to what was there
<dneighbo_> so my thought of downloading lots of mail and 'catching up' in the car is about shot :(
<dneighbo_> hmmm another shutdown and restart fixed it
<dneighbo_> i think evolution just is well not production yet ;)

<ajmitch>  <johnnyb> Does anyone here know much about the NOLA port to GNUe?
<ajmitch> that was 5min ago, you've still got time to answer :)
<dneighbo> im here im here
<dneighbo> johnnyb: you still her
<dneighbo> er here
<johnnyb> sorry, yeah I'm here, just got distracted reading about the IE/SSL thing
<johnnyb> Surfing and chatting can be dangerous
<dneighbo> :)
<johnnyb> So, are you working on the NOLA port to GNUe?
<johnnyb> dneighbo: are you working on NOLA?
<ajmitch> he is
Action: ajmitch pokes dneighbo awake
<dneighbo> yes working
<johnnyb> Is there anything functioning out of it yet?
<dneighbo> a few things
<johnnyb> Even if it's in an amorphous state?
<dneighbo> basically to start we cleaned up the code (directory structure and such) and fixed some no nos
<dneighbo> (jcater did this)
<dneighbo> then converted schema to postgres so didnt have to use mysql
<dneighbo> and have started to test those changes
<johnnyb> I'm really interested in NOLA running on PostgreSQL, and also somewhat interested in GNUe, although I don't know a lot about it yet.
<dneighbo> micahy was/is working on basically making gnue screens for the backend
<dneighbo> some of the account management stuff has screens
<johnnyb> Is NOLA going to run off of GEAS?
<dneighbo> if you want working postgres NOLA you can get it from our acclite (our nola cvs for now until we merge back our changes)
<dneighbo> eventually yes it would run off of GEAS though its not scheduled for our first round of 'goals'
<johnnyb> Sounds exciting.  Is there a mailing list for this, specifically?
<dneighbo> nope
<dneighbo> we really dont want a fork at this point
<dneighbo> but NOLA hasnt adopted it so its 'limbo' for now
<johnnyb> It seems you already have one :)
<dneighbo> if we do a list and such it looks like we are brute forking it
<johnnyb> I see.
<dneighbo> johnnyb: well we had to do some RADICAL changes
<johnnyb> Of course, I'm one to like forks.
<johnnyb> But I'm odd that way.
<dneighbo> and more than one person was doing them so we needed it in cvs
<dneighbo> and until its tested and such they wont readily just accept a patch
<dneighbo> quite frankly its likely it will be fork as they may choose to not accept it
<dneighbo> though they seemed interested so we arent ruling it out
<dneighbo> **** NOTE TO ARTURAS *****
<johnnyb> Do you know if NOLA is appropriate for use in the U.S.?  Does it follow the U.S.'s accounting regulations?
<dneighbo> I would just like to inform that we now have some
<dneighbo> first functional Unicode support for wxGTK in CVS.
<dneighbo> You will need GTK 2.0 from www.gtk.org and some
<dneighbo> recent version of FreeType from www.freetype.org.
<dneighbo> Actually, I have not been able to setup freetype
<dneighbo> correctly myself so that printing still doesn't
<dneighbo> really work, but it compiles... In order to compile
<dneighbo> you need to "configure --enable-gtk2 --enable-unicode".
<dneighbo> You may expect compilation problems on systems other
<dneighbo> than my Linux glibc 2.2 system (and you need to
<dneighbo> add a link flag to -lpangoft2-1.0 to you linker)
<dneighbo> Any testing is welcome.
<dneighbo> *** END NOTE ARTURAS *****
<dneighbo> yes its US based so follows US accounting practices
<johnnyb> Excellent!  I'm starting work for a friend who does custom computer work, and I have blown him away so far with what Free software can do
<johnnyb> So we're working on a full GNU-based terminal product for use in small businesses
<johnnyb> An accounting package seemed a necessity, but I really hate MySQL
<johnnyb> Does anyone know which doc has the GNUe database schema docs?
<johnnyb> Later, yalls

<Mr_You> re

<Mr_You> one thing I like about opensource.. the authors stand by their software for life.. for the most part
<Mr_You> I think some commercial packages can become so buggy just from employee turn over
<Mr_You> Legato and M$ for example.. atleast in the past
<psu> and if open source authors *do* drop a package, they tend to formally abandon it
<psu> which means 
<psu> a) you know it's "use at your own risk"
<psu> b) someone else can step fwd
<Mr_You> well to be fair, commercial packages have their own support life cycles..
<Mr_You> its just cool to be able to msg the author of software written in 1997 or earlier even if I get an answer of "I don't know."  ;-)
<psu> or "gee, you mean people are still using that quick hack I wrote" ;-)
<Mr_You> hehe, actually this is freebsd sysinstall (installer) and Mr. FreeBSD himself Jordan Hubbard ;-)
<Mr_You> he's a long time #unix/efnet regular as myself, he now has a cushy job at apple 
<Mr_You> I guess you could say Jordan is to FreeBSD as Linus is to Linux.
<Mr_You> to some extent..
<Mr_You> but doesnt make you comment any less true..
<Mr_You> hehe
<psu> FreeBSD != quick hack
<Mr_You> man it is super hot today.. heat index could get up near 105 today
<ajmitch> linux == quick hack :)

<sklein> well, if you are monitoring the IRC (and it looks like you might be) -- jcater emailed me that you might be interested in being a co-presenter at the event in DC (see kernel cousin for details)
<Mr_You> heh
<sklein> I can't find your email address.  Send me an email and I will send you my draft for the demo abstract.  I will need a bio and/or resume
<Mr_You> does co-presenter mean getting on stage?
<sklein> yes
<sklein> it could
<Mr_You> I qualify for that? hehe
<sklein> the presentation is a gnue demo
<Mr_You> oh I thought they were going to be held at booths
<Mr_You> I thought the stage was for speakers
<Mr_You> sure I'll help demo GNUe
<Mr_You> whatever you need.. I'll make an effort.
<sklein> They are having a set of "plenary sessions" of 90 minutes each with 4 speakers/demos to a session
<sklein> I understand derek is doing a demo for LinuxWorld
<Mr_You> ok, I misunderstood.. I thought it was going to be speakers talking about philiosophy and solutions, etc.. and the booths for demos
<sklein> We can do the same demo (or an improved version of it
<nickr> sklein: are you saying derek's presentation would be less than perfect?
<Mr_You> msged my email
<sklein> no, that by October it could get better
<Mr_You> I'm expecting by then I'll have my first completed install, dunno how functional it will be but should be ok
<sklein> Mr_You:  got your address.
<sklein> I have gnue running (per cvs) on my laptop
<Mr_You> I need web forms more than anything
<dneighbo> sklein: i have guy i want you to meet in DC
<Mr_You> so I might hack on php web forms client if I see I can
<sklein> dneighbo:  who
<dneighbo> can you email me your email address to derek@gnue.org so i can formally introduce you via email
<sklein> dneighbo:  you can get my email address off my recent email to you

<sklein> unless you delete them
<Mr_You> wonder if it will pass tho
<dneighbo> i think i can

<dneighbo> he is part of the OSXP

<sklein> the what?
<Mr_You> I gotta jump in the shower bbiab
<dneighbo> Open Source eXtrasomething Projects or seomthing
<dneighbo> basically an agency that pushes open source in govt
<sklein> sounds good

<dtm> http://appgen.com and http://mybooks.com   They make java-and-sql-based accounting software for small business to enterprise.  Allegedly a drop in replacement for Quickbooks, scaling up to sub-ERP levels.
<dtm> it would be neat to interoperate with them.  they're big on linux and macos.
<lupo_> free?
<dtm> not free.  they give their entire src to VARs and such though once you pay a membership fee.  it's all proportionately very affordable.
<dtm> it's ridiculously cheaper and better than any other common counterpart, like quickbooks
<dtm> it even runs on os/2 and freebsd!  hee hee
<dtm> well i like talking with their lovely sales/marketing people anyway.
<lupo_> what is os/2? *eg*
<dtm> tee hee
<lupo_> you like the sales chicks
<dtm> os/2 is a java platform :)
<dtm> lupo_: i confess!
Action: chillywilly whistles innocently
<dtm> i've introduced gnue to some enterprise developers and they've remarked that at a glance, it looks like it wants to redevelop j2ee in python.  is that in any way accurate?
<dtm> i'm just learning the overview of the java universe now, due to a client.  but i have enhanced that client's commitment to open source everything we develop.
<lupo_> gnue is j2ee done right, hehe
<lupo_> seriously, gnue lacks the "streamlinedness" at the moment
<chillywilly> I guess one culd say that, however if j2ee were Free then possibly we wouldn't be doing what we're doing
<dtm> that's true
<lupo_> and the completeness :)
<dtm> well how far is it from being Free?  basically would Sun have to totally change its behavior or its licensing or both or what/
<dtm> ?
<dtm> i wanna make sure i understand the FSF-style idealism behind it because i am gonna hafta interact with java due to it being a proven enterprise technology.
<chillywilly> I don't think any of the core Java stuff is licensed under a Free/Open license
<lupo_> i think that even if j2ee was free, there would still be a reason to develop gnue. (hint: java)
<lupo_> nothing Free in FSF sense in Java
<dtm> i want to balance the ideal with the practical here, and so far it sounds like i must maintain a dual standard... and to possibly have the two frameworks interoperate via messaging or sql or something.
<lupo_> Sun hasn't understood Free Software or even Open Source.
<dtm> either that or get clients to scrap all infrastructure or tools based on java  :/  not happening.
<chillywilly> not everyone likes Java either...I don't think it's real popular in GNUe land as a language
<dtm> my current client is using WebObjects as a RAD of sorts, for deployment on tomcat
<dtm> lupo_: yeah.. their "open src diva" understands it according to her interviews on slashdot but her hands are obviously somewhat tied.
<dtm> still i'm sure she's got a cool job :)
<lupo_> I'd say that using the same data bases for gnue apps and other apps is step one
<chillywilly> yea, there's lots of cool Free web stuff...I just saw an article on LinuxToday of how there are lots of Free Java appservers
<dtm> if yo'ure into that sort of thing.
<lupo_> step two would be a way of communicating with gnue
<dtm> chillywilly: url plz?
<dtm> chillywilly: i can look it up
<chillywilly> sheeeit man, I'd have to go look on the site
<lupo_> jboss.org
<dtm> yeah i'm researching jboss
<chillywilly> jboss and tomcat are the 2
<dtm> that's the GPL'd reference implementation of j2ee
<chillywilly> that I remember reading about
<dtm> yeah ok
<lupo_> there are lots of people who understand it - but then there's gates, mcneilly and all these blockheads that don't get it
<chillywilly> even they can't get J2EE certified though for some reason or another
<dtm> well i'm researching content management systems (CMS) 
<lupo_> in Java?
<dtm> so basically the situation is that the community is in a race with the upstream corporate interests (Sun, IBM, etc), sometimes leading (jboss) and sometimes trailing (kaffe) and so Free java is basically an approximate art.  is that completely accurate to say/
<dtm> ?
<dtm> my understnading is that for example kaffe is GPL and is fine, but it's outdated. 
<dtm> and that jboss is state of the art and in many ways way ahead
<chillywilly> yea
<dtm> not unlike how apache is against other web servers
<dtm> or linux, etc
<lupo_> the problem is not JITs, it's the libraries 
<dtm> ok
<dtm> if you guys know of a "java for dumbasses" tutorial in terms of understanding the concepts/technology/architecture and not in terms of programming, lemme know
<dtm> so then.  is the FSF-style mentality consistantly against relying squarely on java as an underlying framework?
<chillywilly> just non-free Java
<dtm> or is it just that people like GNUe prefer not to use java as a language
<lupo_> sun wanted a platform; but they only created an interpreted bytecode-compiled programming language
<dtm> lupo_: hmm!
<chillywilly> i.e., things that there is no free equivalent
<dtm> chillywilly: mmhmm
<chillywilly> well I think we als don't like Java that much
<lupo_> both, i'd say
<chillywilly> ;)
<dtm> so....  theoretically, GNUe could be based squarely on j2ee and jboss, and the FSF wouldn't have a problem with it huh?
<lupo_> what microsoft did with .net is much more clueful than Java
<dtm> s/GNUe/something like GNUe/
<dtm> if GNUe rewrote everything in java there'd be no idealistic problem?
<dtm> in terms of intellectual property and civil rights?
<lupo_> given the current situation, yes
<chillywilly> there's no free j2ee implementation and I don't think jboss can get j2ee certified...I don't recall why probably has t do with the cost of getting j2ee blessed
<lupo_> s/yes/no/ (reading questions right helps)
<dtm> chillywilly: jboss calls itself a free j2ee implementation.  are you saying that it's not j2ee just because it's not certified?
<chillywilly> well, Sun won't certify it for some reason or another
<dtm> jboss looks like a strong community to learn from, in terms of community development
<chillywilly> I forget why
<dtm> chillywilly: ok but it essentially is j2ee, right?
<chillywilly> according to their claims
<dtm> i've heard basically of python being able to replace java in all technical sense, for a couple of years, starting with when i worked at beopen
<dtm> so that was interesting
<dtm> they were gonna deploy mad web apps that way.  client and server side.
<lupo_> python is imho a 100% java replacement, but with better quality :)
Action: chillywilly grumbles about errors
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<dtm> lupo_: mmhm
<chillywilly> gnu cc++ is kicking my arse
<dtm> lupo_: so basically, Sun still doesn't know how to let go and let God :)
<dtm> ;>
<lupo_> kick back
<lupo_> erm
<lupo_> well
<lupo_> somehow
<lupo_> yes
<lupo_> btw, java can't really meet high-capacity demands. have you ever seen a porn site using java?
<dtm> i've never been aware of what technology a porn site is using :)
<dtm> i rarely look at porn and i never buy it, so i dont really even know what's out there
<lupo_> for some people, a .jsp or .asp file ending is more important than .jpg :)
<dtm> heh
<lupo_> www.pythonporn.com :)
<lupo_> "see snake couples and spam orgies"
<lupo_> btw, are there debs for wxpython?
<chillywilly> it's in the archive

<dtm> :\
<jamest> i installed tomcat, tested the demos, setup a user account and gave it mgr status
<dtm> jamest: did you use the prepackaged tomcat distro from sun.com
<dtm> or did you install it straight from jakarta.apache.org/tomcat
<jamest> handed set account info to user needing it and said call if you have trouble
<dneighbo> um debian packages
<jamest> so it's deployed

<dneighbo> i got contact for gentoo packages as well today
<dtm> dneighbo: no, i'm afraid i dont!
<jamest> so hows the show this year?

<jamest> more/less people
<dtm> that being the entire point.
<jamest> more/less interest
<dneighbo> WAY more people
<dneighbo> similar percent interest
<jamest> you get demo's up?
<dneighbo> we have a book deal i think if we want it
<dneighbo> no demos are broken
<jamest> sigh
<dneighbo> so i show VERY cripled functionality :(
<dneighbo> but the marketing slicks are MUCH improved
<jamest> you can't even demo designer?
