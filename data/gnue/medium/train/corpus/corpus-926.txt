<MysticOne> hi :)
<MysticOne> question... what all *does* GNUe do?  Right now is it primarily just a contact database?
<MysticOne> *poke poke*
<MysticOne> hewwo?
<chillywilly> hello
<chillywilly> ERP framework
<chillywilly> we have forms client, rad designer, navigator, commmon module, etc.
<chillywilly> appserver too of course
Action: chillywilly is trying to think if he forgot something
<ajmitch> dcl, bayonne :)
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> those too
<chillywilly> dcl is a project management app that is under the gnue umbrella and bayonne is the gnu telephony server which is affiliated with gnue too
<chillywilly> als in the works is an accounting system using forms (adapted from Nola)
<chillywilly> also
<jcater> also a Rental Management app
<chillywilly> :)
<MysticOne> what about point of sale?
<chillywilly> jcater: what's the name of that ne system that said it wants to work with gnue?
<chillywilly> s/ne/one/
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> http://gibbon.sf.net?
<chillywilly> yep, that be it
<chillywilly> a TRIO program management system is also in development ;)
<jcater> MysticOne: I'm working on point of sale as we speak
<jcater> as I open up a used book store in 6 weeks
<jcater> and seeing as how I'm a core GNUe developer, I'm morally obligated to using GNUe :)
<chillywilly> well there ya go ;P
<chillywilly> this is *your* store?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> for wife to run
<jcater> that's her dream job
<ajmitch> heh, fun
<jcater> and she just got laid off from her regular job
<ajmitch> not so fun
<jcater> so I decided to create a job for her
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> :)
<ajmitch> keep her out of trouble, you mean
<jcater> most definitely :)
<MysticOne> jcater: man... I've been needing a decent point of sale ssystem where I work for so long
<MysticOne> and I'm not a coder, really,so I could'nt do a good one myself
<jcater> well, I never said it'd be decent :)
<jcater> but it'll be a start
<MysticOne> hahaha
<chillywilly> 8-)
<jcater> MysticOne: not to point you in another direction, but I looked at bananahead POS
<jcater> and it looked pretty darn feature complete
Action: jcater didn't actually test it, though
<MysticOne> well, the one we use now is closed, written in VB, and uses Microsoft Access
<chillywilly> blah
<MysticOne> bananahead?  haven't seen that before
<MysticOne> chillywilly: blah is right!
<MysticOne> hey, brb, starting dinner ...
<jcater> MysticOne: http://bananapos.com/pos/index.html
<jcater> of course, I encourage you to use us :)
<jcater> but if you are needing something immediately, there's a lead
<chillywilly> ugh
<chillywilly> my server keeps pausing and doing this
<chillywilly> ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_lostirq func only: 13
<chillywilly> hda: lost interrupt
<chillywilly> screws up the WOPN stream too

<MysticOne> jcater: hey, any idea how to built bananahead without credit card verification stuffs?  (just curious if you happened to do it before)
<jcater> nope
<jcater> I've only researched POS systems
<jcater> haven't had time to actually test them
<chillywilly> jcater: you get an 'F' then ;)
<MysticOne> hmmm...
<MysticOne> just out of curiosity
<MysticOne> is the POS system you're going to work with be PostgreSQL based?  (hopeful look)
Action: chillywilly has plenty of POS systems 8-))
<chillywilly> where POS = 'piece of sheeeit' ;-P
<jcater> MysticOne: yes

<dneighbo> thanks

<dneighbo> er line
<nickr> yep
<dneighbo> then apt-get java sdk thing
<nickr> what do I add?
<dneighbo> and restart galeon
<dneighbo> let me grab you the info
<dneighbo> btw: the support is weak
<dneighbo> most java apps my nephew used ran, but there were 'quirks'
<nickr> quirks eh?
<dneighbo> font issues or such
<nickr> I just wanna use FreedomVR, really.
<nickr> and maybe Yahoo Pool or somethin.
<nickr> give me your sources, bridgekeeper, I am not afraid.
<dneighbo> cool
<dneighbo> give me 5 minutes im trying to get better about making howto's so others can benefit
<nickr> okay
<dneighbo> my first two were nick's studly

<nickr> someone should write a QTVR-like program in Python
<dtm> nickr: whyzat in particular?
<dtm> there's a GPL QTVR-making plugin which runs concurrently in gimp and photoshop
<nickr> qtvr VIEWER
<nickr> there are no free viewers
<nickr> except horrible java programs
<nickr> in fact
<nickr> theres really no free standard for that sort of panorama
<nickr> which is really whats needed
<dneighbo> what is qtvr?
<dneighbo> nickr: did that how to work?
<nickr> well except that I have to download some zip file
<nickr> qtvr == quicktime vr
<nickr> its a panorama viewer format
<nickr> of course it doesn't say WHERE to download the zipfile from
<nickr> so I have no idea.
<dneighbo> fsck
<nickr> google gave me the hookup though
<dneighbo> i switch to evolution and its offline stuff REALLY sucks
<nickr> fix it
<dneighbo> and now i think it has hosed all my mail
<dneighbo> why o why didd i give it a 10th chance
<dneighbo> sigh
<nickr> send bug reports
<nickr> it'd be nice if there were a python plugin for browsers
<nickr> python is so much smoother than java
<dneighbo> agree
<dneighbo> hmmm killing all processes for evolution and restarting fixed it
<dneighbo> i swear i think ximian is trying to be microsoft
<nickr> you're just negative toward them as a corporation.
<nickr> 26meg zipfile
<nickr> blah
<dneighbo> yeah probably
<dneighbo> i do like them on a personal level (or most of them anyhow)
<nickr> righ
<dneighbo> and i like many of the things they are doing from a conceptual level
<dneighbo> but i think some of the stuff is 'too' microsoftesque in that unix is good because of unix philosophy m$ sucks because of m$ philosophy
<nickr> the Unix philosophy can go wrong
<nickr> although I'm coming to believe that the windows philosophy has some fundimental flaws
<dneighbo> joy all my mail was eaten by evolution
<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> had 600 mails i read on the plane and put them in various folders after reading them
<dneighbo> and evolution barfed on sync
<dneighbo> killing everything and restarting ximian solved the barfing issue
<dneighbo> but it lost all the mail in those folders
<dneighbo> at least i got to read it first
<nickr> ah, it works
<nickr> beyond getting the 21mb zip file, your instructions worked
<dneighbo> sweet
<nickr> except that of course its incredibly unstable
<nickr> you'd think they would've fixed that by now
<nickr> its like 1997 all over again
<jcater> "We're gonna party like it's 1997"

<psu> probably get 100% for option 3 ;-)

<chillywilly> well yea he's a bit busy ;)
<dtm> poor mdean
<chillywilly> why?
<chillywilly> what's up?
<chillywilly> I haven't seen him in eons
<brak> greetings...  quick question... I tried DCL a couple years ago... and after seeing the gnue booth at linux world was convinced to give it a second go as a CRM...  should CVS it?  are each of the packages independent?
<dtm> the thing is that the existing hotbed of groupware that's got all the development happening, is in the LAMP space
<dtm> brak: dcl can run independantly.  the only thing it directly cooperates with is phpgropuware/axisgroupware
<chillywilly> linux, ?, mysql, php?
<chillywilly> er, apache
<dtm> chillywilly: yeah
<chillywilly> yea, dat be it
<dneighbo> mdean just commited a dcl patch yesterday :)
<dtm> chillywilly: and there's nothing wrong with all that but it's just that the LAMP space tends to be infested with junior, "not invented here" programming demo style coders
<chillywilly> to gnue cvs?
<dneighbo> brak the tools are all in single cvs tree
<dtm> chillywilly: they wanna reinvent everything, do it their own personal way, and have it be as much about their learning curve as anything
<dneighbo> dcl, bayonne and such are in separate trees
Action: chillywilly is a not a big fan of lamp
<dtm> so they need an app building framework which is as easy as gnue
<dtm> gnue is easy at building specific kinds of apps
<chillywilly> yea, I know...guess I was thinking some gnue intergration would be in gnue tree...I dunno
<dtm> and if it was more fully web enabled (liek with a php or sashxb style presentation driver) and if it had groupware components, then someone could use it as a groupware RAD
Action: chillywilly only tracks commonc++ (which bayonne uses) anyway and has never played with dcl either
<dtm> then we add the ancillary components such as device drivers, palm sync, and external bridges to WAP or other messaging and formatting, and b3wm
<dtm> no more phpgropuware
<dneighbo> sigh evolution isnt suitable for contact management :(
<dneighbo> i decided to be good boy and enter all my contacts in evolution from LWE
<dneighbo> and i am lucky if i can enter one yet two before it dies
<brak> dtm jxta was cool
<chillywilly> btw, we got a latter today that our company bought this big Oracle CRM app called ACE
<dtm> chillywilly: yay!
<chillywilly> er, letter
<chillywilly> it has dispatching, inventory etc....although i didn't think those were CRM-related things...
<chillywilly> but what the frell do I know about CRM
<chillywilly> brb...
<chillywilly> it has some service call junk in there too
<chillywilly> I suppose CRM means different things to different orgs
Action: chillywilly seeks the guidance and wisdom of the enterprise elite
Action: chillywilly starts up a hacking on appserver
<chillywilly> damn I'm thirsty
<dtm> yay, chillywilly's hacking a groupware-enable appserver!
<dtm> does gnue have any degree of collaborative infrastructure?  or is it just a concurrently-usable multiple-individual transaction oriented infrastructure?
<chillywilly> gnue utilizes a common code base
<dtm> i'll just hafta use it and see, wont i?!??!
<dtm> that'll learn me!
<dtm> that's all part of the mystique
<chillywilly> common has the db absatraction, the rpc absatraction, and other code fr writing apps (both server and client)
<chillywilly> er, abstraction
<chillywilly> I always type and extra 'a' in there
<chillywilly> the debug system is in common
<chillywilly> the xml parser
<chillywilly> trigger stuff
<chillywilly> the connections code for linking a form up to a db
<chillywilly> the commn object model
<chillywilly> format masks
<chillywilly> lots of *stuff*
<chillywilly> appserver uses mainly the db and rpc *stuff*
Action: chillywilly wonders if they will play Babylon 5 on scifi
<chillywilly> and/or the old Star Trek
<chillywilly> bbiab
<brak> oh my, this is impressive...
lupo (~lupo@B2952.pppool.de) left irc: "using sirc version 2.211+KSIRC/1.1"
<dneighbo> ?
<dneighbo> what is impressive
<brak> dcl
<brak> so I did the cvs install of gnue
<brak> and then grabbed the dcl tarball
<brak> did I even need the gnue cvs?
<ajmitch> morning
<dneighbo> no
jamest (~jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<nickr> chillywilly: they always do, every day
<dtm> brak: dcl is standalone
<dtm> brak: and yes, it is most impressive, captain.
<brak> cool

<MicahY> anyone know when ash is coming back up???
<MicahY> anyone been working on acclite?  I can get back to it now ... was doing taxes and other crap
<dneighbo> it should be up
<dneighbo> but probably not cvs just yet
<dneighbo> i think only apache or something
<dneighbo> jamest would be one to ask
<dneighbo> it is at its new home that much i know
<dneighbo> i think jamest is just configuring goodies up on it
<MicahY> can't ping it
<MicahY> oh it DOES serve http
<MicahY> ok so you're blocking pings
<MicahY> that threw me off. :)
<MicahY> on cvs: 
<MicahY> Host key verification failed.
<MicahY> cvs [log aborted]: end of file from server (consult above messages if any)
<dneighbo> jamest: do you nkow if jcate rwill be back
<dneighbo> MicahY: yeah pings are blocked
<dneighbo> we have this cheese eating goat luving paranoid sysadmin
<MicahY> hmm I can't even ssh to it
<chillywilly> nickr: I knwo they play those shows, but not on friday
<chillywilly> apparently
<chillywilly> cause that's when we get all the new stuff ;)
<nickr> ah
<nickr> well
<chillywilly> dead zone, stargate SG-1, and farscape
<nickr> the new stuff is better anway
<chillywilly> I know, but I liked the part in babylon 5 when they interrogate what's his nuts
<chillywilly> sheridan
<nickr> Yea
<nickr> that was very well done
<nickr> the whole earth conspiracy thing for the 5th or 6th season was excellent, a very good retelling of 1984
<chillywilly> anyway, I was watching wishmaster and waiting for the rest of the good stuff to come on ;P
<chillywilly> s/the rest of//
<nickr> yow
<chillywilly> cause I am too tired to think right now, I just want to be entertained :)
<nickr> hah
<chillywilly> btw, how's the job?
<nickr> http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0292746741/qid=1029540025/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/104-2541214-1339134 this book is so appealing to me
<nickr> Excellent
<chillywilly> my sister was born in Portland, OR
<chillywilly> boycott amazon!
<chillywilly> :P
<nickr> I was able to dodge the whole VB/Windows progframming thing when they gave me carte blanc to choose my own tools on my most recent project and I was able to line up python and wxWindows for it
<nickr> MUHAHAHA
<chillywilly> :)
MicahY ([d9f8pVXH4@12-225-21-62.client.attbi.com) left irc: "[x]chat"
<chillywilly> nickr: that book just goes to show you are one weird dude
<nickr> whats really far out about it is that I find that price fairly reasonable
Action: chillywilly didn't notice it was 100 bones or so
<chillywilly> you are mental
<nickr> theres another similar one for 113
Action: chillywilly only paid that much fr engineering text books
<nickr> What I really want are reprintings of the various surviving codecies
<chillywilly> what kinda religion did Mayans have?
<nickr> polytheistic/naturalistic
<chillywilly> ok
<nickr> basically similar to the other first peoples in the americas
<nickr> I'm just really into their writing system
<chillywilly> alrighy then
<chillywilly> I have t g back to watching the boob toob
<chillywilly> stupid 'o' key
Action: chillywilly is away: scifi
<brak> k
<nickr> boob
<brak> hehehe
<brak> so I'm in the uneviable position of convicing mnagement about dcl... and they are overy concerned with customizations for this/that...
<brak> I'm guessing that we can fit our business needs into the default system...  
<brak> However, how would you proceed if you were asked to make changes to the system... i.e.  should I do tham in CVS and submit them?  Is there some ueber lord of what the Platonic form CRM should look like?
<nickr> DCL is merely a shadow of the true CRM
<brak> ahh... 
<brak> so how do we break out of the cave?
<nickr> seek ye the oracle
<brak> no!
<nickr> actually DCL is a verb
<nickr> like a burning house
<brak> I have the oracle and it has cracks despite its remedy
<nickr> well seek ye the SAP-DB, then :)
<brak> ok, so CRM was probably too strong a word....
<brak> lets say help desk/trouble ticketing tied into a hardware database
<nickr> well really it depends on what changes you want to make to DCL ..
<nickr> it seems logically, good changes would enhance it and thus be useful to everyone
<nickr> enhance = increase flexibility, generalize
<nickr> although many customizations would of course be to speficy = degenerialize
