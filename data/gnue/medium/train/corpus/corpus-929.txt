<chillywilly> als in the works is an accounting system using forms (adapted from Nola)
<chillywilly> also
<jcater> also a Rental Management app
<chillywilly> :)
<MysticOne> what about point of sale?

<jcater> and seeing as how I'm a core GNUe developer, I'm morally obligated to using GNUe :)
<chillywilly> well there ya go ;P
<chillywilly> this is *your* store?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> for wife to run
<jcater> that's her dream job
<ajmitch> heh, fun

<jcater> MysticOne: not to point you in another direction, but I looked at bananahead POS

<nickr> someone should write a QTVR-like program in Python
<dtm> nickr: whyzat in particular?
<dtm> there's a GPL QTVR-making plugin which runs concurrently in gimp and photoshop
<nickr> qtvr VIEWER
<nickr> there are no free viewers
<nickr> except horrible java programs
<nickr> in fact
<nickr> theres really no free standard for that sort of panorama
<nickr> which is really whats needed
<dneighbo> what is qtvr?
<dneighbo> nickr: did that how to work?
<nickr> well except that I have to download some zip file
<nickr> qtvr == quicktime vr
<nickr> its a panorama viewer format
<nickr> of course it doesn't say WHERE to download the zipfile from
<nickr> so I have no idea.
<dneighbo> fsck
<nickr> google gave me the hookup though
<dneighbo> i switch to evolution and its offline stuff REALLY sucks
<nickr> fix it
<dneighbo> and now i think it has hosed all my mail
<dneighbo> why o why didd i give it a 10th chance
<dneighbo> sigh
<nickr> send bug reports
<nickr> it'd be nice if there were a python plugin for browsers
<nickr> python is so much smoother than java
<dneighbo> agree
<dneighbo> hmmm killing all processes for evolution and restarting fixed it
<dneighbo> i swear i think ximian is trying to be microsoft
<nickr> you're just negative toward them as a corporation.
<nickr> 26meg zipfile
<nickr> blah
<dneighbo> yeah probably
<dneighbo> i do like them on a personal level (or most of them anyhow)
<nickr> righ
<dneighbo> and i like many of the things they are doing from a conceptual level
<dneighbo> but i think some of the stuff is 'too' microsoftesque in that unix is good because of unix philosophy m$ sucks because of m$ philosophy
<nickr> the Unix philosophy can go wrong
<nickr> although I'm coming to believe that the windows philosophy has some fundimental flaws
<dneighbo> joy all my mail was eaten by evolution
<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> had 600 mails i read on the plane and put them in various folders after reading them
<dneighbo> and evolution barfed on sync
<dneighbo> killing everything and restarting ximian solved the barfing issue
<dneighbo> but it lost all the mail in those folders
<dneighbo> at least i got to read it first
<nickr> ah, it works
<nickr> beyond getting the 21mb zip file, your instructions worked
<dneighbo> sweet
<nickr> except that of course its incredibly unstable
<nickr> you'd think they would've fixed that by now
<nickr> its like 1997 all over again
<jcater> "We're gonna party like it's 1997"
<nickr> its crazy

<lupo> hi
<psu> Should we re-introduce polls to the website?

<psu> 4. No, I never take part in on-line polls. They're lame.
<psu> 5. Only if you include a CowboyNeal option.
<jcater> 5
<psu> probably get 100% for option 3 ;-)
<lupo> 1-3 and 5

<drochaid> uhm, ok

<lupo> bad memory
<dneighbo> jamest: you around?
<dneighbo> what was that postscript form tool you had me look at a while back (long while back)
<dneighbo> basically it was similar to gnue
<dneighbo> only it took a .ps file or something
<dneighbo> and put it on a form
<dneighbo> where you could then key data in fields
<chillywilly> hi dneighbo
<dneighbo> hey chillywilly

<dtm> i'll try to host a video of it

<dtm> they're doing like 3 or 4 presentations of it along with video clips from The Matrix
<chillywilly> j/k
<dtm> HAR DE HAR

Action: dtm slaps his knee
<dtm> good one, chill0r
<dtm> fun-ay!
<dtm> hey i got free YDL cds!
<dtm> at the penguinppc.org bewth
<dtm> dneighbo: i can probably start next week on hax0ring gnue in my environment

Action: chillywilly trout slaps a sense of humor into dtm
Action: dtm absorbs the power of the trout
<dtm> soon we shall see who is the slapper.... and who is the slappee!!

<dtm> FEAR ME, TROUT.
<chillywilly> hah!

<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> eeek
<dtm> with 409!!
<chillywilly> w0000!
<dtm> dneighbo: so basically your feeling is that gnue's application framework is not appropriately generalizable toward groupware or CMS.  right?
<dtm> dneighbo: or is it that the gnue team isn't interested in doing so?
<dtm> dneighbo: what if outsiders were to be made interested?
brak (~brak@216.161.22.188) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dtm> dneighbo: are the models that drastically different between a groupware and a transactional enterprise framework?
<chillywilly> er, I thought mdean was a our groupware ma-yan
<dtm> perhaps the state of the art hasn't quite abstracted those models away yet, and we *require* mutiple parallel and interoperable frameworks
<dtm> mdean is semipermanently out to lunch!
<dtm> that sill-e mang be tending to the ranch
<chillywilly> well yea he's a bit busy ;)
<dtm> poor mdean
<chillywilly> why?
<chillywilly> what's up?
<chillywilly> I haven't seen him in eons
<brak> greetings...  quick question... I tried DCL a couple years ago... and after seeing the gnue booth at linux world was convinced to give it a second go as a CRM...  should CVS it?  are each of the packages independent?
<dtm> the thing is that the existing hotbed of groupware that's got all the development happening, is in the LAMP space
<dtm> brak: dcl can run independantly.  the only thing it directly cooperates with is phpgropuware/axisgroupware
<chillywilly> linux, ?, mysql, php?
<chillywilly> er, apache
<dtm> chillywilly: yeah
<chillywilly> yea, dat be it
<dneighbo> mdean just commited a dcl patch yesterday :)
<dtm> chillywilly: and there's nothing wrong with all that but it's just that the LAMP space tends to be infested with junior, "not invented here" programming demo style coders
<chillywilly> to gnue cvs?
<dneighbo> brak the tools are all in single cvs tree
<dtm> chillywilly: they wanna reinvent everything, do it their own personal way, and have it be as much about their learning curve as anything
<dneighbo> dcl, bayonne and such are in separate trees
Action: chillywilly is a not a big fan of lamp
<dtm> so they need an app building framework which is as easy as gnue
<dtm> gnue is easy at building specific kinds of apps
<chillywilly> yea, I know...guess I was thinking some gnue intergration would be in gnue tree...I dunno
<dtm> and if it was more fully web enabled (liek with a php or sashxb style presentation driver) and if it had groupware components, then someone could use it as a groupware RAD
Action: chillywilly only tracks commonc++ (which bayonne uses) anyway and has never played with dcl either
<dtm> then we add the ancillary components such as device drivers, palm sync, and external bridges to WAP or other messaging and formatting, and b3wm
<dtm> no more phpgropuware
<dneighbo> sigh evolution isnt suitable for contact management :(
<dneighbo> i decided to be good boy and enter all my contacts in evolution from LWE
<dneighbo> and i am lucky if i can enter one yet two before it dies
<brak> dtm jxta was cool
<chillywilly> btw, we got a latter today that our company bought this big Oracle CRM app called ACE
<dtm> chillywilly: yay!
<chillywilly> er, letter
<chillywilly> it has dispatching, inventory etc....although i didn't think those were CRM-related things...
<chillywilly> but what the frell do I know about CRM
<chillywilly> brb...
<chillywilly> it has some service call junk in there too
<chillywilly> I suppose CRM means different things to different orgs
Action: chillywilly seeks the guidance and wisdom of the enterprise elite
Action: chillywilly starts up a hacking on appserver
<chillywilly> damn I'm thirsty
<dtm> yay, chillywilly's hacking a groupware-enable appserver!
<dtm> does gnue have any degree of collaborative infrastructure?  or is it just a concurrently-usable multiple-individual transaction oriented infrastructure?
<chillywilly> gnue utilizes a common code base
<dtm> i'll just hafta use it and see, wont i?!??!
<dtm> that'll learn me!
<dtm> that's all part of the mystique
<chillywilly> common has the db absatraction, the rpc absatraction, and other code fr writing apps (both server and client)
<chillywilly> er, abstraction
<chillywilly> I always type and extra 'a' in there
<chillywilly> the debug system is in common
<chillywilly> the xml parser
<chillywilly> trigger stuff
<chillywilly> the connections code for linking a form up to a db
<chillywilly> the commn object model
<chillywilly> format masks
<chillywilly> lots of *stuff*
<chillywilly> appserver uses mainly the db and rpc *stuff*
Action: chillywilly wonders if they will play Babylon 5 on scifi

<dneighbo> jamest would be one to ask
<dneighbo> it is at its new home that much i know

<chillywilly> nickr: I knwo they play those shows, but not on friday

<nickr> Yea
<nickr> that was very well done
<nickr> the whole earth conspiracy thing for the 5th or 6th season was excellent, a very good retelling of 1984

<chillywilly> you are mental
<nickr> theres another similar one for 113
Action: chillywilly only paid that much fr engineering text books
<nickr> What I really want are reprintings of the various surviving codecies
<chillywilly> what kinda religion did Mayans have?
<nickr> polytheistic/naturalistic
<chillywilly> ok
<nickr> basically similar to the other first peoples in the americas
<nickr> I'm just really into their writing system
<chillywilly> alrighy then
<chillywilly> I have t g back to watching the boob toob
<chillywilly> stupid 'o' key
Action: chillywilly is away: scifi
<brak> k
<nickr> boob
<brak> hehehe
<brak> so I'm in the uneviable position of convicing mnagement about dcl... and they are overy concerned with customizations for this/that...
<brak> I'm guessing that we can fit our business needs into the default system...  
<brak> However, how would you proceed if you were asked to make changes to the system... i.e.  should I do tham in CVS and submit them?  Is there some ueber lord of what the Platonic form CRM should look like?
<nickr> DCL is merely a shadow of the true CRM
<brak> ahh... 
<brak> so how do we break out of the cave?
<nickr> seek ye the oracle
<brak> no!
<nickr> actually DCL is a verb
<nickr> like a burning house
<brak> I have the oracle and it has cracks despite its remedy
<nickr> well seek ye the SAP-DB, then :)
<brak> ok, so CRM was probably too strong a word....
<brak> lets say help desk/trouble ticketing tied into a hardware database
<nickr> well really it depends on what changes you want to make to DCL ..
<nickr> it seems logically, good changes would enhance it and thus be useful to everyone
<nickr> enhance = increase flexibility, generalize
<nickr> although many customizations would of course be to speficy = degenerialize

<dneighbo> http://www.pillarmusic.com/downloads/index.html
<MysticOne> pillar?
Action: MysticOne goes to check it out

<dneighbo> fireproof is pretty good the mp3 is there
<dneighbo> they are trying to get heard so i would be REALLY suprised if they didnt give ok to play their music

<ajmitch> afternoon
Action: psu is back
<psu> whilst I was sleeping
<ajmitch> welcome back psu
<ajmitch> what broke?
<psu> nope
<psu> http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/gnue20020817_42.html
<psu> went up
Action: psu can obviously do these in his sleep, now ;-)
<ajmitch> ah, another installment in the story of them goat-luvin' fools
<psu> or, more prosaically, Zack was awake and posted it
<ajmitch> gotta love that headquote :)
<ajmitch> hmm, i was going to say that i probably wouldn't be in this week's one, but it looks like i am
Action: drochaid is back (gone 07:01:56)
<psu> ok
<psu> anyone know a good tool to do thumbnails quickly
<psu> ideally as simple as foo 10% *.png
<psu> pref Debian
<psu> ?
Action: psu is looking at the Debian web site, but finds personal recomms more reliable
<drochaid> so you don't want me to say photoshop then? :)
Action: psu has used FrontPage 2000 for this in his former naughty life 
<psu> galrey, a wrapper for imagemagik seems to be it
<psu> but is not in potato, just woody
Action: psu may have to do his long-delayed upgrade
Action: drochaid has a woody
Action: drochaid thinks that came out wrong
Action: drochaid has a woody *server
Action: psu thinks that sounds even worse
<psu> wanna try again?
<drochaid> :o
<drochaid> I think I'll just give up and slink off to the corner for a bit
<psu> heh, galrey is not in woody, but the underlying imagemagik is
<psu> s/woody/potato
<psu> I'll just try that
<drochaid> :)
Action: psu isn't scared of woody
<psu> just needs to set aside a 1/2 day to do the upgrade
<drochaid> lots of woody at your local LUG
<psu> pref when there are some Debian gurus around here
Action: drochaid shuts up again
<psu> hmm
<psu> some of my thumbnails have larger sizes than the originals
<psu> which isn't really the point ;-)
<psu> I guess the resizing looses some of the big solid colour blocks
Action: drochaid is away: cleansing
<psu> which the png format does its goat-luvving magic on
<drochaid> lol
<psu> let's see how the jpgs go
<psu> yep, jpges are behaving themselves
Action: psu troutslaps his pngs for getting bigger
<psu> theh hugs 'em for being so small in first place
Action: drochaid is back (gone 01:02:38)

<jcater> psu: ImageMagick baby!
<jcater> oh, he's gone
<drochaid> heh
<drochaid> but you only missed him by 3 hours ;)
<jcater> man
<jcater> that was a close call, then
<drochaid> yep
<drochaid> just a few seconds earlier, and he'd know
<jcater> psu: well, if you read the logs, apt-get imagemagick
<jcater> then "man convert"
<drochaid> lol

<drochaid> <jcater> then "man convert"
<drochaid> <drochaid> lol
<psu> oh well
<psu> I have imagemagicked anyway
<psu> so no probs there
<psu> what's odd is that reducing some pngs down to 20% thumbnails
<psu> actually increases the file size
<psu> so for those, I'll just use an <img src="original.png" width="200">
<drochaid> lol
<psu> btw "if you read the logs" ;-)
<psu> hmm
<jcater> lol
<jcater> I meant, "if you read the logs in time to be useful"
<psu> fair enough 
<psu> well, I used imagemagik anyway 
<psu> so either great minds think alike, or fools never differ ;-)
Action: drochaid remains silent

<dtm> http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=964  <--  a game my friend wrote in the 70's
<dtm> for Atari 2600
<dtm> he invented the Easter Egg and the graphical adventure quest game
<dtm> it's bsaed on the original text game
<dtm> conceptually
<dtm> the 2600 has 128 bytes of ram and most games such as this one were 4K ROMs for all data, logic, graphics, everything

StyXman (~support@200.82.61.16) left #gnuenterprise.
<dtm> he could do this because he'd previously done his master's degree at Berkeley, taking computer science courses from Ken Thompson there
<dtm> so this guy is the bomb
