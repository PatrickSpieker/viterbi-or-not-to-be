<mdean> ja, but it will hopefully die down soon
<mdean> I mean, the bugs can't be infinite, can they?
<ajmitch> cool
<ajmitch> back to dcl hacking?
<chillywilly> only if you have billy g as a boss
<mdean> actually did some this weekend
<ajmitch> wow!
Action: ajmitch impressed
<ajmitch> derek was even here a few min ago
Action: chillywilly heard it through the grape vine that mdean recently commited code to dcl
<ajmitch> no??
<mdean> merged in some changes I did at work and am implementing a new feature
<ajmitch> nice
<chillywilly> heh, nice topic guys
Action: chillywilly just noticed it
<ajmitch> hehe
<mdean> reminds me of the old #dcl topic: "Double Choco Latte: It's horribly good."

<derek> yeah
<derek> hello aditya_gilra
<derek> im responding to your email as we speak
<aditya_gilra> thanks
<aditya_gilra> I was wondering if I was being ignored
<derek> i was out of town all last week
<derek> and i generally am the one that responds to such requests
<derek> so i apologize
<aditya_gilra> no please
<aditya_gilra> this is a voluntary effort
<aditya_gilra> I'm most grateful
<derek> jcater_: something is horribly wrong with dcl what the heck are you all doing
Action: derek needs and update
<derek> aditya_gilra: ok i sent response just now
Action: chillywilly just got WOPN to plug GNUe
<ajmitch> derek: you're lead programmer, apparantly
<chillywilly> ajmitch informs me that we hit all 19 listeners!!!?!??!!!
<chillywilly> *all* of them!
<ajmitch> chillywilly: barbicane said 19 people were listening
<chillywilly> I know
<aditya_gilra> just read the mail
<derek> ?
Action: derek is lost about this programmer thing
<chillywilly> just something the streaminging DJ guy said
<chillywilly> he doesn't know
<aditya_gilra> the error message is broken, but I'm still able to query from a slave block
<aditya_gilra> Is there a way to stop that, even if the error doesn't pop up it's fine
<aditya_gilra> other points are clear, thanks.
<aditya_gilra> btw, you don't need gnome2 for the pygtk2 form
<aditya_gilra> just gtk2 and pygtk2-1.99.xx
<jcater_> derek: what's horribly wrong?
<derek> um sorry was gone
<derek> um the link you gave has none of our data
<derek> and the link
<derek> gnuenterprise.org/dclgw/ (what it should be)
<derek> has bad postgres errors
<jcater_> derek: gnuenterprise.org still points to monsoon
<jcater_> until the website gets set back up
<derek> AH
<derek> ah ah ah
<jcater_> and /dcl/ and /dclgw/ are aliases for the same thing on the new system
<jcater_> so whichever you prefer
<derek> i dont understand where data went though
<derek> and why gnue logo isnt displayed and such
<jcater_> um
<jcater_> are you sure data isn't therE?
<jcater_> when I log in, I see all my open tickets
jcater (~jason@w202.z065105010.mem-tn.dsl.cnc.net) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<derek> i login and i have nothing
<jcater_> ah
<jcater_> well
<jcater_> lemme transfer part of my workload
<jcater_> and I can solve that problem
<aditya_gilra> I don't see ticket #78 on the new link you gave either
<derek> well im concerned that things are screwed up
<derek> so i dont wnat to enter things till resolved
<derek> hmm a browse of workorders shows no open workorders at all
<jcater_> hmm
<derek> at https://65.101.4.212/dclgw/main.php
<jcater_> I see
<jcater_> how odd
<jcater_> as all the product information transfered
<jcater_> but no tickets
Action: jcater_ has a complete backup, so I wouldn't worry
<jcater_> but how odd
<jcater_> btw, one thing I noticed...
<jcater_> with the latest DCL debs
<jcater_> there's no upgrade pgsql scripts for this latest release
<jcater_> is this correct?
<derek> correct
<derek> no table elements were upgraded
<derek> just bug fixes man
<derek> :)
<jcater_> true
<derek> er security fixes
<jcater_> but if you look at his update scripts
<jcater_> some of them do nothing more than update his versions table
<jcater_> so dcl knows the latest version installed
<derek> i should have made a DUMMY one
<derek> ah schiest
<derek> thats what happens when you have idiot derek do things :)
Action: derek never releazed that 
<jcater_> I still don't get this dcl stuff
<derek> he is getting ready to do release soon i think as he has started committing things
<jcater_> I did a pg_dumpall
<derek> so can fix it then
<jcater_> then a load
<jcater_> no errors
<jcater_> it transfered the products
<jcater_> but not the tickets
<derek> maybe you are constipated?
<jcater_> I just don't understand
<derek> and having trouble really dumping everything
<jcater_> could be all the donut preservatives?

<sfb-> i was just kind of wondering how GNUe compares to Compiere.
<LuftHans> sfb-: there are those who can make that comparison for you.
Action: LuftHans is not one of those.

<sfb-> oh.
<sfb-> trying to get comparisons of GNUe vs. Compiere
<psu> ah
dsmith (firewall-u@cherry7.comerica.com) left #gnuenterprise.
<psu> well 
<psu> the big issue for people here 
<psu> is that Compiere, although free (as in freedom) itself
<psu> has non-free dependancies
<psu> such as Java 
<psu> and (the biggie) Oracle DB s/w
<psu> i.e. unless you have sold your soul to Oracle for a database, it's just  a kool but inert lump of code
<sfb-> yeah.
<psu> GNUe is designed to have no non-free depends at all
<psu> i.e. you can use GNUe w/Oracle
<sfb-> they're making progress on PG support though.
<sfb-> how about completeness?
<psu> but you can also use with MySQL, Freebird, postgresql, SAB-DB etc
<psu> dunno about completeness
<psu> but we don;t have an off-the-shelf financials package yet
<psu> good source of info is the Kernel Cousins
<sfb-> for it to be usable realistically, would it need a lot of work?
<sfb-> i guess that's what i'm eluding to
<psu> go to http://kt.zork.net/ & type Compiere in search box
<psu> sfb-: at moment, we have tools (very good tools) for building apps
<sfb-> cool
<psu> especially in 2 tier mode (i.e. forms talks direct to database)
<psu> but are a bit short on apps themselves
<psu> as frankly 
<psu> we really want our appserver working 
<psu> i.e. would like our official apps to be 3-tier from start
<sfb-> you seem to be more like Vantive or PeopleSoft than Compiere
<sfb-> with GNUe Designer and such.
<psu> GNUe is 3 things :
<sfb-> are the forms also stored in the appserver and pushed to the client?
<sfb-> or when you make form changes, do you have to push them out manually to clients?
<psu> sfb-: the forms at the moment contain all the biz logic
<psu> so would have to be pushed out 
<psu> but 
<sfb-> so it's not 3 or n-tier yet
<psu> forms can read forms definitions from an URL so no big deal
<psu> once we have appserver working well
<psu> (there's already a proof of concept version)
<sfb-> cool, and that's geas?
<psu> then the biz logic sits there and the forms definitions files will still exist
<psu> and ref appserver
<psu> geas was our original bash at an app server
<psu> it was actually contributed by an oustide company
<psu> but 
<psu> after some work we decided to learn what we could from it & start again
<psu> so 
<psu> geas == old app server, discontinued
<psu> app server = new app server, early in development 
<psu> but not everyone is always 100% consistant on terms
<psu> and we've found no way to have an IRC "swear box" for people who get it wrong ;-)
<psu> we'd have trout beatings, but the guys in charge of the trout get it wrong as much as anybody ;-)
<sfb-> hehe
<sfb-> good to hear.
<sfb-> compiere looks very attractive, but i've been having a hard time convincing myself that oracle is worth the $1k initial investment.
<sfb-> so rumor has it you're also working with integration with bayonne?
<psu> if you want a free finance package today 
<psu> look at NOLA or acclite
<sfb-> well
<psu> sfb-: yep. The idea is that voicemail-type stuff means 
<LuftHans> sfb-: yup. Rich of Bayonne was at the GNUe booth at LWE last week.
<psu> you can access GNUe Forms over the phone
<sfb-> i'm working on starting up a brick-and-click record store.
<sfb-> psu: that'd be slick, really worthwhile. like ivr.
deke (www-data@alt1.libertydistribution.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<sfb-> it'd be nice to not have to spend $120k on a PBX to let customers pull up order information.
<psu> sfb-: yep. In theory, bayonne should be able to use excatly same form defs as full client
<deke> yep
<deke> sfb- psu summed up the gist of the compiere vs. gnue debate
<psu> although I think "press 451 for option whatever" might pall a bit
<deke> generally we wont debate much as 
<nickr> psu: damnit, you've picked up dneighbo's annoying habit of hitting enter halfway through sentences
<deke> a. compiere requires non free software
<deke> b. compiere uses a qeustionable license
<psu> nickr: i find it 
<deke> thus it should be compared to like animals
<psu> becomes addictive
<psu> after a while
<sfb-> questionable?
<sfb-> isn't it just mpl?
<deke> like animals are SAP R/3, ORacle Financials and the likes
<deke> yes mpl is questionable
<deke> it does not protect developers
<psu> mpl == we can use your contrib code for whatever, even non-free versions
<psu> (summarised, but IANAL)
<deke> if it were not 'questionable' why is mozilla dual licensed :)
<sfb-> ahh
<sfb-> true
<deke> the answer is mpl is not gpl compatiable which causes LOTS of issues
<deke> but say we were to over look these issues
<deke> and compare unlike items
<psu> for a truly free finance package today, look at NOLA which is GPL 
<sfb-> what's your next milestone date on the appserver?
<sfb-> do you have an url for nola handy?
<deke> the gbiggest difference is what you suggested
<deke> GNUe is like SAP R/3, PeopleSoft and the likes
<psu> sfb-: try typing "NOLA" into that search page I gave you - don't have it to hand
<deke> i.e. its an application framework
<sfb-> i think i found it on google
<deke> in which you can create and/or extend applications
<deke> so your 'where are we at' question is difficult to answer
<sfb-> yeah, i didn't like the limitation in compiere for customizing the system to your business needs.
<deke> the answer is the tool part
<deke> or the framework is very far along
<sfb-> they don't allow an awful lot of extensibility presently for doing things like adding fields.
<deke> and rather usable in 2 tier mode
<deke> on the application side we are not far along at all
<deke> we havent put the focus there
<deke> in short if you want to author an HRMS system gnue could do that today
<deke> if you want to download and 'run' an HRMS system with minimal effort we can not do that today
<deke> i hope this is a fair summary
<sfb-> yeah.
<deke> and comparision you were looking for
<deke> though it might not be the answer you watned :)
<sfb-> no, it's just the info i was looking for
<deke> we are strongly encouraging interested parties in helping make the applications 
<deke> so we can continue to grow the tools
dneighbo (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<sfb-> how difficult would it be to engineer a CRM/ERP and basic GL package on GNUe as it stands?
<psu> all the stuff you need on tools side is there
<psu> but you'd have to design your own schema & biz logic
<psu> and write that 
<psu> yourself
<sfb-> well
Action: psu apologises to nickr: can't help myself, keep getting subliminal msg to press enter
<sfb-> outside of the givens (business process documentation and such) how difficult is it to implement in GNUe, versus, say, another 'animal' such as PeopleSoft?
<sfb-> (i have zero intention on buying peoplesoft, so don't worry (; )
<psu> the key diff is that, with peoplesoft, sap, baan, oracle financials, jde
<psu> you have something that works out of box
<psu> and "just" needs custom & config to fit your org
<psu> As of today, a finance package in GNUe means you start w/a blank schema 
<psu> and start from scratch
<sfb-> i see what you're saying
<psu> but 
<sfb-> but i'm not taking that into consideration
<nickr> psu: thats okay, I keel you feelthy dead later
<psu> nickr: the voices make me do it
<nickr> hehe
deke (www-data@alt1.libertydistribution.com) left irc: "CGI:IRC 0.5"
<LuftHans> should bug reports about modules not checked for in setup.py be sent to config-support or to the addy for the specific application?
<psu> LuftHans: either/both. Try the setup-cvs.py in root dir first & see if that fixes
<LuftHans> that's the one I used, forgot about the -cvs part :)
<psu> config-support is probably better
<LuftHans> what's wPython.wx and what debian package(s) would hold it?
Action: psu should know this but he can't remember
Action: psu looks around for anyone w/a clue
<LuftHans> python-dev?
<LuftHans> nope
<jcater> libwx2.2-python
<jcater> iirc
<jcater> err
<jcater> libwxgtk2.2-python
<LuftHans> just installed libwxgtk2.2-python, do I have to rebuild gnue?
<LuftHans> wtf is this SPAM from a boot-loader?

Action: chillywilly slaps nickr with his own trout
<LuftHans> hmm, looks like I've got the wxPython modules installed, but gfdes still dies. Do I need to reconfigure something? rebuild gfdes?
ra3vat (~ds@ics.elcom.ru) left irc: Connection timed out
<psu> have you re-run setup-cvs.py?
Action: psu is playing clueless helpdesk jockey tonite
<LuftHans> do I need to? it seems weird since the modules are in site-packages.
<chillywilly> setup=cvs is for running things out of the cvs copy
<LuftHans> how do I tell which python is being called?
<chillywilly> setup-cvs.py that is
<chillywilly> python --version from the shell
<LuftHans> that gives me a help message
<chillywilly> ooops
<LuftHans>  /usr/bin/python is a softlink to python2.1
<chillywilly> python -V
<LuftHans> 2.1.3
<chillywilly> I would guess you are runnin 2.1.x then
<LuftHans>  /usr/lib/python2.1/site-packages/wxPython should get automagically searched, right?
<psu> LuftHans: I know people have had python path problems before
<chillywilly> echo $PYTHON_PATH
<psu> somewhere there is a utility to run to find which pythons you have & which is default path
<chillywilly> sorry
<chillywilly> PYTHONPATH
<LuftHans> both are empty in the shell
<chillywilly> >>> import sys
<chillywilly> >>> print "%s", sys.path
<chillywilly> %s ['', '/usr/lib/python2.1', '/usr/lib/python2.1/plat-linux2', '/usr/lib/python2.1/lib-tk', '/usr/lib/python2.1/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.1/site-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.1/site-packages/Numeric']>>> 
<chillywilly> you can do that in the python command line
<jcater> LuftHans: make sure you have python-egenix-mxdatetime installed
<LuftHans> chillywilly: got that. there's also a site-python and no Numeric, so that seems to not point out the prob.
<LuftHans> jcater: forgot about that one.
Action: chillywilly has a b0rked example
deke (www-data@alt1.libertydistribution.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<LuftHans> I got a different error when missing the mxdatetime packages before.
<chillywilly> guess I don't need the "%s"
<LuftHans> still "ImportError: No module named wxPython.wx"
<chillywilly> hi deke
<LuftHans> this is from the import in Designer.py on line 61
<LuftHans> the install on my laptop also has that line, but works.
<deke> um there is a script somewhere in the tree
<deke> that gives you info
<deke> likely wx is either not installed or installed incorrectly on this machine
<deke> we see it all the time on red hat
<deke> where people have 1.5.2 and 2.1 or 2.1 and 2.2 installed
<deke> and install wx
<deke> but install it for a python other than the default
<deke> can you give me a path to where the wx stuff is on that machine?
<LuftHans>  /usr/lib/python2.1/site-packages/wxPython
<deke> ok
<deke> type
<deke> python2.1
<deke> and then when in python
<deke> type 
<deke> import wxPython.wx
<deke> and tell me what happens
<LuftHans> gdk charset warnings
<LuftHans> but it imports
<deke> ok chances are you are using some other python to run gnue
<deke> got back to setup-cvs
<deke> adn do python2.1 setup-cvs.py
<LuftHans> aha, looking at gfdes rather than Designer I see that it's calling python2 rather than python
<deke> instead of ./setup-cvs.py
<deke> you can edit the shell scripts
<deke> in ~/bin/
<deke> to point to correct python
<LuftHans> is there a --remove for setup-cvs.py?
<StyXman> jcater: you hear?
<deke> i dont think so
<deke> but it should be locally containable
<deke> i.e delete ~/gnue/
<deke> ~/bin/ (assuming you dont have other apps there)
<deke> and its all gone
deke (www-data@alt1.libertydistribution.com) left irc: "CGI:IRC 0.5"
<LuftHans> that would wipe out what I'm using as well as what I inadvertently created.
Action: LuftHans uses rm and a glob on ~/lokal/bin and pretends the rest went away as well :).
<LuftHans> hmm, conf file says borderPercentage should no longer be needed, but <deke> but it should be locally containable
<LuftHans> <deke> i.e delete ~/gnue/
<LuftHans> <deke> ~/bin/ (assuming you dont have other<deke> but it should be locally containable

<LuftHans> oops, mouse-puke :(
<LuftHans> hmm, conf file says borderPercentage should no longer be needed, but that appears to be where gfdes is dying.
<LuftHans> DB000:     self.borderPercentage = (float(gConfig('borderPercentage')) / 100)
<LuftHans> DB000: ValueError: invalid literal for float(): 100.0
<reinhard> could be a locale problem?
<reinhard> (wants 100,0)
<reinhard> LuftHans: you from outside U.S.?
<reinhard> your name sounds much like Lufthansa :)
<LuftHans> reinhard: das war's
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> looks like the Germans are taking over GNUe ;-)
<LuftHans> LANG='C' gfdes
<LuftHans> that fixed it :)
<LuftHans> reinhard: but Derek won't let us call it GNU: :)
Action: LuftHans needs to figure out how to support .de chars in irc someday...
<reinhard> depends on your IRC client
<reinhard> XChat wörks väri good for that ;-)
<LuftHans> I use ircii cuz I don't like GUIs.

<deke> connections.conf gets reloaded when you run apps
<neilt> hey deke
<deke> that is sufficient what you posted
<deke> but  i warn you i dont do mysql so im not much help there
<deke> try  making the name all lower case
<deke> ecube
<deke> instead of eCube
<deke> and make sure you change your forms to use lowercase
<deke> and see if it works
<deke> iirc i had problems with this before
<deke> fixed it then someone re broked it
<deke> hi neilt

<deke> sep, oct i think
<deke> er or
<LuftHans> sorry. trying to get off the phone with Brian.
<deke> lufthans you know good local place to get ink refills for hp printers?

<jcater> yes, send them as html with see brittany nude as the subject

<jcater> that way, spamassassin will properly file the bugs for me

<chillywilly> :)
Action: chillywilly huggles spamassassin
Action: Chipaca wakes from slumber
<Chipaca> hi all!
<chillywilly> howdy
<Chipaca> umm
<Chipaca> several questions from this end...
<Chipaca> any news about the patch we sent in?
<deke> rofl
<Chipaca> that's #1
<deke> we didnt like it your fired
<deke> oh thats not fair
<Chipaca> #2 is is there any reason the names of datasources, pages, forms and blocks invade the root namespace?
<deke> we just will cut you r pay in half
<deke> 0/2 is fair wage right?
<Chipaca> #3 was did you look at -- i don't remember the name; ask aprono --'s appserver?
Action: Chipaca looks at deke
<deke> im teasing chipaca
Action: Chipaca tries to express his salary in us$ and fails
<deke> we havent gotten to the patch yet
<Chipaca> rats
<deke> it has been busy here
Action: LuftHans is off to the CU
<deke> i dont konw abou tthe appserver thing 
<deke> CU?
<LuftHans> actually, it was busy elsewhere, which is where we were...
<deke> ?
<deke> ah
<LuftHans> Credit Union, aka non-bend me over like a bank financial institution :)
<Chipaca> let me look in the logs
<deke> cool
Action: deke 's definition
<Chipaca> rats, where are the logs?
<deke> CU place you go to store the money you wish you had
<deke> at least that is how it is for me
Action: Chipaca wonders about the precedence of "non-" in LuftHans's statement
<jcater> re the appserver thingy, from what I read, it looks no different than a web-application framework much like medusa and webware
<jcater> which we intend to support iirc
Action: Chipaca wonders if the archiver of the logs hasn't heard about using iso-formatted dates to get lexicographically sorted files to sort by date at the same time
<Chipaca> jcater: ah
<jcater> but I've had 0 time to investigate
<Chipaca> jcater: aprono had the impression you hadn't given it any mindshare
<Chipaca> jcater: that's ok
<jcater> Chipaca: I can't begin to describe how hectic things are at the Cater house right now
<jcater> I have to schedule vacation time to eat
<Chipaca> jcater: whassup?
<jcater> 1. wife loosing job  2. Wife starting up bookstore
<jcater> that about sums it up
<jcater> :)
<jcater> c/loosing/losing
<Chipaca> jcater: 3. jcater losing nerve
<jcater> btw, I don't really consider myself to be the "appserver guy"
<Chipaca> jcater: neither do I
<Chipaca> :)
Action: jcater is a huge 2-tier fanatic
Action: Chipaca points at the obvious holes in gnue for 2-tier apps
<jcater> why do in 3+ layers what you can do in 2 :)
Action: Chipaca points at further holes in gnue per se
<deke> the dates of logs are proper  on ash whenit returns
<jcater> Chipaca: true
Action: Chipaca carries on pointing
Action: Chipaca 's pointing arm gets tired
<jcater> I don't deny that :)
Action: deke yesll
<jcater> yesll?
<deke> "im rubber  this is gnue, whatever you point out, bounces off me and sticks on you"
<jcater> is that a form of yodelling?
<deke> er yells this irc client is clunky
<Chipaca> deke: if you used iso-whatever formatted date (i.e. yyyy-mm-dd) they'd sort nicer
<deke> chipaca thats solved on ash, all i can say :)
Action: Chipaca looks at ash
Action: jcater prefers the TN format
<jcater> "Last thursday.log"
<deke> today
<jcater> "2 weeks and a day ago.log"
<jcater> etc
<deke> termerra
<Chipaca> jcater: ugh, try to find something in there
<deke> da  udder day
<jcater> or, better yet, the memphis version
<jcater> in which case, the files are sequentially numbered
<deke> jcater: you cant have logs where tehy cant read
<jcater> and the numbers represent days since Elvis passed away
<Chipaca> jcater: rotfl
<deke> roflmao
<deke> thats a good one
Action: Chipaca picks deke's a up and throws it out the window
<Chipaca> about the namespace thing... ?
deke (www-data@alt1.libertydistribution.com) left #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> it feels ugly, and it breaks things. is there any reason for it?
deke (www-data@alt1.libertydistribution.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> deke: what're you doing logged in as www-data
<deke> dont ask
<Chipaca> deke: too late
<deke> its safer that way
Action: deke wanted to know what it felt like to be apache so im www-data today
<deke> its been rather boring, maybe tomorrow i will be postgres, it should be more fun
<chillywilly> hah
<Chipaca> deke: pah, try being nobody
<chillywilly> you are a goof ball
<deke> good idea
<deke> probably is no one lets me do anything when im nobody
<Chipaca> deke: you could try being no one, then, maybe it's like being root
<jcater> feels ugly?>
<jcater> um
Action: jcater doesn't understand the issue I guess
<Chipaca> jcater: e.g. I can't have a form called the same as a datasource
<jcater> right
<Chipaca> jcater: and aprono said (although I haven't seen that one) you can actually name a form in such a way that it conflicts with something inside gnue
<Chipaca> jcater: having one entry point would be cleaner, no?
<jcater> not in our minds
<jcater> we have a progressing namespace
<jcater> as you move up the tree
<jcater> siblings, etc appear in your namespace
<jcater> I admit we don't have all the error checking in place we need
<jcater> but this progressive namespace was a feature
<jcater> i.e., a design decision
<jcater> not a bug
<Chipaca> jcater: we guessed as much
<Chipaca> jcater: we fail to see the usefulness of it, and we have several times stumbled over it in dismay
<Chipaca> jcater: perhaps we fail to see something you could explain better?
<LuftHans> deke: gonna be at Stammtisch tonight?
<deke> hahahahahhahahahhahahaha
<deke> um no
<deke> not because i dont want  to though
<deke> just i have to find time for family too
<LuftHans> ok, you don't get your monitor :)
<deke> and so committing to  more than one event a month for plug puts me on the chopping block
<deke> and i cant choose stammtisch though i would liek to some months
<deke> because my wife cant relate how a bar and linux go together
<deke> if we didnt have kids i would have her come along
<LuftHans> it's a restaurant. now that smoking isn't allowed it isn't too bad.
<deke> as much as i have been erupting on the list of late
<deke> probably wont be going to too many plug events
