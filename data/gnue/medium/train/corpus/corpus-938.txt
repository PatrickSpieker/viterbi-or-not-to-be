<ajmitch> hi jcater
<jcater> howdy
<jcater> another dead nite in #gnuenterprise, I see
<jcater> :)
<jcater> or
<jcater> that would me morning for you, I suppose
<chillywilly> boo!
<jcater> (or is it mid-day?)
<ajmitch> you see the security hole for NOLA on bugtraq?
<ajmitch> 5pm here
<jcater> no?
<jcater> you have a url?
<ajmitch> just says that users can upload what they want thru upload pages
<ajmitch> NOLA does no checks (they can upload php files, etc)
<ajmitch> lemme try & wade thru the archives 
<jcater> well
<jcater> to be honest
<jcater> that's a big crock if you ask me
<jcater> as anyone who runs a publicly accessible NOLA install
<jcater> (accounting, mind you)
<jcater> just aint right
<ajmitch> is asking for it?
<jcater> not that I'm defending those freakish PHP folks
<jcater> but still...
Action: jcater isn't too worried about my accountants h4x0ring their accounting package
<jcater> although, maybe I should be...
Action: jcater ponders for a minute
<jcater> no, wait... I have to show them how to use email
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/280340/2002-06-30/2002-07-06/0
<MicahY> (hopefully) much improved schema committed!
<MicahY> for acclite that is
<ajmitch> great!
<chillywilly> well this is really trippy
<jcater> coolness
Action: ajmitch waits for commit mail
<MicahY> of course I'm still having trouble adding a vendor
<chillywilly> I got gnome-terminal 2.0 and sawfish 2.0 and none of the rest and I can't really config the wm now ;P
<MicahY> which is the problem I was talking about earlier today...
<chillywilly> no virtual desktops anymore...
<ajmitch> sucks to be you ;)
<chillywilly> they need the rest of gnome 2! dagnabit!
<chillywilly> ajmitch: indeed
<chillywilly> ajmitch: but that's a given
<chillywilly> ajmitch: no need to state the obvious ;)

<MicahY> crap!
<MicahY> was just going to ask a question of jcater
<psu> ask us ;)
<MicahY> ok
<psu> we won't know the answer 
<MicahY> is there a place on the web to find cvs commits for acclite?
<psu> but we can empathise ;-)
<MicahY> I told him I didn't want the commit maillist
<MicahY> too much crap in the mail. :)
Action: psu would guess not
<psu> as cvsweb is a separate package to cvs
<psu> and you probably wouldn't set it up unless asked
<MicahY> hmmm
<MicahY> I'll look around...
<psu> having said that, shouldn't be a big job
<MicahY> I thought I remembered there being a cvsweb for gnue itself
<MicahY> but can't find it now :) and am not sure if acclite is in it
<psu> yes, but GNU/FSF admin all that 
<psu> acclite is definantely in a diff cvs
<psu> GNUe is on savannah.gnu.org
<psu> acclite is on ash.gnuenterprise.org
<MicahY> ok found it.... but ok

<psu> hi dneighbo
<dneighbo> hey
<dneighbo> i started looking at new site today
<dneighbo> i think i made it through about everything
<dneighbo> it looks REALLY complete
<dneighbo> i had a few questions though about maintainability
<psu> done a bit more this a.m.
<psu> like everything else, it will need some docs ;-)
Action: psu is working on a README 
<psu> the main maintainability (hmm) issue at moment is news items
<psu> which need pythonising
<dneighbo> a. are the news items easy (as they are on front page and other page as well)
<dneighbo> b. the status items and some other things are on each tool/package page as well as on the page the item belongs (like status)
<dneighbo> is that being typed twice
<psu> at the moment, yes
<dneighbo> or put in some sort of variable and reused for all pages
<psu> I need to make that more "clever"
<psu> have a status("tool") object that returns relevant text
Action: psu is hopeful that once he has fully assimilated his python tutorial book
<psu> I should be able to automate these w/o bothering our resident python mastas
<dneighbo> i am no zope master but im thinking if we can somehow just make dtml variables or something
<dneighbo> then where you want to insert status you just put the variable
<psu> yes
<psu> I'll raise that as a WO in dcl
<psu> gotta go now
<psu> work calls

<siesel> jamest, I like to add a special 'call method' function to the appserver dbbackend.
<jamest> huh?
<siesel> I've allready added it to the TriggerExtensions, but how can I call it in a trigger.
<siesel> ?
<siesel> I just want to enable access to the geasInstance.call function directly through a trigger in the forms client.
<siesel> I think that it should work like the getSequence etc. in the postgres DBdriver, but I just don't know how I can access that function in a trigger.
<jamest> you've added it to which objects's triggerExtensions?
<siesel> GEASv2_DataObject
<jamest> well
<jamest> hang on
btami (~btami@195.228.11.32) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> Hi Bajusz
<btami> hi Arturas
<Arturas> could you please review today's log?
<btami> reading
<jamest> siesel: look in forms/GFObjects/GFEntry.py
<jamest> search for Trigger Exposure
<jamest> you'll see a dictionary that contains exposed function names 
<jamest> for the triggernamespace
<btami> Arturas/jamest: i'm very sorry for my "AND" mistake
<jamest> self._triggerFunctions has an entry for the sequence functoin that calls a functoin that then uses the triggerExtension
<btami> Arturas: but the fix was a real bugfix
<siesel> I see, i.e. if I add functions to triggerExtensions they won't be added to the triggernamespace automaticaly.
<jamest> btami: could you look at the commented out line in that py file 
<btami> yes
<jamest> siesel: triggerExtensions are old school
<jamest> :)
<jamest> but still have a place
<jamest> siesel: if you look at GDataSource you can see that I made a delete() global
<jamest> you may want to do something similar to your functoin
<siesel> ok, I could add an entry to self._triggerFunctions 
<jamest> usage of the _trigger* stuff is in the common/doc/TriggerSpecifications.txt
<jamest> I'm sure you could put a generic triggerEntry in the GDataSource area
<siesel> ... and even make it global, but what do you think is the best place and name for a function that calls the call function of one instance
<jamest> that if called searched the loaded drivers triggerExtensions for a call method entry and if it existed it could can it
<jamest> and if it didn't exist then it could throw a not supported by backend error (or something)
<Arturas> btami: bugfix for one thing and a bug for another :)
<btami> jamest: i think the     if self.handleCR: thing was another win32 bugfix (you commented out too)
<jamest> btami: I put the old line back as CVS was broken
<btami> Arturas: yes!!! :)
<jamest> but tried to guess at what you were after w/ the patch
<jamest> the AND -> and 
<siesel> ok, I will (try to) do that. :)
<jamest> and ='str' to =='str'
<jamest> but I didn't know what you were fixing so I didn't know exactly what the code was to do
<jamest> siesel: did I make any sense?
<btami> jamest: my fix is good, just syntact was wrong
<btami> jamest: becouse self.display type is int on checkboxes
<jamest> ah, ok
<jamest> checkboxes are evil :)
<btami> yes
<jamest> i need to gut them sometime soon
<btami> anyhow i'm a beginner in python, reading good, writing wrong
<jamest> lol
<btami> so, i have to say sorry again, and by

<Arturas> good morning Jason :)
<siesel> jamest: how can I get the current record? 
<jamest> that gets fugly
<siesel> I think I cannot use that getPostingRecordSet function outside of Pre-commit triggers
<jamest> the _form should always contain a _currentRecord
<jamest> but I'm not sure it's correct
<siesel> i.e. it would be better to access that currentRecord and add the trigger there
<jamest> I wouldn't do that
<jamest> as then it'd be Forms specific
<jamest> if you can keep it in datasource then it'll work for all gnue apps
<jamest> you should be able to go from the datasource down 
<jamest> via _currentResultSet
<siesel> seems like I can the currentRecord by dts.getRecord(dts.getRecordNumber())
<jamest> cool
Action: jamest was looking at a way to do that for the delete() addition
<jamest> but was trying to use the _current* all the way thru which was acting odd
<jamest> so added the posting record var as I needed that form working about 1 month ago
<siesel> hmmm, I'm not shure if it works sane ;) but I can tell you soon :)

<siesel> btw. the button widget is fireing the trigger twice 
<siesel> jamest: where do the pre-commit triggers go? in <block> or <datasource> ?
<siesel> if I add it to <block> everything is ok. but pre-insert doesn't react.
<^chewie> wow, lots of changes to the CVS over the last couple days ;-)
<jamest> i know they go in <block>
<jamest> don't know if <datasource> supports triggers or not 
<jamest> pre-insert will only fire on new records
<jamest> but I use it hear so it should be working
<siesel> hmmm pre-insert still doesnÄt work, but I know a bit more about that strange behaviour of PRE-COMMIT triggers
<siesel> in case of PRE-COMMIT the trigger is called for every single record. but the current record is and should be always the same.

<StyXman> anyone on conditions?
<StyXman> <contitions>, just in case...
<sledge_> nope, sorry
<StyXman> ok, nevermind. either it works or it doesn't...
<sledge_> i'm glad to see you at all
<StyXman> uh?
<sledge_> hey, you could have been shot by the police
Action: jcater is away: MiB2
<sledge_> hey, i've found a bug in designer
<sledge_> okay, bug report sent, i go home now
<sledge_> bye
<StyXman> sledge_: hey, thanks. or... ok, nevermind. just in case, I (we) live in Cordoba. The shootongs where in Buenos Aires
<StyXman> sledge_: bye
<sledge_> i know
<sledge_> but how do *you* know? the press is not lying today?
<StyXman> well, everybosy lies. I'm lying :)
<sledge_> great
<sledge_> as long as your source code is true :)
<StyXman> ah, that, it's a lie also. but you won't notice the difference :)
<sledge_> is it compatible with true source code?
<StyXman> uh, I don't know. it's compatible with lie sc. I could make a lie sc-> true sc compiler, but it would be a lie too.
<StyXman> and I can continue all the day that way.
<sledge_> you must be lying i think
<sledge_> anyway
<StyXman> uh, I'm lost now.
<StyXman> day day day day day day day day
<StyXman> do you use epic4?
<sledge_> nope, why?

<siesel> hi sledge
Action: psu is back
<sledge_> siesel: what's the difference between xmlrpc and pw_xmlrpc
Chipaca (~john@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> jcater: you here?
<sledge_> Chipaca: he is watching MIB2 :)
<Chipaca> oh
<siesel> sledge: xmlrpc is a GPL'd library and pw_xmlrpc is under something else..
<Chipaca> rats
<sledge_> aha
<siesel> xmlrpc is using its own http library, so it should be faster (but it won't work under windows)
<dneighbo> what is windows?
<sledge_> dneighbo: you throw your computer through that when you have software from a company in redmond
<sledge_> erm
<dneighbo> ah i think i have seen this phenonem
<dneighbo> it looks like  a fun game
<dneighbo> do some stuff
<dneighbo> wait until the screen turns blue
<dneighbo> the press the explode button
<StyXman> Chipaca: *when* are you gonna bring ice age?
<Chipaca> StyXman: dvalfre has a copy, no?
<dneighbo> after you die three times you then physically abuse the machine, looks fun
<StyXman> uh? didn't know
<sledge_> hm, does the test script do its work over xmlrpc?
Action: dneighbo thought it wsa called 'you stuipid piece of crap'
Action: StyXman scratches Chipaca in public
<siesel> you mean appserver/src/test.py ?  no.
<dneighbo> as that is what i hear the people saying while playing it :)
<Chipaca> how bad is an incompatible change to _dbsig?
<sledge_> yep. so it directly uses appserver classes, right?
<siesel> yes. if you want RPC you should try geasRpcClient.py. or try it the convinient way : gtestcvs 
<siesel> hmm, I don't know what is more terrible: Gone with the wind, or Gone with windows
<sledge_> gone with windows? 'windows gone' is better :)
<sledge_> i just try to understand the appserver code at the moment
<siesel> I don't know if that helps you, but there are UML diagrams. (in appserver/doc/dia)
<sledge_> i'm familiar with uml, but i don't have dia on my home machine :/
<sledge_> are the diagrams the visualization of the API doc?
<siesel> they are the visualization of the actual code.
<sledge_> okay
<sledge_> including grpc?
<siesel> no, just appserver.
<sledge_> hey, _featuretest looks nice :)
<StyXman> bye bye
StyXman (~mdione@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) left irc: "ircII EPIC4-1.1.2 -- Are we there yet?"
Action: siesel is happy. finally someone is testing _featuretest :)
<sledge_> i wouldn't say "testing", it's rather "reading" :)
<sledge_> see, source code is literature 
<siesel> oh, ein Seelenverwandter :)
<sledge_> atest.py -> testApp.basictest seems to be the starting point
Action: psu nominates <insert your own joke here> as 
<psu> "Best work of fiction by a new author"
<sledge_> literatur muss sein
<siesel> lol
<sledge_> shakespeare preferred, but i occassionally read much from lesser known authors (i.e. torvalds) 
<siesel> hehe, 
<sledge_> an instance is an object feeded with fields and methods from the app server's db?
<sledge_> "your eyes are lode-stars, your tongue's sweet air more tuneable than a lark to sheperds ear, when wheat is green, when hawthorn's buds appear."
<sledge_> recite that to your girlfriend. if her english is good, she might melt.
Chipaca (~john@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) left irc: "l8r"
<siesel> almost. a instance is an object build out of a class, which is created out of list of fields and methods (which is in the db) 
<sledge_> db contains class; instance is an object/instance of the class. aha.
<sledge_> the OIDs in the source code, do they have something to do with the postgres OIDs?
<siesel> but the idea is to be very flexible, so there is a basic class factory which loads basic class definitions which can create basic (without events/triggers/inheritence) and some inheritence supporting classes which create more complex objects...
<sledge_> i see
<siesel> also both OIDs are the same concept, they are not connected with each other.
<sledge_> okay
<sledge_> is create_tables.py used at all? if, where is the db accessed?
<sledge_> s/py/sql/
<siesel> yes, you have to call it. db is accessed in GEDI.py 
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise ("bedtime").
<siesel> but the whole db access thing is not much more than a draft.
<sledge_> allright
<sledge_> "No module named _featuretest"
<sledge_> when i call gtestcvs
Action: pattieja is back (gone 22:23:07)
<siesel> sledge: seems that I forgot to upload __init__.py 
<siesel> if you do a cvs update it should work.
<sledge_> thanks
<sledge_> just a moment
<siesel> reinhard: you here?
<sledge_> okay, the file is here
<sledge_> i just don't have a working postgres here *argh*
<sledge_> anyway, i'll try it at work
<siesel> what kind of db do you have?
<sledge_> none, mysql sucks and postgres doesn't compile :/
<sledge_> at work, i use postgres for my personal projects and mysql for projects of coworkers
<siesel> seems like you are quite egocentric, using the best for yourself ;)
<sledge_> lol
<sledge_> well, they are USED to mysql, they could work with other dbs as well
<sledge_> but they do their dev work on windows :(
<sledge_> and so, they are windows users that use what the marketing dept wants, which is LAMP apps
<sledge_> LAPPy is much better, i think :)
<siesel> yes, but marketing dep likes buzz words. :(
<sledge_> old story
<sledge_> anyway, a clueful database design can get the average PHP coder in trouble
<sledge_> muhahaha
<sledge_> just use IT jerkoff material on database design
<siesel> jerkoff?
<sledge_> literally "abwichsmaterial"
<sledge_> university informatics stuff
<sledge_> just use a hard-core extreme relational model for simple tasks, and they will either break down or learn a lot
<reinhard> siesel: sorta here
<siesel> sledge: you should do a search for "IT jerkoff material" on google. lol
<siesel> reinhard: I just did a small api change, and want your comment.
<sledge_> Angie Jo is prime jerkoff material and she
<sledge_>  slays me every time I see her. 
<sledge_> *g*
<siesel> I've changed the constructor of geasInstance from accepting (self._classname, recordset) to (list, recordset) 
<reinhard> so i can't create an instance without having a list before?
<siesel> yes.
<reinhard> hmmm
Action: reinhard is trying to find an example where we don't want that
Action: reinhard fails
<reinhard> :-)
<reinhard> however
<siesel> the other option would be to pass "session", but it would be complicated to get the list again.
<reinhard> currently i agree with that change
<reinhard> however i have been working for 13 hours now w/ nearly no break
<reinhard> and that for the 3rd day in a row
<reinhard> so don't count too much on what i say now
<siesel> I hope you can change it back/to the better after the 31.7.
<reinhard> i reserve the right to change my mind later ;-)
<reinhard> i hope too
<reinhard> OTOH i have been hoping that for years ;-)
<siesel> changing your mind? ;)
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> sorry 15 hours not 13 hours...
<sledge_> oh it's late
<sledge_> good night
<reinhard> night :)
sledge_ (~sledge@B9759.pppool.de) left irc: "using sirc version 2.211+KSIRC/981227-pre0.9"
<siesel> yes, seems to be quite late. 
<siesel> reinhard: I hope you will find some rest... hopefully before the 26th hour ;)
<siesel> night
