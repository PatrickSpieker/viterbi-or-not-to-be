<jhs> anybody home?
<derek> im home
<derek> and you
<jhs> heh yeah I suppose so
<derek> whats up?
<jhs> I was wondering how different the latest release version is from CVS
<jhs> i.e. should I even bother with release?
<derek> its not all that different
<derek> but usually its pretty radically different so i woudl say it depends on your interest in gnue
<jhs> right
<derek> if you are just wanting quick eval and end user perspective stick with release
<jhs> I'd like to give a little proof-of-concept demonstration to somebody (a suit, basically)
<derek> if you want to be more 'active'
<derek> then i would take cvs
<derek> if you are on windows i would take release
<jcater> I fixed various "oddities" in cvs today
<jhs> It'll be on Linux
Action: jcater is working on a rental property management app using GNUe
<jcater> and it is coming along very nicely/quickly
<jhs> good.  Problem with rapidly developing Free products is that CVS is sometimes a wholly different software system :)
<jcater> btw, cvs is fairly stable at the moment
Action: jcater is back (gone 02:10:43)
Action: derek is away: eating
Action: derek is back (gone 00:00:11)
<jcater> wow
<jcater> that was a quick snack
<jcater> pizza again?
Action: derek had grill food (burgers and shrimp) yummy
<jcater> we went out for mexican
<jcater> 'cause wife wanted mexican
<jcater> (yay!)
<jcater> and low and behold, "I just want dessert"
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> go figure
<jhs> BTW the FAQ doesn't really say much about installation.  Is there some document that I've overlooked?
<jhs> or will the install-from-CVS doc suffice?
<SachaS_away> bye
SachaS_away (~Sacha@203.190.196.197) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<derek> a little
<derek> dedo del pollo eh
<derek> the INSTALL / README files should be enough
<derek> there is an 'installing cvs for RedHat doc floating around'
<jhs> thanks
<derek> what distro
<jhs> Deb woody
<derek> if debian you are looking at about a 3 minute install
<jcater> lol
<jcater> we all use debian woody
<jcater> so you are in for a smoooooth ride
<derek> apt-get install python 2.1 (if you dont have it or something greater)
<derek> what db you using?
<derek> if postgres
<jhs> yeah I think I got all the prereqs
<derek> apt-get install psycopg
<derek> if you have all the preqs
<jcater> python2.1-psycopg
<derek> def use cvs
<jhs> I was going to use mysql, since it's typically the 'default'
<derek> define 'default'
<derek> its a crap db for 'business' applications
<derek> good for web work but serious issues for 'real' work :)
<jhs> right.  I was defining default as the defacto (dejure?) for free software projects
<derek> but none the less if you have it installed you are good to go
<jhs> well I can install postgres
Action: derek thinks sapdb should be the defacto
<derek> anyhow lets stick with mysql, you have it installed and working :)
<derek> snag cvs
<jhs> the FAQ, etc. didn't really mention why I should go with one over another
<derek> tehn from the root cvs directory
<derek> type ./setup-cvs
<derek> and answer the questions
<derek> and thats it
<jhs> heh ok brb
<derek> try gnue/forms/samples/intro/intro.gfd sample after that
<derek> if it works then change entry in connections.conf and try a db form :)
<jhs> woa what's this about 'useful for developers'?
<jhs> I suppose I say yes
<jhs> holy moley that was fast!
Action: derek is away: family time
Action: jcater is away: um, ditto

fajun (james@61.154.11.13) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<dneighbo> ToyMan you around?
<dneighbo> if so you or your admin will need to make sure permissions are set for postgres for me to hit from the box 
<dneighbo> as its quite likely postgres right now is only accepting connections from localhost
<ToyMan> dneighbo?
<ToyMan> woah, good timing, just sat down at my lapper
<dneighbo> ToyMan by default i think postgres only accepts connections from localhost
<ToyMan> one sec, let me shell in..
<dneighbo> you can check by looking at the pg_hba.conf
<dneighbo> i havent tried to access from that machine so its possible its a non issue
<dneighbo> just figured i would try to catch you before i left as figured you might not be around by time i got home
<ToyMan> ok, now what's the problem?
Action: dneighbo is assuming there will be a problem :)
<ToyMan> not sure I understand you
<dneighbo> in that postgres probably wont accept connections out side of the machine its running on
<ToyMan> your logged in to bucky?
<ToyMan> (db serv)
<ToyMan> damn, I can't remember how to get in
<ToyMan> havn't done it enough yet
<ToyMan> i'm root @ server, what next
<ToyMan> ?
<dneighbo> sorry was on phone
<ToyMan> /usr/local/share/postgresql/pg_hba.conf.sample is the only copy I have...
<dneighbo> um this freeBSD right
<ToyMan> yup
jbailey (jbailey@CPE014260028338.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> hi jbailey
<ToyMan> freeBSD always has .sample file by default
<jbailey> Heya.
<jbailey> Hmm
<dneighbo> you flooded out
<ToyMan> or do all distros do that?
<dneighbo> hi jbailey can you check in or send me what you have for dlc debs
<dneighbo> s/dlc/dcl
<dneighbo> yeah i think they all do that
Action: dneighbo is just wondering where on freeBSD to put the file :)\
<jbailey> check in?
<dneighbo> i thought postgres needed one to run
<dneighbo> or send to me
<jbailey> I did it using a dbs build because I don't have write access.
<jbailey> So it's not suitable for checking in.
<jbailey> Should I just upload them?
<dneighbo> i guess im not following
<dneighbo> as i dont know what dbs build is
<dneighbo> i assume there is a program or config files or something that is used to make debs?
<dneighbo> basically i need debs for dcl (and i know you are busy)
<dneighbo> but rather than start from scratch i was hoping to pick up where ever you left off
<dneighbo> if possible
<dneighbo> i have a security release i hope to bundle tonight in tar/gz format
<dneighbo> and would be killer if i could offer debs at that time as well
<ToyMan> dneighbo?
<jbailey> dneighbo: When are you bundling the .tar.gz?
<dneighbo> after i do final testing
<dneighbo> ToyMan : im not sure where you pg_hba.conf goes :(
<dneighbo> basically you just need to add something like
<ToyMan> /usr/local/pgsql or /usr/local/etc probably
<dneighbo> host       all         156.42.63.46    255.255.255.0    trust
<dneighbo> where 156.42.63.46 is the windows machine
<ajmitch> hmm yeah, it's in /etc/postgresql on debian
<dneighbo> until your admin can set up something better than trust
<dneighbo> either password or ident or the likes
<jbailey> Because I will probably have a bit of time tonight to putit together for you.  IT's easier than explaining what I've done.
<jbailey> Then you're welcome to update yourself after, or have me or another DD do it.
<dneighbo> its been a long time since i configured other htan for local devel (trust) other wise i would walk you through it
<jbailey> (or anyone, really)
<dneighbo> jbailey that would be killer
<dneighbo> what is in CVS should pretty much be what i plan to release
<jbailey> Isn't that a bad expression to use in the US right now?
<jbailey> My build requires me to use release tarballs.
<dneighbo> in the stable-2002214 (or somethign branch)
<dneighbo> jbailey will you be around in 2 hours or so?
<dneighbo> i can get you are tar ball then
<jbailey> Umm, 2230h?  Yeah, I'll probably be working my way to bed about 30 minutes after that or so.
<jbailey> I don't think angie and I are watching a movie tonight.
<dneighbo> how hard is the process?
<dneighbo> as i can provide you are tarball right now
<jbailey> To update?  Mostly just copy the tarball into place.
<dneighbo> but i still have some testing to do so its possible might need minor tweaking
<jbailey> But since my current package is from February and I haven't touched it since, I'd like to poke it a little before I hand it over to you.
<dneighbo> sigh more pain that expected
<dneighbo> if you can get cvs of stable branch
<dneighbo> i have to run :(
<dneighbo> sigh what is proper tar syntax?

<ajmitch> hi SachaS
<SachaS> how are you?
<SachaS> hey its saturday....what are you doing? programming?
<ajmitch> yeah, some
<ajmitch> and you?
<SachaS> some xml programming. doing a todo list. todo list is in xml. and i have web forms with jsp which display, updated, add items to the todo list.
<ajmitch> sounds nice
<ajmitch> been doing much with GNUe?
<SachaS> nothing :( the last time i tried to install it no luck.
<SachaS> you?
<ajmitch> yeah, going to do a few forms sometime soon, and perhaps try & get appserver to do tricks
<ajmitch> what OS are you running on?
<SachaS> ajmitch. linux 2.4.18 with debian woody. 
<ajmitch> hmm, most GNUe developers are using woody
<SachaS> ajmitch. last time i had problems with the different dependencies of python (modules?)
Action: ajmitch is using sid
Action: SachaS knows ajmitch is using sid
<ajmitch> very strange that you could get dep problems on woody :)
<SachaS> i remeber I had to install different pyhton packages. python-orbit, python-XXXdatabase bindings etc. maybe i was just not determined enough to make it work. actually the designer came up....
<ajmitch> yeah, python-orbit shouldn't be needed
<ajmitch> just a number of db wrappers, etc
<SachaS> yeah. what i saw from screenshots the forms look pretty nice.
<ajmitch> yup
<SachaS> they all connect to the db right?
<SachaS> no application server between yet....
jbailey (jbailey@CPE014260028338.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<ajmitch> mostly, yeah
<ajmitch> there's an appserver test form or two, but fairly limited
<SachaS> how far is designer2html forms?
<ajmitch> sorry? you mean a web forms client?
<SachaS> yes
<ajmitch> dunno, siesel has done a reasonable amount on a php forms client
fajun (james@61.154.11.26) joined #gnuenterprise.
<SachaS> the other day i came across a nice thing: http://www.pitman.co.za/projects/charva/
<SachaS> its java and ncurses
<SachaS> normally if you use graphical user interfaces in java you used swing.
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> or if using old java, awt
Action: ajmitch recalls there was work being done recently on an ncurses GNUe forms client
<SachaS> with this library? you change import something like javax.swing.window to something like charvax.swing.window and you get ncurses window!
<ajmitch> great!
<SachaS> import javax.swing.window becomes charva.swing.window
<SachaS> import javax.swing.window becomes import charva.swing.window
<SachaS> and you have ncurses for most parts.
<SachaS> javax.swing.button becomes charva.swing.button etc....
<SachaS> check the screenshots page. impressive somehow.
<SachaS> you write regular java code with swing and if you want to compile it with ncurses you only change the import statements
<ajmitch> impressive
<SachaS> yeah.
<SachaS> ajmitch: i do some programming with java atm. i have a dilemma. what programming language to use! you guys use python, i did learn some c way back (for gtk progm. c or c++ is good). then there is perl with a huge modules pool. then people like ruby ...
<SachaS> hey something else....a couple weeks ago i wrote a couple of lines of java code (without swing or awt) and compiled it with gcc (the gcj compiler) into native code. binary was running smoothly. impressive again. i used kaffee before also works.
<ajmitch> ok
Action: ajmitch on phone :)

<dneighbo> um probably relies on trust authentication
<reinhard> ok so you should create the db
