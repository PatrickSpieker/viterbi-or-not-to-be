<chillywilly> hey php gurus
<chillywilly> what else do you have to do to get apache to recognize php postgres functions besides having extension=pgsql.so?
<chillywilly> in php.ini
<chillywilly> my test script complains about pg_connect()
Action: siesel is using PEAR/DB.php, so I don't have to handle that :)
<chillywilly> well onyl reason I hacked it up is to see if I postgres support is working
<chillywilly> we're trying to setup phpBB we board software
<chillywilly> s/we/web
<chillywilly> it was bitching about php not having postgres support
<derek> apt-get install apache php4 php4-pgsql

<derek> comment out 2 lines to load php and recognize .php extension
<derek> and you are done
<derek> no editing php.ini or other stuff
Action: chillywilly slaps himself hard

<jhs> anybody home?
<derek> im home
<derek> and you
<jhs> heh yeah I suppose so
<derek> whats up?
<jhs> I was wondering how different the latest release version is from CVS
<jhs> i.e. should I even bother with release?
<derek> its not all that different
<derek> but usually its pretty radically different so i woudl say it depends on your interest in gnue
<jhs> right
<derek> if you are just wanting quick eval and end user perspective stick with release
<jhs> I'd like to give a little proof-of-concept demonstration to somebody (a suit, basically)
<derek> if you want to be more 'active'
<derek> then i would take cvs
<derek> if you are on windows i would take release
<jcater> I fixed various "oddities" in cvs today
<jhs> It'll be on Linux
Action: jcater is working on a rental property management app using GNUe
<jcater> and it is coming along very nicely/quickly
<jhs> good.  Problem with rapidly developing Free products is that CVS is sometimes a wholly different software system :)
<jcater> btw, cvs is fairly stable at the moment
Action: jcater is back (gone 02:10:43)
Action: derek is away: eating
Action: derek is back (gone 00:00:11)
<jcater> wow
<jcater> that was a quick snack
<jcater> pizza again?
Action: derek had grill food (burgers and shrimp) yummy
<jcater> we went out for mexican
<jcater> 'cause wife wanted mexican
<jcater> (yay!)
<jcater> and low and behold, "I just want dessert"
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> go figure
<jhs> BTW the FAQ doesn't really say much about installation.  Is there some document that I've overlooked?
<jhs> or will the install-from-CVS doc suffice?
<SachaS_away> bye
SachaS_away (~Sacha@203.190.196.197) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<derek> a little
<derek> dedo del pollo eh
<derek> the INSTALL / README files should be enough
<derek> there is an 'installing cvs for RedHat doc floating around'
<jhs> thanks
<derek> what distro
<jhs> Deb woody
<derek> if debian you are looking at about a 3 minute install
<jcater> lol
<jcater> we all use debian woody
<jcater> so you are in for a smoooooth ride
<derek> apt-get install python 2.1 (if you dont have it or something greater)
<derek> what db you using?
<derek> if postgres
<jhs> yeah I think I got all the prereqs
<derek> apt-get install psycopg
<derek> if you have all the preqs
<jcater> python2.1-psycopg
<derek> def use cvs
<jhs> I was going to use mysql, since it's typically the 'default'
<derek> define 'default'
<derek> its a crap db for 'business' applications
<derek> good for web work but serious issues for 'real' work :)
<jhs> right.  I was defining default as the defacto (dejure?) for free software projects
<derek> but none the less if you have it installed you are good to go
<jhs> well I can install postgres
Action: derek thinks sapdb should be the defacto
<derek> anyhow lets stick with mysql, you have it installed and working :)
<derek> snag cvs
<jhs> the FAQ, etc. didn't really mention why I should go with one over another
<derek> tehn from the root cvs directory
<derek> type ./setup-cvs
<derek> and answer the questions
<derek> and thats it
<jhs> heh ok brb
<derek> try gnue/forms/samples/intro/intro.gfd sample after that
<derek> if it works then change entry in connections.conf and try a db form :)
<jhs> woa what's this about 'useful for developers'?
<jhs> I suppose I say yes
<jhs> holy moley that was fast!
Action: derek is away: family time
Action: jcater is away: um, ditto
<jhs> okay thanks for everything, guys
