<Bill_H> bill_h: test
<dneighbo> hi Bill_H
<Bill_H> Hi Derek
<Bill_H> I see you are still keeping things together
<ajmitch> hi
<dneighbo> we are making progress yes
<Bill_H> What has been the biggest challenge? Moving the bytes around or the subject matter for the modules (G/L, HR, etc.)
<dneighbo> biggest challenge lack of time
<dneighbo> and people willing to write applications
<ajmitch> time for me to learn designer fast
Action: ajmitch wants to throw an basic app together within a couple of weeks at most :)
<ajmitch> btw, there's no gadfly dbdriver, is there?
<Bill_H> Yes, I know what you mean.

<derek> hi kemitix
<kemitix> hi derek, I'm just having a look at the download pages for GNUe, havn't read *too* much of the docs yet.
<dneighbo> well consider irc the 'quick start' guide :)
<dneighbo> kemitix: where abouts in the uk are you?
<kemitix> thanks.  Just tried to grab geas-0.0.6 and got a 404 error
<kemitix> I'm in fife, scotland
<dneighbo> you dont want geas
<dneighbo> its dead
<dneighbo> its replaced by appserver
<kemitix> Am I even on the right site?  Can only find geas.  I'm on http://www.gnuenterprise.org/download.php
<kemitix> Ok I've found GNUe-AppServer-0.0.1.tar.gz Is this right?  Did the version number wind back after geas?
<ToyMan> hey derek

<reinhard> kemitix: yes appserver-0.0.1 is the current version
<kemitix> reinhard, got appserver-0.0.1 and the rest - now I just have to wait on postgres downloading

<kemitix> I've followed the INSTALL file for GNUe-Common and AppServer.  Do I need to actually create a database in postgres or do I just go into installing Forms next?
rdean (~rdean@chcgil2-ar2-4-64-030-076.chcgil2.dsl-verizon.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<reinhard> kemitix: you need to create a database in postgres
<kemitix> just 'createdb' or do I need to create a gnue user first?  (Couldn't find this in the docs - I could be blind though)
<reinhard> well that depends on what you are going to do next
dneighbo (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<reinhard> IIRC most of the sample programs for appserver rely on the postgres user name to be identical to $LOGNAME
<reinhard> and having no password in postgres
<kemitix> got postgres user with no passwd
<dneighbo> um probably relies on trust authentication
<reinhard> ok so you should create the db
<kemitix> okay, done that
<reinhard> um
<reinhard> sorry
<reinhard> to create the db you could use samples/setup-pgsql.sh from the appserver directory
<reinhard> then actually the appserver test programs should work
<reinhard> bbl
