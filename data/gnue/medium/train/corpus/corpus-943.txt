<ajmitch> ok, jcZzzz :)
<jcZzzz> lol
<jcZzzz> nite
<ajmitch> nite
<psu> no time for us to do jokes 
<jcZzzz> err, morning
<jcZzzz> err, whatever
<psu> about donuts ;-)
<jcZzzz> hey, now

<jcZzzz> don't make it worse
<jcZzzz> argh!
<jcZzzz> donut shop has fresh batch in 2 hrs iirc
<jcZzzz> sigh
<jcZzzz> damn you!
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> poor jcater, to be tormented so
<psu> well, jcZzzz off to Zzzzz, me off to work
<psu> I think that means ajmitch gets left to mind the shop ;-)
<psu> remember, if anyone asks
<psu> Designer properties bug is known about, and 
<psu> you know the workaround
<psu> anything else is just 
<psu> "works for me, you'll have to ask jcater or jamest when they wake up"

<ajmitch> hey jbailey
<jbailey> Andrew!
<ajmitch> derek seems to be worried about dcl & gnue debs
<ajmitch> especially as there's a security release of DCL due out
<jbailey> hmm
<ajmitch> yep
<jbailey> Well, AFAICT there's 0 people using the old DCL debs now.  So at least the annoyance of making it upgrade friendly is gone.
Action: ajmitch should find out how other distutils projects did things
<jbailey> I should dust off what I had.
<ajmitch> ok then
Action: ajmitch is playing with x2x
<ajmitch> woohoo, my code built
<jbailey> What's x2x?

<chillywilly> yes? ;)
<reinhard> did you hear that microsoft will officially have a booth at the lwe sf?
<chillywilly> are you half asleep reinhard?

<chillywilly> I don't trust them as far as I can throw them
<ToyMan> dneighbo: that's just the datafiles you need copied, yes?
<chillywilly> btw, mr. mueller what are you using to generate all those funny quit messages?
<dneighbo> um
<ToyMan> there's isn't a 100% clean break between data db and app db
<chillywilly> reinhard: they have brought great joy to all of us ;)
<ToyMan> 'cause of some Access weridness
<reinhard> chillywilly: xchat lets you define a text file where every line is a quit message and it selects randomly
<chillywilly> yep, I have seen that
<dneighbo> access and weirdness in the same sentence, surely you jest
<chillywilly> did you write the text file or borrow it?
<reinhard> chillywilly: and every time i read a good line i add it to the file
<reinhard> it's not big
<chillywilly> aaaaah
<chillywilly> well keep up the good work ;)

<dneighbo> ToyMan you around?
<dneighbo> if so you or your admin will need to make sure permissions are set for postgres for me to hit from the box 
<dneighbo> as its quite likely postgres right now is only accepting connections from localhost
<ToyMan> dneighbo?
<ToyMan> woah, good timing, just sat down at my lapper
<dneighbo> ToyMan by default i think postgres only accepts connections from localhost
<ToyMan> one sec, let me shell in..
<dneighbo> you can check by looking at the pg_hba.conf
<dneighbo> i havent tried to access from that machine so its possible its a non issue
<dneighbo> just figured i would try to catch you before i left as figured you might not be around by time i got home
<ToyMan> ok, now what's the problem?
Action: dneighbo is assuming there will be a problem :)
<ToyMan> not sure I understand you
<dneighbo> in that postgres probably wont accept connections out side of the machine its running on
<ToyMan> your logged in to bucky?
<ToyMan> (db serv)
<ToyMan> damn, I can't remember how to get in
<ToyMan> havn't done it enough yet
<ToyMan> i'm root @ server, what next
<ToyMan> ?
<dneighbo> sorry was on phone
<ToyMan> /usr/local/share/postgresql/pg_hba.conf.sample is the only copy I have...
<dneighbo> um this freeBSD right
<ToyMan> yup
jbailey (jbailey@CPE014260028338.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> hi jbailey
<ToyMan> freeBSD always has .sample file by default
<jbailey> Heya.
<jbailey> Hmm
<dneighbo> you flooded out
<ToyMan> or do all distros do that?
<dneighbo> hi jbailey can you check in or send me what you have for dlc debs
<dneighbo> s/dlc/dcl
<dneighbo> yeah i think they all do that
Action: dneighbo is just wondering where on freeBSD to put the file :)\
<jbailey> check in?
<dneighbo> i thought postgres needed one to run
<dneighbo> or send to me
<jbailey> I did it using a dbs build because I don't have write access.
<jbailey> So it's not suitable for checking in.
<jbailey> Should I just upload them?
<dneighbo> i guess im not following
<dneighbo> as i dont know what dbs build is
<dneighbo> i assume there is a program or config files or something that is used to make debs?
<dneighbo> basically i need debs for dcl (and i know you are busy)
<dneighbo> but rather than start from scratch i was hoping to pick up where ever you left off
<dneighbo> if possible
<dneighbo> i have a security release i hope to bundle tonight in tar/gz format
<dneighbo> and would be killer if i could offer debs at that time as well
<ToyMan> dneighbo?
<jbailey> dneighbo: When are you bundling the .tar.gz?
<dneighbo> after i do final testing
<dneighbo> ToyMan : im not sure where you pg_hba.conf goes :(
<dneighbo> basically you just need to add something like
<ToyMan> /usr/local/pgsql or /usr/local/etc probably
<dneighbo> host       all         156.42.63.46    255.255.255.0    trust
<dneighbo> where 156.42.63.46 is the windows machine
<ajmitch> hmm yeah, it's in /etc/postgresql on debian
<dneighbo> until your admin can set up something better than trust
<dneighbo> either password or ident or the likes
<jbailey> Because I will probably have a bit of time tonight to putit together for you.  IT's easier than explaining what I've done.
<jbailey> Then you're welcome to update yourself after, or have me or another DD do it.
<dneighbo> its been a long time since i configured other htan for local devel (trust) other wise i would walk you through it
<jbailey> (or anyone, really)
<dneighbo> jbailey that would be killer
<dneighbo> what is in CVS should pretty much be what i plan to release
<jbailey> Isn't that a bad expression to use in the US right now?
<jbailey> My build requires me to use release tarballs.
<dneighbo> in the stable-2002214 (or somethign branch)
<dneighbo> jbailey will you be around in 2 hours or so?
<dneighbo> i can get you are tar ball then
<jbailey> Umm, 2230h?  Yeah, I'll probably be working my way to bed about 30 minutes after that or so.
<jbailey> I don't think angie and I are watching a movie tonight.
<dneighbo> how hard is the process?
<dneighbo> as i can provide you are tarball right now
<jbailey> To update?  Mostly just copy the tarball into place.
<dneighbo> but i still have some testing to do so its possible might need minor tweaking
<jbailey> But since my current package is from February and I haven't touched it since, I'd like to poke it a little before I hand it over to you.
<dneighbo> sigh more pain that expected
<dneighbo> if you can get cvs of stable branch
<dneighbo> i have to run :(
<dneighbo> sigh what is proper tar syntax?

<ajmitch> hi SachaS
<SachaS> how are you?
<SachaS> hey its saturday....what are you doing? programming?
<ajmitch> yeah, some
<ajmitch> and you?
<SachaS> some xml programming. doing a todo list. todo list is in xml. and i have web forms with jsp which display, updated, add items to the todo list.
<ajmitch> sounds nice
<ajmitch> been doing much with GNUe?
<SachaS> nothing :( the last time i tried to install it no luck.
<SachaS> you?
<ajmitch> yeah, going to do a few forms sometime soon, and perhaps try & get appserver to do tricks
<ajmitch> what OS are you running on?
<SachaS> ajmitch. linux 2.4.18 with debian woody. 
<ajmitch> hmm, most GNUe developers are using woody
<SachaS> ajmitch. last time i had problems with the different dependencies of python (modules?)
Action: ajmitch is using sid
Action: SachaS knows ajmitch is using sid
<ajmitch> very strange that you could get dep problems on woody :)
<SachaS> i remeber I had to install different pyhton packages. python-orbit, python-XXXdatabase bindings etc. maybe i was just not determined enough to make it work. actually the designer came up....
<ajmitch> yeah, python-orbit shouldn't be needed
<ajmitch> just a number of db wrappers, etc
<SachaS> yeah. what i saw from screenshots the forms look pretty nice.
<ajmitch> yup
<SachaS> they all connect to the db right?
<SachaS> no application server between yet....
jbailey (jbailey@CPE014260028338.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<ajmitch> mostly, yeah
<ajmitch> there's an appserver test form or two, but fairly limited
<SachaS> how far is designer2html forms?
<ajmitch> sorry? you mean a web forms client?
<SachaS> yes
<ajmitch> dunno, siesel has done a reasonable amount on a php forms client
fajun (james@61.154.11.26) joined #gnuenterprise.
<SachaS> the other day i came across a nice thing: http://www.pitman.co.za/projects/charva/
<SachaS> its java and ncurses
<SachaS> normally if you use graphical user interfaces in java you used swing.
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> or if using old java, awt
Action: ajmitch recalls there was work being done recently on an ncurses GNUe forms client
<SachaS> with this library? you change import something like javax.swing.window to something like charvax.swing.window and you get ncurses window!
<ajmitch> great!
<SachaS> import javax.swing.window becomes charva.swing.window
<SachaS> import javax.swing.window becomes import charva.swing.window
<SachaS> and you have ncurses for most parts.
<SachaS> javax.swing.button becomes charva.swing.button etc....
<SachaS> check the screenshots page. impressive somehow.
<SachaS> you write regular java code with swing and if you want to compile it with ncurses you only change the import statements
<ajmitch> impressive
<SachaS> yeah.
<SachaS> ajmitch: i do some programming with java atm. i have a dilemma. what programming language to use! you guys use python, i did learn some c way back (for gtk progm. c or c++ is good). then there is perl with a huge modules pool. then people like ruby ...
<SachaS> hey something else....a couple weeks ago i wrote a couple of lines of java code (without swing or awt) and compiled it with gcc (the gcj compiler) into native code. binary was running smoothly. impressive again. i used kaffee before also works.
<ajmitch> ok
Action: ajmitch on phone :)
