<dneighbo> ajmitch: for some reason NO modules were installed with the kernel :(
<dneighbo> do you know whats up with that?
<ajmitch> dneighbo: what kernel?
Action: ajmitch hasn't used a debian-supplied kernel for a long long long time
<dneighbo> kernel-image-2.4.18-686
<nickr> dneighbo: you have to install te pccard package also
<nickr> dneighbo: kernel-pcmcia-modules-2.4.18-686
<nickr> I think
<dneighbo> nickr: cool im already snagging that :
<dneighbo> hopefully it fixes thigns
<dneighbo> nickr: you here
<dneighbo> its odd modconf ONLY has pcmcia
<dneighbo> but regardless just raw out of box if i do /etc/pcmcia restart i get some errors i dont know how to resolve
<nickr> what error?
<nickr> you don't touch modconf in regards to pcmcia
<dneighbo>  Starting PCMCIA services: modules/lib/modules/2.4.18-686/pcmcia/i82365.o: unresolved symbol isapnp_find_dev_R9991be23
<dneighbo> ds: no socket drivers loaded!
<nickr> yea, okay, edit /etc/defaults/pcmcia, the line PCIC=i82365, change that to PCIC=yenta_socket
<dneighbo>  /lib/modules/2.4.18-686/pcmcia/ds.o: init_module: Operation not permitted
<nickr> um
<dneighbo> nickr: ok that removed error
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> no network card now
<dneighbo> er still (in 2.4)
<nickr> ?
<dneighbo> in 2.2 i had working ethernet
<dneighbo> in 2.4 it doesnt and if i do lsmod it doesnt appear to show tulip or anything
<nickr> try ejecting and reinserting the card
<dneighbo> nope
<dneighbo> BUT went to modconf
<dneighbo> and selected tulipc something
<dneighbo> and lights came on
<dneighbo> pulled card pushed card
<dneighbo> nothing
<dneighbo> ifup eth0
<dneighbo> and im go
<dneighbo> so looks to maybe use standard network/interfaces file now?
<dneighbo> anyhow looks good i think
<dneighbo> ext3, 2.4 kernel and bliss
<dneighbo> now just need some X loving and sound and im good to go
<dneighbo> im worried though
<dneighbo> modconf as stated before has NO modules 
<nickr> try doing a depmod -a and see if that populates your module list
<dneighbo> cept pcmcia so how will i do so sound?
<dneighbo> nope
<nickr> uhh
<nickr> go to /lib/modules/2.4.18-686 and see whats in there
<dneighbo> modules.dep
<dneighbo> modules.generic_string
<nickr> I'm really more interested in the directories ...
<dneighbo>  m.ieee1394map
<dneighbo> m.isapnpmap
<dneighbo> m.parportmap
<dneighbo> m.pcimap
<dneighbo> m.pnpbiosmpa
<dneighbo> m.usbmap
<dneighbo> s/m/modules
<dneighbo> pcmcia
<dneighbo> well working on X, if you have ideas let me know
<nickr> there is no possible way if you installed the kernel package that you'd end up without tonnes of modules in there.
<dneighbo> um
<dneighbo> im special remember
<nickr> Yea.
<nickr> I think you apply just enough knowledge to be dangerous to yourself but not enough to solve your problems
<nickr> anyway
<nickr> look at /var/lib/dpkg/info/kernel-image-2.4.18-686.list and do a search for /lib/modules/2.4.18-686 and verify that there are many .o files under there
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-229.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> i get fatal server error: trying to start x
<dneighbo> could not open default font 'fixed'
<dneighbo> i went back and apt-get xfonts-100dpi and xfonts-75dpi
<dneighbo> not sure where to go from there
<nickr> install aptitude
<nickr> go into aptitude
<nickr> install the destop environment task
<dneighbo> and yes all items seem to be in /lib/modules/2.4......
<dneighbo> that are in the package
<dneighbo> or at least all the ones i have checked
<nickr> so there are things like kernel/drivers/net/tulip.o ?
<dneighbo> btw: im too dumb to use aptitude
<dneighbo> its the worst ui i have ever seen
<nickr> uh
<nickr> aptitude is simple
<nickr> go down to Tasks
<nickr> hit enter
<nickr> find Desktop Environment, move the lin to it and hit +
<nickr> type g
<nickr> type g again
<nickr> sit back and watch
<nickr> alternatively, you can suffer
<dneighbo> nickr: will this be kde or gnome?
<dneighbo> there is basic-desktop
<dneighbo> and
<dneighbo> desktop
<dneighbo> i chose desktop
<dneighbo> it was the second g that wasnt intuitive btw
<nickr> well it gives you a chance to review its dependency resolutions before it commits them
<nickr> thats what the second g is
dneighbo_ (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> actually tulip.o and friends are under kernel/drivers/net
<dneighbo> i originally looked at kernel/net (my bad)
<dneighbo> i think its just a matter of something not being refreshed for them to show in modconf
<dneighbo> iirc i had similar issue before and some magic incantation solved it
<nickr> yea
<nickr> most likely a reboot would solve that problem
<nickr> sinec I don't know the incantation
<dneighbo_> hmm i had to reboot after getting 2.4 and after getting the pcmcia stuff
<dneighbo_> you think another reboot would help?
<dneighbo_> sigh, the desktop thing you had me pick i think is all kde
<dneighbo_> i love debian, but they have some kinks to work out on install 
Action: dneighbo_ wonders if they could use some of progeny's stuff
<nickr> They will
<dneighbo_> it was far from perfect but seemed pretty decent
<nickr> there is a beta piggy net install CD
<dneighbo_> as debian is like leaps and bounds superior once installed
Action: dneighbo_ admits some its install features are pretty slick too, just not enough of them
<nickr> anyway. Did you install grub?
<dneighbo_> its funny they let you do really complex stuff easily
<nickr> it shouldn't make a diff but I like grub :)
<dneighbo_> but some more simple stuff they do archaic style
<dneighbo_> i wanted grub but i didnt ping you at right time
<dneighbo_> and i dont have notes on what we did last time
<nickr> first install grub and uninstall lilo
<dneighbo_> you give bad instructions let me whip up a quick guide
<dneighbo_> 1. install grub
<dneighbo_> 2. pray hard
<dneighbo_> 3. uninstall lilo
<dneighbo_> 4. rejoice
<ajmitch> ello again
<nickr> apt-get --purge install grub lilo-
<nickr> grub-install /dev/hda
[01:03] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<nickr> update-grub
<nickr>  .. answer 'y' at the prompt
<nickr>  .. if you have your root on /dev/hda1 you're golden .. type update-grub again
<nickr> reboot
<dneighbo> let me get X working
<dneighbo> then i will do grub if you are still here
<dneighbo> as i have to try to reboot to get sound modules to show up anyhow :)
<dneighbo> might as well make it a useful reboot
<nickr> type this: apt-get moo
<nickr> and this: aptitude moo
Action: ajmitch recalls that last time he tried booting with grub he had to edit the menu.lst
<ajmitch> of course i still haven't fixed it up yet :)
<dneighbo> rofl
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> but that's the beauty of grub - you can fix it up even when it's partly stuffed up :)
<ajmitch> hey psu
<psu> hiya
<psu> wb me
<psu> ;-)
<dneighbo> ok x works but it defaulted to KDE
Action: dneighbo thinks some debian developers need a pimp slap :)

<psu> hey, they are just saving you the worry of having to make a choice
<psu> if you want choices, install a non-bullying distro like 
<psu> er 
<psu> Debian
<psu> ;-)
Action: ajmitch pimp slaps psu
<dneighbo> two questions i always forget
<ajmitch> don't you be dissin' my debian here!
<dneighbo> a. how can you tell what resolution you are running?
<ajmitch> xdpyinfo
jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> b. how can you change it (with something that doesnt involve + key
<ajmitch> hack XF86Config
<ajmitch> or wait for the XRANDR extension to be out & supported by wm's
<nickr> use dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86 and only enable the resolutions you actually want
Action: psu hugs his Debian
<ajmitch> nickr: don't tell him the easy way!
<nickr> woops
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> thats what i did before
<ajmitch> this is debian, you gotta hack all the config files with ed
<dneighbo> was wondering if more dynamic tool to do it
<ajmitch> like windows? :)
fred_bad (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<fred_bad> hahaha
<fred_bad> trying silly kde irc program its bad
<nickr> dneighbo: oh, there is a gnome applet(s), probably kde applet(s) and other little programs to do it
<nickr> just for the session tohugh
<fred_bad> trying to go to grub
<nickr> it can't change the actual config file
<ajmitch> hello fred_bad
Action: ajmitch would not want to change resolution here - anything less than 1280x1024 is small
<fred_bad> do i really need to do grub-install /dev/hda twice?
<fred_bad> Remosi: your previous instructions?
<ajmitch> heh
<nickr> fred_bad: I don't know, its probably a good idea to
<ajmitch> nick completion is fun
<fred_bad> ajmitch: i feel same way but never seem to have hardware (cept at work) that supports it
<fred_bad> either video card sucks or monitor sucks
<ajmitch> at the moment i've got a second screen beside this one that does 640x480 max
<ajmitch> using x2x to switch between them
<nickr> x2x rawks
<ajmitch> yup
<nickr> although there is something even better
Action: fred_bad is nervous that it says 'This May Take A Long Time'
<ajmitch> xinerama & dualhead cards?
<nickr> ajmitch: no, that works on that sort of setup, I'm searching for it
<nickr> ajmitch: I saw an ITP a while back
<ajmitch> interesting
<ajmitch> ITP on the debian-devel list?
Action: ajmitch does a search
<ajmitch> hmm, mutt takes awhile to load a 100MB mbox file
<ajmitch> espcially on this crappy hardware :)
<nickr> I'm not terribly impressed by mutt.
<nickr> I mean, its better than anything else, but not quite up to my standards
<ajmitch> using gnus?
<ajmitch> ah ok
<nickr> http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?archive=no\&bug=149457
<nickr> dmx
<nickr> looks TOTALLY AWESOME
<fred_bad> i dont have / on hda1 but rather hda2
<fred_bad> i assume i need to edit menu.lst
<fred_bad> changed all (0,0) to (0,1)
<fred_bad> and hda1 to hda2
<fred_bad> is that correct thing to do?
<fred_bad> then update-grub?
<fred_bad> and reboot?
<ajmitch> afaik you don't need to update-grub
<ajmitch> grub reads the file on boot
<nickr> you do need update-grub
<ajmitch> why?
<fred_bad> ok updating grub
<fred_bad> now just reboot?
<fred_bad> brb
fred_bad (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left #gnuenterprise.
Action: ajmitch thought update-grub was for installing new kernels, etc
<nickr> ajmitch: update-grub reads directives in the comments of menu.list to fill out its automatically generated lines
<ajmitch> ah
Action: ajmitch has a plain menu.lst, no update-grub used
<nickr> update-grub is one of the best tools ever created
<nickr> hehe
<nickr> well its very nice at least
<nickr> debian needs a lot more tools like it
<dneighbo> you guys rock
<dneighbo> im grubified
<dneighbo> so new shiny debian
<dneighbo> X (kde and gnome)
<dneighbo> grub
<dneighbo> 2.4.18
<dneighbo> ext3
<dneighbo> what more could a geek ask for ?
<dneighbo> oh yeah crap sound
<dneighbo> yeah stuff shows up now
<nickr> sweet
<nickr> do an lspci and look for the multimedia device
reinhard (~rm@62.47.247.52) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> maestro installed
<dneighbo> just apt-get smbclient and xmms to test
<dneighbo> and i think im up and running
<dneighbo> grrrr scratch that after reboot ethernet is toast
Action: ajmitch wonders why so many reboots :)
Action: ajmitch wants nice shiny new KDE desktop
<ajmitch> already have gnome 2 compiled
<ajmitch> don't want to install calc's kde3 debs yet because new libarts breaks sdl & wine
<dneighbo> sigh i dont get it, it was working
<dneighbo> now a /etc/init.d/pcmcia restart brings card back up (or at least doesnt error)
<dneighbo> but no networking 
<dneighbo> an ifconfig shows only lo as up
<dneighbo> if i do an ifup eth0
<dneighbo> it says ifup: interface eth0 already configured
<ajmitch> do ifconfig eth0
<ajmitch> maybe 'ifdown eth0; ifup eth0' if you're bored
<dneighbo> error fetching interface information: device not found
<dneighbo> grr hold up
<ajmitch> hmm k
<nickr> dneighbo: first take the auto out of /etc/network/interfaces for eth0
Action: ajmitch defers to nickr
<nickr> dneighbo: then ifdown eth0, then /etc/init.d/pcmcia restart
<dneighbo> lets time i did tulip_c module install under pcmcia to get network to work
<dneighbo> i look there now and that module doesnt exist
<nickr> you don't touch the fucking modules with pcmcia
<nickr> how many times will I have to tell you for you to get that?
<dneighbo> um two things
<dneighbo> a. removing auto eth0 and restarted services no effect
<ajmitch> bbl :)
<dneighbo> b. neworking didnt work until i activated tulip_c in pcmcia modules last time
<nickr> did you do an ifdown first?
<dneighbo> yip
<nickr> remove and reinsert the card, investigate lsmod for the driver, are there beeps? do the lights turn on?
<dneighbo> yeah i have fixed
<dneighbo> by installing a module
<nickr> gar
<dneighbo> they moved xiricom_tulip_c out of pcmcica
<dneighbo> into pcmcia/net
<dneighbo> and thats why it stopped working
<dneighbo> woo hoo sound rocking

<StyXman> hi. I just noted...
<StyXman> uh, we have masterlink and detaillink...
<StyXman> and order_by and foreign_key...
<chillywilly> hi StyXman
<StyXman> (hi chil)
<chillywilly> why is your greeting in parens?
<StyXman> can you (we?) have a politic about attr names?
<chillywilly> hi reinhard
<chillywilly> just the man I want to talk to
Action: chillywilly checks for a pulse
<StyXman> 'cause it's not related to I was saying..
<reinhard> oh
<chillywilly> :P
<chillywilly> he lives
<reinhard> you sure=
<reinhard> ?
<chillywilly> I was wondering if you wouldn't mind if I wrote a schema and odlml xml parser and write some xslt stuff too for the "object" format in the appserver
<chillywilly> we can write some transformations to go to ODL
<StyXman> or the politic about it is have no politic?
<chillywilly> I have been readin GParser a bit
<chillywilly> and it makes sense
<chillywilly> I am ready to dabble in it
<chillywilly> have you ever looked at the GObj class in common?
<chillywilly> in "Gobjects.py"
<chillywilly> GObjects.py that is
<reinhard> chillywilly: i haven't looked
<reinhard> and i think i have learned that the aims people have in gnue are of different nature
<reinhard> if we have a parser for odlml xml class definition files
<reinhard> i for my part are about 100% sure that i will never use it
<chillywilly> well you would use designer or you could write the simpler format
<chillywilly> I can stick it in jan's _featuretest module so it's not in the way ;)
<reinhard> currently i would think that jan has taken the role as the appserver lead developer
<chillywilly> true
<chillywilly> are you saying I should talk to him?
<chillywilly> ;)
<reinhard> i have a very specific picture of how i would gnue want to be
<reinhard> and i know that it's _my_ turn to make it look like that
<chillywilly> so what are you saying to me?
<reinhard> as most other people have their own specific picture :)
<reinhard> chillywilly: i'm saying that i am not sure if it is worth doing
<reinhard> but that i can't stop you anyway :)
<chillywilly> well it lets me play with xml ;)
<chillywilly> j/k, that
<chillywilly> 's not the *only* reason ;)
<chillywilly> seems like all the other xml elements in the various gnue formats are GObj based objects
<chillywilly> you could reuse triggers
<chillywilly> tie them into the objects
<reinhard> i'm not sure but maybe i'm the only one here working _daily_ with a buttload of different business application _users_
<reinhard> and i tend to see _their_ prolems and _their_ wishes
<reinhard> i guess most of them give a sh*t about wheter something is in XML or in foo
<reinhard> and whether it is tied to GObject or whatever
<reinhard> what they want is a stable working usable business software
<reinhard> that is easily extensible
<reinhard> to some degree extensible by an _average_ business user
<reinhard> however as derek likes to say "gnue will be all things to all people"
<chillywilly> I am just trying to leverage all the hard work that jcater and jamest have put into "common"
<reinhard> so i guess someday gnue will be ODMG compilant as well as easy to extend and performant and all the other things we want it to be
<chillywilly> seems like what you want can be defined at a higher level, like a business rule design type thing that people can use
<reinhard> anyway
<reinhard> believe me it hurts me personally to have to tell you that
<chillywilly> rant, rant, rant
<reinhard> but i think it's better when i'm honest
<chillywilly> sure it does
<reinhard> i see no value in the thing you are going to do
<reinhard> however that's my personal opinion
<reinhard> and i might not see all sides of the coin
<chillywilly> well jan was implementing the same ideas in _featuretest plus some of the things he was bringin to the table
<reinhard> i have lost track about what jan is doing as well
jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<reinhard> and i'm positive we might have different opinions on some topics
<chillywilly> he has a book on appservers where he is implementing some ideas
<chillywilly> afaik
<chillywilly> the code is pretty clear, imho
<reinhard> i think the thing i need most currently is time :(
<reinhard> and sleep
<chillywilly> yea, you seem a bit cranky ;P
<reinhard> chillywilly: please talk to jan about this
<chillywilly> he started hand coding a GCD parser

<Chipaca> hi all
<Chipaca> jamest: you actually here?
siesel (jan@dial-194-8-196-52.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> siesel: hi
<siesel> hi Chipaca
<siesel> hi all
<Chipaca> we're trying (aprono is) to get the dbsig drivers to work wrt primary keys
<Chipaca> we've stumbled over something that'll break backwards compatibility if we fix it
<Chipaca> and it's a pain if we don't (because we'll have to check the type of the return value of a function, to start with)
<Chipaca> so we're wondering if we should just go ahead, or if we should leave it as is
<Chipaca> and do the ugly thing, vs. the Right Thing
<dneighbo> Chipaca thats ok we have a rule here anyhow it says
<dneighbo> "You cant fix something unless you break two of something else."
<Chipaca> dneighbo: can I count the things?
Action: Chipaca gets his dictionary of aggregates
<dneighbo> rofl
aprono (~aprono@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> ok, so we fix this one bug in dbsig, but create a new bug in GNUe, that's a bug for a bug, so that's fine
<Chipaca> dneighbo: is that how it works?
<Chipaca> dneighbo: actually, it wouldn't break anything, except backwards compatibility between dbdrivers
<Chipaca> dneighbo: i.e. all the dbdrivers except postgres would stop working
<Chipaca> which is fine by me!
jcater (~jason@cpe-024-165-193-024.midsouth.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<StyXman> jcater: hi!
<Chipaca> jcater: hi. read the last bit of the logs, please?
<StyXman> jcater: besides what Chipaca said, do you have just a sec?
<jcater> um
Action: jcater just got home
<jcater> wassup?
<jcater> I read the back logs
<jcater> so what is the fix/breakage?>
<Chipaca> jcater: to work with the primary key
<Chipaca> jcater: in dbsig, you see if the dbdriver has a string called primary key, and you use that as the name of the column that has the primary key
<Chipaca> jcater: that breaks on one table when you have multiple primary keys
<jcater> in dbsig?
<jcater> I don't recall having any primary keys in dbsig
<Chipaca> jcater: yes, isn't that you?
Action: jcater is lost
<Chipaca> jcater: PrimaryIdField i think it's called
<Chipaca> aprono says so :)
<jcater> oh
<jcater> that's not the primary key
<Chipaca> sorry
<Chipaca> yeah, that, ok
<Chipaca> umm, no, it's not the primary key
<Chipaca> it could be for example in postgres the oid
<Chipaca> but we ran into trouble there too, and the only way we could think of that fixes that is with primary keys
<Chipaca>  the trouble we ran into was when inserting a row that has an autogenerated primary key
<Chipaca>  we couldn't find out the oid of the row
Action: neilt back
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I want to petition the DB-SIG group
<jcater> to add that functionality
<neilt> dneighbo: no spam
<jcater> i.e., we can get the OID (or RowID, etc) of any inserted rows
<jcater> but that doesn't solve the immediate need
<Chipaca> jcater: exactly
<Chipaca> jcater: so we find that the only sane way of doing it is using primary keys, and that presents us with a problem
<jcater> yes
<Chipaca> jcater: that the thing we've got to return from PrimaryIdField is no longer a string, but rather a hash
<jcater> how are you getting the primary keys?
<jcater> doing introspection at startup?
<Chipaca> jcater: in postgres, asking the system tables
<jcater> ok
<Chipaca> jcater: that's in psycopg
<Chipaca> the psycopg guys told us what to do :)
<jcater> ah
siesel (jan@dial-194-8-196-52.netcologne.de) left irc: "night"
<jcater> well
<jcater> if you look in recent cvs
<jcater> recent == last week or two
<jcater> I added primary key lookup functions to the postgresql drivers
<jcater> :)
<jcater> why a hash? and not a list?
<jcater> any particular reason?
<Chipaca> jcater: yes, aprono corrected me it's not in psycopg, but in the postgres thing
<Chipaca> jcater: because, if you remember, we're working on getting multiple tables working...
<Chipaca> ...so we have several primary keys in several tables
<Chipaca> if not, we'd've done "a, b, c".split(", ")
<Chipaca> and retained backwards compat
<jcater> ok
<jcater> I see where you guys are going
Action: jcater is fine w/breaking other drivers
Action: Chipaca is, too
<jcater> just create a trouble ticket saying the other ones might be broken
<StyXman> reit!
<Chipaca> trouble tickets are the same as bug reports, right?
<StyXman> (greit...)
Action: jcater thinks the only other driver to use PrimaryIdField is Oracle
<jcater> and I'll fix it quickly if it breaks
<jcater> as I use it
<Chipaca> jcater: yeah, and it's broken
<Chipaca> oops
<jcater> lol
<Chipaca> jcater: we're pretty sure it shouldn't work
<Chipaca> rather like the bumblebee
<jcater> it's broken like the bumblebee?
Action: jcater doesn't get the reference
