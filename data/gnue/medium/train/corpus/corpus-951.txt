<dneighbo> hey nickr guess what
<nickr> what?
<dneighbo> debian kicks ass
<ajmitch> evening
<nickr> well, tya
<dneighbo> oh and btw, we expect you to provide all the mixed drinks from now on
<dneighbo> seeing how you are gonna get that free blender and all
<dneighbo> ;)
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> well mr dneighbo, i'm glad you like debian :)
<nickr> he he
<dneighbo> :)
<dneighbo> apt-get is my friend
<ajmitch> yes
<dneighbo> i actually dont mind new debian installs (if have fat connection)
<dneighbo> as i know its easy to get stuff as i need it with no hassle
Action: ajmitch has no fat connection :)
<dneighbo> btw: im stoked at how much BETTER my display is going to 2.4 kernel from like 2.0 or 2.2 that rh6.2 had and new X 4.1
<dneighbo> its NOTICEABLY better
<dneighbo> not too mention, this might be weird i had 128mb RAM
<ajmitch> display?
<dneighbo> upgraded to 256mb
<dneighbo> and it didnt seem to 'help' any under 6.2
<dneighbo> under 2.4 kernel and debian this feels like a whole new machine performance wise
<ajmitch> rh 6.2's kernel might not have been seeing the extra ram?

<ra3vat> Function 'show' was called.
<ra3vat> is it expected message?
<siesel> yes
<siesel> at the moment, show is a demo function, which is not a trigger, so "Trigger 'person:show' does not exist" is printed. 
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> but everything is a very alpha state, because interfaces are not defined, the method namespace is not defined etc.
<siesel> if you have a application which needs a special function or a special way to do something I will try to implemet it.
<ra3vat> what is the difference between frigger and method?
<ra3vat> trigger
<siesel> a trigger is called on a special event. i.e. you can define a trigger person:insertnewrecord which is called every time a new record is inserted into person.

<jamest> a good test of the zopeness of the site

<jamest> i make them use the zope management interface and cadaver (a shell like interface)
<jamest> I'm migrating as much as I can into postgresql tables as well

<ra3vat> jamest: i have tabbed form with calculated field that works when you insert data row by row, how to get it working when I switch between tabs or run query? what kind of trigger should i add?
<jamest> on forms like that i used to create a named trigger
<jamest> then put a post-change (IIRC) trigger that referenced the named trigger on all fields involved in the calculation
<jamest> that should work for queries
<ra3vat> jamest: can't get it working may be i missunderstand what  post-change (IIRC) trigger that referenced the named trigger is
<jamest> ra3vat: i don't have any examples at work :(
<jamest> but instead of having the trigger definition on each entry contain the trigger text I just point them at the named trigger
<jamest> it's been months since I looked/tested that
<jamest> gnue/forms/samples/button/forms contains named trigger example
ymablr (hello@203.195.202.107) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ra3vat> jamest: now named trigger works with type PRE-FOCUSOUT

<jamest> yeah
<ra3vat> jamest: which are left then? :)
ymablr (hello@203.195.202.107) left #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> the focusout will only fire out navigatoin out of the field
<ra3vat> one more question is there a trigger that is fired one time on form's startup?
<Arturas> ra3vat: you can try with focus-in for the first entry in the form - it should get focus bu default
<Arturas> ra3vat: you can try with focus-in for the first entry in the form - it should get focus by default
<ra3vat> Arturas: will try, thanks
<jamest> if that works it's an interesting hack

<jamest> argh!
<jamest> don't feed him!
<jamest> he's like a stray animal
<jamest> once you feed them they'll never leave!

<drochaid> lol

<dneighbo_> yummy

<dneighbo_> its hectic
<dneighbo_> i want to have so much more done
<dneighbo_> sigh
<dneighbo_> speaking of which is jcater around?
<jamest> nope
<jcater> as round as ever
<dneighbo_> roflmao
<dneighbo_> jcater: you have print shop capabilities of any kind?
<dneighbo_> two items
<dneighbo_> a. we need marketing materials
<dneighbo_> b. we need to have them printed :)
<dneighbo_> i think you are probably best situated to design (a)
<dneighbo_> b becomes cost issue, if you have printing facilities it might be cheaper for you to print and ups to me
<dneighbo_> if you dont probably cheaper for me to take digital formats to kinkos or such here
<jcater> I have semi-large format color laser
<jcater> up to 13"x19"
<dneighbo_> i got for free a nice display to hold trifoldss
<jcater> but that's usually for proofs
<jcater> not production
<jcater> we outsource all printing
<dneighbo_> its probably 20x15 or larger clear plexiglass
Action: jcater can get some killer deals on printing typically
<dneighbo_> so you can insert your own print
<dneighbo_> then it has the holder on it for the trifolds
<jcater> as NCS is considered a "large" print customer
<dneighbo_> i was thinking if we can get low cost trifold even b/w 
<dneighbo_> with a nice insert for the holder i can place that on the main table
<dneighbo_> as a help yourself kind of thing
<jcater> I have high-speed b&w lasers
<jcater> but only up to 11x17
<dneighbo_> im thining the insert i would like to be color
<dneighbo_> the trifolds can be black and white

<Mr_You> hi
<psu> hi
Action: Mr_You waters the growing channel.
<dneighbo_> drochaid so now you are calling me names?
<drochaid> lol
<psu> house rule is dneighbo needs to find at least 3 bugs in your code that 
<drochaid> just reading up [a little]
<psu> no-one else can 
<psu> reproduce before you are allowed that
<drochaid> dneighbo_: could you promise me that any marketing material you produce will be made availble in various formats?
<dneighbo_> sure
<drochaid> I've got a rather nice colour laser sitting behind me, and I already use it to reproduce OOo marketing materials
<Mr_You> has anyone else shown any interest in coding a web-enabled GNUe?  
<dneighbo_> jcater can promise that
<Mr_You> just curious
<dneighbo_> Mr_You two efforts exist
<dneighbo_> one is in cvs
<Mr_You> cool
<jcater> any marketing materials I produce will be available in press-ready PDF
<Mr_You> hopefully I can extend whatever might be the end result
<drochaid> great jcater
<Mr_You> why do press need PDF? unless they are printing? I've just always used a news service.
<drochaid> what sort of quantities are you looking at for the UK market?
<Mr_You> I guess for letter head?
<drochaid> and do you have a sponsor for it yet?
<Mr_You> sorry jumped in heh
Action: Mr_You has never owned a working printer.
<Mr_You> well I had a dot matrix donated I never used.
<Mr_You> ok I'll stop babbling now
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> tis a very nice networked colour laser I have behind me you know ;)

<Mr_You> off-topic sorry, but life is hard heh
<Mr_You> per hour
<Mr_You> based on total # of hours per month or week (msg me I guess)
<drochaid> Mr_You: where abouts are you based?
<Mr_You> NC, USA
<drochaid> oh yeah
<drochaid> are you any good? [don't be modest]
<Mr_You> my background includes 6+ years of Sun admin, Level 2 Cisco Network Engineer at MCI (old backbone), I have mid level DB experience.. from Fortune 500 (MCI, Lucent, Fujitsu) to startups..
<drochaid> if you're capable and can get by with checking resources as needed, I'd say around $30 p/hr ... if you're shit hot, upto $125 p/hr
<drochaid> and somewhere inbetween for anything else
<drochaid> hmm .. I'd probably say at least $60 p/hr up then
<Mr_You> right now I'm looking for $80/hour for custom work.. being that it would only take me an hour or two to complete a lot of work.
<drochaid> then that's falls right in the range I suggested .. so cool ;)
<Mr_You> ie. I'm probably gonna set 30 minute minimum and charge somewhere like that I guess..
<Mr_You> 30 min increments
<drochaid> I'd suggest 15min increments
<Mr_You> yeah but its still too high for small biz :-((
<drochaid> offer small businesses a discount then
<Mr_You> I can't find any biters, I don't even know where to look.. I tried looking local already a year plus.. 
<drochaid> but make it as you discuss the work with them rather than a default small business cost
<Mr_You> and the other side of it is people who just want simple web interface management services.. and they probably wanna pay $8-$15/hour.
<Mr_You> yeah.. I always remind them pricing is based on skills needed and total time.
<drochaid> well, one way to market it could be that although you charge more per hour, you work faster than less experienced people
<Mr_You> yeah
<Mr_You> I'll hafta emphasize that more.
<drochaid> and therefore the job cost difference between you and a less experienced person is much reduced
<Mr_You> I need to find a price for "run my web interface" type management.
<Mr_You> yeah.. I said that on one "ad" but I should emphasize
<drochaid> yep
<drochaid> p/hr costing is misleading ...
<drochaid> don't advertise that bit, discuss it when you meet a potential client
<drochaid> also consider job costing withing set parameters
<Mr_You> well ideally tho, it would be an ongoing deal
<Mr_You> outsourced management
<Mr_You> ok
<drochaid> job cost to get it setup and a service fee, reduced from standard hourly rate maybe?
<drochaid> on the basis that keeping their business is even more important than gaining new business
<Mr_You> I don't follow that statement "job cost..."
<Mr_You> there is no setup fee
<Mr_You> essentially you are just hiring me as a contractor.. with minimum hours per month
<Mr_You> as the cost
<Mr_You> with report of how much used, kinda like cell phone minutes ;-)
<Mr_You> thanks, will take your suggestions
<Mr_You> oh yeah.. and I *NEED* GNUe (geas and "web" available) for backend ;-)))
<drochaid> hmm, I'd have serious issues hiring someone on a min hours per month basis unless I KNEW I was going to use them all
<Mr_You> I know I know it works
<Mr_You> well.. the idea is that you are paying a minimum to employ us period.
<Mr_You> but lets discuss this
<Mr_You> you expect to use above that amount anyways
<Mr_You> if not, you are having a slump in business.
<Mr_You> if you just need per project pricing, that is not the same as management pricing
<Mr_You> follow?
<Mr_You> ie. we provide services for your cost, such as monitoring, etc.
<drochaid> I'd still object
<Mr_You> single point of contact
<drochaid> either I get a fixed service plan regarless or I pay strict useage
<Mr_You> you get both.
<Mr_You> ie. if you need me to be available and monitoring and "daily maint.", that might be only $160/month.. 2 hours..
<Mr_You> but if you use beyond those 2 hours, an hourly charge begins
<drochaid> mm, maybe then
<Mr_You> seems to be you could drastically reduce onsite management
<Mr_You> s/be/me
<Mr_You> hmm
<Mr_You> pricing the way you were.. just a sec
<drochaid> of course, it doesn't help that I have little knowledge of what you're doing ;)
jamest (~jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<Mr_You> pricing the way you were mentioning.. it would be like paying seperately.. which is the same thing.. ie. $160 for daily services and another price for on demand service
<Mr_You> so I'll take that into consideration also
<Mr_You> or maybe $80 for daily services/month with minimum of one hour admin services.
<Mr_You> way cheap

<dneighbo_> hi mumpf 
<mumpf> hi dneighbro
<mumpf> i am having no gnue joy lately, CVS version (designer) doesn't even start.  
<mumpf> it says it can't find a module named Instance
<dneighbo_> ok lets start at beginning we will get you all fixed up :)
<dneighbo_> a. you are running cvs from (today)?
<dneighbo_> b. what platform(distro) ex: linux/debian, windows/xp
<mumpf> yes (cvs today). Debian woody.
<dneighbo_> ok
<dneighbo_> what version of python you using?
<mumpf> 2.1.3
<dneighbo_> ok
jhs (~jhs@cs6668105-78.austin.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo_> how did you 'install' cvs?
<dneighbo_> er once you grabbed cvs
<dneighbo_> how did you go about installing gnue?
<mumpf> run ,/setup.py install in common, edit the .conf files in /usr/local/gnue/etc, run  ./setup.py install in forms, designer, reports, navigator
<mumpf> i do that after efery CVS update.
<mumpf> today out of desperation I nuked /usr/local/gnue and started ./setup'ping from scratch.
drochaid_ (~drochaid@pc2-kirk1-2-cust175.ren.cable.ntl.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<mumpf> it used to work OK for me until a while ago (say 2 weeks). started to learn a bit about forms and getting frustrated abourt docbook docs :-)
<stbain> dneighbo: missed you last night by about 15 minutes
<dneighbo_> dont do that
<dneighbo_> mumpf if you are running cvs
<dneighbo_> in the root of cvs there should be setup-cvs.py or setup-cvs.sh (i cant recall which)
<mumpf> well, the docbook frustration is over: i got docbook-tools from debian and hey presto, docbook2ps and suxch work fine. There was an issue with jade but i can't be bothered to figure that one now that docbook-tools work.
<dneighbo_> run that instead
<dneighbo_> and answer the questions
<dneighbo_> this lets you run cvs and production at same time if needed and gives much greater controll of where things are and such
<dneighbo_> if you can run that and let me know when you have done so
<dneighbo_> then i can walk you through a few configuration tests
<stbain> dneighbo: looks like I'll be going to work for the rescue mission at a reduced salary w/ the understanding that I can use any and all spare/free time to a) build my consulting business and b) develop free software
<dneighbo_> and we can get you giong
<dneighbo_> stbain yummy
<stbain> they have NOLA installed
<dneighbo_> so they willing to use postgres and NOLA
<stbain> haven't started playing with it yet
<dneighbo_> did you install NOLA or acclite
<stbain> acclite
<stbain> w/ MySQL
<dneighbo_> yuck
<dneighbo_> :)
<stbain> hehe
<stbain> don't worry... once they play w/ it
<stbain> I'll convert the production installation to Postgres
<stbain> which brings me to my question for you
<stbain> do you have any sample companies that I can load in for them?
<dneighbo_> nope :(
<stbain> :/
<dneighbo_> i plan to start banging away with testing
<dneighbo_> and out of that i can end up witha  sample company :)
<stbain> time estimate?
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise ("bedtime").
<dneighbo_> nope
<dneighbo_> im displaced this week
<dneighbo_> on laptop w/ no software (thoght quickly getting it up to speed)
<dneighbo_> hopefuly by end of tonight
<dneighbo_> and then i will start grunting forward on acclite
<dneighbo_> last week dcl security fixes were my top priority
<stbain> you on vacation or something?
<dneighbo_> nope
<dneighbo_> im youth pastor at our church i couldnt escape for a full week to go to youth/kids camp so i sent my wife
<stbain> you're the youth pastor?
<stbain> that's cool
<dneighbo_> i have our two little ones, but take them to my parents house so they can watch while im at work (it happens to be on other side of town from my house and work is in the middle
<stbain> I'll probably start working w/ the youth dept. at my church when the school year starts again
<dneighbo_> so im just staying at their place rather drive my self to death

<dneighbo_> so on sunday i wiped red hat and installed debian on laptop
<dneighbo_> so its kind of bare bones
<dneighbo_> stbain : nope, i would like to get it though
<stbain> and since you're on a dialup, it will probably stay pretty bare bones, eh?
<stbain> hehe
<dneighbo_> its funny really as i never have 'desired' to be youth pastor
<stbain> my sister and brother-in-law have their M. Div. degrees, met at seminary
<dneighbo_> and at old church the pastor asked me to do it and i was really leary and said ok anyways as the group was small (under 5)
<stbain> wow... we have like... 30-50 active youth at my church
<dneighbo_> then moved and started giong to bigger church youth of about (100+) and the youth pastor asked me to be sponsor and next thing i know im preaching on sunday for htem
<stbain> lol
<stbain> from 5 to 100+
<stbain> nice transition
<dneighbo_> then we planted a church with some folks from there
<dneighbo_> and im very close to the pastor (being one of core families starting the church)
<dneighbo_> and am on council and such
<dneighbo_> and we had 1 youth age kid 
<dneighbo_> and they asked if on wednesdays if i would do a study with him, i said sure (not thinking this was going to be youth pastor thing)
<dneighbo_> i have been having about 6 regularly now and this weekend two new families are coming both with youth kids so now my group is about at 14
<dneighbo_> and some how im officially youth pastor
<dneighbo_> go figure
<dneighbo_> the funny part of the story is i've had all guy youth group for past 3 months or so
<stbain> good deal
<dneighbo_> always they complain no 'chicks'
<dneighbo_> so last week we prayed for 'ladies' and growth
<dneighbo_> that sunday 6 tall blondes show up to service
<dneighbo_> when i started teasing the boys, see God answers prayers
<dneighbo_> they said, you set this up didnt you?
<dneighbo_> and i was like nope, really i dont even know these families
<dneighbo_> i think im taking them all to mexico for mission work next month
<dneighbo_> that should be well interesting

<jamest> er
<jamest> s/production/fully installed
<jamest> s/cvs/running from cvs directory
<mumpf> i find gfdes from CVS  doesn't work, is that OK?
<dneighbo_> when you installed via the setup-cvs
<dneighbo_> it should have asked you where to put the files (by default it goes to your home dir)
<dneighbo_> so you would run ~/bin/gfdes

<siesel> hi Daniel
<ThreeSeas> Ok, what I'm wondering is about freedevelopers and is gnuenterprise  something along the same lines 
<ThreeSeas> ?
<chillywilly> no, gnuenterprise is an enterprise application framework
<chillywilly> http://www.gnuenterprise.org
<ThreeSeas> Oh, ok, what about freedevelopers.......is it really a dead stick?
<chillywilly> yes it is
<ThreeSeas> shouldn't something be said on the web page?
<chillywilly> various people were discussing it problems on dotgnu developers list recently
<chillywilly> it's dead to most Developers
<ThreeSeas> Ok who are you on the list?
<chillywilly> probably not to Tony, although nothing has been done with it in forever
<ThreeSeas> or have you posted recently.....

<Mr_You> heh
<SachaS> morning ajmitch
<ajmitch> morning? :)
<ajmitch> maybe for you
<drochaid> feasgar math, as I belive the saying goes
<SachaS> ah yeah.
<ajmitch> it is too
<SachaS> ajmitch: are you coming to Perth for the australian linux conference and present gnue?
<SachaS> ajmitch: conference is in January 2003
<SachaS> http://www.linux.conf.au :)
<ajmitch> i doubt that i could :)
<chillywilly> how far away is AU from NZ?
<SachaS> chillywilly, ajmitch: maybe 7 hours by plane, just around the corner
<ajmitch> SachaS: 3 hours from NZ to brisbane or syndey, i think
<SachaS> chillywilly: Perth is at the very west of australia.
<ajmitch> but perth is other side of the country :)
Action: ajmitch imagines rhys would be there, maybe myrddian
<ajmitch> hmm, could be some fun if i ever had the money :)
<drochaid> mar sin leat
Action: drochaid toddles off to bed
Action: drochaid is away: Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons, because you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.
<ajmitch> night drochaid
Action: chillywilly wires ajmitch some cash ;)
<ajmitch> chillywilly: it says that i'd need to be a good presenter & have a v.good technical knowledge of the subject
<ajmitch> abstracts are also due in 5 days ;)
<chillywilly> get to work then ;)
<ajmitch> *cough*
Action: ajmitch is a clueless newbie
<chillywilly> hehehe :)
<SachaS> chillywilly can come as well....
<SachaS> make some holidays in Australia and combine it with the linux conference
<ajmitch> "Abstracts are required for paper, tutorial and work in progress presentations. Abstracts should be up to 400 words and be submitted to the Paper Review Committee at the address lca-cfp@conf.linux.org.au."
Action: ajmitch would have to get *much* better at GNUe stuff before then
<SachaS> ajmitch: i think they are going to extend the date for abstracts
<ajmitch> and i'm a uni student, not a presenter ;)
<chillywilly> bah, for me they were one in the same
<chillywilly> don't they make you take a speech class ajmitch?
<SachaS> lol
<ajmitch> chillywilly: certainly not
<chillywilly> (one where you have to give speeches in public/class)
<chillywilly> ajmitch: wow, that sucks
<ajmitch> did that at HS
<chillywilly> ok
<ajmitch> we may have to present simnars to the class next year or later
<ajmitch> seminars
Action: ajmitch has to run out sometime soon
<chillywilly> well that's good
<chillywilly> if you do a senior project you will surely have to present it ;)
<ajmitch> and **** around with IE5
<ajmitch> yeah, i will
Action: ajmitch doesn't have much problem with that
Action: ajmitch is able to BS his way thru speeches :)
<chillywilly> well what I thought was cool about speech class is that we get to have a banquet at the end and everyone gives a speech
<chillywilly> s/get/got/
<chillywilly> and there's food and all that good stuff
<ajmitch> interesting
Action: ajmitch is just a simple student, none of that fancy guff
<chillywilly> I believ they made us take that class as a freshman or sophomore
<chillywilly> I don't recall
<chillywilly> or I suppose you can put it off until senior year like some people ;)
