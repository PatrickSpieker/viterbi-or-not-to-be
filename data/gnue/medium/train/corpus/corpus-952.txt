<derek> you running windows over there or what
<Vee2d2> hmm
<derek> come and go come and go
<Vee2d2> hehe
<jcater> derek: that is an interesting link
<jcater> always nice to know what's out there
Action: derek cant find a political niche i fit in 
<derek> im a loner i guess
<derek> i am all about liberties and am socialistic
<derek> which kicks me out of any republican, capitalist movements
<chillywilly> derek: http://www.americafirstparty.org!
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> yet i have strong religious beliefs which kicks me out of about everything else
<derek> i.e. it seems the 'smaller' parties are into supporting feminism, gay/lesbianism and other deviants
<jcater> chillywilly: they lost me on the second sentence
<derek> likely because they want to accomodate as much support as possible
<derek> and MOST people with their views dont have moral convictions against such things
<derek> anyhow
<derek> though people into freesoftware might find that link interesting
<derek> not endorsing them or anything
Action: derek just likes political debate ;)
<jcater> derek: there's a fine line between "endorsing" and "tolerating other ppls right to sin"
<jcater> I don't think a lot of the smaller parties endorse such things
<jcater> as much as, "who are we to judge"
<jcater> but it's too late to get into political debates
<jcater> so nevermind :)
<chillywilly> ?
<chillywilly> what second stance?
<jcater> sentence
<derek> :)
<derek> jcater: actually i agree with that statement
<jcater> about it being too late?
<derek> i just dont like that they are so flagship about it
<chillywilly> hmmm?
<derek> i.e. i actually agree with statement 'who am i to judge'

<Vee2d2> Brian: from cvs, https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=gnue-sb
<Brian> any other way apart from cvs?
<Vee2d2> not at the moment. 
<Brian> hmmm cvs looks a bit complex
<Vee2d2> dont let it be. It's really not that complicated. 
<Vee2d2> what sort of system are you using?
<Brian> i'm on win2k here at work
<Vee2d2> I dont know exactly how to help you, but I know others here use cvs from windows
<Vee2d2> What's your interest in the project?
<Brian> I want to look at it to see if it would suit the sort of system that we require or if we will require the full blown GNUe
<Vee2d2> What is it you do?
<Brian> I'm the IT Co-ordinator for an electronics recycling company
<Vee2d2> we're just getting started on it, so there's not much of a system at the moment. 
<Vee2d2> ahh, neat. 
<Brian> trying to find anything that is even nearly suitable is a nightmare - we are only a small company so SAP and the like is out of the question
<Vee2d2> yea, I feel your pain.
<Brian> not sure if GNUe-sb would fit the purpose either but was curious too see just the same
<Vee2d2> so you work out a relationship with a mfg, or large companies to take their old equipment, then repair what can be repaired, see it as refurbished goods, and scrap/recycle the rest?
<Vee2d2> s/see it/sell it/
<Brian> we dont technically
<Brian> we are basically a hub here in the UK - we collect product sort it and send it onwards for processing
<Vee2d2> I see. 
jbailey (~jbailey@atlas.fundserv.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Vee2d2> So I'm curious, what your needs from a system are? you dont really have any products, right?
<Vee2d2> morning jbailey
<jbailey> Heya Vee2d2
<Brian> well we do have products which we sort and well kind of sell to our parent company
<Brian> we bring in goods and split them into like types or strip them down depending on what they are
<Vee2d2> interesting. 
<Brian> Its kind of the reverse of a manufacturing process - instead of a Bill of Materials we have a Reverse Bill of Materials if you like
<Vee2d2> There's a pretty large electronics recycler not too far from here.. http://www.resourcecon.com/ but I never knew just what they did with the 'junk' they didnt refurbish.
<Brian> At the processing plant in Singapore all the nice stuff happens where boards get melted down and the precious metals etc are extracted
<Brian> www.citiraya.co.uk
<Vee2d2> so do you strip the boards down completely or is it ok that components are stull soldered on?
<Vee2d2> s/stull/still/
<Vee2d2> I'm unable to connect to that url atm.
<Brian> Its ok that components are still soldered on - there is more precious metals in the chips than the actual boards
<Brian> www.citiraya.com - thats the Singapore site - its full of flash though so its not that fast at loading
<Brian> hmmm looks like our webservers gone down - so much for 10 mins to go till finishing time
<V_laptop> =(
<Brian> ahhh - fixed page should now be available
<Brian> lol - I wondered what that bit of cat5 was for
<V_laptop> =)
<V_laptop> Brian: so what sort of system are you using to manage everything, now?
<Brian> errr don't laugh - Excel
<Brian> Accounts are done on Sage Line 50
<V_laptop> I use a spreadsheet atm too so I can understand.. =)
<Brian> we have around 20 different spreadsheets that just need to be put together into some king of system
<V_laptop> well.. I bet with some effort a gnue(-sb) solution is certainly possible

revDeke (www-data@alt1.libertydistribution.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> jbailey: well i upgraded gnue's dcl install to 0.9.2
<revDeke> it was using the  old deb package (and you thought no one was)
<revDeke> and it upgraded REALLY nicely
<revDeke> all the attachments and stuff are in a separate directory by default in the debian package :)
<revDeke> which was always a pain with tarball
<revDeke> i submitted a few 'minor' bugs on it
<revDeke> but am happy with outcome none the less
<jbailey> Cool.
<jamest> see, he loves you too.
<jbailey> I need to talk to some people to find out what I should do about automatic upgrades and stuff.
<revDeke> did you plan on doing debs for 0.4.3 of gnue?
Action: revDeke would love you to 
<revDeke> as 0.5.0 will probably be in the cooker a bit before its announced as stable
<revDeke> and we are getting ready to dig into gnue-sb pretty hard (the email lists have erupted since you so kindly turned them on) ;)
<jbailey> *lol*
<revDeke> and it will target 0.4.3
<V_laptop> oh
<jbailey> Glad to know they work.
<revDeke> until 0.5.0 is stable
Action: V_laptop hugs jbailey for fixing the lists
<revDeke> V_laptop: i got your email and LOVED it
<revDeke> will look at implementing stuff tonight
Action: revDeke thinks we found perfect gnue-sb candidate
<revDeke> one that is in irc as much as we are
<revDeke> and has the time to write detail emails on their needs
<revDeke> and not afraid to break some stuff :)
<revDeke> jcater: did you guys institute case insensitive queries in 0.4.3?
<jamest> no
<revDeke> that is where the db value might be Foo
<revDeke> but if i put foo in the entry and hit query it finds Foo
<revDeke> will this be in 0.5.x?
<revDeke> or would it be too rough to back port into 0.4.3
<revDeke> it is one of the reports i get a lot from people using the framework and i have hit myself once or twice
<revDeke> i remember talking about it back a few months ago, but i dont recall what you can jcater thought about it
<jamest> I'm pretty sure it's a trivial addition
<revDeke> thats what im thinking
<jamest> ilike support needs added to the GCondition/Datasource
<revDeke> probably a property in the entry or datasource (or both)
<jamest> i was thinking about this earlier this week actually
<revDeke> any chance you could throw in 0.4.3 without lots of work
<revDeke> and make it in 0.5.x as well
Action: revDeke isnt sure how far off 0.5.x is
<jamest> what I wasn't sure of if this would be a form level or per field level setting
<revDeke> thats only reason i ask
<revDeke> couldnt you make it either one of three
<revDeke> field
<revDeke> datasource
<revDeke> form
ToyMan (~stuq@170-215-205-41.glv.frontiernet.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> that is each could have a property?
Action: revDeke suspects for 'immediate' needs form level would get us buy
<revDeke> er by
<revDeke> as most people that want it, want it on all forms
<revDeke> fields, sources
<revDeke> but long term it would be nice to have tighter control
<jamest> i guess so but i was worried about too many additional options
<revDeke> but you know what is easiest to implement
<revDeke> jamest: i tend to agree
<revDeke> maybe doing
<revDeke> by form
<revDeke> with a gnue.conf option (so it sets it for all forms)
<revDeke> would be enough
<jamest> meaning I didn't want to just add it everwhere w/o knowing what people wanted it for
<revDeke> and we leave 'finer grain' control till someone cries they need it
<revDeke> i think that a gnue.conf option would almost be enough
<revDeke> as stated most people that want this, want it to be default behavior for all queries
<revDeke> er all forms
<revDeke> and it makes nice for me with gnue-sb 
<revDeke> as i can not put it in the form
<revDeke> and tell people if you want that turn on in gnue.conf :)
<jamest> i know jbailey also needed it
<jamest> so lets find out what he needs before I do anything
<jbailey> blue?
<jamest> also I'm kinda on a tight schedule till next week 
<jamest> but I'll see what I can do
<jbailey> jamest: My needs are mostly case insensitive matches to company names and people's names.
<revDeke> jbailey: you can have baby blue or royal blue
<jamest> what level?
<jamest> field, form, block
<revDeke> jbailey; you want on field, on datasource, on form or whole damn framework :)
<jamest> I'm not sure this should go in datasource 
<revDeke> ok s/block/datasource
Action: revDeke reminds jamest i still try to ignore fact blocks exist
<jbailey> I'd be happy if nothing were case sensitive - Anyone distinguishing only by case needs to be shot with a ball of their own shit.
<jbailey> (tm)
<revDeke> jamest: i think he just voted for whole damn framework
<jamest> i'd be happy if people wouldn't put mixed case data in the db
<jcater> um
Action: jcater must butt in
<jcater> there aren't many databases that support ilike
<jbailey> jamest: Can't do it - Some people get really irate when they're case isn't preserved in company names, etc.
Action: jcater only thinks of postgres
<revDeke> support ilike?
<jcater> case insensitive like
<jamest> ah damn, i thought that was sql92
<jcater> nope
<jcater> it might be sql99
<jcater> btu I don't think so
<revDeke> ah never heard of it
<jcater> but I know it's not sql92
<jamest> fsck, that complicates things alot
<jcater> yeah
<revDeke> figured you woudl be doing 'upper' on things
<jcater> that's why it's not there
<jcater> revDeke: that would kill any database
Action: revDeke didnt say it wouldnt
<revDeke> but like jbailey said people whine about all uppercase data
<revDeke> cause it doesnt look pretty in letters and on reports
Action: revDeke is very pro upper case data
<revDeke> entry
Action: revDeke is just relaying what i have heard gripes on
<jamest> that's why oracle created initcaps() 
<jamest> :)
<jbailey> That doesn't help McDonald, McDonald & Company.
<jcater> no
<jcater> we aren't saying it's not an issue
<jcater> but we are saying we can't just throw in upper() into the queries
<jamest> it's just going to take more thought
<jamest> i have no issue with forms doing it
<jamest> as my own users use mixed case data
<jamest> (grrrrrrrr)
<revDeke> gasp
<jcater> not mine
<V_laptop> what db doesnt have ilike or something like it?\
<jamest> so I hear about it as well
<jcater> oracle for one
Action: revDeke digs around in his box of torture tools
<revDeke> hmmm
<revDeke> that wont do
<revDeke> nope thats not evil enough
<jamest> my solution currently is to tell them they shouldn't used mixed case
<revDeke> ah... uncle fester's head vice
Action: revDeke hands it to jamest
<jamest> but that works about as well as me sitting in my office telling my mouse that
<jbailey> [Mm][Cc][Dd][Oo]... 
<jbailey> What that kill the DB, too?
<V_laptop> egads
<jamest> jbailey: um, i think mysql and postgresql are the only ones that could handle that
<jbailey> jamest: Microsoft SQL server, apparently.
Action: jamest blinks
<jamest> they do regex?
<jbailey> According to this web page..
<jbailey> "I saw it on the Internet, daddy, it must be true"
Action: jamest figured they'd do something non-std like replace / with \ 
<jamest> *cough*
<jbailey> Does it need to be just pushed down to the DB layer with a flag?
<jbailey> Then each DB can do it it's own way?

<Vee2d2> the only oracle solutions I seem to find are the use of lower() or upper() in the query
<revDeke> Vee2d2: what db do you plan on using?
<revDeke> better yet what platform do you use?
<Vee2d2> postgres
<revDeke> for client and server
<revDeke> i assume some gnu/linux distro for server?
<revDeke> and possibly client as well?
<Vee2d2> oh.. yea I run debian all around now.
<revDeke> yummy
<revDeke> you truly are the perfect candidate
<revDeke> if only there were sap-db packages for debian
<revDeke> we will start with postgres, but someday i might try to convince you to use sap-db instead for gnue-sb :)

Action: Vee2d2 reads irs tax guides.. 
<Vee2d2> blech
<jcater> gack
<jcater> so sorry
<derek> hmmm i think we have found someone sicker than us ;)
<derek> doh
<derek> its been a long time and i cant find my 'cheat' sheet
<derek> jcater:  you happen to remember the incantation to build .sql files from our gsd's?
<jcater>  derek, I have mine handy ... hang on...
<Vee2d2> I do
<jcater> 1+1 = 2
<jcater> 2+2 = 4
<jcater> 3+3 = 6
<Vee2d2> geeg:~> cat `which gsd-to-sql`
<Vee2d2> #!/bin/sh
<Vee2d2>  
<Vee2d2> GCVS="/home/vin/bin/gcvs";
<Vee2d2> CVS="/home/vin/cvs/gnue";
<Vee2d2>  
<Vee2d2> ${GCVS} ${CVS}/gnue/common/src/schema/scripter/Scripter.py $1 $2 $3 $4 $5
<jcater> oh, that cheat sheet
<Vee2d2>  
[23:07] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
Action: derek thought i put it in the README
<derek> Vee2d2: thats a nice little tool
<derek> i think i might put it cvs :)
<derek> grrr
<Vee2d2> dont have a ~vin ?
<Vee2d2> =)
<derek> seems installing common doesnt put Scripter.py anywhere
<derek> Vee2d2: i was going to modify that to point to 'typical' setup.py install install ;)
<derek> but a typical install doesnt install scripter.py :)
Action: derek thought jcater had a wrapper too that shortened that
<derek> ah gcvs
<jcater> Vee2d2: just an fyi
<derek> i see it in there now... me is blind :)
<jcater> ${GCVS} ${CVS}/gnue/common/src/schema/scripter/Scripter.py "$@"
<jcater> is same as
<jcater> ${GCVS} ${CVS}/gnue/common/src/schema/scripter/Scripter.py "$1" "$2" "$3" .....
<Vee2d2> ok.. =)
<jcater> not that I'm criticizing
<jcater> just an fyi :)
<derek> but i dont have a gcvs
<jcater> gcvs is an, erm, cvs testing tool
<jcater> so it's not installed
<derek> jcater: any ideas short of installing cvs
<jcater> for an immediate solution?
<jcater> just copy gnue-forms to gnue-scriptor
Action: derek both kind of
<jcater> and change the last line
<jcater> for long term
<derek> ?
<jcater> /usr/bin/gnue-forms
<derek> oh the file gnue-forms
<jcater> it's a script file
Action: derek was thinking directory at first
<derek> do you know eta's on 0.5.0
<jcater> yes
<jcater> not within 3 weeks
<Vee2d2> xmas
<derek> ok
<jcater> but probably before xmas
<jcater> seriously, though
<jcater> not within 3 weeks
Action: derek is thinking might end up with one more 0.4.x release
<jcater> but hopefully we can wrap up sometime shortly after that
<derek> as even when it ships i would be leary to move gnue-sb to it for a week or so until the dust settles
<jcater> I personally don't want to put any more effort into 0.4.x branch
<jcater> but you are welcome ti
<jcater> to
<jamest> I'm not doing a 0.4.x unless there is a showstopper
<jcater> it's not difficult to release one
<jcater> but I just can't see jamest or I sacrificing what little time we have on it
<jcater> well, seems jamest and I agree :)
<jcater> that's an oddity
<jcater> oh, wait... no
<jcater> it's an oddity when derek and I agree
<jcater> so scratch that
<jcater> =)
<derek> jcater: i didnt mean you and jamest :)
<derek> remember the idea is that as we get more users and more advancements
<derek> we will have to maintain a stable branch for longer and longer
<derek> from  gnue.forms.GFClient import *
<derek> if __name__ == '__main__':
<derek>         GFClient().run()
<derek>         
<derek> are the last lines of gnue-forms
<derek> whatt should i change it too for scripter
<jcater> um
<jcater> from gnue.common.src.schema.scripter import Scripter
<jcater> if __name__ == '__main__': 
<jcater>   Scripter().run()
<jcater> I would imagine
<jcater> err
<jcater> s/src./
Action: derek is thinking it didnt install scripter anywhere
<derek> but will try that
<jcater> then you have bigger issues
<derek> latitude:/home/dneighbo# locate Scripter.py
<derek> /home/dneighbo/cvs/gnue/common/src/schema/scripter/Scripter.py
<derek> /home/dneighbo/cvs/gnue040branch/gnue/common/src/schema/scripter/Scripter.py
<derek> latitude:/home/dneighbo# 
<derek> but i dont have 'installs' for those cvs versions
<jcater> um
<derek> im running from 0.4.3 tarball
<jcater> imho
<jcater> oh
<jcater> sigh
Action: derek is suspecting setup.py install for common didnt include anything for Scripter
Action: derek regrets not testing 0.4.3 better now
<derek> Vee2d2: i suspect you are running from a cvs install?
<Vee2d2> no, I installed the tarballs, too (4.3)
<derek> ?
<derek> you install tarballs using setup.py install?
<jcater> you want my $0.02 ????
<derek> yes
<Vee2d2> I used the cvs to convert the gsd's yea.. 
<jcater> built your .gsd against 0.5.0 common
<jcater> and include the .sql files in gnue-sb
<Vee2d2> because I was using cvs at the time
<derek> jcater: ok
<jcater> save yourself the effort of converting later (not that the format has changed... but still)
<jcater> I don't think it's worth your effort
<jcater> to spend all night (or more)
<derek> as long as Vee2d2 is cool with it
<jcater> getting 0.4.3 scripter.py to work
<derek> as he will likely be doing schema work as well
<jcater> as the end users probably don't want to generate their own .sqls anyway
<Vee2d2> I was cool with using cvs head before it got fsck'd.. =)
<derek> i dont suspect we will have other schema contributors for at least 4 - 6 weeks
<jcater> Vee2d2: is the scripter not working in cvs head?
Action: jcater didn't realize it was fscked
<jcater> or are you talking head in general?
Action: derek will test it in a minute
<derek> the scripter in head
<Vee2d2> no, I was saying in total.. not speaking of the scripter
<Vee2d2> I havent tried, but I suspect it still works
<derek> btw: can we make sure that it gets on a list somewhere that common 0.5.0 needs to install a gsd2sql tool :)
<jcater> you have my address
<jcater> and the local donut shop's phone number
<jcater> I think there might be a way
<derek> hmmm
<derek> head scripter might be broked
<jcater> Vee2d2: btw, I *promise* the "fscking" of head will be worth it
Action: jcater at least keeps telling himself that
<jcater> derek: what's it doing?
<derek> ./gsd2sql -v postgresql -o foo.sql item.gsd
<derek> yields
<derek> DB000:   File "/home/dneighbo/cvs/gnue/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/common/definitions/GParser.py", line 288, in startElementNS
<derek> DB000:     raise MarkupError, tmsg
<derek> DB000: gnue.common.definitions.GParser.MarkupError: Error processing <table> tag [invalid type for "name" attribute; value is "item"]
<derek> <?xml version="1.0"?>

<derek>   <table name="item">
<derek>     <fields>
<derek>       <field name="id" type="key" defaultwith="serial" nullable="N"/>
<derek> is start of that schema file
<derek> best i know this schema worked with 0.4.x
<Vee2d2> I'm sure it will, jcater.. and I wasnt complaining.. just saying I dont mind riding the edge, is all.. 
<jcater> hrm
<jcater> this is 0.5.0 common?
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue-sb/schema$ ./gsd2sql --version
<derek> GNUe Schema Scripter
<derek> Version 0.4.3.99
<derek> GNUe Common Version 0.4.3.99
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue-sb/schema$ 
Action: derek doesnt know what 0.4.3.99 means
<jcater> that's 0.4.x branch iirc
<derek> but /home/dneighbo/cvs/gnue/ was updated about 2 minutes ago and should be head
<derek> as
<jcater> erm, maybe not
<derek>  /home/dneighbo/cvs/gnue040branch/gnue/ is my branch copy of cvs
<Vee2d2> I just synced to head and get the same
Action: derek likes this Vee2d2 guy
<derek> its nice to have a 2 to 1 vote for once 
Action: jcater really didn't have time to work on schema stuff tonight
<jcater> sigh
<derek> assuming jamest finally went to bed ;)
<jcater> nah
<jcater> I think he's just better at tuning y;all out than I am
<derek> rofl
<jcater> s/;/'
<derek> i can just install cvs of the branch
Action: derek would rather see head fixed
<derek> er other parts of head fixed
<jcater> Vee2d2: are you getting that error w/the scripter too?
<derek> as this isnt pressing
<derek> <Vee2d2> I just synced to head and get the same
<jcater> I assumed that was same version #
<derek> oh
<jcater> did he mean same error?
<derek> you probably are right (about version not necessarily error)
<derek> jcater: can you slurp gnue-sb
<Vee2d2> it didnt like the name attribute in the <table> tag
<derek> if so grab lastest copy and run item.gsd through yoru cvs head
Action: derek notes that will be the nice thting about gnue-sb it should be easy for jcater to get cvs to recreate problems
<derek> Vee2d2: just a warning... i have this knack...
<jcater> nmice?
<jcater> nice?
<derek> i think jamest calls it a supernatural power
<jcater> how's that nice?
<jcater> never underestimate the power of denial
<Vee2d2> derek: for breaking things?
<derek> to break things in ways that are inconcievable to be broken
<derek> no normal people break things
<derek> my power goes beyond breakage
<derek> its not common to hear
<derek> "how the hell did you make it do that, i dont even see how it could do that"
<Vee2d2> derek: I've picked up on that. You ***REALLY*** remind me of a QC inspector named Karl in our QA department at the company I use to work for.
<Vee2d2> derek: he broke things all the time.. and believe me, I watched him closely and I still dont understand how it happened. 
<derek> jcater: you want me to revert to cvs04x for schema or you want to take time to look at head tonight
<jcater> oh bugger
Action: derek has no problem using cvs04x for schema only
<jcater> grrrr
<jcater> this is some i18n changes that were commited
<jcater> that break things
<jcater> ok
<jcater> update cvs head
<Vee2d2> weee.. workingness..
<derek> yeah
<derek> works
<derek> barring a 'you stupide l'american, do you not understand concept of locale's message'
<Vee2d2> yea.. =)
<derek> jcater: many donut praise to your name
Action: derek thinks perhaps we should change our marketing strategy to
<derek> gnue, the only place where you get head on demand?
<derek> nah
<jcater> gnue... where head gets better with age
<derek> Vee2d2: hopefully you will be up and no baby duty
<Vee2d2> derek: with any luck.. I just heard her semi cry, but a couple minutes have passed so I think she went right back to sleep
<derek> as im printing out your email as we speak
Action: derek thinks your wife must really like that you help with baby so much :)
<jcater> I hope y'all don't have any more incidents w/cvs tonight
<jcater> as I'm soooo tired
<jcater> I think I'm retiring for the night shortly
