Action: derek dials 1-800-4Donuts
<derek> hmmm seems like the MS branch closes at sunset
<derek> Vee2d2: you have 5 lu tables
<derek> i was going to make 6
<derek> my question is do you really have your sku as
<derek> C.14.4.20.1
<derek> or is it represented as
<derek> C144201
<derek> do you see a need for a 'free' form as well
<Vee2d2> yea, it's really delimited. that way I didnt literally lock myself into 2 digits per segment as I designed it to be. 
<derek> well lets start with what you need and we will adjust form there
<derek> hmmm
<derek> im thinking that the delimiter will be really evil for invoicing and such
<derek> i.e. i dont see delimiters for much of anything
<derek> on invoices and such i encounter
<derek> maybe i just seem them as - instead of .
<Vee2d2> and since I've opted to make my cross references mfg.model <-> ref, there's a much more likely need for that segment to be 3 digits
<Vee2d2> ahh, will the choice of delimiter I'm not married to.. 
<Vee2d2> s/will/well
Action: derek is just waffling here
<derek> goes back to not starting out too complex
<derek> as now it seems like this will need to be a choice
<derek> 'delimiter' or no delimiter
<derek> im planning on making the categories be 6 character varchar 
<Vee2d2> just as padding will need to be, I aggree
<derek> so if you want to use 1 digit or 6 you can
<derek> and somewhere will need to add a 'pad' routine :)
<derek> ok for now
<derek> im giong to make the fields big enough
<derek> but will plan on delimiting (not doing optoin not to)
<derek> and NOT padding
<derek> i figure those can be 'second pass' type items :)
<Vee2d2> suits me. =)
<derek> im getting lost in the email now
<derek> im with everythign until we get to 
<derek> The crossref table maps mfg.model <--> our-reference section
<derek> im somewhat lost from that point on
<Vee2d2> Ok 
<derek> are you trying to build in some filter mechanism here?
<derek> very generically im thinking
<derek> six category tables 
<derek> with a segment and a desc (As well as id)
<derek> then you have your item
<derek> and it has 
<derek> id
<derek> cat1 cat2 cat3 cat4 cat5 cat6
<derek> which holds the segments
Action: derek suspects will 'build' the number form the segments as well and store it in a field
<derek> even though it could be calculated (for flexibility) later on i imagine some folks will want free form ability
<derek> its the cross reference table here that is throughing me for a loop
<derek> i think i get what your driving at just not sure how to make it generic
<derek> did i lose you?
<Vee2d2> yea, I can see this as being specific to my needs. but I need to have a way to correlate my #'s to my vendor's #'s.. each vendor has their own system but the one thing that remains true is the mfg's #. So I rely on that. 
<derek> let me see if i can clarify what you are trying to do
<derek> basically take manufacturer and manufacturer number
<derek> and condense it to a smaller number
<Vee2d2> yes
<derek> to include as a part of your sku
<Vee2d2> exactly
<derek> ok here is what im thinking
<derek> family
<derek> manufacturer
<derek> mfg model
<derek> are probably going to be universal
<derek> that is people will probably want to 'group' product types
<derek> and everyone's product is manufactured by someone (even if its yourself)
<derek> this way we can create a xref table
<derek> as if all tables are generic we dont want to make 6 xref tables
<derek> actually i guess family could still be generic

<derek> so what if i make
johannes (~johannes@M697P006.adsl.highway.telekom.at) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> manufacturer table and mfg model number (which is really an Xref table)
<derek> then 4 generic 'category' tables
<derek> will this work for you?
<Vee2d2> I'm trying to digest it
<derek> of course manufacturer table should be more than
<derek> id
<derek> segment
<derek> desc
<derek> but i want to get something usable quick
<derek> and doing full contact tables for manufacturer at this point makes me shudder a bit
<derek> are your manufacturers and vendors one in the same
<Vee2d2> no
<Vee2d2> not at all.. 
<derek> and do you know if in manufacturing they usually are?
<derek> ok
<derek> so manufacturer would be 'nike'
<Vee2d2> I might be able to source a mfg's goods through multiple vendors, and in fact that is the problem
<derek> even though you buy from 'sport shirt world'
InsanitY (~insanity@213.51.196.60) left irc: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)
<derek> i.e. sport shirt world is your vendor
<Vee2d2> right
<derek> so having 'manufacturer' information beyond product details likely isnt too important
<derek> i.e you dont have contacts at nike and dont deal 'directly' with them
InsanitY (insanity@co58147-a.olden1.ov.home.nl) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Vee2d2> well.. I could, but that's not important to me.. I would set them up as a vendor and treat them as such if I did
Action: derek is just trying to guage if that manufacturer table needs to at this point me more complicated than a mfg name
<derek> i suppose for now it need not be and if it becomes important we fix it :)
Action: derek has to keep telling self

<derek> Vee2d2: ok i think most of the lu_* forms are updated
<derek> excpet for lu_item_mfg_model.gfd
<derek> they probably lack polish and havent been fully tested but they connect to the tables and have all the fields :)
<derek> getting late but with some luck i think i can get lu_item_mfg_model.gfd pushed out and possibly update item_maint.gfd to reflect all the new tables
<Vee2d2> I'll give 'em a lookee in a bit
<derek> you have some 'testing' time tonight :)
<derek> or you running off to bed pretty soon
<Vee2d2> fairly soon.. 
<derek> btw: there is
<derek> item_mfg
<derek> item_mfg_model
<derek> which were your sku_mfg and sku_xref
<derek> then there are 
<derek> item_group item_type item_category item_class
<derek> which are the four 'generics'
<derek> category is slightly different as a generic as it has a 'parent' attribute
<derek> so you could have nested categories
<derek> for reporting purposes
<derek> the other tables might have use for that as well, but its in category only cause it already existed there :)
<derek> you realize documenting this stuff will be more of bitch than writing it :)

<chillywilly> what's a good way to get a "stable" checkout of gnue?
<chillywilly> cvs co -r gnue-tools-0-4-0 gnue ?
<jamest> no that easy
<chillywilly> or pull head and downgrade various modules?
<jamest> for name in forms,reports,common do
<chillywilly> cd forms; cvs update -r forms-0-4-3-release...etc.
<jamest>   cd $name; cvs update -Pdr $name-0-4-1-branch
<jamest> done
<chillywilly> what about
<chillywilly> pre-jamestui-muckup?
<chillywilly> is that "newer"
<jamest> that's 0.5.0 with some changes to the event system in prep for the ui muckup
<chillywilly> so no good eh?
<jamest> so I'd call it untested

<jamest> after over 1 year of trying I was finally able to cause major designer breakage
<jamest> ususally that damn thing just worked no matter what I did to forms
<chillywilly> yea, but you did it backasswards ;)_
<chillywilly> you changed the forms format
<chillywilly> that's the easy way ;)
<jamest> no, no designer supported that
<chillywilly> so should I add designer to the list of modules for that branch?
<chillywilly> is there a way to check out a module under a different name in cvs or can I just mv it? I don't recall...and I am being derek-like today ;P

Action: pattieja is back (gone 14:36:35)

<chillywilly> route add -net xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx netmask 255.255.255.0 dev ethx

<chillywilly> he wats certain traffic to go out eth0 and other traffic to go out ppp
<chillywilly> I think
<chillywilly> based on IP address
<chillywilly> does that make sense?
<chillywilly> route add ppp-gw gw <IP> ?
<chillywilly> then

Action: chillywilly wouldn't know
<dsmith> chillywilly: They have been around a while.  We've used them for years.
<dsmith> chillywilly: webmin is nowhere near as nice as the cobalt gui
<dsmith> chillywilly: The big bosy make similar things.  They are call "Network Attached Storage".
<dsmith> s/bosy/boys/
<dsmith> s/call/called/
<chillywilly> anyone should be able to do the same as the cobalt server...I can't imagine it would be that hard
<chillywilly> and it would be best as Free software
<chillywilly> hey guys I am reading this by Norbert: http://freestrategy.info/
<dsmith> chillywilly: It's actually running RedHat 6.2 . But the gui is not free. :(

<derek> jcater: what you using for pos at bookstore?
<jcater> a LanePOS+GNUe mutation
<jbailey> Piece of Shit?
<chillywilly> no, that's PoS not POS
<derek> well thats questionable
<derek> most of the free POS are PoS as well
<derek> the +GNUe mutation suggests to me that jcater picked the least of the worst
<derek> er best of the worst
<jbailey> Hey - I noticed that the windows port has a gnue front end to the connections.conf file - Is that available on Unix systems?
<chillywilly> it's a db driver, IIRC
<chillywilly> a db driver to edit config files
<chillywilly> should work everywhere
<chillywilly> erm, well that form uses that driver
<derek> huh
<derek> i thought we had a .gfd to edit them
<derek> which worked on any platform gnue worked on?
<chillywilly> right that's what I just said
<chillywilly> inh a round-about way
<derek> where has aj the mitch been lately?
<derek> chillywilly: you got a minute
<derek> maybe jbailey can help too
<derek> here is current "route"
<derek> Kernel IP routing table
<derek> Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
<derek> 192.168.0.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
<derek> default         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
<derek> latitude:/home/dneighbo/cvs/gnue-sb/item/forms# 
<derek> if i dialup pppd
<derek> net and ppp dont work
<derek> if i do a route del default
<derek> then dial up ppp
<derek> ppp works
<derek> but net doesnt
<chillywilly> right
<derek> i can then do a dhclient and net will start working again, but ppp wont
<chillywilly> cause they bioth want to be the default route
<derek> doing a route del default will make ppp work again
<chillywilly> you need to add a static route for ppp
Action: derek needs to know how to make net be the default
<chillywilly> like so
<chillywilly> route add ppp-gw gw <IP>
<chillywilly> then
<derek> and ppp only take traffic requests for 156.x.x.x or whatever
Action: derek notes this is a REAL bitch cause we have uber security
<derek> where i have a hand held device that assigns me a password
<chillywilly> route add -net <IP> netmask <netmask> gw <IP>
<dsmith> Dosn't ppp automaticlaly add a defualt route?
<derek> if i fail authentication with it, its a 30 minute process to get it reset by the home office
<derek> dsmith: yes it does
Action: dsmith remembers somehting like that
<chillywilly> right and so does the dhcp client
<dsmith> You can only have *one* default route.
<chillywilly> thus they don't want to wokr together
<chillywilly> work*
<chillywilly> in ppp there's an options file
<chillywilly> I think you can tell it to not add a default route
<dsmith> It's the route when you have no other route to that ip.
<chillywilly> then you can add a static route for ppp and then have whatever subnet use that route
<chillywilly> default is used last if there's no other way...but you can turn it off I think in /etc/ppp/options file
<dsmith> Yeah, dont have ppp add a defualt route, and add a static route in one of the hook scripts.
Action: derek doesnt want to break something that is working
<derek> i.e. if you cant say 'do this exactly'
<derek> im leary to do it
<derek> as while it sucks having to switch at least i can
<derek> if i break it im screwed
<derek> as i wont be able to get into work :)
<dsmith> From pppd man page:
<dsmith>        defaultroute
<dsmith>               Add a default route to the system routing tables, using the peer
<dsmith>               as the gateway, when IPCP negotiation is successfully completed.
<dsmith>               This  entry  is removed when the PPP connection is broken.  This
<dsmith>               option is privileged if the nodefaultroute option has been spec-
<derek> best i can remember if i have ethernet up
<dsmith>               ified.
<derek> and run kppp it doesnt add a default
<chillywilly> what is the network info?
<derek> if i kill default route
<derek> before starting kppp it does
<derek> also note i have a gateway in this mix
<chillywilly> add nodefaultroute
<derek> as evidenced by the route i pasted to you
<chillywilly> to the options file
<derek> chillywilly: i do everything via kppp
<chillywilly> this shoudl NOT breaknaything except ppp
<derek> so im not sure i can
<chillywilly> which cna be fixed
<derek> btw: i tried not using kppp and pppd sucks weenie
<chillywilly> by removeing it
<chillywilly> pon/poff
<chillywilly> should work
<chillywilly> you're doing PPPoE right?
<derek> i have no idea
<derek> i open kppp
<chillywilly> PPP over ethernet
<derek> and click connect
<derek> no im DIALING out
<chillywilly> over existing connection?
<chillywilly> oh, ok
<chillywilly> stilll go into /etc/ppp and add nodefaultroute to the options file
V_laptop (~vin@c66.169.136.41.ts46v-07.otn-c1.ftwrth.tx.charter.com) left irc: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)
<chillywilly> or, use kppp and tell it not o add a default route
<chillywilly> s/o/to
<chillywilly> (this reslly shouldn't hurt and you can change it back easily)
<dsmith> In
<dsmith>        most cases the defaultroute and/or proxyarp options are sufficient  for
<dsmith>        this,  but  in  some  cases  further  intervention  is  required.   The
<dsmith>        /etc/ppp/ip-up script can be used for this.
<chillywilly> yes dsmith I used the script dirs for all my dyanmic IP hacks back in da day
<chillywilly> ;)
<dsmith> I used to have the ip-up script ftp a generated web page of the just-connected ip address.
<chillywilly> me too
<derek> too much chatter
<derek> so just add
<derek> nodefaultroute
<chillywilly> make ppp not add a default route
<derek> to /etc/ppp/options
<derek> then try to connect?
<dsmith> yep
<chillywilly> yea
<dsmith> And add the static route in /etc/ppp/ip-up (and remove it in /etc/ppp/ip-down)
<derek> grrr
<derek> i already started to connect
<chillywilly> can't you disconnect after it's done?
<derek> hopefully this doesnt butcher stuff too 
Action: dsmith yanks derek's modem from the wall

<derek> sigh
<chillywilly> ?!?
<derek> no i will likely have to go through the 30 minute phone hell to have my activcard reset
Action: derek knew i shouldnt have dorked with it
Action: dsmith plugs the modem back in
<derek> Feb 28 15:29:46 latitude pppd[14124]: defaultroute option is disabled
<derek> from the log
<chillywilly> right :)
<chillywilly> but you did nto sucessfully authenticate?
<dsmith> Sounds good.
<dsmith> derek: Don't give up. It's not really that hard.
dsmith (~dsmith@borg.altus.cc) left irc: "later.."
<chillywilly> dsmith: he's cursed so he ALWAYS expects the worst
<derek> ok i think i see what might have happened
<derek> there is option in kppp
<derek> i removed in options file
<derek> which disabled it
<chillywilly> right
<chillywilly> I was gonna say I think you can do it in the gui
<derek> and then the client probably passed parameter to execute it
<derek> which confused it
<chillywilly> lemme install kppp once
<derek> dsmith: only reason i get irrated is it takes 30 minutes to reset active card after every failure :(

<chillywilly> why did it fail?
<chillywilly> hmmm, I already have kppp installed
Action: chillywilly fires it up
<chillywilly> heh, it crashes or something
<chillywilly> oh I can only run it as root
<derek> ok
<derek> password reset

<derek> i.e. i attach to few machines with 156.88.x.x

<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> prolly IP
<derek> but how will it know when to use that?
Action: derek doesnt understand kernel routing at all
<chillywilly> well I need to get this right here....
<derek> but i would suspect there needs to be something
<chillywilly> it'll see the IP header and say throw it out this interface
<derek> that tells it for this ip (or range of ips) go this way
<derek> otherwise use the default
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> firts it needs another GW entry
<chillywilly> for your peer
<chillywilly> then
<chillywilly> nased on you IP on your end of the ppp
<chillywilly> based*
<chillywilly> you say go out that gateway
<chillywilly> basically
<chillywilly> just have to get the syntax correct
<chillywilly> well try this once
