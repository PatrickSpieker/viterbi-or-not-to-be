<jcater> of course, every day I don't use windows is a day I wonder how I ever did
<jcater> it's the small, odd things that make me cringe when I have to go back
<chillywilly> V2!
<aaron___> i load up windows to test what the end user will see, thats about it anymore
<jcater> mike!
<dsmith> Emacs was the very first "full screen" editor.  Everything before was "line editors".
<chillywilly> emacs is life
<chillywilly> ...
<jcater> dsmith: and today, emacs is the perfect "full memory" editor!
<chillywilly> ummm, and I thought emacs WAS the OS ;)
<chillywilly> I know ppl who are sick enough to run emacs as their login shell
<dsmith> heh
<aaron___> lol
<dsmith> It's a "windowing system" too.
<derek> i want to say it was born in 81 ...
<derek> oh snot
<derek> emacs was started in 1974
<jcater> dang
<derek> gack its same age as i am
<chillywilly> it's slightly older than me
<jcater> wow
<jcater> I guess good things do bloat w/age
<aaron___> lol
Action: jcater ducks

<jcater> man

<jcater> is quite sickening
<chillywilly> why'
<jcater> you read their philosophy page?
<jcater> Our goal is to make it possible for developers to provide the functionality businesses need for 1/10th of the cost and still make twice as much money. Adding up those numbers it is clear that much more than a free base package is needed.
<derek> jcater: i had to stop at the business plan
<jcater> that's the primary goal?
<jcater> bleh!
<jcater> I'm all for making a living and all that
<derek> as my wife said if i puked on the office floor one more time

<aaron___> do you peeps coordinate with dotgnu?

<jcater> I'd say we are a well-balanced group
<jcater> we openly talk occasionally
<jcater> I'd say we have good relations w/them
<jcater> but aren't directly working together

<havoc> esv: They do, they just choose to ignore it
<havoc> esv: it is far easier to be led than to think independently

<reinhard> i don't know any torture that works over the internet
<esv> havoc: does that explains the M$ success?
<havoc> reinhard: talking to 12yr old AOLusers
<havoc> esv: partially if you think about it
<havoc> esv: would you consider spendint 3x more than necessary an "intelligent" descision?
<havoc> I think (sociologically speaking) that most people actually fear choice, they want their options and actions restricted
<havoc> which is self-destructive
<havoc> I could be wrong of course
<havoc> And I often entertain that possibility
<havoc> In fact I often hope I am wrong, and that there is a method to Humanity's madness
<havoc> Nothing to do I suppose but try to change what we can, and not sweat what we can't
Action: esv cant access more than half of its prefered web sites.
<havoc> geez, I can't believe how many of these .ws spams I've gott since Monday
<havoc> 30+ of the same damn message in less than two days
<esv> hey, where do I learn to use an IDE such as GNUe, I dont seem able to get to any search engine today

<jcater> lol
<jcater> this quote on slashdot is classic
<jcater> What amazes me about America is NOT that we seem to be a nation of whores, but that we are a nation of cheap whores.
<havoc> heh
<havoc> it's not just us though
<jbailey> jcater: Thinking of which.  Is it true that your president has decided that he doesn't like France now?
<jcater> jbailey: I will not comment on our president
<jbailey> I mean, sheesh.  You'd think he'd pick on a country that's won a war at least once...
Action: jbailey hides.
<havoc> GWB is a moron.
<havoc> Buff said
<jcater> as my mom said, if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all
<havoc> Nuff
<chillywilly> jcater: :)
<jcater> I seriously don't have a SINGLE nice thought about him
<jcater> I try

Action: chillywilly thinks of a freeniode radio song where they talk about "elist nerdy shmucks"
<jamest> um
<jamest> he's going to have a very positive impact on the bottom line of serval of america's largest defense contractors
<chillywilly> wooohooo!
<jbailey> jamest: Well, lockhead martin should be happy then. =)
<jamest> exactly
<jcater> chillywilly: I wasn't trying to be elitist
<jbailey> And boeing, I guess.
<jamest> that's sorta positive for at least some people
<chillywilly> I wasn't implying that about you
<jcater> I just can't think of a single point I agree with him on
<chillywilly> it was a side comment in reference to something you said to someone here
<chillywilly> earlier
<jcater> ah
Action: chillywilly read the back log
<chillywilly> anyway
<chillywilly> I am kidding
<jbailey> Well, I haven't looked recently but a few months ago, he was still terribly popular with the citizens.
<chillywilly> jbailey: he'snot

<havoc> heyya, esv
<havoc> my friend from .mx was over today
<havoc> he did his very first linux install :)
<jbailey> .mx?
<havoc> Mexico
<jbailey> Did he start screaming C#!  I must have C#!
<jbailey> ?
<jbailey> =)
<havoc> he's kindof a newbie
<havoc> just got his BS CS
<havoc> trying to hire him, but it's a nightmare :(
<havoc> It would be much easier if him and his woman would just get married already
<jbailey> If he's got his BS CS, what's the problem?
<jbailey> Hire him under Chap 16 of Nafta.
<havoc> jbailey: hmm, I looked into a TN, but apparently it's on for Canadians now
<havoc> s/on/only/
<jbailey> Ah, too bad.
<jbailey> That's how I usually work in the US. =)
<havoc> a PITA
<jbailey> I hadn't realised there were restrictions on Canadian vs. Us.  Silly.
<havoc> jbailey: you Canadian, hey?
<havoc> INS is a nightmare :(
<jbailey> It's not hey, its 'eh.
<jbailey> Get it right, dude.
<jbailey> Or I'll feed you some poutine.
<jbailey> =)
<havoc> heh, I'm in WI, a little piece of Canada in the US :)
<havoc> ay?
<jbailey> =)
<jbailey> I was in Madison 9 days ago.
<jbailey> Well, just outside.
<jbailey> Somewhere past the American Bull Sperm sign.
<havoc> heh, I'm ~55min from there
<havoc> and my lil Bro lives there
<havoc> party town
<havoc> many many bars
<jbailey> Cool.  We were on a lake.  It was frozen, very cool.  I had never walked on water before.
<havoc> heheh
<esv> hi, sorry I gog caught
<havoc> you're from Canada and you've never been ice fishing?
<esv> cool.
<jbailey> Ice fishing?  Why would I fish for ice?  I can grow my own.
<havoc> heh
<jbailey> Unless it's like meat where it supposedly tastes better if its wild.
<havoc> or snowmobile racing
<jbailey> I don't buy that though.
<jbailey> Too likely that some bear urinated on it.
<jbailey> What it George Burnard Shaw who said: "I don't drink water, fish fuck in it." ?
<havoc> brb
<esv> s/gog/got/

Action: esv means amerian as US Citizen.

<jbailey> no ppl here.
<jbailey> just hax0rs.
<jbailey> that all happen to pass the turing test.
<jbailey> well, except derek.
<jbailey> His vocab seems limited to "are new debs out yet?", and "i broke something!"
<jbailey> =)
<esv> I use to say that (the broke thing) last year, while trying to automate a mill and lathe
<esv> well, accually replace the control unit
<esv> s/accually/actually/
<havoc> wow, really snowing out

<havoc> heh, in the basement I can *feel* the plows go by on the street
<jbailey> Not snowing yet.
<jbailey> It's supposed to.
<havoc> this is the biggest "storm" we've had all year
<havoc> 2" so far
<jbailey> If only.
<esv> 75F here.
<jbailey> The weekend I was in Madison we got something like a foot.
<havoc> we've had almost no snow this year
<havoc> jbailey: yeah, but I'm in this strange weather pocket where we've gotten ~8" (10" now) all year
<havoc> up north has gotten feet
<havoc> esv: heh, I like it up here
<havoc> the cold doesn't bother me too much
<havoc> used to live in Minot, ND
<havoc> everyone around where I live is pretty pissed about the lack of snow though
<havoc> I bet there are a lot of people calling in sick/late for work tomorrow ;)
<havoc> everyone with a snowmobile that is
<havoc> I feel bad for anyone who bought a new sled this year
<havoc> or a new plow/snowblower
<havoc> even Canada has been having strange weather this year
<havoc> well below average snowfalls
<esv> well, NY City got its share too, with lots snow, two/three weeks ago.
<dsmith> Hmph.  I got stuck in my driveway several times this winter.
<esv> we dont get snow at all, we're lucky if we get enough water, this year was an excellent one.
<esv> hey, what are the gpd's?
<jamest> process definitions for gnue-navigator
