<derek> sup Vee2d2
<chillywilly> blah, there's like 3-4 more inches of snow that I still have to get off the driveway now
<Vee2d2> chilly, jbailey
<derek> jbailey: where are my debs
<derek> this thing is broken
<chillywilly> HEH
Action: derek is teasing jeff for his comments the other day ;)
<jbailey> chillywilly: Has it stopped snowing there?  It's still going here.
<chillywilly> now that's a greeting if I ever heard one
<jbailey> derek: See?
<jbailey> derek: Exactly like I said! =)
<jbailey> Hey V
<derek> jbailey: think of it this way
<chillywilly> jbailey: ys, it has stopped but it kept going on after I shoveled yesterday
<derek> as long as you make debs for packages i use
<jbailey> chillywilly: It hasn't stopped here yet.
<derek> you know you will always have email ;)
Action: derek needs to get to work
<jbailey> Work?  Bah!
Action: derek is away: work

<jbailey> Anyone know of a good online LDAP tutorial or a paper book?
<jbailey> I'd rather not spend more than 50EUR or so.
<jbailey> (I should figure out how to make the euro symbol, hmmm...)
<chillywilly> home depot was bought by M$ man
<jbailey> What?  Really?
<chillywilly> erm, in a figurative ense
<chillywilly> they went with M$ software after billy g threw them some cash
<havoc> that sucks
<havoc> home depot used to use linux
<dsmith> havoc: 
<chillywilly> time for a boycott ;)
<jbailey> chillywilly: Everyone here boycotts Home Depot anyway. =)
<havoc> chillywilly: no, they're gonna need the extra revenue now ;)
<chillywilly> who cares if they need it, they shouldn't have let Billy G buy them
<havoc> it's their choice
<dsmith> havoc: We could start our own home-imrovement store using Linux.  With the moneyt we'll save, we'll drive 'em out of buisness.
<havoc> it's disappointing, but it's still their choice
<chillywilly> and it is also my choice not to spent money there and tell others not to either
<havoc> they were using linux for their POS for ~5yrs though
<chillywilly> that's capitalism

<chillywilly> there's an ODL parser

<harryF> chillywilly: acutally, I'm striving for an OQL -> SQL tool
<harryF> chillywilly: so let me know when you're ready with the OQL stuff ;)
<chillywilly> I see
<dsmith> harryF: a quick google search tunred up "castor" as the first link.  A oql -> sql tranlator in Java.  BSD license.
<chillywilly> now wouldn't that depend on your object to relational mapping? ;P
<jbailey> harryF: OQL->SQL is a non-trivial mapping.
<harryF> dsmith: thanks, I found a bunch of Java solutions, but no C/C++
<harryF> chillywilly: sure, I'm writing one at the moment and try to spice it up with OQL :)
<jbailey> Easier to have an underlying object store and choose what your flat database would be on top of that, I think.
<chillywilly> harryF: anything here would be written in python ;)
<harryF> jbailey: yes, but I have to retrieve the objects at some point, so a pluggable OQL parser with some hooks would be nice.
Action: harryF feels like the only non-python developer on this planet
<jbailey> Hmm.  It would be fun to dust off gnusql again someday and do things like have it be OQL based instead.
<chillywilly> well the ODL parser I wrote use PLY
<chillywilly> python lexx/yacc
<chillywilly> but it doesn't really parse into anything just has hook methods based on thegrammar rules
<chillywilly> there's much opposition to the ODMG standard within the development ranks here ;)
<chillywilly> (well excluding me)
<harryF> chillywilly: parts of ODMG are not bad, the OQL could be implemented as "optional" feature into any persistence library, if only there would be a free parser :)
<jbailey> I like ODMG. =)
<jbailey> I learned it before I learned SQL, though.

<jamest> derek
<derek> i would be much more likely to start with NOLA
Action: derek assumes people liking sql-ledger will like it an GNUe isnt for them
<derek> those wishing to have something they can extend and has clean data structures
<derek> will look for gnue-sb
Action: derek isnt saying sql-ledger is non usable
<derek> its very nice for the market that is using it
<derek> it certainly is more functional than gnue-sb and there is something to be said for working code :)
<jamest> derek: head should work again for the most part
<jcater> derek: fwiw, I think he said target it's feature set, but ignore the crappy schema and code
<jamest> in wx mode
<jamest> that's what he said
<jamest> anyway, i wouldn't attempt to use head in production
<jamest> or for gnue-sb as I hear you're close to a release
<jamest> but it would be nice for you to use the converter and test
<derek> jcater: well my point is they have an accounting system and one of the features they lack is being able to reconcile a ledger
<derek> imho thats NOT a feature set i wish to mimic ;)
<derek> jamest: if its that close
<derek> i will not release
<derek> i will wait for 0.5.x
<derek> to be ready for production
<derek> what i mean by that that
<derek> is i will use gnue-sb as a 'testing tool'
<jamest> i wouldn't
<derek> i.e. upgrade the forms
<jcater> derek: I don't disagree with your analysis of SL
<jcater> you know that
<jamest> I doubt i'd use 0.5.0 in production
<derek> use designer and such
<jamest> well, i will
<jcater> I was just pointing out his points
<derek> jamest: im not 'pushing' to release gnue-sb
<jamest> i won't encourage others to
<jcater> s/points/view
<derek> if you guys want 0.5.x tested
<derek> so it can be 'released' 
<derek> i will do gnue-sb with it
<derek> if its not ready for testing yet
<derek> i will stick with 0.4.3
<derek> if that makes sense
<V_laptop> let's do it derek! =)
<derek> if you are willing to bundle head as 0.5.0-prelease
<derek> i will move gnue-sb to 0.5.0

<derek> jamest so what is your take
<jcater> wtf does that mean?
<derek> you up for moving to 0.5.0
<derek> i.e. you willing to let the sharks (v and me) start beating on it
<derek> or would you rather not face bug reports just yet :")
<V_laptop> we'll be moving to 0.5.0 anyway so I think it's better to do it sooner than later even if it does mean the tools may be a bit unstable it'll get worked out eventually..
<derek> jcater: means they have 'voices' set to off

<jamest> there are a ton of changes under the hood

<derek> jcater: technical mysql isnt SQL ;)
<V_laptop> 0 results
<jemfinch> I want keys to be able to have more than one fact associated with them.
<jamest> derek: I don't think tarballs are doable at this time
<jamest> but we will need testing to prep for a release
<jemfinch> so there's a keys table with (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, key TEXT, locked BOOLEAN) and a factoids table with (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, key_id INTEGER, added_by TEXT, added_at TIMESTAMP, fact TEXT)
<derek> jamest: hmmm, the only reason i need tarballs is i need to be able to point gnue-sb folks to a 'static' copy of gnue that is known to work with gnue-sb
<jamest> I'm going to go out on a limb and say 0.5.0 in under a month pending a good testing cycle
<derek> so maybe its best to wait a little
Action: derek would really like to use gnue-sb to do that testing :(
<esands> derek: As I've said before Nola is only useful for the USA. Personally having looked at the code for both I perfer SL over Nola.  Anyway, if you can basic invoicing, both for income and expenses without stock I'm sure you'll find people to test it 
<jamest> and pending jcater, btami, jamest, (and friends) free time
<derek> but probably wont be able to based on what you said
<jemfinch> so given a key, I want to find all the facts that match that key.
<jcater> jemfinch: what's the question?
<jcater> (err, nevermind :)
<esands> anyway. I'm not suggesting using SL's code base or methodology.  Regardless you'll need to match most of their feature set for gnue-sb to be useful.
<jemfinch> so I'm guessing I need to JOIN, but I don't know how.
<jamest> lol, without good solid testing we may be pushing more than a month
<derek> esands: im not worried about usefulness problems i think we have 3 or 4 real live users that will keep us honest in that regard
<derek> already in about 10 - 15 hours of discussion and coding i think we might have the most power 'free software' product database ;)
<jcater> jemfinch: the typical SQL way would be
<jcater> select fact from factiods, keys 
<jcater> where key_id = keys.id and 
<jcater> key = 'some key'
<jemfinch> ah, ok.
<jemfinch> I had something similar.
<jcater> I'm not sure if SQLite supports those kinds of joins or not
<jcater> I think it does, but am not sure
<jemfinch> we'll see soon :)
<jemfinch> are you sure I don't need to qualify fact?
<jemfinch> make it factoids.fact?
<V_laptop> jem: could use just 1 table and just enter multiple rows with the same key to reference several locations
<jemfinch> V_laptop: I think this way is more "normalized," though, isn't it?
<jcater> jemfinch: actually, that's a good habit to get into
<jcater> but usually if there isn't a namespace conflict, you don't have to
<jemfinch> what?  qualifying the field name?
<jemfinch> ah, ok.
<V_laptop> jem: *shrug* 
<dsmith> jemfinch: Yeah, why do you need two tables?
<jemfinch> dsmith: it's just more normalized that way.  Technically more scalable, not that it matters for an IRC bot.
<jemfinch> at least, as I understand normalization, that is.
<derek> well there are different forms of normalization
<derek> and it boils down to reasonableness
<jcater> jemfinch: it's only more normalized if you add more information to the keys table
<derek> one could make ever field another table
<derek> and be normalized than ever
<dsmith> Ahh. ok.
<jemfinch> jcater: why do you say that?
<jcater> derek: that's stretching the definitions a little :)
<jcater> but point taken
<V_laptop> in this case I dont see 2 tables doing anything but complicating matters..
<jemfinch> you're probably right.
<jcater> derek: I don't follow your logic wrt using 0.5.0 vs 0.4.3
<jemfinch> but it gives me an oppurtunity to learn more about SQL :)
<jcater> you are introducing a chicken vs egg problem
<jcater> when I imagine we'll both be ready to release at about the same time
Action: jcater doesn't see you doing a meaningful release in the next 2 weeks
<jemfinch> you guys are helpful.  What exactly is Gnu Enterprise?
<V_laptop> me either, so I'm all for using 0.5.0
<V_laptop> =)
Action: V_laptop does the unstable cheer, rah rah rah!
<jamest> jemfinch: a project to produce tools and applicatoins for business use
<jamest> an ERP 
<jamest> a great way to avoid friends, family, and the sun as you sit in front of a screen
Action: V_laptop sends jamest out for a laptop w/802.11 and a lawn chair
<V_laptop> ohh! and sunglasses!
<jamest> damn
Action: jamest misread that as
<jamest> V_laptop sends jamest out a laptop w/802.11 and............
<V_laptop> I saw something pretty cool the other day.. a usb light.. =) 
<V_laptop> had a little clip on it to clip onto the lcd of a laptop..
<jemfinch> the only advantage to this 2-table approach is that I can lock a key and all the factoids get locked.
<V_laptop> update table set lock='yes' where key='whatever' or whatever would do the same..
<jemfinch> yeah, but new factoids for that key could still be added.
<V_laptop> yea, you'd have to work around that I s'pose.. I see your point.
<derek> jcater: i woudl be willing to remove the 'need a tar/ball' requirement
<derek> but are you ready for bug reports :)
<jamest> yes
<derek> then its worth doing i suppose
Action: derek will update cvs head tonight and look at the conversoin tools
<derek> you two be around for a bit?
<jamest> yes
<jamest> i will
<V_laptop> yay!
Action: derek needs to eat dinner and get a pilates cd queued for burning
<jemfinch> thanks for the help, guys.
<derek> and then i can start abusing it
<jemfinch> btw, are you guys really opposed to MySQL questions?
<jcater> lol
<jamest> no
<derek> no
<jamest> but we don't like mysql
<jcater> we answer all questions if we can
<derek> unfortunately we support it
<jamest> most of us anyway
<V_laptop> I like mysql
Action: V_laptop runs
Action: jemfinch likes SQLite.
Action: jamest grabs a thwapstick
<jcater> SQLite is nice
<derek> we just often shake our heads at what 'works' in mysql that has no business working ;)
<jcater> I've used metakit in the past
<jcater> before I knew about SQLite
Action: jcater wants to convert some internal projects from one to the other later on
<derek> im suspecting gnue-sb will likely want to be sqllite compatiable
<dsmith> jemfinch: I like sqlite too.  Sometimes you don't need a huge thing.
<jemfinch> and it keeps my from entering the RDBMS wars with my IRC bot.
<jemfinch> "I'm not using SupyBot because it uses MySQL instead of PostgreSQL!"
<derek> anyone want some ice cream, wife has been getting half gallon of dreyer's 'special flavors' for free
<derek> we have no room left in freezer
<jemfinch> yeah, I'll take it.
<derek> she told me to 'eat ice cream, lots of it'
<Vee2d2> buy another freezer!
<derek> all i can say is the twix ice cream kicks butt
<derek> Vee2d2: we have 2 freezers already
<derek> a full size 
<derek> and double wide fridge w/ half it being a freezer
Action: derek has coupon queen for a wife we generally dont spend money on groceries other than milk,meat and fruits/veggies
<derek> oh and soda ;)
<Vee2d2> we got a deep freeze from my folx when they moved last summer.. 
<derek> meat we get like 98% ground sirlion for like .98/lb
<wtg> anyway of getting to australia? ... i need something to sustain my fat bitchness =)
pattieja (~pattieja@www.pcxperience.com) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<Vee2d2> wtg: =)
pattieja (~pattieja@www.pcxperience.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> likely on transport will melt
<derek> you are welcome to come over and get some :)
<wtg> =) might have to pass it up =(
Action: derek is updating cvs
<derek> Vee2d2: you might as well get cvs up and running
<derek> if you want to track gnue-sb ;)
<V_laptop> it's been up and running.. just waiting on you cheif
Action: derek has to eat some ice cream ;)
<V_laptop> s/cheif/chief/
<jcater> man
<jcater> after working on the QT driver for forms
<jcater> I swear, if the licensing for QT on Win32 was worked out
<jcater> so it was GPL too
<jcater> I'd redo designer in QT in a heartbeat
<havoc> jcater: w00t!
<havoc> QT rocks
<jcater> it's a very well thought-out/well designed library
<havoc> jcater: I've written QT apps to run on PocketPC/Windows/Linux from one codebase
<havoc> QT is pretty good
<havoc> as are the KDE libs
<havoc> and the general KDE arch
Action: havoc likes libs/archs that "make sense"
<derek> jamest: / jcater: where is the 'converter'?
<jamest> forms/utils
<derek> no 'bin'
<jcater> no
<jamest> ?
<jcater> forms/utils
<derek> ok
<derek> first bug report
<V_laptop> heh
<V_laptop> =)
<derek> there is no README and ./gfd04to05.py yields

<jcater> um
<jcater> ok
Action: derek notes likely the README would exist in the changelog or release notes
<jcater> serious bugs please
Action: derek is assuming you want to know what is necessary for 'release'
<jamest> ./gfd04to05.py yourForm.gfd
<jamest> i'll add a README
<derek> jamest: i figured as much, but im being a QA guy here
<jamest> just a sec
<jcater> um
<jcater> that converter is not a "product" imho
<jcater> but that's just me I guess
<derek> as one question that comes to mind is that going to 'preserve' my original .gfd
<derek> i.e.
<derek> 04to05 myfoo.gfd
<derek> does it yield myfoo.new.gfd
<derek> or replace myfoo.gfd
<V_laptop> iirc it moves the original file to file.gfd.pre050 or something
<derek> if it replaces myfoo.gfd
<derek> can i pass it
<derek> myfoo.gfd myfoo.new.gfd
<derek> or do i need to back up myfoo.gfd first
Action: derek notes this because i know you guys are good
<derek> BUT
<jamest> it creates a -PRE050
<derek> so many vendors just screw you
<jcater> it does both
<jcater> if you specify one file name
<jcater> it backs that one up
<jcater> and places the new version in the original file name
fixe (~fixe@dsl093-081-253.chi2.dsl.speakeasy.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> if you specify two
<jcater> then the first is "input", second is "output"
<derek> jcater: i would have tried the input/output method if left to my own devices
<jamest> derek: how about upgrading notes in INSTALL
<jamest> that's how postgresql does it
<jcater> that's what I was thinking we'd do
<derek> thats fine
<derek> that was more a 'question' saying 'pay attention for release'
<derek> ok real bug possibly
<derek> DB000:   File "/home/dneighbo/cvs/gnue/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/common/definitions/GParser.py", line 278, in startElementNS
<derek> DB000:     raise MarkupError, tmsg
<derek> DB000: gnue.common.definitions.GParser.MarkupError: Error processing <form> tag [I do not recognize the "height" attribute
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue-sb/item/forms$ 
Action: derek converted working form using tool
<derek> and ran the new generated file untouched and it gets what i pasted
<jcater> that looks like you are running old form in new cvs
<derek> never mind
<derek> got your naming conventions messed up 
<jemfinch> does anyone here speak swahili?
<derek> when i saw -pre05
<jemfinch> oops, wrong channel.
<jemfinch> mean that one for #python, ironically :)
<derek> i was thinking that was the 'new' file not the old one
<derek> as i was thinking im usin pre 05 ;)
<derek> as in pre-release
<V_laptop> derek: I did the same thing.. 
<jamest> new INSTALL file commited
<derek> V_laptop: you schema file wont import for me
<derek> lots of 'odd errors'
<derek> maybe you could do a pg_dump 'data only' proper insert strings?
<V_laptop> derek: will do in a bit gotta finish cleaning up in here then back to the office..
<derek> i think something like
<derek> pg_dump -adO -f datadump.sql gnue_sb 
<derek> would work
<derek> V_laptop: no problem
