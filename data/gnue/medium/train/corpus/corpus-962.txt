<jcater> I haven't used an atm in like 2 years
<jcater> so I forget about that
<jcater> :)
<jcater> err, :(
<chillywilly> why don't you use an ATM?
<chillywilly> how do you pay for your donuts?
<chillywilly> ;P
<jcater> it's called "Petty Cash" at work :)
<chillywilly> lol
<jcater> I borrow money from "Petty Cash" and have the accountants reimburse "Petty Cash" with part of my expense checks
<jcater> works out real well
Action: jcater is good friends w/the accounting department, though :)
<jcater> when I do need to get cash, I pay for something at the store using my Debit Card (instead of the Check card)
<jcater> that way I don't have to get out multiples of $10 or $20, and it's always free :)
<jcater> even when out of town
Action: jcater is a cheap bastard
<chillywilly> I see...
<chillywilly> yes, you cheap bastard
<chillywilly> ;P
<jcater> argh!!!\]
<jcater> dammit
<jcater> Comdex starts tomorrow
<chillywilly> what?
<chillywilly> where?
Action: jcater missed it again
<jcater> Chicago
<jcater> NCS has agreed to send me like the last 2 years
<chillywilly> dude
<jcater> but I forget to sign up
<chillywilly> I could;ve went
<chillywilly> bah
Action: jcater wants to get a GNUe booth at ComDex :)
<chillywilly> too late for that now isn't it?
<jcater> timing is everything
<jcater> now is not the time for GNUe to be at something like that
<jcater> but, yes, it's too late, regardless :)p
<jcater> dammit!
<jcater> what's with Flash
Action: chillywilly troutslaps jcater
<chillywilly> settle down man!
<chillywilly> ;P
<jcater> what's with all these sights requiring flash
<chillywilly> they are gay
<jcater> if I can't view a site in plain ole Konqueror, then I move on
Action: chillywilly has the plugin though
<jcater> I refuse to grab the plugin
<jcater> gasp!
<jcater> chillywilly: doesn't that bork up vrms?
<chillywilly> I think I used this line: deb http://marillat.free.fr/ unstable main
<chillywilly> I don't think the one I got is non-free

<JX> ?
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> sorry i can't answer that
<reinhard> seems to be a very pgsql specific question

<btami> reinhard ? (in neighborhood)
<btami> ?
<jcater> what's the question?
<btami> hah
<btami> 1. I am testing forms/designer and
<btami> made a master-detail form with designer
<btami> when I run it with gfclient it say:
<btami> dynamic SQL error Token unknown NULL
<btami> it is came from _dbsig.DBdriver._buildQueryCount
<jcater> hmm
<btami> the SQL sentence is:
<jcater> is this the cvs version? or a released version?
<btami> yes
<btami> CVS
<btami> select count(*) from employee_project where emp_no = NULL
<btami> I think "emp_no IS NULL" is the correct syntax
<btami> isn't it?
ToyMan (stuq@c5300-4-ip114.albany.thebiz.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jcater> um
<jcater> is employee_project the detail table
<jcater> (sorry about the delays, I'm at work :)
<btami> yes 
<btami> and employee is the master
<btami> this is from the standard example database shipped with interbase
<jcater> do you have records in employee where emp_no is null?
<jcater> is this happening after running a query? or when you first open the form? or after inserting a new record?
<btami> no, it is a generated primary key in table
<btami> when I first open the form
<btami> nothing visible yet
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> so there is a null emp_no?
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> we haven't accounted for that yet
zwiskle (~zwiskle@194-208-138-086.TELE.NET) left #gnuenterprise.
<btami> no, there is not null
<jcater> oh
<jcater> hmm
<btami> I think it is a programming error, becouse "emp_no=NULL" is wrong
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> but it doesn't do that with the other databases
<jcater> so I'm trying to figure out what triggers that
<btami> "emp_no IS NULL" a correct syntax
<jcater> well
<jcater> ouch
<jcater> actually
<jcater> emp_no = NULL is valid too
<jcater> except that it always returns false
<jcater> hmm
<btami> but not in SQL92
<btami> I think
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> it looks like SQL92 defines NULL = NULL to be false
<jcater> but we'll have to work around interbase
<jcater> I guess I need to grab a copy of interbase
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<btami> I read in "A first course in database systems" by Ullman-Widom that
<btami> NULL is not a constans value, and field=NULL is not a valid expression
<btami> interbase says too :)
<psu> btami: yep. NULL is never equal to anything, not even NULL
<psu> of course, this isn't how d/b users want it, so you end up using "IS"
<psu> i.e. field IS NULL, which will either be true or false
<btami> yes, but interbase sends me: dynamic sql error. token unknown NULL
<jcater> well, we'll have to work around that
<jcater> all the other db's define field = null to be false
<jcater> so whichever is right, we'll have to work around it
<jcater> :)
<btami> OK
<btami> but I have another question
<btami> I cant see the toolbar in designer
<btami> everything else is OK
<btami> ?
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> are you on Windows?
<btami> win2k
<btami> python 2.1.2
<jcater> yah
<jcater> this is a known issue with Windows
<jcater> I'm still trying to figure this one out :(
<btami> I dont like win, but use :(
<btami> is anybody working on forms now?
<jcater> I'm looking at the is null thing right now
<btami> what time is it there? (here 23.13)
<psu> jcater: I thought Oracle was the same, i.e. field = NULL is a syntax error
<jcater> 16:13
<btami> :)
<jcater> SQL> select * from dual where dummy = null;
<jcater> no rows selected
<jcater> SQL>
<jcater> :)
<psu> ack
<psu> I think that's technically wrong
<reinhard> btami: i'm happy to see you finally got in contact with jcater
<psu> of course, Mr. Ellison does have several billion dollars weight of argument on his side ;-)
<btami> me too
<jcater> psu: well, I'm not so sure
<btami> hi reinhard
<jcater> as = NULL is technically the same as = UNKNOWN
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> gives me a headache
<btami> :(
<jcater> either way, we are fixing our code to remove any ambiguity :)

<drochaid_> drivers for my colour laser [yet]
<drochaid_> sage financial controller
<drochaid_> and quite a few more you couldn't care less about
<drochaid_> any machine I've got that doesn't require a windows app, uses either linux or a bsd
<chillywilly> :P
<chillywilly> what does dezign for databases do?
<chillywilly> there are Free alternatives for most of what you just typed ;)
<drochaid_> erd mapping and schema outputs for most sql based dbs
<chillywilly> GNUe designer and Forms ;)
<drochaid_> yes, and most of them suck
<drochaid_> gnue forms and designer replace WHAT that I mentione?
<chillywilly> the database schema thingy
Action: jcater won't comment on suckiness of pagemaker :)
<drochaid_> no
<jamest_> drochaid_: photoshop
<drochaid_> erd design and ddl script production

<drochaid_> jamest_: ??
<jamest_> yip
<jamest_> lauches xfig
<chillywilly> photoshop == gimp
<chillywilly> ;)
<drochaid_> balls
<jamest_> that's a good photoshop replacement isn't it :)
<drochaid_> gimp is good, but not that good
<chillywilly> acrobat == xpdf
<drochaid_> not the same thing ata ll
<jcater> chillywilly: acrobat *reader* == xpdf
<drochaid_> all xpdf does [that I know of] is create dpfs
<chillywilly> jcater: yes, sorry
<jcater> acrobat == gs
<drochaid_> ooh .. not xpdf, but I know there is one
<drochaid_> ah gs
<jamest_> acrobar = gs = crappy TeX font support
<chillywilly> what does sage financial controller do?
<drochaid_> but thats only a replacement for acrobat pdf writer ... what about the other components of acrobat?
<drochaid_> sage fin con is an enterprise level accounting package
<chillywilly> adobe should be boycotted anyway
<drochaid_> it's the most comprehensive off the shelf package there is
<drochaid_> chillywilly: kinda difficult when there are no serious alternatives, I agree with the sentiment tho
<chillywilly> the thing is you've let yourself get locked in my friend
<drochaid_> no
<drochaid_> the thing is, I use the products that do what I need
<drochaid_> and I'm not going to avoid a product or OS unless there is a viable alternative
<jcater> I'm a QuarkXPress person myself
<jcater> although I am learning I love the unix photo tools much more than photoshop
<jcater> esp, imagemagick
<chillywilly> most adobe products can be replaced ;)
<drochaid_> that rather depends what you use them for chillywilly
<drochaid_> jcater: I could never get into quark
<jcater> it is the industry standard
<drochaid_> that and pagemaker/indesign is more suited to my dtp needs
Action: jcater consider's it a "power" tool
<drochaid_> jno, it's the industry standard for magazine publishing ;)
<jcater> well
<jcater> we are a magazine company
<jcater> :D
<chillywilly> hehe
<drochaid_> pagemaker is more suited to smaller flyers and materials
<drochaid_> indesign is more suited to high artwork intensive publications etc
<jcater> it is also the standard for catalog production
<drochaid_> but you have a good reason to use quark ;)
Action: chillywilly thinks jcater should write a Free QXpress replacement
<drochaid_> catalogue == magazine
<chillywilly> drochaid_: you're not european are you?
<chillywilly> ;P
<drochaid_> Scotland :P
<drochaid_> but I meant in terms of design and production
<jcater> we run QuarkXPress, Freehand, and Photoshop under Win4Lin on Linux now
<jcater> it's *much* faster than running native on Windows
<chillywilly> hehe
<jcater> of course, that's still proprietary
<jcater> but at least we don't dual boot
<jcater> :)
<drochaid_> I've had pretty good usage with vmware, but it doesn't give enough tp hardware control for me to use it
<drochaid_> that and my machine isn't meaty enough
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> vmware is kinda kludgy
<MicahY> I just tried to install vmware for the first time this afternoon
<jcater> and big
<MicahY> didn't work...
<MicahY> I have an upgraded rh 7.2 kernel and it didn't like the modules....
<MicahY> :(
<drochaid_> :/
<derek> so much log so little time
<derek> MicahY: win4lin
<chillywilly> anyone know if you compile the in-kernel pcmcia crap if the separate packaged stuff will work?
<chillywilly> derek: I think recommending prop. software in a GNU channel is forbidden ;) (j/k)
<drochaid_> hmmm, bed
<drochaid_> nite all
<chillywilly> bye
<derek> chillywilly: um he said vmware (which isnt free)
<chillywilly> I know
<chillywilly> but I was being nice
<derek> as far as i can tell there is currently no free equivalent or even close
<chillywilly> but you
<chillywilly> don;t have that luxury
<chillywilly> plex86 is improvng I hear....not sure if it is even close to being any good yet
<drochaid_> derek: there is one that's doing quite well ... can't remember the nme tho
<drochaid_> ah plex86 .. that's it
<MicahY> it's not for me.  But we have a guy here at the MK school where I'm at that is try ing to convert to almost all Linux.
<derek> plex and bochs i think are the ones
<derek> but last i saw they were crap
<MicahY> but he needs a bit of 'doze still
<drochaid_> it needs some fudging .. but it looks promising
Action: chillywilly got winblows out of the house permanently ;)

Topic changed on #gnuenterprise by derek!~derek@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net: GNUe Rated PG-13 (Excessive Violence)
<derek> so what happened in here today?
<derek> anything worth reading about?
<chillywilly> ah, nothing much
<chillywilly> not that I can tell
<chillywilly> nice topic dawg ;)
<jcater> well, bill gates came by asking about some trout-networking protocol
<chillywilly> dude the howto packages are friggin HUGE
<jcater> we tried to sell chillywilly to him
<jcater> but he wouldn't budge from $10
<chillywilly> nah, I just did a ping o' death and he went bye bye
<jcater> hehe
<jcater> then Larry Ellison came by
<jcater> and mentioned that because his stocks are doing dismal
<jcater> he wants to borrow our stuff for "cost cutting" reasons, or something like that
<jcater> I tried to give him GEAS, but he wouldn't take it
<jcater> other than that
<jcater> nothing happening today
<chillywilly> ouch, that hurts man
<chillywilly> (shea, right)
<jcater> <for all would-be litigators out there reading my comments, this is considered SATIRE, not LIBEL!!!>
<chillywilly> ping o' death == bucket of trout
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> gotta cover your ass eh?
<jcater> well
<jcater> ya never know
<chillywilly> you wouldn't want that thing uncovered anyways, you mght blind an innocent child ;)

<chillywilly> yea, I just did apt-get install initrd-tools
<chillywilly> and then info mkinitrd
<chillywilly> ;)
<dtm> oh, well then.
Action: chillywilly has a fatter kernel now
<chillywilly> this thing is taking much longer to compile
<chillywilly> hopefully I'll have all the drivers to get this burner working ;)
<dtm> you deserve the phattest kernel in the land, bro
<chillywilly> hehe, :)
<chillywilly> I took the stock debian kernel config and modified that so now I have tons of crao that I'll probably never use ;)
<chillywilly> er, crap
<chillywilly> shit now I'll have to remember to build an initrd every time I build a new kernel
<chillywilly> *joy*
<chillywilly> dtm: you usually build it after you install the new kernel? Seems to me you have to point it at the modules dir and it looks in its config file to determine which ones to use in the image
<dtm> chillywilly: why'd you modify it with stuf fyou dont use
<dtm> chillywilly: you mean you're building modules, or did you patch it uselessly or what
<chillywilly> it build a lto more modules
<chillywilly> er, builds a lot more
<chillywilly> no biggie
<chillywilly> I did patch it with preemption and O(1) scheduler
<chillywilly> but that's besides the point ;)

Action: drochaid is away: oot
<dneighbo> Mr_You thanks
<dneighbo> i need to announce on our announce list too
<Mr_You> I see some new nicks
<Mr_You> in regards to the GEAS rewrite, I guess there still isn't a python app server already in development that we may consider?
<Mr_You> I guess not, atleast not one that had multiple connection methods
<dneighbo> if you find one
<dneighbo> let us know
<dneighbo> so we can consider it
<dneighbo> zope is probably closest so far
<dneighbo> there are others but they are so infantile in development still not sure it makes sense
<Mr_You> i have a comment on the GEAS rewrite.. nothing mentions authentication
<dneighbo> there is something on security
Action: Mr_You considers those two seperate ;-)
<Mr_You> you noticed any progress or such in regards to the webclient?
<Mr_You> madlocke still doing that or no?

<dneighbo> i had a flame war recently on a list
<dneighbo> question, what do you all feel is a fair consulting price
<dneighbo> i.e. NOT what you COULD charge, but what is a fair price
<drochaid> what type of consultation and to what market sector/size?
td-work (td-work@birddog225.birddog.com) left irc: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)
<drochaid> and no, I don't have any pizza left ;)
td-work (~td-work@birddog225.birddog.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> drochaid honestly it shouldnt matter about sector/business size
<dneighbo> IMHO
<dneighbo> type of consultation i agree maters
<dneighbo> er matters
<dneighbo> say general IT consultancy
<drochaid> I think it does matter about size
<dneighbo> mixed bag of networking, programming, project management
<dneighbo> drochaid why would size of company matter
<dneighbo> i.e. i think it somewhat morally wrong to charge a bigger client more than a smaller client
<drochaid> I'm aiming my consulting primarily at small businesses with very limited capital in the main part
<Mr_You> experience, skills, and requirements made by the "problem" determine the price, IMO
<drochaid> I have dropped my hourly cost substantially to allow them to be able to afford a service I believe they have a right to use, but normally can't afford
<dneighbo> i think 'the problem' and expertise needed to solve it should factor most of the price variable
<dneighbo> drochaid : yes im for that
<chillywilly> well I would charge more for prop./internal GPL solutions ;)
<Mr_You> for example, I have experience/skills in multiple *nix and Cisco.. but if someone pays me to install a RAID, I can't charge a higher hourly rate because I know Cisco.
<dneighbo> chillywilly you are evil
<dneighbo> i wouldnt do prop systems :)
<drochaid> so I don't charge *more* to a larger business, but I don't exclude those that couldn't normally afford me
<chillywilly> well, I didn;t imply that I would do it
<dneighbo> drochaid, understood :)
<Mr_You> charging different prices depending on the size of the org doesn't make much sense always
<chillywilly> but in general people will do prop. solutions
<dneighbo> i am against saying 'how big are you so i can overcharge you' :)
<dneighbo> im not against saying here is what it would cost, but i know you cant afford that lets see what we can do
<drochaid> for what your talking about dneighbo, I would say upto £125 an hour would be very acceptable depending on experiance and skill
<Mr_You> well..
<drochaid> *you're
<chillywilly> it deodns if you like the customer ;)
<Mr_You> you could say "anything the gets the best deal" or "gets the deal period".. so scaling your pricing in that regard is good I guess
<chillywilly> :P
<Mr_You> if you price each org differently then I don't see anything wrong with it.. all your doing is shooting to make the deal happen and still be beneficial
<Mr_You> its the larger orgs own fault for not trying to get a lower price
<chillywilly> you need to make your money and stay afloat...come people will not be able to afford you...if you can afford to cut them a deal then I'd say do it
Action: drochaid thinks dneighbo fell asleep
<chillywilly> dneighbo: most importantly let your conscious be your guide...if you are seriously ripping people off I am sure you will feel a bit guilty
<chillywilly> (assuming you;re a decent human being...yea big assumption I know)
<Mr_You> you could also look at "what may be a rip off price" .. is what people are still willing to pay.. so maybe its not a rip off?  ;-)
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> ouch 125 pounds seems extremely high
<dneighbo> i think i would have issues charging more than 80 US $
<dneighbo> depending on things having to 'overhead' maybe 100 US $
<Mr_You> for what exactly?
<dneighbo> any kind of IT consulting
<Mr_You> I disagree completely.
<drochaid> $100 US is pretty low tbh
<dneighbo> im hearing people say over 100 an hour
<dneighbo> and that just seems like gouging to me
<dneighbo> the justification i keep getting back
<Mr_You> $90-$100 is probably the average
<dneighbo> is that well you dont always have work
<drochaid> IBM charged me out @ £850 GBP a day
<dneighbo> wtf should a company pay you for not working :)
<drochaid> and that was really basic stuff
<dneighbo> is my opinion :)
<Mr_You> I've talked to Cisco Engineers that barely new anything and they charged $125/hour or such
<dneighbo> drochaid i dont think ibm pricing is non gouging
<dneighbo> sigh 
<dneighbo> i think consultants have m$ syndrome
<Mr_You> I can't charge a flat rate, I charge based on what needs done and skills required for the job
<dneighbo> the 'because you can' and 'look what others charge' is the common theme :(
<dneighbo> i guess im too much of a socialist
<Mr_You> and what it takes to get the deal or best deal
<dneighbo> Mr_You i dont think flat rate
<dneighbo> im saying over 100 seems like gouging to me
<Mr_You> derek: you can't pay a senior level network engineer the same as a jr. admin
<Mr_You> its not gouging when you consider the profit required..
<dneighbo> i looked at several surveys and the averages on the high end ar 85 bucks and low end 17 (tech support)
<dneighbo> which seems to support my argument
<dneighbo> we can agree to disagree
<Mr_You> thats hourly rate for individuals
<dneighbo> i guess im the one out in the dark here
<Mr_You> what you charge as a company and what you pay an individual are two different things
<dneighbo> 60,000 is 28/hr flat rath
<dneighbo> er rate
<drochaid> dneighbo: look at it from a business viewpoint. As a consultant, you are there for one purpose and one purpose only. To save the company money by making recommendations based on knowledge they do not posess. If the fee you charge reflects the level of saving they will make if carried out correctly, then it is a fair cost to them as long as they know upfront and agree to it.
<dneighbo> say you figure you have 4 times in overhead cost (extremely high)
<dneighbo> that is 112 an hour
<Mr_You> so you figure.. if someone is paying their employee $85/hour.. they are charging the client probably $150/hour or more
<Mr_You> right.. now add another $25/hour for profit
<drochaid> if they're paying $85 an hour they SHOULD be charging 3 times that Mr_You
<dneighbo> im sorry as an independent consultant
<dneighbo> if i can make 60k
<Mr_You> ok drochaid
<dneighbo> and have 2 week vacation and health insurance etc
<dneighbo> that is more than enough
<Mr_You> I agree.. but in the details lies the overhead of the rest of the company.. sales, execs, etc.
<drochaid> break it down as, 1x for salary, 1x for immediate expenses to maintain the consultanct, and the rest as a mix of profit and general indirect running costs
<dneighbo> Mr_You i guess i think that is the gouging part
<dneighbo> :)
<Mr_You> an independent person has less over, less cost
<dneighbo> i guess this only validates there is GREAT room for this market :)
<dneighbo> i.e. building a COMPANY that conosidates independents world wide
<Mr_You> company needs to make a profit to grow
<dneighbo> while maintaining next to zero overhead :)
<drochaid> dneighbo: that's called IBM dood :)
<dneighbo> which is POSSIBLE via internet
<dneighbo> drochaid ibm has HUGE overhead
<drochaid> I know
<drochaid> I contributed to it a great deal :D
<dneighbo> anyhow...
<Mr_You> the lowest over head will come from each employee having multiple hats/jobs within the company.. ie. the CEO also performs the lower level duties
<drochaid> dneighbo: 60k !!!! usd!!!! is that all you want?
<drochaid> brb
<Mr_You> $60k/year for me is fine too
<Mr_You> my dad owns his own company and I never knew how much he made until he applied for an apt I was gonna rent.. $80k/year.. I have no idea where he spends his money.. cept on cigarettes
<Mr_You> rather he's president and is one of the stock holders
<Mr_You> guess he only cares about saving for retirement
<dneighbo> 60,000 yeah is nice living
<Mr_You> thats usually what I aim for.. you said its $28/hour?  usually I shoot for $30-$32/hour.
<dneighbo> well 28 hour is raw money
<Mr_You> for Senior Sun admin duties
<dneighbo> if you put in for insurance
<dneighbo> and paying employers portion of tax
<Mr_You> they get their moneys worth too
<drochaid> 60k USD is rather low
<dneighbo> probably looking at closer to 40/hr
<dneighbo> to get that 28/hr in reality
<Mr_You> I don't follow
<drochaid> ok, I know housing and general costs over there are lower than here, but still ....
<Mr_You> insurance is about $1k per year for me I guess..
<dneighbo> drochaid: on 60k a year
<dneighbo> can support family of 5 nicely
<dneighbo> 2 new cars
<dneighbo> 2000sqft home (own) with pool
<dneighbo> etc etc
<drochaid> yeah, but it leaves little room for growth or serious toys ;)
<Mr_You> yeah I'm very lucky
<dneighbo> as i said 'im a bit of a socialist'
<drochaid> 2000sqft home with pool??!!!!!!
<Mr_You> drochaid: not if yer single ;-)
<drochaid> sheese, told you your housing was cheaper
<dneighbo> if you are single making 60k
<Mr_You> that would be a pricey home around here probably
<dneighbo> you can do a lot better :)
<drochaid> I was living in a very small 2 bed house worth 96K GBP
<dneighbo> like 4000 sqft home
<dneighbo> and mercedes :)

<drochaid> what can I get for $150,000 USD ??
<dneighbo> per year
<Mr_You> I can't buy a home til I find stability.. not sure that really exist
<dneighbo> or housing what can you get for 150,000
<drochaid> housing
<Mr_You> drochaid: $100k California is about $60k here
<Mr_You> east coast, North Carolina
<dneighbo> 150,000 is about what i paid for 1890sqft + pool
<dneighbo> in arizona
<drochaid> compared to the 2 bed house I had for that ...
<drochaid> :o
<dneighbo> 4 bedroom, dining room, living room, family room and huge master bedroom, walkin closets etc
<drochaid> ok, so $60k a year is a lot more for you than it is for me
<dneighbo> nothing extravagent
<dneighbo> for about 180k could have gotten a huge deal w/ no pool
<dneighbo> like 3500sqft
<dneighbo> 6 bedroom
Action: chillywilly doesn't make shit and still lives at home
<dneighbo> now same hows in northern california
<chillywilly> ;P
<drochaid> dneighbo: what you just described would set me back £250,000 [$350,000] where I am now or £600,000 [$900,000] where I had the 2 bed house
<dneighbo> would be like 450,000

<chillywilly> so guys was crazymike talking a lot of sht before?
<drochaid> my real charge is £65 p/hour
<Mr_You> maybe build there some day, who knows

<chillywilly> scottland is the "low lands" right?
<drochaid> lol, no
<chillywilly> er, scotland
<chillywilly> how maybe it's the high lands then
<chillywilly> s/how//
<drochaid> calling Scotland flat would be, somewhat inacurate
<chillywilly> I said 'low' not flat
<drochaid> 2/3s of Scotland is CALLED the Highlands .. does that give it away?
<drochaid> highlands pronounce more like heelan
<chillywilly> wasn't the dude form iin the movie highlander from scotland?
<chillywilly> s/form//
<drochaid> his character was
<chillywilly> well anyway

Action: chillywilly wants to know just how accurate the movie Brave Heart is
<chillywilly> some people were saying that William Wallace was not the big hero he was made out to be
<chillywilly> in the movie
<drochaid> not very
<drochaid> the overall idea was close, but as usual there was a lot of holywood alterations
<drochaid> the battles were far to small and short lived for one thing :)
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> well they have to fit it into a movie
<chillywilly> surely you can let them slide on that one?
<chillywilly> ;)
<drochaid> nah, I'ma pedant ;)
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<drochaid> the hung drawn and quartered scene was way off as well
<chillywilly> how so?
<drochaid> first you were hung until nearly dead .. this could last 30 mins or more
<drochaid> next you were drawn along the ground behind a horse to the place where you were disembowled
<drochaid> I seem to recall they had Wallace in a yolk on the back of a cart

<dneighbo> was turning pale green

<chillywilly> nickr: hey you there?
<nickr> yea
Action: chillywilly can't get his new kernel to boot because of initrd issues
<chillywilly> it didn't like the 'ramdisk' that I made
<chillywilly> I just did
<chillywilly> mkinitrd -o initrd-2.4.18-xfs /lib/modules/2.4.18-xfs/
<chillywilly> grub loads it, then it complains and says it cannot mount the root fs
<chillywilly> any ideas?
<jcater> chillywilly: you are asking *us* for help with compiling kernels
<jcater> isn't this kind of reversed?
<chillywilly> no , nickr
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> I never compiled the stupid ramdisk in there
<chillywilly> and had to make an initrd
<chillywilly> I think there's probably some modules that I need to configure the mkinitrd command to use....but I have no idea what
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<chillywilly> but I really don't need any special modules to mount the root fs, it's an xfs file system
<chillywilly> and I have that compiled directly into the kernel
<chillywilly> (i.e., not as a module)
<nickr> I don't understand initrd
<nickr> thats why i use debian kernel images=
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<chillywilly> I think this is why
<chillywilly>  mkinitrd will fail to determine the root  file  system  if
<chillywilly>        rdev(8)  can't  find  the root device under /dev.  You can
<chillywilly>        specify your real root device by setting the ROOT variable
<chillywilly>        in  mkinitrd.conf.  If it still fails to recognise it, you
<chillywilly>        will need to manually add files to the image in  order  to
<chillywilly>        mount the root file system.

<yogurt2unge> hello people, do your know something about rewriting of GEAS?
<chillywilly> yes
<yogurt2unge> is it traumatic for the others stuff of GNUe?
<yogurt2unge> I'm just starting a project under GNUe
<dneighbo> explain
<dneighbo> the rewritting of GEAS will have little direct impact on two tier
<yogurt2unge> Yes I know
ariel_ (~ariel@217.133.245.223) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> i.e. any changes necessary for two tier to accomodate geas should be fairly seemless
<yogurt2unge> but will all application work with old and new GEAS without changes?
<dneighbo> um that depends
<dneighbo> we are discussing modifying the gcd specification some
<dneighbo> if we do that then you will probably have some issues
<dneighbo> so you are currently developing an application with geas right now?
<dneighbo> i guess if you fill me in a little bit i can better guide you with what the changes will mean to you
<yogurt2unge> Thanks dneighbo

<dneighbo> yogurt if you have not yet begun to develop your application
<dneighbo> what is your time frame?
<dneighbo> if you need to start development immediately i would use 2 tier and it should be relatively easy to scale it to multi tier with GEAS(v2) as functionality permits
<dneighbo> if your time frame isnt immediate you could wait until the first prototypes of GEAS(v2) start showing up
<dneighbo> we dont have a large production geas base, so there have really to date been no concerns about backwards compatiablity
<yogurt2unge> I have a short time frame because I must chosee a framework
<dneighbo> do you mind me asking what type of application you were going to write? (as if its similar to something in our plans perhaps we could help you)

<drochaid> I rebuild my linux boxes ... uhm ... 
<drochaid> well, only when I'm trying a new distro really

<Pharsyde> i figured it would be on ppc since you're on mklinux
<Pharsyde> I'm mid-linux boxes.
<Pharsyde> it's disturbing not having one.

<Pharsyde> need the ppc cluster for make, make install

<dtm> there are businesses built on ppc clustering

<Pharsyde> very nice. need to find some old 7100
<dtm> yeah
<Pharsyde> dtm: 7100 series? is that right?
<dtm> well they were porting the monolithic kernel to nubus so i guess the current kernel would run on 7100 but mklinux is the primary kernel for nubus hosts
<dtm>  i have an 8500!
<dtm> it's the bastion of my household pride
<Pharsyde> do you have a need for some old 6800 or 7100 with g3 upgrades
<dtm> well that's interesting  i can't afford to buy anything but i would like a g3 for my 8500
<dtm> i have a dead one
<dtm> from Powerlogix
<dtm> apparently dead, that is
<Pharsyde> I might be able to get them to you for shipping only.
<dtm> oh really well i'd only want 8500 upgrades  :)  got any?

<ra3vat> is that naming convention for packages, modules in geas you did with neilt still making sense ?

<ra3vat> is it described somewhere in the doc or buried in the log?
<reinhard> i think it should be somewhere in the mailing list archives

<chillywilly_> er, Person
<dneighbo> http://www.adaytum.com/advisor/mar02/index.html#tips
<chillywilly_> cool you get polymorphism in your queries
<dneighbo> er
<dneighbo> http://www.adaytum.com/advisor/mar02/tips_and_tricks.html
<chillywilly_> polymorphism == many types ;)
Action: chillywilly_ doesn't knwo if masta is hip to the object lingo
<dneighbo> yes
<dneighbo> if you use polymorphism you have achieved BAD design
<dneighbo> there are so FEW instances where it is good design to use
<dneighbo> most people like as it aids them in crappy thinking :)
<chillywilly_> what?
<chillywilly_> t allows for generic code and runtime "behavior"
<chillywilly_> s/t/it
<nickr> polymorphism just means you can treat one object as another
<chillywilly_> e.g, you could have a collection of 'shape' and elements in an image and not have to know what type they are and tell them all to draw() themselves and each one knows how to draw itself
<nickr> thats why I like objc and not C++
<dneighbo> sory multi inheritance
<dneighbo> polymorphism can be bad though too
<nickr> yes
<nickr> but I only use it for good, not evil.
<chillywilly_> sure because it tightly cpiples your objects
<dneighbo> a lazy programmer and polymorphism can lead to evil maintenance
<chillywilly_> er, couples
<chillywilly_> you have to use it only for good ;)
<chillywilly_> anyway, object query langauge looks like fun ;P
<chillywilly_> er, language
Action: chillywilly_ goes back to reading

<chillywilly> I don't have it compile din
<chillywilly> because of alsa
<nickr> chillywilly: see, this is what you get for not using stock kernel images.
<chillywilly> oh, plz
<chillywilly> alsa rewuires you not to compile any drivers
<chillywilly> I may just reconfigure and put that module in there
<chillywilly> and say fuck alsa
<nickr> yea.
<nickr> try it.
<nickr> you should just compile everything as a module just so they are available
<nickr> less recompiles that way
<dtm> chillywilly: seems to me that all Creative cards were linux supported
<nickr> dtm: there is definitely a kernel-included module for it.
<dtm> chillywilly: you could try using the OSS drivers for autodetection
<dtm> nickr: well, happy day!
<chillywilly> yes, but won't you get conflicts if you try to do alsa and have all those sounds drivers compiled as modules?

<dtm_> Mr_You: i made an initrd just like in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/ramdisk.txt and when the kernel loads it, it says it can't find the superblock.
<dtm_> input?
<chillywilly> you didn't use /usr/src/linux/Documentation/initrd.txt?
<dtm_> made a 2MB /dev/zero file, used 'losetup', then 'mke2fs -vm0 -b 1024 -N 20000 /dev/loop0', copied my /etc and /dev to it, and that's it
<dtm_> wholly sheet  i didn't notice that ; lemme look
<dtm_> oh btw i tried it compressed and uncomrpessed, same result
<Mr_You> I'm trying to use cluster_mkinitrd but it complains about "all loop interfaces are in use"

<Mr_You> not sure whats going on with the loop device deal.. at first I thought it was the mosix kernel, but I compiled a "clean" 2.4.16 kernel and same thing
<dtm_> isn't it true that my initrd only needs /dev/tty1, /dev/raidtab, and /dev/fstab ?
<dtm_> well i guess and /sbin/mount
<dtm_> it's only supposed to mount and switch to the md0
<dtm_> ok and raidstart and maybe fsck

alexey (alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<jcater> if you "print baseAttrs" that should show you what it is
<jcater> if it prints {'Somehting': something, ...} then it's a dictionary
<jcater> which is what I think baseAttrs is
<jcater> and baseAttrs[attr] should be set to a string
<jcater> wait
<jcater> not true
<jcater> baseAttrs[attr] could be either a string or an int
<Arturas> it is from GParser.py
<Arturas> int
<Arturas> print baseAttrs gives me an error too
<Arturas> have to quit now
<Arturas> bye :)

<stbain> perfecto
<stbain> heh... bringing you tomorrow's meat product... today
<nickr> :)
<stbain> cool
<stbain> looks simple enough
<nickr> yea, the storage part is pretty simple
<nickr> the libarry will be the fun part.
<nickr> Library
<stbain> what do you see as the major hurdles to get over in order to get it implemented?
<stbain> search engine for the library?
<nickr> Well, the library is sort of a search engine
<stbain> yah
<stbain> indexing, sorting, searching
<stbain> etc.
<nickr> it'll warrent its own diagrams I think
<nickr> yea
<stbain> what about the backend? SQL server neutral?
<nickr> I'm thinking GnUe Common
<stbain> sounds like I'll need to read up on GNUe Common
<stbain> ;)
<nickr> I believe that it provides DB neutrality
<stbain> hrmm
<stbain> through GEAS?
<nickr> I don't know exactly.
<stbain> looking through Common/docs dir now
<stbain> doesn't look like there's much info available on Common
<stbain> frontend through forms?
<nickr> forms/web/whatever
<nickr> all the various objects are RPC and 'trustless' or reduced trust relationships
<nickr> so your client just has to speak RPC
<stbain> cool
<dneighbo> um common will do db
<dneighbo> w/ or w/o geas
<dneighbo> the new geas will use common 
<nickr> db and rpc
<nickr> abstraction
<dneighbo> so it would be something like
<nickr> which is why its needed
<dneighbo> db (common-db) geas (common - rpc)
<dneighbo> er
<dneighbo> db (common-db) geas (common - rpc) docustore
<dneighbo> but it could also be
<dneighbo> db (common-db) docustore
<dneighbo> stbain currently only good docs for common are the source :(
<stbain> right

<nickr> hrm.
<dtm> hi guys 
<dtm> how's it going
<nickr> what version of debian are you runnig?
<derek> er very little (which is nice to get things working) but horrible for a FLIPPING SCREEN
<derek> sid
<nickr> hrm
Action: derek hates gdm (as im not used to it)

<nickr> I found the debconf thing to be much better than xf86config

<dtm> are you ladies having a lovely day?
<derek> yes lovely
<derek> nickr: its much better just not as many options
<derek> grrrr

<nickr> derek: flicker, like chunky jumpy?
<derek> no
<nickr> no I mean
<derek> like little 'stars'
<derek> around the windows when i move them
<nickr> like theres interlaces of the image you're moving like halfway over on the screen?
<derek> barely visible, but to me highlyh noticable
<nickr> this is a SiS?
<derek> no
<derek> trident cyberblade
<nickr> hrm.
<derek> its ok for now
<nickr> what depth?
<derek> i dont know
<derek> how can i tell those things?
<derek> as i want it smaller (higher res)
<nickr> didn't it ask you what color depth you want to use?
Action: derek needs to fix
<derek> 24 is what i choose
<nickr> see the debconf one asks you these things
<derek> i need to fix fonts too
<derek> debians fonts by default SUCK
<derek> they are for the 'blind'
<derek> anyhow back to how do you change resolution?
<derek> btw these are the things that kill me on linux
<nickr> in the debconf thing it prompts you for this
<derek> why should it be so difficult to change resolution?
<derek> i mean once im running
<derek> i should NOT have to reconfigure x everytime i want to change my resolution
<nickr> c-a-+/-
<derek> ca?
<derek> ctl-alt
<nickr> but that only cycles the ones that you selected in your config
<nickr> its all about the X mentality
<derek> thats fine (cycling ones in config)
<derek> i CANT do that on my laptop though
<derek> as only plus key i have requires a shift
<derek> which disables the strok (fwiw) now i remember why i didnt remember that only ever have wanted to change on laptops
Nick change: crazymike -> crazymike_away
<nickr> there is a gnome applet that lets you do it
<derek> btw
<derek> doing this changed things
<derek> but it made X go bye bye

<chillywilly> there is an nVidia card in here
<chillywilly> 01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation Vanta [NV6] (rev 15) (prog-if 00 [VGA])
<chillywilly> it doesn't lock up the computer though
<chillywilly> but the printer doesn't work :-/
<nickr> chillywilly: polling is not what you think it is
<chillywilly> I know
<chillywilly> that interrupt is not good though
<nickr> so give it the right one.
<chillywilly> well I mena getting that message does nto look good
<chillywilly> er, mean
<chillywilly> er, not

<derek> im tempted to cut them a check for 50 bucks
<derek> im VERY impressed
<derek> seemless import of netscape mail
<derek> nice clean (FAST) interface with good features
<nickr> yea
Action: derek loves this threaded mail
<derek> mmmm mmmm yummy
<chillywilly> threaded?
<derek> its what evolutions wishes it could be :)
<chillywilly> mutt does that ;)
<nickr> like mutt has
<nickr> evo is for a ifferent audienc.
<derek> netscape did it too
<chillywilly> I don't need no stinkin' gius
<chillywilly> er, guis
<derek> but it was not good
<derek> time will tell if syphleed does better
<derek> nickr: you really think so?
<derek> i guess evolution is task and calendar too
<nickr> yes, I really do.
<chillywilly> hehe
<derek> but i had wife try evolution and she said
<derek> let me put this nicely
<nickr> I know several people who probably wouldn't use linux without evo
<derek> 'what is this shit, give me windows back'
<chillywilly> nickr: do you know how to specify io ports and inetrrupts to lp?
Action: chillywilly does know the syntax
<derek> i put on syphleed
<derek> and her only complaint so far is in html mail if she clicks a link it does nothing
<nickr> chillywilly:  I have no idea.
<derek> im seeing now that it calls 'netscape' by default
<derek> which isnt installed
<nickr> derek: she uses outlook express normally?
<chillywilly> cnage it
<chillywilly> er, change
<dtm> derek: dood, that's a pretty abusive statement for her to make to you 
<nickr> yea, thats a smackable statement.
<dtm> geeeeeez
<nickr> I'm making myself sick on butterfinger BBs
<dtm> nickr: cool
<nickr> I'm 90% my second pound
<chillywilly> my mom likes evolution
<nickr> the good thing about free software is that there is a lot of choice.
<dtm> chillywilly: does your mom give you the finger if she didn't?  ;)
<chillywilly> wa?
<dtm> chillywilly: like derek's wife?
<chillywilly> where did he say that?
<nickr> make that 100%
<nickr> 19:01 < derek> 'what is this shit, give me windows back'
<chillywilly> you sick bastard
<chillywilly> that says nothing about flipping the bird
<nickr> well he 'put it nicely'
<dtm> ha
<nickr> so I assume there was ball-kneeing involved
<chillywilly> ouch
<dtm> HA
<chillywilly> dude everytime you use windows you get theat ball-kneeing feeling
<dtm> heh
<chillywilly> s/you/one/
<derek> well the phone call was nasty
<derek> as i just SWITCHED her to linux w/o warning
<derek> and evolution really does suck :)
<chillywilly> phone call?
<chillywilly> I dunno about evolution sucking, my mom seems to like it
<chillywilly> runs fast on this box
<chillywilly> 800MHz Athlon ;)
<derek> um put it this way chilly
<derek> even the ximian developers are bagging on it being non usable to them :)
<chillywilly> yea, what version though?
<chillywilly> 1.0.2 seems fine
<chillywilly> I dunno I have no opinion of it nor do I wish to use it
<chillywilly> I am used to using keys and commds to navigate my mail
<chillywilly> evo requires to much mouse movement
<chillywilly> ;)
<derek> im half teasing
<derek> it will be a killerapp
<derek> some day
<nickr> I don't agree that evolution sucks
<nickr> its a good concept, and it looks nice
<nickr> its like a first draft
<nickr> like X11R1
<nickr> :)
<derek> well i half agree
<derek> its past sucking yes
<derek> but its typical ximian :(
<derek> i.e. its too microsoft ish
<derek> and im not talking look and feel
<derek> im talking bloat and overtly complex
<derek> example dsmith wanted to garner address book data from it for another program
<derek> THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY AND ENCOURAGED THING
<derek> basically they hand him an documented and jacked db api that they say they havent yet really grokked (the storage method)
<derek> and point him to oaf/bonobo/corba hell and say he could 'try' that too
<derek> to me if their aim (which they say) is not the home user but the corporate desktop
<chillywilly> blah, blah
<chillywilly> blah, blah, blah
<derek> stuff like that is what gives m$ a bad name

<dneighbo> ou are attempting to install an initrd kernel image (version 2.4.17-k7)
<dneighbo> This will not work unless you have configured your boot loader to use
<dneighbo> initrd.
<dneighbo> As a reminder, in order to configure lilo, you need to
<dneighbo> add an 'initrd=/initrd.img' in your /etc/lilo.conf
<dneighbo> I repeat, You need to configure your boot loader. If you have already done
<dneighbo> so, and you wish to get rid of this message, please put
<dneighbo>   `do_initrd = Yes'

<dneighbo> Do you want to stop now? [Y/n]
<nickr> say 'no'
<dneighbo> what do i do?
<nickr> or n
<dneighbo> what is ash?
<nickr> ash is a little tiny posix shell
<chillywilly> a small shell
<chillywilly> they put it on the boot floppies
<nickr> they also put it in the initrd
<chillywilly> bahs won'
<chillywilly> t fit ;)
<dneighbo> Setting up kernel-image-2.4.17-k7 (2.4.17-1) ...
<dneighbo> /boot/initrd.img does not exist. Installing from scratch, eh?
<dneighbo> Or maybe you don't want a symbolic link here. Hmm? Lets See.
<dneighbo> I notice that you do not have initrd.img symbolic

<nickr> it might be that ide-scsi is interfering
<derek> i got grub
<derek> and it seems to be reloading
<chillywilly> it doesn't work on my laptop either
<derek> GDM is back up
<nickr> derek: nice menu eh?
<chillywilly> but anyway, I install via a different method
<derek> yip
<chillywilly> nickr: how do you commonly set up CUPS?
<chillywilly> with th4e web thingy?
<nickr> derek: cool
<derek> gack
<nickr> chillywilly: yea
<derek> it killed my networking though
<nickr> what?
<nickr> oh
<derek> i tried to use xchat and says bad host
<derek> so i do ifconfig and get nothing
<nickr> derek: the driver name might have changed
<nickr> derek: what do you have?
<derek> realtek something
<nickr> derek: pci?
<derek> um on board
<derek> but shsows up in pci
<nickr> then its pci :)
<derek> realtek 8139
<nickr> derek: lemme see
<derek> how do i change the driver 
<chillywilly> you just load the module
<derek> modconf
<chillywilly> modprobe or insmod
<nickr> derek: hrm just a sec
<nickr> derek: you can use modconf to adjust your drivers you know
<derek> im doing it already
<chillywilly> yes it is printing
<chillywilly> woooo
<chillywilly> I think it is anyway
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> heh the test page has a little simley in the uppper left corner?
<chillywilly> that's it
<chillywilly> ?

<dneighbo> hi mom
<dneighbo> i got it to work 
<chillywilly> sup dawg
<dneighbo> yeah :
<chillywilly> fuck it won't do it again
<nickr> I'm just too good.
<chillywilly> where does cups log things?
<nickr> um
<nickr> /var/log ?
<nickr> :)
<dneighbo> so back to sound
<dneighbo> now that we have new kernel now what?
<dneighbo> i tried modconf to load ac7
<dneighbo> and it loaded ok
<chillywilly> nickr: duh
<dtm> chillywilly: does your initrd boot to a software riad device?
<dneighbo> but do i need to do something to configure sound?
<chillywilly> dtm: no
<chillywilly> dtm: it's not even a valid image
<chillywilly> ;P
<dneighbo> and is ac7 proper module
<dtm> chillywilly: it switches to an alternate root, right?
<chillywilly> dtm: I don;t really need it I ust left it there
<nickr> dneighbo: I dunno, is it? :)
<derek> im not sure :(
<derek> i just have chipset number
<derek> vt82c686b
<nickr> dneighbo: thats generally what the drivers are named after
<nickr> dneighbo: go into modconf and find it.. its in sound
<derek> well this is the motherboard chipset not sound card chip set
<derek> 7. (12/28/2001 Ver 0.91A) Red Hat Linux 7.2/7.1 VT82C686B/VT8231/VT8233/VT8233C Audio Driver Installation Guide
<derek> This document describes four methods of installing the audio driver for VIA's south bridge chips: (1) OS built-in driver, (2) VIA driver, (3) ALSA driver from the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture project, and (4) OSS driver from 4Front Technologies. The instruction for each method and a comparison of their respective features are provided.
<derek> was from that one
<derek> ok foundit and installed it
<derek> now what?
<nickr> derek: try catting something to /dev/audio and see if it makes noise :)
<chillywilly> I tried to orint the test page 3 more times and now ti won't go
<chillywilly> this fucking blows man
<chillywilly> hijs driver sucks
<chillywilly> er, whatever the friggin thiung is called
<chillywilly> now it prints
<chillywilly> (switched drivers)
<chillywilly> yay
<dneighbo> win.wav >/dev/audio
<dneighbo> didnt seem to produce noise
<chillywilly> woohoo
<chillywilly> now I just need to get the scanner working
<nickr> dneighbo: do you have an output plugged in?
<dneighbo> yes let me triple check though
<nickr> hrm
<dneighbo> cable slightly tugged on
<dneighbo> when i pulled case out a minute ago
<dneighbo> turned up speakers now and hear light gargle
<dneighbo> so am getting some 'noise'
<nickr> well wavs won't play from /dev/audio
<nickr> try catting /vmlinuz
<nickr> its a very good test
<dneighbo> yikes
<dneighbo> need to turn sound down now :0
<dneighbo> i get lots of noise now :0
<nickr> okay
<nickr> thats good
<nickr> do you have a mic plugged in?
<dneighbo> i just need samba up
<dneighbo> um
<chillywilly> hehe
<dneighbo> what package is smbmount in?
<dneighbo> or the equivalent there of
<nickr> dneighbo: samba
<dneighbo> you have to get the server?
<dneighbo> i tried getting just smbclient
<dneighbo> but will get all of samba i suppose
Action: chillywilly should go watch scifi as a reward to himself for getting the printer to work ;)
<chillywilly> scifi channel even
<nickr> heh
Action: dneighbo thinks chillywilly is gonna punch the clown while watching lexx
stbain (GunAndGiz@ip68-10-44-170.rn.hr.cox.net) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<nickr> Lexx rocks!
<dneighbo> grr getting samba still doesnt give me samba mount
<nickr> haah
<nickr> apt-cache search smbmount
Action: dneighbo thinks smbclient was probably enought
<dneighbo> smbfs
<nickr> ah
<nickr> yea
<chillywilly> lexx does indeed rule
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> xmmms reports
<dneighbo> 1. you have the correct output plugin selected
<chillywilly> HOWEVER, wrt dneighbo's comment: "In this crazy world we don't spank the monkey the monkey spanks us!"
<dneighbo> 2. no other programs are blocking the soundcare
<dneighbo> 3. your soundcard is configured properly
<nickr> dneighbo: if you're in gnome try setting your output plugin to esound
<dneighbo> hmmmm this is weird
<chillywilly> lp is hte print command in cups right?
<dneighbo> i thin xxms toasted itself
<nickr> chillywilly: sure.
<nickr> chillywilly: if you installed cups-bsd
<chillywilly> I thought lpr was bsd?
<chillywilly> galeon prints like crap
<dneighbo> xmms just locks up
<dneighbo> when it tries to play an mp3 now
<dneighbo> but it doesnt get the other error
<nickr> xmms sucks bag.
<nickr> you might try a different player.
<nickr> or try killing esound and using the oss output plugin
<dneighbo> the oss output one is the one that complained
<nickr> right, thus my advise to kill esound before you try it :P
<dneighbo> how do you kill esound?
<nickr> killall esound
<dtm> isn't it 'killall esd'?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> dneighbo: do you in fact have any linux experience at all? :)
<dtm> dneighbo: i'll resend you the email i sent you this week
<dneighbo> esd: no process killed
<dneighbo> yeah, just coming from red hat originally for all this
<dneighbo> amazing you dont have to dick with it their tools do it for you
<dneighbo> last time i setup sound took 5 minutes
<dtm> dneighbo: ar eyou burned out, buddy?
<dneighbo> dtm: well that doesnt help either
<nickr> dneighbo: you have sound setup, just the things that use it aren't cooperating
<dneighbo> nickr: yeah, like my video. :
<dneighbo> :)
chillywilly_ (~danielb@d24.as8.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dtm> dneighbo: what doesn't help?
<dneighbo> its setup and works (just has that irrating static) one of those things that one day i will have to fix but for now it will get by
<chillywilly_> modems lick balls
<dneighbo> dtm: burn out, and configuring debian boxes
<dtm> dneighbo: oh sorry dood
<dtm> dneighbo: well just know that i'm genuinely concerned for your well being
<dtm> :)
<nickr> dneighbo: I suggest installing SuSE or something, I don't think you're really having a good debian experience. Maybe a nice Mandrake
<dtm> hehe
<dneighbo> no i like debian
<dtm> he really likes debian
<dneighbo> configuring it is brutal
<nickr> Mandrake is good, you don't have to think at all.
<dneighbo> when you dont do it everyday
<dneighbo> or even frequently
<nickr> point and drool all the way
<chillywilly_> amen to that brotha
<dtm> mdk is pretty darn good
<chillywilly_> mdk has some issues here and there though
<dtm> the sheer vastness of its software collection helps
<dtm> i've heard debian is similarly vast
<chillywilly_> whiuch distro has the most packages?
<dtm> and debian is sure more ported
<dtm> i dunno but mdk is sickeningly large, like > 4 CDs
<dtm> it's retarded
<chillywilly_> debian has over 6000 packages last time I looked
<nickr> dtm: Debian Woody is 8 CDs
<dtm> in fact one of the first rules to distro maintenance is for the core team to not be that diverse
<chillywilly_> heheh
<dtm> so as to have a core competency
<dtm> nickr: yeah that's a lot :)
<dtm> at one point, debian was the only one which had cfengine
<dtm> and then suse got it
<dtm> nobody else!
chillywilly (danielb@d68.as8.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) left irc: Killed (NickServ (Ghost: chillywilly_!~danielb@d24.as8.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net))
<dneighbo> so no advice for sound beyond this
Nick change: chillywilly_ -> chillywilly
<dtm> so i made a package on linuxppc based on suse's stupid way of making rpms
<dtm> dneighbo: did you search for a hardware conflict?
<dtm> dneighbo: most ia32 boxes have conflicts, or are sharing irqs
<nickr> dtm: its PCI
<dtm> dneighbo: linux may not like the irq sharing
<dtm> nickr: i know
<dtm> ia32 is garbage.
<nickr> PCI never doesn't work
<nickr> in my experience.
<dneighbo> well we were able to cat a file to it and get sound
<dneighbo> which makes me think its not a conflict
<dtm> nickr: your experience does not extend to the recent majority then :)
<nickr> dneighbo: ps awx |grep esound
<dtm> nickr: ia32's tiny number of irqs doesnt go very far and must be shared.  often oyu'll find sound, usb, and video sharing one irq.
<dneighbo> nickr: nothing
<nickr> dneighbo: hrm, so you're in gnome now, yes? try catting again
<dtm> i've seen cases where PCI doesn't sort out the irqs and there's a conflict
<dtm> and i've seen where each slot is hardcoded to an irq
<dtm> like in emachines
<dneighbo> nickr: loud as can be
<chillywilly> gnome-gv is b0rked
<nickr> dneighbo: okay, so OSS should be working. try installing another mp3 player aside from xmms
<nickr> chillywilly: yea, has been for quite a while
Action: chillywilly hasb;t noticed
<chillywilly> until now
<nickr> dneighbo: scratch that
<nickr> dneighbo: its probably a permission issue
<dneighbo> want me to run xmms as root?
<nickr> dneighbo: try running xmms as a user that can write to the sound device
<chillywilly> what groups you in?
<nickr> if that works we can address it easily
<dneighbo> thats it
<dneighbo> sound is working now 'as root'
<chillywilly> is it owned root.audio?
<dneighbo> so what is the easy fix
<nickr> dneighbo: sweet
<dneighbo> btw: thanks for the help, im really not a complete idiot, just an idiot minor
<nickr> dneighbo: make sure /dev/dsp* audio* mixer* are group sound
<chillywilly> if it is owned root.audio you just add yourself to the audio group
<nickr> er, audio group
<nickr> sorry
<dneighbo> yeah all audio
<nickr> then you adduser user audio where user is the user you want to be able to play stuff, for every user that you want to be able to play stuff
<nickr> make sure all those devices are group read and write also
<chillywilly> man galeon generates shitty ps
<nickr> chillywilly: its mozilla
<chillywilly> ok, moz then
<chillywilly> it blows
<chillywilly> I want it to look like my screen dam,nit
<nickr> dneighbo: oncey ou adduser to add the groups you have to log out of gnome nad log back in, buecause you have to have everything running with the new group
<chillywilly> why does printing under GNU/Linux have to be so shitty?
<nickr> chillywilly: I've never had problems in printing under linux
<nickr> I've never had problems with sound
<nickr> I've rarely had problems with video
<chillywilly> what kinda printer you got though ;)?
<nickr> I've had a number of different printers
<chillywilly> any of them new hp deskjets?
<nickr> the best was an HP LJ2100TN because it had JetDirect :)
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> brb
dneighbo (dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<nickr> chillywilly: never, because deskjets suck balls
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> agreed
<chillywilly> they bite the big one
<chillywilly> what is a goo GNU/Linux printer?
<chillywilly> er, good
<nickr> any printer that speaks Postscript is good in my book
<nickr> if it speaks LP or JetDirect AND Postscript its insanely great
<nickr> or IPP
<nickr> LP|IPP|JD
<chillywilly> lp  = line printer?
<nickr> printer515/tcpspooler# line printer spooler
<chillywilly> I knew this printer was going to bite the big one anyway
<nickr> er
<chillywilly> most new deskjets do
<nickr> c&p sure does slaughter spacing
<chillywilly> usually it doesn't
<chillywilly> only line breaks it murders
<chillywilly> what's jetdirect good for?
<nickr> its a remote printing protocol
<nickr> like IPP and LP
<chillywilly> ok
<nickr> cups supports it :)

<nickr> eh, probably won't kill me though :)
<chillywilly> dude CUPS will not work with hpijs
<chillywilly> :(
<nickr> why?
<chillywilly> probably too old of a version
<chillywilly> yep, needs 1.0.3 hpijs

<nickr> hah
<chillywilly> so what do you think is the best scheme for a shared apt cache?

<psu> I must admit I didn't expect to find anyone awake here
<chillywilly> I bet nickr is awake
<chillywilly> ;)
<psu> just logged in as IRC is an easy way of getting a "tickle packet" for my dial up connection
<chillywilly> dtm may still be awake
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly>  wish mine would stay up as long as there was activity, but I'm afraid it will drop off after so long no matter what
<psu> my ISP is very tolerant of dial-up staying on all the time
<chillywilly> which sucks the bag
<psu> you can even run servers and the like if you want to 
<chillywilly> nice :)
<psu> most UK ISPs kick you off after 2 hours
<nickr> I'm awake
<chillywilly> well I run them anyway ;)
<chillywilly> I don't give a crap what thye say
<psu> mine doesn't care, but will time you out after 3 mins idle
<psu> which is fair enough
<nickr> my connection stays up for 8 hours (480.1 minutes precisely) 
<psu> I think I will actually have been with my ISP for 10 years soon
<chillywilly> 3 minutes is not vry long at all
Action: psu is an old dial-up luser ;-)
<chillywilly> heh

<psu> "Are you going to drink that...
<dtm> haha
<psu> ... or have you?"
<dtm> yeah i saw that
<dtm> i saw it all.. i was there.
<chillywilly> justa a little inside joke
<chillywilly> I guess it is only funny to him and I
<dtm> no i love it
<dtm> LOVE IT

<nickr> but Red Mt Dew is different
<chillywilly> Moutain Dew Code Red has become my fav
<nickr> aptitude is my new best friend
<chillywilly> oh yea
<dtm> i, too, favor the red dew
Action: chillywilly has been using aptiotude forever
<chillywilly> but lately it is acting a bit stupid
<nickr> grape jolt is really good though =)
<chillywilly> it wants to remove a crap load of packages
<nickr> I've noticed some annoying stupidity
<nickr> like sometimes I explicitly remove some packages in the final reviewe screen and it looses that I removed them
<chillywilly> ick
<nickr> and It annoys the fuck out of me that I can't remove the 'hold' statucs without selecgt to install or remove
<chillywilly> nothing like good ol' apt-get ;).....I just think it is so weird how some apt frontends want to different things
<chillywilly> it's like wtf?
<nickr> Well, aptitdue does the right thing mostly
<nickr> like when resolving it brings recommends: along with things
<nickr> which I like
<chillywilly> that is configurable
<nickr> although I seelegted to install unifont and it brought all the fucking CJK fonts with it
<chillywilly> you can turn recommends off
<nickr> I like recommends
<chillywilly> I don't
<nickr> I also find it annoying the delay you get when changing the status of something

<chillywilly> howdy derek
<chillywilly> reinhard: what are the current geas assignments?
<derek> many thanks nickr working sound is a wonderful thing
<derek> reinhard, chillywilly we need to use DCL for our todos
<reinhard> chillywilly: none IIRC
<chillywilly> reinhard: and if I design some API will I be stomping on someone's toes?
<derek> prolly
<derek> i think the big current item is to document common
<reinhard> which api?
<derek> the sexy one of course
<chillywilly> schema compiler, etc.
<chillywilly> can I just write up a proposal?
<reinhard> so "internal" api's within GEAS?
<chillywilly> for discussion
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> or comething that will go in common if we chose to put it there
<reinhard> gotcha
<chillywilly> and what are we going to call the new geas module?
<chillywilly> (in cvs)
<reinhard> i think we will call the directory "appserver"
<reinhard> like "forms", "reports", "designer" etc
<chillywilly> to be consistent eh?

<chillywilly> ttp://www.gnuenterprise.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=NS-My_eGallery&file=index&do=showpic&pid=31
<chillywilly> darn
<reinhard> ok which interface would you talk about?
<chillywilly> ummm, well I am trying to figure out which one to dstart with ;)
<reinhard> hehe
<reinhard> if i may put my 2c here
<reinhard> (we have cents now in europe, too)
<reinhard> ;)
<reinhard> i would say
<chillywilly> I;m mainly want to know about the "process" I;'m not just going to go bezerk and commit code
<reinhard> the most important interface is what GEAS (as a whole) shows against forms
<reinhard> the "external" API of geas so to speak
<chillywilly> hmmm, yea....I would think for that forms would use OQL
<chillywilly> but I dunno
<reinhard> i don't think that
<chillywilly> well ODMG has a bunch of interfaces
<chillywilly> well I need to read th4e c++ implementation
<reinhard> however i think we must discuss with jamest what would make most sense to him
<reinhard> btw on the naming of GEAS
<reinhard> derek requested that GEASv2 still is named geas
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> well we do have a nice acronym
<reinhard> and said that it would be no problem to remove all docs from the web and everywhere that refer to the first implementation
<reinhard> and are not longer valid
<reinhard> however i'd like to ask _who_ will do this removement
<Arturas> deep silence......
<reinhard> Arturas: :)
<chillywilly> hmmm, we should fiogure out what parts are "common" to geas arhitecture
<chillywilly> probably security and protoclo adapters can be factored out
<chillywilly> into common
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> well I think the diagram could be much refined altogether...maybe that's what I'll start with, breaking things down further
<chillywilly> I dunno
<chillywilly> there's lots of stuff :P
<reinhard> sure :)
Action: chillywilly is just thinking out loud
<reinhard> chillywilly: that's ok
<chillywilly> actually methods adapter could be shared too
<reinhard> i think _lots_ could be shared
<chillywilly> yea
<reinhard> that's why i think we need a lot of communication with jcater and jamest
<reinhard> much more than before
<chillywilly> indeed
<chillywilly> deinfe our common APIs then code ;)
<reinhard> exactly
<chillywilly> we shooting toward a much more intergrated geas :)
<chillywilly> er, integrated
<chillywilly> I mena GNUe
<chillywilly> doh
<chillywilly> this is good for unity, because too long have various parts just been "distant"
<chillywilly> it was like talk to me at an arms length

<chillywilly> stop followign me ;)
<crazymike> ok, bye bye

<nickr> you all smell bad.-

<chillywilly> you know what to do ;)

<crazymike> sorry
Action: crazymike gives nickr a crate to the jugular
<chillywilly> about time
<crazymike> delayed beating, my bad
<crazymike> is there anyway to try and "fix" a bitched windows hard drive thru Linux
<crazymike> like possible bad sectors, like your moms, chillywilly
<chillywilly> you got some bad sectors?
<chillywilly> only way is a low level format which usually is nto worth it
<chillywilly> probabyl rewuires shipping it to the manufacturer (I dunno of anyone who has done that)
<crazymike> I dunno
<crazymike> I am trying to access it but can't
<crazymike> the bitched one
<crazymike> I would like to get the info off of it
<chillywilly> you get funky DMA messages?
<crazymike>  wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda1,
<crazymike>        or too many mounted file systems
<chillywilly> unrecoverable errors and such?
<crazymike> could that be because it is NTFS or whatever
<chillywilly> ah
<crazymike> instead of Fat
<chillywilly> why did you use NTFS
<crazymike> or is that cause it is bitched
<chillywilly> naughty naughty
<chillywilly> nah, it's not a bad sectors thing
<chillywilly> I am not sure if ntfs is supported and if it is
<chillywilly> it would be read only
<crazymike> so I couldn't copy the shit???
<chillywilly> yea
<crazymike> fuck
<chillywilly> well maybe
<chillywilly> no, you could dopy it
<chillywilly> er, copy
<chillywilly> lemme look
<crazymike> I just couldn't write to it
<chillywilly> exactly
<chillywilly> copy it off and reformat it in something sane ;)
<crazymike> lol...yeah

<chillywilly> NTFS Overview
<chillywilly> =============
<chillywilly> Legato Systems, Inc. (http://www.legato.com) have sponsored Anton Altaparmakov
<chillywilly> to develop NTFS on Linux since June 2001.
<chillywilly> To mount an NTFS volume, use the filesystem type 'ntfs'. The driver
<chillywilly> currently works only in read-only mode, with no fault-tolerance supported.
<chillywilly> look in
<crazymike> mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /folder
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly>  /linux/Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt if your curious
<crazymike> thats what i did when I pasted that error
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> try modprobe ntfs
<chillywilly> otherwise you need a kernel with that in it
<chillywilly> ;P
<crazymike> modprobe ntfs /dev/hda1 ???
<chillywilly> no
<chillywilly> just 'modporbe ntfs'
<crazymike> just modprobe ntfs
<crazymike> o
<chillywilly> er, modprobe
<crazymike> k
<crazymike> ok
<crazymike> then try again???
<chillywilly> assuming that is what it is called
<chillywilly> danielb@obfuscation:/lib/modules/2.4.18-xfs/kernel/fs/ntfs$ ls
<chillywilly> ntfs.o
<chillywilly> I got it ;)

<crazymike> ntfs                   47584   0  (autoclean)

<chillywilly> gah
<nickr> chillywilly: see, your little inside jokes are funny when you use them occationally, but its all getting really old at this point
<crazymike> i don't think it has anything to do with the fs type, I think it is just bitched...I mean thats why I can't boot it
<nickr> hrm, for some reason this font makes me crave heavy cream.
<chillywilly> nickr: bite me bitch
<crazymike> Both: Calm down boys
<chillywilly> nickr: it wasn't for your amusement as crazymike is on the 'inside'

<chillywilly> crazymike: "pole" cream
<nickr> crazymike: this font, neep alt, 'tastes' like cream
<nickr> heavy cream, the kind you make whipped cream from
<nickr> or put in your coffee

<nickr> well they are migratinga way from it, but they still have to support it
<nickr> since my skillset is on the other side, the person handling tech support and VB now will move more toward VB whlie I take up the web side
<chillywilly> or drill holes in your toe nails and hang you from fishing line
<chillywilly> maybe even chinese water torture

<dneighbo> sigh cant get flash to work on debian box :(
<chillywilly> gah!
<chillywilly> screw flash
<dneighbo> well generally i dont hump technology
<dneighbo> the problem is too many sites use flash
<dneighbo> and they are sites my wife wishes to visit
<dneighbo> so if my options are 
<dneighbo> a. install windows so she can get what she wants 
<dneighbo> or
<chillywilly> works here I think
<chillywilly> try this usrl
<dneighbo> b. get flash to work on gnu/linux
<chillywilly> (it has flash debs)
<drochaid> dneighbo: have you tried the swf viewer for flash?
<dneighbo> i have it working on my laptop but for some reason dumb thing hangs on my debian box :(
<chillywilly> deb http://marillat.free.fr/ unstable main
<chillywilly> try that one dude
<dneighbo> trying now
<chillywilly> I thought that's where I got flash from

<chillywilly> actually unstable has more packages I think
<chillywilly> dneighbo: apt-get install flashplayer-mozilla
<chillywilly> but it really is non-free
Action: chillywilly should apt-get remove it
<dneighbo> rock that worked!
Action: dneighbo was told to sign up for 'trading spaces'
<drochaid> trading spaces?

<chillywilly> yes

<dneighbo> its where two neighbors switch houses for two days

<psu> <brit_pride>we invented that</brit_pride>
<chillywilly> that's goofy
<chillywilly> oh gawd
<dneighbo> psu i think you all called it 'trading rooms'
<drochaid> ah, yes we did, didn't we psu :)
<drochaid> dneighbo: changing rooms
<dneighbo> or something, while the concept pretty much identical the production quality and show 'humor' is much better on 'trading spaces'
<dneighbo> btw: i was a fan of changing rooms :0
<chillywilly> I don't see the appeal
<chillywilly> but then again ppl here watch survivor and elmidate so...
<chillywilly> I think reality TV suck balls

<dneighbo> heeeeellllp
<dneighbo> how do i get rid of GDM or rather how can i do multi displays w/ it?
Action: dneighbo nudges chillywilly and chillywilly_ with a smelly trout
<dsmith> dneighbo: Check out /etc/X11/gdm  Lots o config files in there.
<dsmith> Sorry. I lied.  I use wgm, and there are lots of comfigs in /etc/X11/wdm.
<dneighbo> dsmith: sigh, i just want to be able to do startx -- :1 in (alt-ctl f2)
<dneighbo> and then togggle back and forth
<dneighbo> i cant seem to do that on this machine :(
<dneighbo> i assume its because gdm
<dneighbo> so want to know how to disable it
<dneighbo> or work around it :)
<dsmith> I know it can be done.
Action: dsmith looks
<dneighbo> well i can do it just fine on redhat 6.2
<dneighbo> but i dont have gdm, xdm or kdm on it
<dneighbo> so i guess wrong or right im assuming gdm is the thing causing the issue
<dneighbo> as i can START the second display up and it runs fine
<dneighbo> it just wont let me switch back to the first display :(
<dsmith>   /etc/X11/wdm/Xservers
<dsmith> Not sure where that is for gdm though.
<dsmith> I currently don't have gdm installed. Sorry.
<dneighbo>  /etc/gdm/gdm.conf
<dneighbo> but who knows what 'setting' it is
<dsmith> You need to tell it which console to use.  vt7 or vt8 or whatever.
<dneighbo> DisplaysPerHost=1
<dneighbo> shoudl this be higher than one?
<dneighbo> [servers]
<dneighbo> 0=Standard vt7
<dneighbo> do i set this to
<dneighbo> 1=Standard vt8
<dneighbo> ?
<dsmith> ADD the 1=xx vt8
<dneighbo> what is xx
<dsmith> Dunno. Just a name?
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> i think you can define different 'servers'
<dneighbo> [server-Standard]
<dneighbo> name=Standard server
<dneighbo> command=/usr/bin/X11/X -deferglyphs 16 -nolisten tcp
<dneighbo> flexible=true
<dsmith> The 0 or 1 is the DISPLAY
<dneighbo> right
<dneighbo> im gonna leave it as Standard and try
<dneighbo> if i go away you know it puked on itself :

<dsmith> What do you mean by toggle?
<dneighbo> yes
<dneighbo> ctl-alt-f7 ctl-alt-f8
<dneighbo> its gonna make me have to install windows if i cant figure it out
<dneighbo> as having to logout and login every time to have two people sahre a machine is utter HELL in my household
<dneighbo> anyone running debian that can tell me how to UNINSTALL gdm would be fine too
<dsmith> Doesn't C-A-f7 and C-A-f8 switch between the two?
<dneighbo> as i really dont care for it (exactly because of these issues)
<dneighbo> dsmith: normally it does
<dneighbo> but it KILLS the x session if switch that way :(
<dsmith> Well, just install another session manager like xdm or wdm.
<dneighbo> not kill and give me a prompt but HANG as in black nothingness
<dsmith> Gaaa!
<dsmith> Thats broke!

<dneighbo> dsmith i really dont want 'antoher' one
<dneighbo> would rather have none at all
<dneighbo> but a apt-get remove gdm 
<dneighbo> wants to remove x-server
<jcater> ack
<jcater> that's fscked up
<dneighbo> just how do i SHUT IT OFF
Action: dneighbo is reminded of phrase...
<dneighbo> mommy, "please, make the bad man stop"
<dsmith> Well, just put an "exit 0"  in the /etc/init.d/gdm file, or use that tool to move the symlinks around.
<dneighbo> oh wait
<dneighbo> now apt-get remove gdm seems to work
<dsmith> update-rc.d or something
<dneighbo> i thiink before i did
<dneighbo> gmd xdm kdm
<dneighbo> as i wanted to get rid of all the evil display managers. :)
<dneighbo> hopefully this wont totally toast me
<dneighbo> i was actually starting to 'like' gdm (previously i abhored it)
<dsmith> They start frome the init scripts.  You can stop them that way too. /etc/init.d/gdm stop
<dneighbo> i will be rigght back

<dneighbo> sigh helllp
Action: dsmith hums the Jeopardy "waiting" theme
<dneighbo> it hangs when i try to remove gdm
<dneighbo> even when gdm isnt running
<dneighbo> so i switched to xdm and it does exact same thing :(
<dsmith> WHat X you running?
<dneighbo> HOW please tell me HOW to stop ANY display manager from running
<dneighbo> this is just EVIL

Nick change: chillywilly_ -> chillywilly
<dneighbo> hey i think i have gdm removed now
<dneighbo> but how do i make xdm not start now?
<dneighbo> as trying to 'remove' it wants to take x too
<dsmith> the --purge remove all the config files
<chillywilly> it shoudln't be that hard and X should not depend it either that would be stupid

<chillywilly> she'll have to suffer the wrath of GNU/Linux after all

<chillywilly> I only installed it so she could run her bible teaching software and turba tax (although I think she should just do it on the damn web)
<chillywilly> er, turbo
dneighbo (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> help triple help
<dsmith> Does turbo tax (or tax cut) run under wine?
<chillywilly> people just don't like change
<dneighbo> ok gdm and xdm are now both DEAD
<chillywilly> nope
<dneighbo> but i still can NOT switch between vt
<chillywilly> trued that first
<dneighbo> even with only ONE session up
<dsmith> dneighbo: Sounds like and X server problem to me.
<dneighbo> i.e. if i start x from vt1
<dneighbo> it starts it in vt7
<dsmith> Doesn't like your video card.
<dneighbo> and if go to vt2-6 and try to come back to vt7
<dneighbo> it flickers like it tries and then hangs eternal death
<dneighbo> where only atl-ctrl-bcksp saves it
<dneighbo> ANY idea where to start researching this :(
<dneighbo> i was thinking maybe its cause im on a switch box?
<dneighbo> and i think
<dneighbo> alt-ctrl-shift is the key combo to switch it....
<dsmith> What X, What video card?
<dneighbo> this just sucks cause i taught my wife concept of vt
<dneighbo> and she LOVED it
<dneighbo> and one thing that made moving to linux 'acceptable'
<dneighbo> um
<dneighbo> xfree86 4.x
<dneighbo> trident cyberblade videocard i think
<dneighbo> btw i my video settings arent that great
<chillywilly> I thought she GOT Free Software?
<dneighbo> i get a LOT of flickering
<chillywilly> that sounds like a cheap ass card ;)
<dneighbo> chillywilly its built on the motherboard
<chillywilly> where's the ATI All in Wonder Card or the GeForce eh?
<dsmith> Can you got to a text cosole and back with only one X running?
<dneighbo> but windows would look fine on it if not better than 
<dneighbo> anyhow
<dneighbo> no
<dneighbo> dsmith : that no was for you
<dneighbo> if i 'leave' X for antoher vt
<dneighbo> there is no going back :)
<dsmith> Thats BROKE.
<dneighbo> i can pop between NORMAL vt's just fine though
<dneighbo> which makes me think its not hte 'switch box'
<dneighbo> dsmith i agree
<dneighbo> but HOW do i fix it?
<dsmith> There *might* be some extra options and settings for your vid card.
Action: dneighbo goes back to dpkg-reconfigure x
<dsmith> Need to find some docs in the /usr/share/doc/X directoryes
<dneighbo> will be back in a moment if i go away
<chillywilly> dneighbo: you didn't happen to use google at all did you?
<chillywilly> I mean I know it is not as fun as bitch in #gnuenterprise
<chillywilly> er, bitching
<chillywilly> but you may be able to find an "answer"
<dsmith> dneighbo: Look in /usr/share/doc/xserver-xfree86
<dsmith> dneighbo: And I'd be running 4.1.x and not 4.0.x
Action: chillywilly has 4.1.x
<chillywilly> 4.1.0:
<chillywilly>     Support (accelerated where the chip supports it) for the TVGA8900D, TGUI9440AGi, TGUI9660, TGUI9680, ProVidia 9682, ProVidia 9685, 3DImage975, 3DImage985, Blade3D, Cyber9320, Cyber9382, Cyber9385, Cyber9388, Cyber9397, Cyber9397/DVD, Cyber9520, Cyber9525/DVD, CyberBlade/Ai1, CyberBlade/DSTN/Ai1, CyberBlade/DSTN/i1, CyberBlade/DSTN/i7, CyberBlade/e4, CyberBlade/i1, CyberBlade/i7, CyberBladeXP, and CyberBladeXPm is provided by t

<chillywilly> seems 4.1.x may have better support
<dsmith> dneighbo: Are you using xserver-xfree86 ?
<chillywilly> dneighbo: is that a laptop?
Action: chillywilly smacks dneighbo with a salmon to get hsi attention
<chillywilly> you could try the frame buffer device
<dneighbo> sorry back
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> reran config and seems slightly better, now can see it repaint instead of just black but it still locks
<dneighbo> how do i tell what x i have?

<dsmith> Use w3m
<chillywilly> becaue it is VESA 2.0 compliant
<dsmith> awesome text web browser.  Does tables
Action: chillywilly likes links
<chillywilly> dneighbo: is that a laptop?
<dneighbo> not a laptop
<dneighbo> sigh
<chillywilly> shouldn't matter though
<dneighbo> so what do i need to do
<dneighbo> best i can tell X seems to work ok
<dneighbo> i jusst cant use vt or multi display
<chillywilly> try the frame buffer you can always switch it back
<chillywilly> instead of 'trident'
<dsmith> What's happening is that the vid driver isn't talking to the chip properly
<dsmith> Some registers aren;t getting saved
<dsmith> OR are being used improperly
<dneighbo> can i update my xserver or something?
<dneighbo> how do i tell what DRIVER
<dneighbo> as i only get option of TRIDENT
<dneighbo> not a specific trident
<chillywilly> you know where you picked trident at?
<chillywilly> that's where you pcik them at
<dneighbo> yeah dpkg-reconfigure
<chillywilly> er, pick
<chillywilly> yup
<dneighbo> pick what?
<dneighbo> framebuffer?
<dneighbo> as i dont see anything but ONE trident
<chillywilly> I think it's there
Action: chillywilly looks
<dsmith> chillywilly: What about adding support for frambufer in the knerel?  Does he need a new kernel too?
<chillywilly> only if he doesn't have it
<chillywilly> BUT
<dneighbo> i have 2.4.xxx
<chillywilly> he has the stcok kernel, IIRC
<dneighbo> and its there
<chillywilly> er, stock
<chillywilly> yep
<dneighbo> i turned it on and off
<dneighbo> framebuffer control of kernel
<dneighbo> and no dice
<chillywilly> you need that lilo line though
<chillywilly> (or GRUB)
<chillywilly> vga=something
<chillywilly> just like on that web page

<chillywilly> hehe
<dneighbo> chillywilly i dont understand what you are asking me to do 
<dneighbo> and i cant get to the web page
<dneighbo> i REALLY want to know why when i run xf86config
<chillywilly> that machine has a net connection right?
<dneighbo> it lets me pick trident/cyberblade
<chillywilly> obviously since you are here
<dneighbo> but when i try dpkg-reconfigure
<dneighbo> it only lists 'trident'
<chillywilly> does the ctberblade on work then?
<chillywilly> er, cyberblade

<chillywilly> (with your version in there)
<chillywilly> that just happens to be my current kernel image

<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> it's foobarred
<dneighbo> as the spec says that it will support up to 1600x1200
<dneighbo> now the video card does have NO memory

<dneighbo> i have wasted WAY too long on it
<chillywilly> plz
<dneighbo> will live to learn with getting my shit toasted
<dneighbo> when wife logs me out :(
Action: chillywilly has wasted a week or so on getting a useless debian installl
<chillywilly> dneighbo: Gnome should actually save your session
<dsmith> dneighbo: Don't give up!
<chillywilly> where did you get that machine from
<chillywilly> yes, screw that you gotts beat the machine not the other way around
<dsmith> Who is the master here anyway?
<chillywilly> we have no masters
<chillywilly> only "mastas"
<dsmith> Oh. Sorry.
<chillywilly> you better be
<chillywilly> sheeeet
<dneighbo> i just dont have time to fight it
<dneighbo> im just ticked as i moved ALL my email to it

<dneighbo> so now have to constantly log in and out
<dsmith> Bogus harware is a real pain.
<dneighbo> and if i leave my account up im screwed
<dneighbo> dsmith : thats a copout

<chillywilly> spring for the good stuff ;)
<chillywilly> j/k
<dneighbo> shoudl not have to be TOP dollar to make things work
<chillywilly> bah they put that chip in low end laptops dneighbo
<dneighbo> im not on a laptop
<dneighbo> but now i KNOW i really dont want to move my laptop to debian
<dsmith> Well, the lastest-and-greatest is alway broke. It takes a while for the code to catch up.
<chillywilly> never said you were
<dneighbo> at least not until i have another box that mirrors its functionality cmpletely
<dsmith> Cant be too old either. Need to be in the sweet spot of about two years old.

<yogurt2unge> hello people I have a problem when I want connect GEAS to Postgres
<reinhard> yogurt2unge: i am here
<reinhard> what is your problem
dtm (dtm@ip22.promontory.sfo.interquest.net) left irc: "brb"
<yogurt2unge> The problem is How to connect to de DB
<yogurt2unge> I created the user in the postgress
<reinhard> yogurt2unge: may i ask what you are planning to do with geas?
<reinhard> use it in production
<reinhard> or play with it
<reinhard> or want to help with development?
<yogurt2unge> I put It is my first time with geas
<reinhard> just to inform you
<reinhard> the geas that is currently in the downloads area
<reinhard> or in cvs
<reinhard> is the "old" incarnation and we have stopped development on that
<reinhard> a complete rewrite from scratch is just about to be started
<reinhard> so i don't want to stop you but i think it could be wasted effort to put time into this "old" geas
<yogurt2unge> Ok, OK, you said that I must download the cvs and try run?
<reinhard> um no
<reinhard> what i wanted to say is
<yogurt2unge> this version "run"? or is to beta?
<reinhard> currently we have no "run" ("production") version of geas
<reinhard> we have that c code we got contributed from a company
<reinhard> which is what you are looking at now
<reinhard> we decided to no longer put efforts into that code
<reinhard> as it's too far away from what we would need
<reinhard> and the rewrite has not yet started
<reinhard> so i guess what i'm saying is
<reinhard> there is no "geas" at the moment
<reinhard> the old has died
<reinhard> the new has not yet been born
<reinhard> but keep your eyes open
<reinhard> the new one will arrive soon :)
<yogurt2unge> Ok, what's "soon" meaning of?
Action: reinhard hides
<reinhard> depends on how many are going to help
<reinhard> currently all of GNU Enterprise is volunteer work
<reinhard> we all do it in our spare time
<yogurt2unge> In this momment my company need to know about any Frameworks to start a project
<yogurt2unge> GNU Enterprise is in focus
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> remember you can use GNU Enterprise in 2-tier and in n-tier mode
<reinhard> 2-tier means forms talks directly to database
<reinhard> this is very usable already
<reinhard> and it _is_ used in production at several places
<reinhard> n-tier means that there is the appserver in between
<yogurt2unge> Yes, It was my first test and based it I made my recomendation
<reinhard> i believe it will be some months until that constellation is usabel in production
<reinhard> however if you and/or your company is willing to help we can speed that up a lot

<hobbes> someone here ?
<reinhard> yes
<hobbes> ok$
<hobbes> I just encountered gnue
<hobbes> most of the docs are real old
<hobbes> my question : is it usable now to manage a small business
<reinhard> hobbes: in a nutshell
<reinhard> gnue is two projects in one
<reinhard> a. create the tools that can be used to build powerful business applications
<reinhard> b. create the powerful business applications themselves
<dneighbo> reinhard really its 3 in 1 :)
<reinhard> we are currently in stage a.
<dneighbo> c. a meta package of GNU that bundles enterprise software for the GNU project :)
<reinhard> dneighbo: ok
<dneighbo> but other than that i agree 100% :)
<reinhard> hobbes: so it all depends what you are wanting to do
<reinhard> if you are looking at a tool that lets you build your own business apps
<reinhard> then you could use gnue for sure
<dneighbo> nutshell, if you are willing to build your own app w/ frame work, what are you waiting for :)
<reinhard> if you are looking for a ready to go accounting package
<dneighbo> if you are wanting to open the box and press the button to have accounting then nope :)
<reinhard> rofl
<dneighbo> DCL and Bayonne are both available and working
<reinhard> at least dneighbo and me agree :)
<hobbes> :-)
Action: reinhard is away: food
<dneighbo> but are not using the framework (this is part c) :) of meta package
<dneighbo> both are getting intergrated into the framework so they are good choices :)
<hobbes> ok, I'm considering creating my small business right now
<hobbes> it would be service to small business for which a full time It staff is not needed
<hobbes> I need accounting, but can do some developpment for it
<hobbes> (I'm not a developper but I know how a relational db system works)
<hobbes> I considered gnucash
<hobbes> but that wouldn't allow me to manage other things (stocks, sales,...)
<hobbes> and encountered gnue
<hobbes> do you think it would be usable with a small investment in development 
<hobbes> or it requires a big investment to be usable ?
<hobbes> (I'd like to use it because I could propose the solution to clients when it's ready)
<hobbes> (clients for which stocks, sales, invoices,... are requisites)
<hobbes> And if ti doesn't work now, approx when will it ?
<hobbes> (1 year, 5 years,...)
<hobbes> ?
<dneighbo> depends
<dneighbo> for example i expect DCL to be ready very soon
<dneighbo> for small business (SERVICE) based consultants
<hobbes> what is DCL ?  :-)))
<dneighbo> like software consultant shops
<dneighbo> dcl.sourceforge.net
<dneighbo> it is like a project management / help desk system
<dneighbo> we are adding strong CRM support into it
<dneighbo> and making it so that the work order side could be used to generate invoices
<dneighbo> i.e. a time entry/crm/billing solution for software consultants (or any service based company)
<dneighbo> it is quite usable today
<drochaid_> WOOOOOO
<hobbes> but now there is no way to do accounting, and it's not expected soon
Nick change: drochaid_ -> drochaid
<drochaid> dneighbo: are you involved with the DCL project?

<dneighbo> hobbes that is correct you can not do accounitng out of box today
<hobbes> dneighbo: what level of development is needed ?
<btami> in GNUe?
<hobbes> (I mean : development in gnue, or gnue framework is ready I just have to make my specific apps)
<dneighbo> app developers
<dneighbo> the framework or parts of it are highly usable
<dneighbo> btami as to reports
<dneighbo> the code works
<dneighbo> the biggest hang up is we need to 'define' our tags
<dneighbo> several of us have mentioned some things but no one made a 'proposal'
<dneighbo> once that is done i can do XSLT style sheets against them
<dneighbo> and we will have workign reports :)
<dneighbo> hobbes our framework is designd for BUSINESS ANALYST more thna 'programmers'
<dneighbo> so if you can understand table structures
<dneighbo> and know what you want your app to do
<dneighbo> doing it in GNUe shouldnt be too difficult even for a non 'programmer'
<hobbes> ok thanks, I'll look at it
<btami> dneighbo: can you tell me some words what do you think about 'tags'
<btami> these are about report layout?
<dneighbo> um setup and layout
<dneighbo> so you might hae like
<dneighbo> <title>my foo report</title>
<dneighbo> let me dig up something...
<dneighbo> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/reports.txt
<dneighbo> is something i dummied up when we talked about before in here
<dneighbo> basically that doc isnt what we WANT
<dneighbo> but it helps describe what we are looking for
<dneighbo> im all about starting simple
<dneighbo> and working way into more complex reporting ojbects :)
<btami> I will read
<btami> sometimes I misunderstand things, but if I understand
<btami> I will try a proposal

<chillywilly> did fstab work for ya?
<crazymike> hellz yeah
<chillywilly> good
<chillywilly> you going to brave the storm of getting that SB Live card to work?
<crazymike> I am gonna try
<chillywilly> wel I would NOT worry about compiling a new kernel
<crazymike> right now I am trying to look up how to get the net connection of boot
<chillywilly> the one you have is fine
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> just apt-get install kernel-source then you can compile that Sb Live driver against it
<drochaid> heh, ok chillywilly ... although I can't be more than 8 hours travel for you :)
<crazymike> i don't see anything in the man page about making it permanent
<jamest> chillywilly: I'm 99% sure my sblive worked out of box w/ debian 2.4 kernel
<chillywilly> jamest: what driver did you load"?
<jamest> checking
<chillywilly> help out my man crazymike would you ;)?
<jamest> crap
<chillywilly> jamest: the 2.4.17 stock kernel?
<crazymike> FUCK
<jamest> i was wrong
<chillywilly> ok
<jamest> sigh
<chillywilly> crazymike: what did you do?
<crazymike> nothing
<crazymike> I never do anyhting
<jamest> i thought i'd at long last gotten rid of all my custom kernels
Action: chillywilly always compiles his own
<chillywilly>  but I don't have many boxen to maintain

<derek> chillywilly: remember how i said 'i will just live with no vt'
<derek> well the other 'side effect' of this friggin card under linux
<derek> is that it 'offsets' the mouse
<derek> by about 1/2 inch
<jcater> dude
<derek> i say it happen the first day and thought it was a bug in gmc
<jcater> no fscking way
<jcater> that's happening to my terminals at work
<derek> so ignored it as it  never happened again
<mdean> yo
<derek> then wife called today and explained what was up
<chillywilly> how gay
<chillywilly> you just need to give the frame buffer another chance

<chillywilly> make it work man
<chillywilly> dude, if I lived near you I would come over and help you out

<chillywilly> like yesterday and shit
<chillywilly> how stupid
<dneighbo> i had this happen before and jamest gave me some brutal mount command (iirc) to fix it
<chillywilly> you did what
<chillywilly> mount /dev/hdX /target ?
<nickr> dneighbo: mount -o remount,rw /
<chillywilly> why is it doing it read only?
<chillywilly> I've never had that happen
<nickr> dneighbo: whats the Driver line in /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 in the Device seciotn
<dneighbo> nickr: give me two seconds trying to reboot
<dneighbo> whoo
<dneighbo> that was close, grub seems to be back in action
<dneighbo> nickr: give me a minute then will paste here the driver info
<dneighbo> iirc
<dneighbo> BoardName "CyberBlade/i1"
<dneighbo> BudID "1:0:0"
<dneighbo> Driver "trident"
<dneighbo> Screen 0
<dneighbo> VendorNAme "Trident"
<dneighbo> where i got that info it said also to add 
<nickr> okay
<dneighbo> Indentifier "Device[0]"
<dneighbo> which didnt work
<nickr> don't worry about that
<dneighbo> so i had to remove it
<chillywilly> everything I have seen says use the fb device
<chillywilly> for that card
<chillywilly> but that is fun to get working isn't it ;)
<nickr> puh Option "NoAccel" "True"
<nickr> in the device section
<nickr> right under driver
<dneighbo> give me a second the reboot barfed on self
<dneighbo> fsck failed
<dneighbo> so trying a manual one and reboot
<dneighbo> man dat was ugly
<nickr> now to figure out what I have that goes wel with vodka
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> if you fix this you want paymentin vodka or us dollars
<nickr> USD, I need to do ltaudry.
<nickr> :)
<chillywilly> bah
<dneighbo> ah
<dneighbo> noaccell freaked it out hard
<nickr> freakid it out!?
<nickr> it should definitely not freak it out
<dneighbo> um scrunched it up and made it blink and go nuts
<chillywilly> because that driver blows dude
<jcater> nickr: given his history
<jcater> freaking out could mean
<dneighbo> in fact it looks almost identical to what happens when you try to toggle between vt's :)
<jcater> "working correctly"
<jcater> :D
<dneighbo> under the driver entry added
<dneighbo> Option "NoAccel" "True"
<dneighbo> thats what you asked for right?
<nickr> yen
<nickr> dneighbo: I'll sell you a rendition card for 20$, problem solved. :)
<dneighbo> pci?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> although I have a nice virge/vx
<nickr> and an MGA
<dneighbo> i uncomment that and it goes back to way it was before
<nickr> hrh
<nickr> thats very strange behavior
<nickr> NoAccell is supposed to make it slow but definietly stable
<dneighbo> two ll's or one
<nickr> one
<nickr> hrm
<chillywilly> read this dude
<chillywilly> talks about you offset pointer problem
<chillywilly> http://www.pairlist.net/pipermail/linux-laptop/2001-November/000314.html
<chillywilly>  had the same problem on a 352Tev. Adding these two lines in the
<chillywilly> XF86Config-4 file in the "Device" section
<chillywilly>        Option "NoAccel"
<chillywilly>        Option "SWCursor"
<nickr> yea.
<dneighbo> so add those two optoins?
<chillywilly> it's amamzing what google will do for you ;)

<chillywilly> that talks about it too
<chillywilly> uh?
<chillywilly> doh that's the same friggin url
Action: chillywilly needs t recopy that
<chillywilly> might want to try this config even
<dneighbo> ok SWCursor
<dneighbo> freaks it out too :(
<chillywilly> http://boreal321.com/vmg/XF86Config
<dneighbo> basically it just throws up a white screen and hangs
<nickr> dneighbo: maybe you have bad hardware, did the card get bent?
<chillywilly> it's onboard
<nickr> get bent, it pays
<chillywilly> they put that thing in a lot of laptops it seems ;)
<nickr> hehe
<dneighbo> nickr: its new hardware (not that it doesnt mean its not bad)
<dneighbo> but its onboard as chilly states so its not real likely that its bent or not 'seated' properly etc :)
<nickr> why did you buy something with the word 'cyber' in it?
<dneighbo> i didnt 
<chillywilly> according to xf4.1.x docs that 'trident' driver is supposed to work with that card
<dneighbo> i bought what i could afford
<dneighbo> chillywilly: thats what i saw too
<dneighbo> but its freaking out
<chillywilly> blech
<nickr> sucks
<nickr> at least its not a SiS
<nickr> this thing is so fucking slow
<nickr> I can't watch dvds on it
Action: chillywilly has an ATI Rage Mobility P/M
<chillywilly> no 3D support yet though :(
<dneighbo> this is supposed to be a 'decent' card from the specs (as on boards go)
Action: nickr has an ati rage pro 128 in his winders box
<nickr> not that that box works
<nickr> currently
jcater (jason@HubA-mcr-24-92-70-39.midsouth.rr.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<chillywilly> why don't you put it in the one your using?

<nickr> chillywilly: remember that boalrd I broke?
<nickr> chillywilly: do you see an AGP slot on this board? :)
<nickr> thats the board with the SiS on it
<nickr> the AT version of which I'm currently using
<chillywilly> oh
<dneighbo> is it possible lspci -v is giving me back 'bad' info on the card?
<dneighbo> though that chipset seems to support that its trident
<nickr> dneighbo: Not likely.
<chillywilly> nickr: you never used the frame buffer?
<nickr> chillywilly: ?
<chillywilly> I mena do you have experience setting it up
<nickr> chillywilly: my card doesn't seem to work with the sisfb driver
<nickr> oh, yea sure. you just load the correct driver

<crazymike> <chillywilly>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike> thats the part I need
<chillywilly> yes
<crazymike> ty
<crazymike> then do I need to take out the part about dhcp???
<chillywilly> yes if you aren't using it anymore
<crazymike> just # that out
<chillywilly> you assgning static IPs now?
<crazymike> then how will I connect to the net???
<crazymike> neverminf
<crazymike> nevermind
<crazymike> no, nevermind the nevermind
<crazymike> it says :
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike>         client dhclient
<chillywilly> yea, you want dhcp if it is dhcp
<crazymike> then I have to do pump -i eth0
<chillywilly> no it should use dhclient for you on boot up
<crazymike> I am setting static IP's
<chillywilly> *if*
<chillywilly> you have eth0 in the 'auto' line
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet ???
<chillywilly> as that specifies what interfaces to bring up on boot
<chillywilly>  iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike> but I don't have dhcp
<crazymike> anymore
<crazymike> right???
<chillywilly> then you want the static one
<chillywilly> I dunno did you change your router fconfig?
<crazymike> i am right now
<chillywilly> ok
<crazymike> doing both at once
<chillywilly> then you can use my previous static example
<crazymike> # /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)
<crazymike> # The loopback interface
<crazymike> # automatically added when upgrading
<crazymike> auto lo
<crazymike> iface lo inet loopback

<crazymike>         client dhclient

<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike> thats what I ahve right now
<chillywilly> add eth0 to the 'auto' line
<chillywilly> auto lo eth0
<chillywilly> like that
<crazymike>  auto lo eth0
<chillywilly> ye[
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> er, yep
<crazymike> # /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)
<crazymike> # The loopback interface
<crazymike> # automatically added when upgrading
<crazymike> auto lo eth0
<crazymike> iface lo inet loopback

<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike> so I still want the dhcp part in there or not???
<chillywilly> on
<crazymike> I can edit that out, right
<chillywilly> er, no
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> comment it out
<chillywilly> or remove it
<chillywilly> you can't deifne the same interface twice ;)
<crazymike> #iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike>         client dhclient
<crazymike> just that part, right
<crazymike> the rest stays
<chillywilly> no, both lines
<chillywilly> otherwise it will get confused
<crazymike> oh, I thought that took care of both, hence the tab
<crazymike> but ok
<chillywilly> then you gotta go configure your dad's and sisters box's
<chillywilly> er, sister's box
<crazymike> my sister isn't online
<chillywilly> give them static IPs
<crazymike> she just ahs a computer
<crazymike> s/ahs/has
<chillywilly> well when they want to use it they won't be able to unless you set their shit up
<dneighbo> well i got it to accept SWCursor
<chillywilly> oh, ok
<chillywilly> dneighbo: cool
<dneighbo> copied someone elses X file
<dneighbo> from a NON DEBIAN machine
<dneighbo> i think debconf is loading some modules up front that kill some of the options
<chillywilly> probably
<chillywilly> BUT
<dneighbo> i still cant 'toggle' between vt's with this setup
<chillywilly> you can choose which ones
<dneighbo> but we will see if it fixes the cursor issue
Action: chillywilly thinks this channel should be #debian-support
<dneighbo> if so i can live with it for now until i find some X bad ass that can explain things to me
<dneighbo> tempted to try the no accel now
<chillywilly> maybe I should start my own support channel
<crazymike> lol
<crazymike> you should
<dneighbo> two other things
<chillywilly> gnu-linux-support
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> #gnu-linux-support
<dneighbo> a. it fixed my LARGE font gripe (yeah)
<dneighbo> b. it got rid of the 'flickering'
<dneighbo> if it
<dneighbo> c. fixes cursor
<dneighbo> i will be happy
<dneighbo> then if i can figure out vt
<dneighbo> i will be set :)
<dneighbo> though it appears to still be in 800x600
<dneighbo> NOT cool
<dneighbo> slowly but surely i will get there
<dneighbo> i just need to get it to point where im not getting support calls at work for the 'fscked up mouse'
<crazymike> for packet forwarding, do I ahve to forward the pop3 port or will it still do that automatically, for e-mail???
<chillywilly> dneighbo: what do you think of starting a *good* help channel
<dneighbo> btw: syphleed wont work for my wife :(
<chillywilly> why not?
<chillywilly> crazymike: you will be good
<crazymike> do I only need to set the FTP port
<dneighbo> as it doesnt display html mail fully and doesnt support clicking on email :(
<chillywilly> crazymike: yes
<dneighbo> so installed evolution for her
<crazymike> ok
<dneighbo> will see how it goes
<dneighbo> chillywilly: sounds good to me
<chillywilly> cause it is a 'serever' and will accept incoming requests
<crazymike> I'll brb...got to restart my computer
<crazymike> see if the net still works
<chillywilly> crazymike: you have ip forwarding turned on?
<crazymike> yeah
<chillywilly> (in your router)
<chillywilly> ok
<crazymike> I just set it to forward port 21 to my IP
<chillywilly> you need to forward the ftp port
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> also
<crazymike> then set my IP
<crazymike> and turned off DHCP
<chillywilly> I think you need to forward the data port
<chillywilly> I thin ftp uses 2 ports
<chillywilly> ftp-data  20/tcp
<chillywilly> ftp   21/tcp
<chillywilly> forwrad both of those
<chillywilly> to your IP

<dneighbo_> is there a way you can probe to see what resolution you are running
<chillywilly> uh
<chillywilly> not that I know of
<chillywilly> XFree86.0.log might contain some info though ;)
<chillywilly> it is in /var/log

<chillywilly> wb crazymike
<crazymike> hi
<chillywilly> how goes it?
<crazymike> the internet still works
<chillywilly> can you do an ifconfig and see the interface up?
<crazymike> but I had to type dhclient
<chillywilly> er, did you haev to bring it up manually?
<crazymike> yeah
<chillywilly> blah
<chillywilly> thought you turned dhcp off
<chillywilly> also dude you need to set the router IP as your gateway then if you use static
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> like
<chillywilly> gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
<chillywilly> in the static interface definition part
Action: chillywilly forgot about that
<chillywilly> but seems the thing is still talking dhcp
<crazymike> whats the easiest way to find out my IP
<crazymike> the other one
<chillywilly> ifconfig
<crazymike> I just saw it but don't know where
<chillywilly> er?
<chillywilly> which one?
<crazymike> the house IP
<chillywilly> for the router
<chillywilly> the public IP?
<crazymike> yeah
<crazymike> the public
<chillywilly> crazymike@mke-65-31-133-230.wi.rr.com
<chillywilly> I guess it is 65.31.133.230 ;)
Action: chillywilly pings it
<crazymike> cool, thanks
<chillywilly> you are squashing ICMP packets though
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike>         gateway 65.31.133.230
<chillywilly> no silly
<crazymike> whats that mean
<chillywilly> you need the router's provate IP
<crazymike> oh
<chillywilly> not thw public one
<crazymike> 192.168.1.1
<chillywilly> it make all the hosts on your network look like packets come from that
<crazymike> like that
<chillywilly> then
<chillywilly> it reverses it and delivers stuff back to your orivate IPS
<chillywilly> you dig?
<chillywilly> that's called NAT
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> Network Address Translation
<chillywilly> (ip forwarding)
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike>         gateway 192.168.1.1
<chillywilly> bingo ;)
<chillywilly> did they cover the packet format i your networking class yet?
<chillywilly> like what IP packet headers look like
<chillywilly> (roughly)
<chillywilly> basically it pull the private IP off the packet and slaps on the public one and delivers it
<chillywilly> then it does the reverse
<chillywilly> yanks off the public IP and put the private back on and delivers it locally
<crazymike> kind of

<chillywilly> wooooo!
<chillywilly> you da man!
<crazymike> no, you da man, niggie
<chillywilly> sheeeet
<crazymike> Gftp...will that allow me to setup an FTP???
<crazymike> or is it done somewhere else in Linux??
<chillywilly> gftp is a 'client' dude
<chillywilly> you need to install an ftp server
<chillywilly> (daemon)
<crazymike> well, alot of the clients for Windows, serve dual purpose
<crazymike> client/server
<crazymike> not alot but some, I should say
<chillywilly> well gftp is only a client
<chillywilly> as is ncftp
<crazymike> thats what I was asking
<chillywilly> althought there is ncftpd
<chillywilly> which is a server
<dneighbo> ok have tools now i need to work for an hour or so i guess :)
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> crazymike: okey dokey smokey
<chillywilly> crazymike: I;m not sure what the best ftp server is to use
<crazymike> wu-ftpd
<chillywilly> sure
<chillywilly> that'll work
<nickr> I should hook up the subwoofer and play tnhe THX sound as loud as it goes
<chillywilly> heheh
<crazymike> my book says that is the most popular :)
<chillywilly> there's also proftpd
<chillywilly> or just plain ftpd
<crazymike> I am getting wu=ftpd right now
<crazymike> it says ftpd sucks
<chillywilly> wuftp has a config program
<chillywilly> well a couple actually
<chillywilly> kwuftpd - wu-ftpd configuration tool
<chillywilly> webmin-wuftpd - wu-ftpd control module for webmin
<chillywilly> or you can be a real hacker and read your book and edit the files with vi
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> (or emacs)
<nickr> wuftpd? sacre vache!
<chillywilly> what's good nickr?
<nickr> hrm
<chillywilly> proftpd?
<chillywilly> ftpd suposedly blows goats
<chillywilly> er, supposedly
<nickr> well it depends on what you want
<chillywilly> he wants to run anon ftp off his computer to server up gufs shows
<chillywilly> etc.
<chillywilly> off his cable modem
<nickr> um gnutella?
<nickr> :)
<chillywilly> er, no
<chillywilly> woah
<chillywilly> there's a shit load of ftp servers
<dneighbo> um why run ftp?
<nickr> how about ..
<nickr> um
<chillywilly> crazymike: do apt-cache search ftpd
<nickr> muddleftp!
<nickr> lukemftp!
<dneighbo> why not use http?
<chillywilly> dneighbo: what should he run?
<nickr> +d
<dneighbo> http
<dneighbo> or
<dneighbo> scp
<nickr> vsftpd!
<dneighbo> if need anonymous file transfer use http
<chillywilly> it's for anonymous downloads
<nickr> http is much better for just downloady shit
<dneighbo> if you need authenticated use scp
<chillywilly> http is not as good as ftp
<nickr> just get freaking gn
<chillywilly> gn?
<dneighbo> just ftp is one more security hole
<nickr> chillywilly: based on what criteria?
<dneighbo> easier to just use http
<dneighbo> also almost everyone has a browser
<dneighbo> not everyone an ftp client
<nickr> chillywilly: its faster, lighter weight, can go though hostile firewalls, requires no authentication or dangerous trickery
<nickr> chillywilly: its universally supported
<chillywilly> http can't go through a firewall any better
<dneighbo> i would say if you merely want anon ftp dont use ftp :)
<dneighbo> use http
<dneighbo> chillywilly: sure it can
<chillywilly> you still have to open the http port
<dneighbo> at my work port 80 is open
<dneighbo> port 21 is not
<chillywilly> well whatever
<chillywilly> he wanted to run ftp
<dneighbo> just saying ftp is a liabilty
<nickr> for just downloads there are a lot of compelling reasons to use http over ftp
<dneighbo> and personally i would avoid unless some good reason (like legacy application or some special need)
<dneighbo> chillywilly: hell i bet you get your debs via http instead of ftp ;)
<chillywilly> well I know it's a potential security hole
<chillywilly> indeed I do
<chillywilly> crazymike: maybe you should setup apache ;)
<chillywilly> so these guys will shutup
<chillywilly> ;p
<crazymike> ummm...ok
<nickr> ne
<nickr> no
<crazymike> I don't care as long as it works
<nickr> apache is complicated and easy to break
<chillywilly> oh plz
<crazymike> and I don't know shit except what you guys tell me to do :)
<chillywilly> the default config is fine
Action: crazymike is stupid!!!
<nickr> try boa
<chillywilly> you setup apache
<chillywilly> put the files in /var/www/
<chillywilly> bingo bango
<chillywilly> you're done
<nickr> or thttpe
<nickr> thttpe
<chillywilly> no, apache
<nickr> thttpd
<nickr> damnit
<nickr> or wn
<chillywilly> piss on those other ones
<nickr> wn is really good, you just have to generate explicit indexes
<chillywilly> crazymike: apt-get isntall apache
<chillywilly> er, install
Action: crazymike ducks under the punches everyone is throwing at each other
<nickr> chillywilly: wtf is with you an apache? are you like getting excellent oral sex from it or something?
<crazymike> so should I get it or not???
<crazymike> AHAHAHAHAHA
<chillywilly> hell yea and you're a jealous little bitch nickr
<nickr> crazymike: get boa
<chillywilly> crazymike: get apache
Action: crazymike cries
<chillywilly> crazymike: who's going to help you out eh?
<crazymike> chillywilly: thats true
<chillywilly> who's your bro eh?
<chillywilly> don;t listen to this little chuckle head
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> that was a funny exchange
<dneighbo> <nickr> chillywilly: wtf is with you an apache? are you like getting excellent oral sex from it or something?
Action: crazymike is apt-getting some shit
<dneighbo> has got to be the quote of the nite
Action: nickr boms
<nickr> bows
Action: chillywilly thought his response to that was better
<chillywilly> [23:27:22] <chillywilly> hell yea and you're a jealous little bitch nickr
<dneighbo> chillywilly: mind tell me the source-list for that ;oral sex; apache?
<chillywilly> no
<dneighbo> dick
<chillywilly> punk
<dneighbo> i thought the freudian slip you made good too
<crazymike> apt-get install apache-oralpleasure

<chillywilly> you just need to copy files to /var/www and they need to have proper permissions (chmod 644 should be good enough)
<crazymike> it installed (i think) but nothing started up
<derek> nickr: i was trying to be polite :)
<chillywilly> /etc/init.d/apache start
<crazymike> i don't have that much space on this drive for that shit
<derek> the topic inthere when i was trying to get help tonight
<derek> was
<chillywilly> crazymike: make a symlink then
<derek> 'i wish apt could apt-grow weed'
<derek> or something like that
<crazymike> it says it is already started, I guess
<chillywilly> cd /var
<crazymike> I dunno
<chillywilly> mv www www.old
<nickr> derek: that would be a time saver
<chillywilly> ln -s /wgere/Igots/my/shiznit/at www
<chillywilly> cd ..
<chillywilly> chmod 755 www
<crazymike>  ln -s /wgere/Igots/my/shiznit/at www
<chillywilly> cd www
<crazymike> lol
<chillywilly> chmod 644 *
<chillywilly> then I would get a dyndns.org host name

<crazymike> where do I put the link though
<chillywilly> cd /var
<crazymike> in www
<crazymike> just in cd /var
