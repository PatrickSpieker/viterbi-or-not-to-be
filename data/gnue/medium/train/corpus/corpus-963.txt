<Mr_You> hi
<Mr_You> great news on the dcl & gnue merge
Action: drochaid is away: oot
<dneighbo> Mr_You thanks
<dneighbo> i need to announce on our announce list too
<Mr_You> I see some new nicks
<Mr_You> in regards to the GEAS rewrite, I guess there still isn't a python app server already in development that we may consider?
<Mr_You> I guess not, atleast not one that had multiple connection methods
<dneighbo> if you find one
<dneighbo> let us know
<dneighbo> so we can consider it
<dneighbo> zope is probably closest so far
<dneighbo> there are others but they are so infantile in development still not sure it makes sense
<Mr_You> i have a comment on the GEAS rewrite.. nothing mentions authentication
<dneighbo> there is something on security
Action: Mr_You considers those two seperate ;-)
<Mr_You> you noticed any progress or such in regards to the webclient?
<Mr_You> madlocke still doing that or no?
<dneighbo> um
<dneighbo> havent heard from madlocke in a bit
<dneighbo> jan was doing a php forms client and it seemed to be going well
<dneighbo> though he hasnt been around either 
<Mr_You> ok

<dneighbo> i had a flame war recently on a list
<dneighbo> question, what do you all feel is a fair consulting price
<dneighbo> i.e. NOT what you COULD charge, but what is a fair price
<drochaid> what type of consultation and to what market sector/size?
td-work (td-work@birddog225.birddog.com) left irc: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)
<drochaid> and no, I don't have any pizza left ;)
td-work (~td-work@birddog225.birddog.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> drochaid honestly it shouldnt matter about sector/business size
<dneighbo> IMHO
<dneighbo> type of consultation i agree maters
<dneighbo> er matters
<dneighbo> say general IT consultancy
<drochaid> I think it does matter about size
<dneighbo> mixed bag of networking, programming, project management
<dneighbo> drochaid why would size of company matter
<dneighbo> i.e. i think it somewhat morally wrong to charge a bigger client more than a smaller client
<drochaid> I'm aiming my consulting primarily at small businesses with very limited capital in the main part
<Mr_You> experience, skills, and requirements made by the "problem" determine the price, IMO
<drochaid> I have dropped my hourly cost substantially to allow them to be able to afford a service I believe they have a right to use, but normally can't afford
<dneighbo> i think 'the problem' and expertise needed to solve it should factor most of the price variable
<dneighbo> drochaid : yes im for that
<chillywilly> well I would charge more for prop./internal GPL solutions ;)
<Mr_You> for example, I have experience/skills in multiple *nix and Cisco.. but if someone pays me to install a RAID, I can't charge a higher hourly rate because I know Cisco.
<dneighbo> chillywilly you are evil
<dneighbo> i wouldnt do prop systems :)
<drochaid> so I don't charge *more* to a larger business, but I don't exclude those that couldn't normally afford me
<chillywilly> well, I didn;t imply that I would do it
<dneighbo> drochaid, understood :)
<Mr_You> charging different prices depending on the size of the org doesn't make much sense always
<chillywilly> but in general people will do prop. solutions
<dneighbo> i am against saying 'how big are you so i can overcharge you' :)
<dneighbo> im not against saying here is what it would cost, but i know you cant afford that lets see what we can do
<drochaid> for what your talking about dneighbo, I would say upto £125 an hour would be very acceptable depending on experiance and skill
<Mr_You> well..
<drochaid> *you're
<chillywilly> it deodns if you like the customer ;)
<Mr_You> you could say "anything the gets the best deal" or "gets the deal period".. so scaling your pricing in that regard is good I guess
<chillywilly> :P
<Mr_You> if you price each org differently then I don't see anything wrong with it.. all your doing is shooting to make the deal happen and still be beneficial
<Mr_You> its the larger orgs own fault for not trying to get a lower price
<chillywilly> you need to make your money and stay afloat...come people will not be able to afford you...if you can afford to cut them a deal then I'd say do it
Action: drochaid thinks dneighbo fell asleep
<chillywilly> dneighbo: most importantly let your conscious be your guide...if you are seriously ripping people off I am sure you will feel a bit guilty
<chillywilly> (assuming you;re a decent human being...yea big assumption I know)
<Mr_You> you could also look at "what may be a rip off price" .. is what people are still willing to pay.. so maybe its not a rip off?  ;-)
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> ouch 125 pounds seems extremely high
<dneighbo> i think i would have issues charging more than 80 US $
<dneighbo> depending on things having to 'overhead' maybe 100 US $
<Mr_You> for what exactly?
<dneighbo> any kind of IT consulting
<Mr_You> I disagree completely.
<drochaid> $100 US is pretty low tbh
<dneighbo> im hearing people say over 100 an hour
<dneighbo> and that just seems like gouging to me
<dneighbo> the justification i keep getting back
<Mr_You> $90-$100 is probably the average
<dneighbo> is that well you dont always have work
<drochaid> IBM charged me out @ £850 GBP a day
<dneighbo> wtf should a company pay you for not working :)
<drochaid> and that was really basic stuff
<dneighbo> is my opinion :)
<Mr_You> I've talked to Cisco Engineers that barely new anything and they charged $125/hour or such
<dneighbo> drochaid i dont think ibm pricing is non gouging
<dneighbo> sigh 
<dneighbo> i think consultants have m$ syndrome
<Mr_You> I can't charge a flat rate, I charge based on what needs done and skills required for the job
<dneighbo> the 'because you can' and 'look what others charge' is the common theme :(
<dneighbo> i guess im too much of a socialist
<Mr_You> and what it takes to get the deal or best deal
<dneighbo> Mr_You i dont think flat rate
<dneighbo> im saying over 100 seems like gouging to me
<Mr_You> derek: you can't pay a senior level network engineer the same as a jr. admin
<Mr_You> its not gouging when you consider the profit required..
<dneighbo> i looked at several surveys and the averages on the high end ar 85 bucks and low end 17 (tech support)
<dneighbo> which seems to support my argument
<dneighbo> we can agree to disagree
<Mr_You> thats hourly rate for individuals
<dneighbo> i guess im the one out in the dark here
<Mr_You> what you charge as a company and what you pay an individual are two different things
<dneighbo> 60,000 is 28/hr flat rath
<dneighbo> er rate
<drochaid> dneighbo: look at it from a business viewpoint. As a consultant, you are there for one purpose and one purpose only. To save the company money by making recommendations based on knowledge they do not posess. If the fee you charge reflects the level of saving they will make if carried out correctly, then it is a fair cost to them as long as they know upfront and agree to it.
<dneighbo> say you figure you have 4 times in overhead cost (extremely high)
<dneighbo> that is 112 an hour
<Mr_You> so you figure.. if someone is paying their employee $85/hour.. they are charging the client probably $150/hour or more
<Mr_You> right.. now add another $25/hour for profit
<drochaid> if they're paying $85 an hour they SHOULD be charging 3 times that Mr_You
<dneighbo> im sorry as an independent consultant
<dneighbo> if i can make 60k
<Mr_You> ok drochaid
<dneighbo> and have 2 week vacation and health insurance etc
<dneighbo> that is more than enough
<Mr_You> I agree.. but in the details lies the overhead of the rest of the company.. sales, execs, etc.
<drochaid> break it down as, 1x for salary, 1x for immediate expenses to maintain the consultanct, and the rest as a mix of profit and general indirect running costs
<dneighbo> Mr_You i guess i think that is the gouging part
<dneighbo> :)
<Mr_You> an independent person has less over, less cost
<dneighbo> i guess this only validates there is GREAT room for this market :)
<dneighbo> i.e. building a COMPANY that conosidates independents world wide
<Mr_You> company needs to make a profit to grow
<dneighbo> while maintaining next to zero overhead :)
<drochaid> dneighbo: that's called IBM dood :)
<dneighbo> which is POSSIBLE via internet
<dneighbo> drochaid ibm has HUGE overhead
<drochaid> I know
<drochaid> I contributed to it a great deal :D
<dneighbo> anyhow...
<Mr_You> the lowest over head will come from each employee having multiple hats/jobs within the company.. ie. the CEO also performs the lower level duties
<drochaid> dneighbo: 60k !!!! usd!!!! is that all you want?
<drochaid> brb
<Mr_You> $60k/year for me is fine too
<Mr_You> my dad owns his own company and I never knew how much he made until he applied for an apt I was gonna rent.. $80k/year.. I have no idea where he spends his money.. cept on cigarettes
<Mr_You> rather he's president and is one of the stock holders
<Mr_You> guess he only cares about saving for retirement
<dneighbo> 60,000 yeah is nice living
<Mr_You> thats usually what I aim for.. you said its $28/hour?  usually I shoot for $30-$32/hour.
<dneighbo> well 28 hour is raw money
<Mr_You> for Senior Sun admin duties
<dneighbo> if you put in for insurance
<dneighbo> and paying employers portion of tax
<Mr_You> they get their moneys worth too
<drochaid> 60k USD is rather low
<dneighbo> probably looking at closer to 40/hr
<dneighbo> to get that 28/hr in reality
<Mr_You> I don't follow
<drochaid> ok, I know housing and general costs over there are lower than here, but still ....
<Mr_You> insurance is about $1k per year for me I guess..
<dneighbo> drochaid: on 60k a year
<dneighbo> can support family of 5 nicely
<dneighbo> 2 new cars
<dneighbo> 2000sqft home (own) with pool
<dneighbo> etc etc
<drochaid> yeah, but it leaves little room for growth or serious toys ;)
<Mr_You> yeah I'm very lucky
<dneighbo> as i said 'im a bit of a socialist'
<drochaid> 2000sqft home with pool??!!!!!!
<Mr_You> drochaid: not if yer single ;-)
<drochaid> sheese, told you your housing was cheaper
<dneighbo> if you are single making 60k
<Mr_You> that would be a pricey home around here probably
<dneighbo> you can do a lot better :)
<drochaid> I was living in a very small 2 bed house worth 96K GBP
<dneighbo> like 4000 sqft home
<dneighbo> and mercedes :)

<drochaid> what can I get for $150,000 USD ??
<dneighbo> per year
<Mr_You> I can't buy a home til I find stability.. not sure that really exist
<dneighbo> or housing what can you get for 150,000
<drochaid> housing
<Mr_You> drochaid: $100k California is about $60k here
<Mr_You> east coast, North Carolina
<dneighbo> 150,000 is about what i paid for 1890sqft + pool
<dneighbo> in arizona
<drochaid> compared to the 2 bed house I had for that ...
<drochaid> :o
<dneighbo> 4 bedroom, dining room, living room, family room and huge master bedroom, walkin closets etc
<drochaid> ok, so $60k a year is a lot more for you than it is for me
<dneighbo> nothing extravagent
<dneighbo> for about 180k could have gotten a huge deal w/ no pool
<dneighbo> like 3500sqft
<dneighbo> 6 bedroom

<drochaid> my real charge is £65 p/hour
<Mr_You> maybe build there some day, who knows
Action: chillywilly will have to beat him with the smoke pole if he was
<Mr_You> I'll probably build in the mountains if I'm lucky
<chillywilly> then you can be the true jick that you want to be ;)
<chillywilly> er, hick
<nickr> just like cw
<chillywilly> uh, yea...
Action: chillywilly thwaps nickr profusely
<drochaid> Mr_You: I live in Scotland ... I'm looking for farmland on the west coast in Argyll ... gimmie some low flat ground and hillside in around 600 acres :D
<chillywilly> scottland is the "low lands" right?
<drochaid> lol, no
<chillywilly> er, scotland
<chillywilly> how maybe it's the high lands then
<chillywilly> s/how//
<drochaid> calling Scotland flat would be, somewhat inacurate
<chillywilly> I said 'low' not flat
<drochaid> 2/3s of Scotland is CALLED the Highlands .. does that give it away?
<drochaid> highlands pronounce more like heelan
<chillywilly> wasn't the dude form iin the movie highlander from scotland?
<chillywilly> s/form//
<drochaid> his character was
<chillywilly> well anyway
<chillywilly> drochaid: that's what I meant of course, no need to get all super technical
Action: chillywilly doesn't go around splitting hairs
<drochaid> heh

<drochaid> oh really?
<drochaid> you don't? ;)
<chillywilly> wooo!
Action: chillywilly wants to know just how accurate the movie Brave Heart is
<chillywilly> some people were saying that William Wallace was not the big hero he was made out to be
<chillywilly> in the movie
<drochaid> not very
<drochaid> the overall idea was close, but as usual there was a lot of holywood alterations
<drochaid> the battles were far to small and short lived for one thing :)
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> well they have to fit it into a movie
<chillywilly> surely you can let them slide on that one?
<chillywilly> ;)
<drochaid> nah, I'ma pedant ;)
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<drochaid> the hung drawn and quartered scene was way off as well
<chillywilly> how so?
<drochaid> first you were hung until nearly dead .. this could last 30 mins or more
<drochaid> next you were drawn along the ground behind a horse to the place where you were disembowled
<drochaid> I seem to recall they had Wallace in a yolk on the back of a cart

<chillywilly> I just did
<chillywilly> mkinitrd -o initrd-2.4.18-xfs /lib/modules/2.4.18-xfs/
<chillywilly> grub loads it, then it complains and says it cannot mount the root fs

<jcater> chillywilly: you are asking *us* for help with compiling kernels
<jcater> isn't this kind of reversed?
<chillywilly> no , nickr
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> I never compiled the stupid ramdisk in there
<chillywilly> and had to make an initrd
<chillywilly> I think there's probably some modules that I need to configure the mkinitrd command to use....but I have no idea what
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<chillywilly> but I really don't need any special modules to mount the root fs, it's an xfs file system
<chillywilly> and I have that compiled directly into the kernel
<chillywilly> (i.e., not as a module)
<nickr> I don't understand initrd
<nickr> thats why i use debian kernel images=
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<chillywilly> I think this is why
<chillywilly>  mkinitrd will fail to determine the root  file  system  if
<chillywilly>        rdev(8)  can't  find  the root device under /dev.  You can
<chillywilly>        specify your real root device by setting the ROOT variable
<chillywilly>        in  mkinitrd.conf.  If it still fails to recognise it, you
<chillywilly>        will need to manually add files to the image in  order  to
<chillywilly>        mount the root file system.

Action: chillywilly wonders where ajmitch has been as of late
<Isomer> and a couple of malicious people who spread the vicious rumour
<chillywilly> heh
<Isomer> people started listening to me when I kept telling them that if it was my birthday where was my present, and perhaps http://www.pizzahut.co.nz/ would make a reasonable substitute.
<Isomer> Apparently I don't look a day over 170 either
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> you like pizza hut?
<Isomer> Nah, it was just the only thing I could think off on short notice that did delivery in NZ :)

<yogurt2unge> hello people, do your know something about rewriting of GEAS?
<chillywilly> yes
<yogurt2unge> is it traumatic for the others stuff of GNUe?
<yogurt2unge> I'm just starting a project under GNUe
<dneighbo> explain
<dneighbo> the rewritting of GEAS will have little direct impact on two tier
<yogurt2unge> Yes I know
ariel_ (~ariel@217.133.245.223) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> i.e. any changes necessary for two tier to accomodate geas should be fairly seemless
<yogurt2unge> but will all application work with old and new GEAS without changes?
<dneighbo> um that depends
<dneighbo> we are discussing modifying the gcd specification some
<dneighbo> if we do that then you will probably have some issues
<dneighbo> so you are currently developing an application with geas right now?
<dneighbo> i guess if you fill me in a little bit i can better guide you with what the changes will mean to you
<yogurt2unge> Thanks dneighbo 
Action: Mr_You burps.

<dneighbo> yogurt if you have not yet begun to develop your application
<dneighbo> what is your time frame?
<dneighbo> if you need to start development immediately i would use 2 tier and it should be relatively easy to scale it to multi tier with GEAS(v2) as functionality permits
<dneighbo> if your time frame isnt immediate you could wait until the first prototypes of GEAS(v2) start showing up
<dneighbo> we dont have a large production geas base, so there have really to date been no concerns about backwards compatiablity
<yogurt2unge> I have a short time frame because I must chosee a framework
<dneighbo> do you mind me asking what type of application you were going to write? (as if its similar to something in our plans perhaps we could help you)
<dneighbo> also, i'm curious about what other frameworks you are considering :)

<chillywilly> is it debian?
<kdog> No, I a rogue RedHat user :-)
<crazymike> BOOOOO!!!
<chillywilly> gah
<crazymike> :)
<chillywilly> lol
<kdog> I did put postgres on instead of MySQL
<crazymike> then scrap it, and get Debian
<kdog> just for GnuE :-)
<chillywilly> :)
<crazymike> :)
<chillywilly> but it's GNUe dagnabit not GnuE ;)
<kdog> not this time
<crazymike> next time???
Action: chillywilly chops off crazymike's extra ?s
<kdog> The last three attempts at Debian have been crash and burn. I'll stick to RH
Action: crazymike gives chilywilly a crate to the jugular

Action: crazymike gives chillywilly a band-aid
<chillywilly> hey jamest
<kdog> My old install will run gfclient so the python stuff is set
<chillywilly> grooovy
<kdog> I guess I need the postgres drivers, that was the stumbling block on the MySQL side last time.
<kdog> What's recommended?
<chillywilly> ummm, ask jamest
<chillywilly> that's what I recommend ;)
<crazymike> lol
<kdog> lol
<kdog> jamest_: chillywilly and crazymike sent me
<jamest> what's the platform
<kdog> RedHat and Postgres
<kdog> I've gotten over the dual Python version hurdle
<jamest> pypgsql
<jamest> is the driver i'd use
<kdog> I'm installing it now
<kdog> well the python build failed on a missing libpq-fe.h
<jamest> part of postgresql libs
<jamest> may need a RH -dev rpm of some sort
<kdog> right, no postgres-dev rpm installed
<chillywilly> hey guys

<Pharsyde> i take it derek not in
<dtm> Pharsyde: h0h0
<dtm> Pharsyde: i'm upgrading from 2.4.18-pre4 to 2.4.18 but it is on ppc, and using lots of far out drivers and services, so there!  :)
<Pharsyde> i figured it would be on ppc since you're on mklinux
<Pharsyde> I'm mid-linux boxes.
<Pharsyde> it's disturbing not having one.
<Pharsyde> i've always been a slakware guy. and hated having programs compiled with gcc on 386
<Pharsyde> i tend to try and re-compile everything.
<Pharsyde> makes for a long week
<dtm> Pharsyde: heheh
<dtm> Pharsyde: well, similarly, when i'm looking for RPMs for ppc, i feel like a woman in the 50's trying to get a job.
<Pharsyde> especially when you want to recompile your compiler so you can "make" a new kernel.
<dtm> it's SRPM for me!  thank goodness for the rights movement and unions^W^W^W^Wpackage management
<dtm> rpm --rebuild *src.rpm
<dtm> *snore*
<Pharsyde> hehehe :)
<Pharsyde> ouch
<Pharsyde> need the ppc cluster for make, make install
<Pharsyde> dtm: have they done that yet???
<Pharsyde> ppc clustering??!?
<dtm> oh sure, just about everything is feature comparable on ppc
<dtm> there are businesses built on ppc clustering
<dtm> slashdot articles constantly
<Pharsyde> very nice. need to find some old 7100
<dtm> yeah
<Pharsyde> dtm: 7100 series? is that right?
<dtm> well they were porting the monolithic kernel to nubus so i guess the current kernel would run on 7100 but mklinux is the primary kernel for nubus hosts
<dtm>  i have an 8500!
<dtm> it's the bastion of my household pride
<Pharsyde> do you have a need for some old 6800 or 7100 with g3 upgrades
<dtm> well that's interesting  i can't afford to buy anything but i would like a g3 for my 8500
<dtm> i have a dead one
<dtm> from Powerlogix
<dtm> apparently dead, that is
<Pharsyde> I might be able to get them to you for shipping only.
<dtm> oh really well i'd only want 8500 upgrades  :)  got any?
<dtm> so you dont have a linux box on ya at all?
<dtm> do you have some heavy hardware for all that recompiling?  at least large storage, eh?
<dtm> :)
<Pharsyde> brb
<Pharsyde> don't know. It's a client of mine that has some old upgraded macs

<Pharsyde> ^think they
<dtm> well i dontk now what models you have

<Pharsyde> you are the man right??!?
<jamest> the man for what?
<Pharsyde> gnue
<jamest> I'm a man
<Pharsyde> never a straight answer.
<jamest> but if you mean co-coordinator/founder yes
<Pharsyde> good that's a straight answer.
<Pharsyde> then we definitely need to talk offline
<jamest> it's derek's fault
<Pharsyde> brb afk
<jamest> i didn't do it
<jcater> lol
<jamest> honest
<jamest> afk?
<jcater> jamest, you did take out that liability insurance like I said, right?
<jamest> a fscking kansan?
<jcater> rofl
<jamest> i'm that too
<Pharsyde> something like that
<Pharsyde> afk
<jcater> or in chillywilly's lingo... a fscking kde'ian
<jamest> Pharsyde: well, offline is ok i guess
<jamest> but I"m on dialup and in the middle of downloads
<Pharsyde> later is cool. download your p0rns
<Pharsyde> :) LOL
<jamest> if only
<jamest> at least I'd have something to look forward too
<nickr> haha
<jamest> this is the JDK 2
<jamest> that a programmer at a client's wants
<jamest> on their new server I'm setting up at home
<jamest> 40MB of pure pain
<nickr> jdk is devil spawl
<jamest> but, but, but
<jamest> java servlets are awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
<nickr> yea, I heard J2EE will solve all of our middleware problems and bring about whirled peas
<jamest> you get all the performance hit of normal java while being able to ensure that your app only needs to work right on one server platform!
Action: jamest has never understood that trend at the school
<jamest> java on the client failed huge
<chillywilly> jcater: *my* lingo?
<jamest> so they moved it back on the server
<chillywilly> yay world peas!
<jamest> which completely (in my mind) invalidates one of java's biggest so called advantages (cross platform blah)
<nickr> I dunno if I'd rather have whirled peas or whorled peas
Action: chillywilly compiles a kernel yet again :(
<jamest> (never mind the fact that GCC is still available on more platforms than java:)
<chillywilly> er, whirled peas, my bad
Action: jamest will shutup now
<nickr> heh
<nickr> jamest: its silly that the gcc java compiler runs on more playforms than JVM
<chillywilly> and in conclision...java sux0rz
<chillywilly> er, conclusion
<nickr> chillywilly: thank you for that enlightened vision
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> any time my friend
<chillywilly> I aimz to plz
<jcater> so, chillywilly
<jcater> enlighten us
<jcater> if java's so bad
<nickr> and zo doez leweez
<jcater> should we go with C# ?
Action: jcater ducks
<jcater> quack quack
<nickr> sicko
<Mr_You> I know most of you will hate this.. but I'd like to use macromedia flash interfaces versus java
<nickr> leave that fowl alone
<chillywilly> uh, yea and we should merge with dotGNU asap
<Mr_You> macromedia wants that too
<nickr> flash
<nickr> bah
<chillywilly> nooo!
<Mr_You> they wanna replace java
<Mr_You> for web pages
<Mr_You> or web based apps
<nickr> whenever I go to a wbesite that has a flash interface I impulsively close the broser
<jcater> yeah

<jcater> it's horrible
<Mr_You> well they should provide both
<jcater> DirecTV is all flash now

<nickr> er
<jcater> I can't stand the flicker of Flash
<Mr_You> dunno what flicker is
<chillywilly> I prefer to kick ppl in the head when they use flash
<Mr_You> flash doesn't mean you gotta have animation
<jcater> Mr_You: go to DirecTV's account section
<jcater> no animation there
<jcater> but it makes me dizzy looking at tit
<chillywilly> but I have been told I am "violent"
<jcater> err, it
<chillywilly> go figure
