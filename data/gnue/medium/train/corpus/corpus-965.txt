<ra3vat> reinhard: hi
<reinhard> hi ra3vat
<ra3vat> is that naming convention for packages, modules in geas you did with neilt still making sense ?
<reinhard> i think yes
<reinhard> because it's about how the packages, modules and classes can be
<reinhard> translated into table and column names
<ra3vat> is it described somewhere in the doc or buried in the log?
<reinhard> i think it should be somewhere in the mailing list archives
<ra3vat> ok, thanks
<reinhard> probably in the old gnue-geas@lists.gnue.org archives

<chillywilly_> er, Person
<dneighbo> http://www.adaytum.com/advisor/mar02/index.html#tips
<chillywilly_> cool you get polymorphism in your queries
<dneighbo> er
<dneighbo> http://www.adaytum.com/advisor/mar02/tips_and_tricks.html
<chillywilly_> polymorphism == many types ;)
Action: chillywilly_ doesn't knwo if masta is hip to the object lingo
<dneighbo> yes
<dneighbo> if you use polymorphism you have achieved BAD design
<dneighbo> there are so FEW instances where it is good design to use
<dneighbo> most people like as it aids them in crappy thinking :)
<chillywilly_> what?
<chillywilly_> t allows for generic code and runtime "behavior"
<chillywilly_> s/t/it
<nickr> polymorphism just means you can treat one object as another
<chillywilly_> e.g, you could have a collection of 'shape' and elements in an image and not have to know what type they are and tell them all to draw() themselves and each one knows how to draw itself
<nickr> thats why I like objc and not C++
<dneighbo> sory multi inheritance
<dneighbo> polymorphism can be bad though too
<nickr> yes
<nickr> but I only use it for good, not evil.
<chillywilly_> sure because it tightly cpiples your objects
<dneighbo> a lazy programmer and polymorphism can lead to evil maintenance
<chillywilly_> er, couples
<chillywilly_> you have to use it only for good ;)
<chillywilly_> anyway, object query langauge looks like fun ;P
<chillywilly_> er, language
Action: chillywilly_ goes back to reading

<chillywilly> oh, plz
<chillywilly> alsa rewuires you not to compile any drivers
<chillywilly> I may just reconfigure and put that module in there
<chillywilly> and say fuck alsa
<nickr> yea.
<nickr> try it.
<nickr> you should just compile everything as a module just so they are available
<nickr> less recompiles that way
<dtm> chillywilly: seems to me that all Creative cards were linux supported
<nickr> dtm: there is definitely a kernel-included module for it.
<dtm> chillywilly: you could try using the OSS drivers for autodetection
<dtm> nickr: well, happy day!
<chillywilly> yes, but won't you get conflicts if you try to do alsa and have all those sounds drivers compiled as modules?
<chillywilly> nickr: which one then ;)
<chillywilly> I am damn sick of this shit
<chillywilly> ;P
Action: chillywilly must prevail
<chillywilly> fuck it the to hell wit youse alsa
<dtm> )@_)#
Action: chillywilly smacks alsa with a trout
<dtm> chillywilly: so are you using initrd for root raid or what
<chillywilly> nope
<nickr> chillywilly: I don't believe there is a confluct as long as they aren't both loaded as once
<chillywilly> I don't really need it and the reason things wouldn't boot is becaise I had the ide drivers compiled in as modules
<chillywilly> npthing to with friggin initrd
<dtm> hehehehe
<dtm> you're my hero chillywilly
<chillywilly> uh, why?
<chillywilly> because I know how to compile a fscked up kernel?
<dtm> exactly
<chillywilly> blah
<dtm> i'm going to have to get a sparc ipx for nostalgia someday
Action: chillywilly has yet to tackle the CD burner
<dtm> good luck fewl

<nickr> I have to restart my computer.
<dtm> heh
<nickr> I'm on my third coaster
<nickr> I might just have to fixate it though
<nickr> but I enjoy breaking coasters
<chillywilly> I got no scsi devices made in my devfs though
<dtm> heh idont use devfs at this point
<nickr> chillywilly: you have to load sg
Action: chillywilly winders if he needs to comment out the shit at the end of devfsd.conf
<nickr> chillywilly: modprobe sg
<chillywilly> doh
<chillywilly> it's friggin late
<nickr> it should find it then.
<nickr> I always mount my devfs in like /dev/devfs
<nickr> because I phear devfsd

<nickr> I'm writing direct from a cd reader to the writer
<chillywilly> heh
<nickr> so it can't check the size
<chillywilly> rom to the rw?

<nickr> man, galeon has been so unstable lately
<chillywilly> doe sit freeze up on you?
<dsmith> Galeon runs fine for me. Using Debian sid.
<nickr> no, it just doesn't start
<nickr> segfaults immediately
<nickr> I don't think it likes gdkxft
<chillywilly> ah
Action: chillywilly only runs debian sid
<dsmith> nickr: What gtk theme are you using?  mrproject would segfault on me for (cant remember which) theme.
<chillywilly> hey dtm cool radio station ;)
<nickr> as I said I don't think it likes the antialiasing
<nickr> although it doesn't have these troubles on other boxen I have AA on
<chillywilly> I don't think I could get gdkxft to work
<dsmith> nickr: try it with the default theme.

Action: chillywilly rips out his old 2.4.18 kernel
<chillywilly> where's dtm?
<nickr> chillywilly: what'd I tell ya?
<chillywilly> yea, yea
<chillywilly> if onyl that driver would work on my laptop I wouldn't need alsa
<chillywilly> it's the same type of chip on there though

<chillywilly> you think that would work with the kernel module?
<nickr> worth a try
<chillywilly> xnot really as I am damn sick of compiling kernels ;)
<chillywilly> and alsa works there anyway ;)
<chillywilly> maybe if I am bored I'll give it a try
<chillywilly> like tomorrow or something
<chillywilly> ok, time to reboot this mug
