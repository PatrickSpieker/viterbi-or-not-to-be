<chillywilly> is there anyway for GNU/Linux to not use the bad sectors ;)
<chillywilly> ?
<chillywilly> hmmm, /dev/hda3 is the one that is b0rked
<chillywilly> that's /home IIRC
<chillywilly> bollocks!
<nickr> chillywilly: you have to reformat, but you can have it scan and mark bad blocks
<nickr> chillywilly: in modren hardware, though, bad blocks usually means the drive is dying

<chillywilly> yea...she might as well replace it now
Action: chillywilly had his laptop hard drive get fscked on a lockup
<chillywilly> she'll probably blame me ;)
<chillywilly> or she'll blame "Linux"
<chillywilly> but it's winblows fault
<chillywilly> they kept turning off the power when it would lock up
<chillywilly> looks like there's more bad sectors
<chillywilly> that there was before
<chillywilly> er, than
<chillywilly> wooooo
<chillywilly> then I get to reinstall and do it all over again
<chillywilly> :(
<Mr_You> thats one thing that sucks about *nix OSs.. not automagically doing that
<Mr_You> it also sucks that the larger a drive is the more likely it may have bad sectors from the factory
<chillywilly> the drive must be taking a shit
<chillywilly> gawd this sucks balls
<chillywilly> maybe I'lll be able to salvage some stuff
<chillywilly> (to make a reinstall/resetup go faster ;) )
<Mr_You> installs don't take long, cept ftp over modem ;-)
<Mr_You> a long install is solaris + patches... yow
Action: chillywilly did a network install on that box over his modem
<chillywilly> well over my lan and out my modem ;)

<dtm_> i need initrd help!
<Mr_You> me too ;-)
<Mr_You> whatcha need?
<dtm_> askdjbnf
<dtm_> Mr_You: hi
<dtm_> Mr_You: i made an initrd just like in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/ramdisk.txt and when the kernel loads it, it says it can't find the superblock.
<dtm_> input?
<chillywilly> you didn't use /usr/src/linux/Documentation/initrd.txt?
<dtm_> made a 2MB /dev/zero file, used 'losetup', then 'mke2fs -vm0 -b 1024 -N 20000 /dev/loop0', copied my /etc and /dev to it, and that's it
<dtm_> wholly sheet  i didn't notice that ; lemme look
<dtm_> oh btw i tried it compressed and uncomrpessed, same result
<Mr_You> I'm trying to use cluster_mkinitrd but it complains about "all loop interfaces are in use"
<dtm_> huh.
<dtm_> do you have good loop device support in your kernel?
<dtm_> how many does it need
<Mr_You> lemme double check, but it should be compiled in
<chillywilly> I must sleep now
<chillywilly> good night all
<chillywilly> hey at least I got the sound working on that box
<chillywilly> ;)
<dtm_> chillywilly: you crazy fucquir

<dtm_> hm i have no /linuxrc
<dtm_> that kinda sucks.
<Mr_You> not sure whats going on with the loop device deal.. at first I thought it was the mosix kernel, but I compiled a "clean" 2.4.16 kernel and same thing
<dtm_> isn't it true that my initrd only needs /dev/tty1, /dev/raidtab, and /dev/fstab ?
<dtm_> well i guess and /sbin/mount
<dtm_> it's only supposed to mount and switch to the md0
<dtm_> ok and raidstart and maybe fsck
<dtm_> so why the heck is there initrd.txt and ramdisk.txt ?
<dtm_> sheesh

<Arturas> Hi ra3vat
<Arturas> Hello chillywilly
<chillywilly> mike and I can't do network play very well because it is choppy (we're connected via cross over cable), would this have anything to do with the fact that he has a CardBus card and I only have a 16-bit pcmcia card?
<chillywilly> anyone know?
<Arturas> it shouldn't, but i don't know this for sure
<chillywilly> well cardbus cards can run faster
<dneighbo> hi Arturas 
<chillywilly> it even says so int he PCMCIA howto
<dneighbo> Arturas you get your mxDateTime issue resolved
<chillywilly> and his is in 32-bit enhanced mode
<chillywilly> accroding to winblows
<chillywilly> wehn I ping his card it responds at PCI card speeds
<chillywilly> 0.5ms on avg
<chillywilly> mine responds at 1ms on avg

<Arturas> how construction 'baseAttrs[attr]' is called (in Python)? Is this list or array or what? (attr is defined string, and when i do print baseAttrs[attr] i get an error)
alexey (alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<jcater> if you "print baseAttrs" that should show you what it is
<jcater> if it prints {'Somehting': something, ...} then it's a dictionary
<jcater> which is what I think baseAttrs is
<jcater> and baseAttrs[attr] should be set to a string
<jcater> wait
<jcater> not true
<jcater> baseAttrs[attr] could be either a string or an int
<Arturas> it is from GParser.py

<stbain> what do you see as the major hurdles to get over in order to get it implemented?

<stbain> yah
<stbain> indexing, sorting, searching

<nickr> it'll warrent its own diagrams I think
<nickr> yea
<stbain> what about the backend? SQL server neutral?
<nickr> I'm thinking GnUe Common
<stbain> sounds like I'll need to read up on GNUe Common

<stbain> through GEAS?
<nickr> I don't know exactly.
<stbain> looking through Common/docs dir now
<stbain> doesn't look like there's much info available on Common
<stbain> frontend through forms?
<nickr> forms/web/whatever
<nickr> all the various objects are RPC and 'trustless' or reduced trust relationships
<nickr> so your client just has to speak RPC
<stbain> cool
<dneighbo> um common will do db
<dneighbo> w/ or w/o geas
<dneighbo> the new geas will use common 
<nickr> db and rpc
<nickr> abstraction
<dneighbo> so it would be something like
<nickr> which is why its needed
<dneighbo> db (common-db) geas (common - rpc)
<dneighbo> er
<dneighbo> db (common-db) geas (common - rpc) docustore
<dneighbo> but it could also be

<nickr> laurie: what the freak configurer are you using?
<laurie> xf86config
<laurie> as the reconfigure one doesnt let you jerk with video card settings :(
<laurie> it just makes you pick from list of 'brands'
<laurie> pretty much
<laurie> brb see if i hosed this or not

<nickr> hrm
<nickr> you should install xserver-xfree86 and use the nice debconf configurer
<derek> i have xserver-xfree86 installed
<derek> where is the nice debconf configure?
<derek> i do the dpkg-reconfigure
<derek> and it gives me like no options :(
<nickr> and you got xf86config?
<nickr> hrm.
<dtm> hi guys 
<dtm> how's it going
<nickr> what version of debian are you runnig?
<derek> er very little (which is nice to get things working) but horrible for a FLIPPING SCREEN
<derek> sid
<nickr> hrm
Action: derek hates gdm (as im not used to it)
<dtm> derek: what's bad about it/
<nickr> I found the debconf thing to be much better than xf86config
<dtm> ?
<dtm> are you ladies having a lovely day?
<derek> yes lovely
<derek> nickr: its much better just not as many options
<derek> grrrr
<derek> that darn 'flicker' still exists when i move windows
<derek> this irks me
<derek> i had this problem w/ my laptop too
<nickr> derek: flicker, like chunky jumpy?
<derek> no
<nickr> no I mean
<derek> like little 'stars'
<derek> around the windows when i move them
<nickr> like theres interlaces of the image you're moving like halfway over on the screen?
<derek> barely visible, but to me highlyh noticable
<nickr> this is a SiS?
<derek> no
<derek> trident cyberblade
<nickr> hrm.
<derek> its ok for now
<nickr> what depth?
<derek> i dont know
<derek> how can i tell those things?
<derek> as i want it smaller (higher res)
<nickr> didn't it ask you what color depth you want to use?
Action: derek needs to fix
<derek> 24 is what i choose
<nickr> see the debconf one asks you these things
<derek> i need to fix fonts too
<derek> debians fonts by default SUCK
<derek> they are for the 'blind'
<derek> anyhow back to how do you change resolution?
<derek> btw these are the things that kill me on linux
<nickr> in the debconf thing it prompts you for this
<derek> why should it be so difficult to change resolution?
<derek> i mean once im running
<derek> i should NOT have to reconfigure x everytime i want to change my resolution
<nickr> c-a-+/-
<derek> ca?
<derek> ctl-alt
<nickr> but that only cycles the ones that you selected in your config
<nickr> its all about the X mentality
<derek> thats fine (cycling ones in config)
<derek> i CANT do that on my laptop though
<derek> as only plus key i have requires a shift
<derek> which disables the strok (fwiw) now i remember why i didnt remember that only ever have wanted to change on laptops
Nick change: crazymike -> crazymike_away
<nickr> there is a gnome applet that lets you do it
<derek> btw
<derek> doing this changed things
<derek> but it made X go bye bye
<derek> so i assume it crashed X
<derek> sigh
<derek> i give up
<derek> i spend more time SCREWING with getting linux configured than i do doing work on it at times...
<derek> so frustrating
<derek> good thing is once its configured and working its pretty darned rock solid
<drochaid> have you considered using windows?
<drochaid> takes a couple of hours to set up ...
<drochaid> but you'll be screwing with it constantly to keep it up :)
Action: drochaid isn't bitter
<drochaid> no, just because I finished a 2 day 2k build at gmt 4pm ... and at gmt 10pm it had died completely 
<drochaid> not at all bitter
Action: drochaid toddles off again

<derek> no more mozilla now, im going to sylpheed
<derek> btw dtm i got my inbox eaten today
<derek> about 100+ messages lost
<derek> so if you sent something and i dont respond im sorry :(
<derek> anyone know how to convert mailboxes from mozilla to sylpheeds type?
Nick change: crazymike_away -> crazymike
<derek> grrr

<nickr> hey chillywilly 
<chillywilly> where's crazymike at?
Action: chillywilly rips CUPS out
<chillywilly> nickr: what printing software do you use?
<nickr> cups
<chillywilly> anyone know wtf this is:
<chillywilly> Mar  7 12:30:33 babers kernel: spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
<chillywilly> that can't be good
<chillywilly> earlier it does:
<chillywilly> Mar  7 12:30:19 babers kernel: parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778) [PCSPP,TRISTATE]
<chillywilly> Mar  7 12:30:19 babers kernel: parport0: irq 7 detected
<chillywilly> Mar  7 12:30:20 babers kernel: lp0: using parport0 (polling).
<chillywilly> I'm thinking this si why the damn printer won't work anymore
<nickr> that does'nt sounds so great
<chillywilly> maybe I just need to load lp module with the proper params
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> screw the polling crap
<chillywilly> I saw something on the Linux Kernel mailing list about someone getting alockup on that and it having to do with an nVidia card
<chillywilly> there is an nVidia card in here
<chillywilly> 01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation Vanta [NV6] (rev 15) (prog-if 00 [VGA])
<chillywilly> it doesn't lock up the computer though
<chillywilly> but the printer doesn't work :-/
<nickr> chillywilly: polling is not what you think it is
<chillywilly> I know
<chillywilly> that interrupt is not good though
<nickr> so give it the right one.
<chillywilly> well I mena getting that message does nto look good
<chillywilly> er, mean
<chillywilly> er, not
Action: derek hugs sylpheed
Action: derek wonders if they take donations
<derek> im tempted to cut them a check for 50 bucks
<derek> im VERY impressed
<derek> seemless import of netscape mail
<derek> nice clean (FAST) interface with good features
<nickr> yea
Action: derek loves this threaded mail
<derek> mmmm mmmm yummy
<chillywilly> threaded?
<derek> its what evolutions wishes it could be :)
<chillywilly> mutt does that ;)
<nickr> like mutt has
<nickr> evo is for a ifferent audienc.
<derek> netscape did it too
<chillywilly> I don't need no stinkin' gius
<chillywilly> er, guis
<derek> but it was not good
<derek> time will tell if syphleed does better
<derek> nickr: you really think so?
<derek> i guess evolution is task and calendar too
<nickr> yes, I really do.
<chillywilly> hehe
<derek> but i had wife try evolution and she said
<derek> let me put this nicely
<nickr> I know several people who probably wouldn't use linux without evo
<derek> 'what is this shit, give me windows back'
<chillywilly> nickr: do you know how to specify io ports and inetrrupts to lp?
Action: chillywilly does know the syntax
<derek> i put on syphleed
<derek> and her only complaint so far is in html mail if she clicks a link it does nothing
<nickr> chillywilly:  I have no idea.
<derek> im seeing now that it calls 'netscape' by default
<derek> which isnt installed
<nickr> derek: she uses outlook express normally?
<chillywilly> cnage it
<chillywilly> er, change
<dtm> derek: dood, that's a pretty abusive statement for her to make to you 
<nickr> yea, thats a smackable statement.
<dtm> geeeeeez
<nickr> I'm making myself sick on butterfinger BBs
<dtm> nickr: cool
<nickr> I'm 90% my second pound
<chillywilly> my mom likes evolution
<nickr> the good thing about free software is that there is a lot of choice.
<dtm> chillywilly: does your mom give you the finger if she didn't?  ;)
<chillywilly> wa?
<dtm> chillywilly: like derek's wife?
<chillywilly> where did he say that?
<nickr> make that 100%
<nickr> 19:01 < derek> 'what is this shit, give me windows back'
<chillywilly> you sick bastard
<chillywilly> that says nothing about flipping the bird
<nickr> well he 'put it nicely'
<dtm> ha
<nickr> so I assume there was ball-kneeing involved
<chillywilly> ouch
<dtm> HA
<chillywilly> dude everytime you use windows you get theat ball-kneeing feeling
<dtm> heh
<chillywilly> s/you/one/
<derek> well the phone call was nasty
<derek> as i just SWITCHED her to linux w/o warning
<derek> and evolution really does suck :)
<chillywilly> phone call?
<chillywilly> I dunno about evolution sucking, my mom seems to like it
<chillywilly> runs fast on this box
<chillywilly> 800MHz Athlon ;)
<derek> um put it this way chilly
<derek> even the ximian developers are bagging on it being non usable to them :)
<chillywilly> yea, what version though?
<chillywilly> 1.0.2 seems fine
<chillywilly> I dunno I have no opinion of it nor do I wish to use it
<chillywilly> I am used to using keys and commds to navigate my mail
<chillywilly> evo requires to much mouse movement
<chillywilly> ;)
<derek> im half teasing
<derek> it will be a killerapp
<derek> some day
<nickr> I don't agree that evolution sucks
<nickr> its a good concept, and it looks nice
<nickr> its like a first draft
<nickr> like X11R1
<nickr> :)
<derek> well i half agree
<derek> its past sucking yes
<derek> but its typical ximian :(
<derek> i.e. its too microsoft ish
<derek> and im not talking look and feel
<derek> im talking bloat and overtly complex
<derek> example dsmith wanted to garner address book data from it for another program
<derek> THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY AND ENCOURAGED THING
<derek> basically they hand him an documented and jacked db api that they say they havent yet really grokked (the storage method)
<derek> and point him to oaf/bonobo/corba hell and say he could 'try' that too
<derek> to me if their aim (which they say) is not the home user but the corporate desktop
<chillywilly> blah, blah
<chillywilly> blah, blah, blah
<derek> stuff like that is what gives m$ a bad name

<nickr> chillywilly: it removes it
<chillywilly> oh
<dneighbo> ok thats all well and good
<dneighbo> why k6?
<chillywilly> is that a pacjage or somethat apt recognizes?
<dneighbo> duron in the k6 family?
<chillywilly> er, package
<dneighbo> uilding Dependency Tree... Done
<dneighbo> The following extra packages will be installed:
<dneighbo>   ash cramfsprogs initrd-tools 
<dneighbo> The following packages will be REMOVED:
<dneighbo>   lilo 
<dneighbo> The following NEW packages will be installed:
<dneighbo>   ash cramfsprogs grub initrd-tools kernel-image-2.4.17-k6 
<chillywilly> fuck it typing sucks too
<dneighbo> that look right?
<nickr> dneighbo: dneighbo oh, I think you want -k6
<nickr> dneighbo: er, k7
<chillywilly> grub rocks
<dneighbo> The following extra packages will be installed:
<dneighbo>   ash cramfsprogs initrd-tools 
<dneighbo> The following packages will be REMOVED:
<dneighbo>   lilo 
<dneighbo> The following NEW packages will be installed:
<dneighbo>   ash cramfsprogs grub initrd-tools kernel-image-2.4.17-k7 
Action: chillywilly needs to install grub here
<dneighbo> oh i will be happy to go on grub
<dneighbo> im trying it wish me luck
<nickr> dneighbo: don't reboot until you talk to me agfain :)
<dneighbo> ok should be done downloading in a minute
<chillywilly> so can you do apt-get install package- for anything?
<nickr> chillywilly: yea
<chillywilly> what do you use to configure cups dude?
<chillywilly> the web interface?
<chillywilly> gtklp?
Action: chillywilly has tried and failed with the web interface
<dneighbo> ou are attempting to install an initrd kernel image (version 2.4.17-k7)
<dneighbo> This will not work unless you have configured your boot loader to use
<dneighbo> initrd.
<dneighbo> As a reminder, in order to configure lilo, you need to
<dneighbo> add an 'initrd=/initrd.img' in your /etc/lilo.conf
<dneighbo> I repeat, You need to configure your boot loader. If you have already done
<dneighbo> so, and you wish to get rid of this message, please put
<dneighbo>   `do_initrd = Yes'
<dneighbo> in /etc/kernel-img.conf.
<dneighbo> Do you want to stop now? [Y/n]
<nickr> say 'no'
<dneighbo> what do i do?
<nickr> or n
<dneighbo> what is ash?
<nickr> ash is a little tiny posix shell
<chillywilly> a small shell
<chillywilly> they put it on the boot floppies
<nickr> they also put it in the initrd
<chillywilly> bahs won'
<chillywilly> t fit ;)
<dneighbo> Setting up kernel-image-2.4.17-k7 (2.4.17-1) ...
<dneighbo> /boot/initrd.img does not exist. Installing from scratch, eh?
<dneighbo> Or maybe you don't want a symbolic link here. Hmm? Lets See.
<dneighbo> I notice that you do not have initrd.img symbolic
<dneighbo> link. I can create one for you, and it shall be
<dneighbo> updated by newer kernel image packages. This is 
<dneighbo> useful if you use a boot loader like lilo.
<dneighbo> Do you want me to create a link from /boot/initrd.img-2.4.17-k7 to initrd.img?[Yn] 
<chillywilly> er, bash
<dneighbo> what now?
<nickr> dneighbo: yes
<dneighbo> back to prompt
<dneighbo> what now
<chillywilly> won't matter if you use grub ;)
<dneighbo> nickr just said to consult him before rebooting
<nickr> dneighbo: do grub-install

<chillywilly> does that ever work?
<dneighbo>                           instead of the root directory
<dneighbo>   --grub-shell=FILE       use FILE as the grub shell
<nickr> oh, grub-install /dev/whatever
<dneighbo>   --force-lba             force GRUB to use LBA mode even for a buggy

<nickr> the disk thta you boot from
<dneighbo> INSTALL_DEVICE can be a GRUB device name or a system device filename.
<dneighbo> grub-install copies GRUB images into the DIR/boot directory specfied by

<dneighbo> sector.
<dneighbo> Report bugs to <bug-grub@gnu.org>.
<dneighbo> aegagrus:/home/dneighbo# 
<nickr> dneighbo: you don't have to fucking paste the whole thing
<dneighbo> um
<dneighbo> how do i know where?
<dneighbo> as i had lilo on MBR
<dneighbo> :)
<nickr> dneighbo: type mount
<nickr> dneighbo: look at your / device
<chillywilly> what is the device for your drive
<nickr> dneighbo: take the /dev/hdblahnumber and do grub-install /dev/hdblah
<dneighbo>  /dev/hda2
<nickr> dneighbo: grub-install /dev/hda
<dneighbo> hmmm it comes back
<dneighbo> i did
<dneighbo> grub-install /dev/hda2
<nickr> dneighbo: no no
<dneighbo> too late
<dneighbo> how do i undo it?
<nickr> dneighbo: well do it with /dev/hda too
<nickr> it doesn't matter
<dneighbo> aegagrus:/home/dneighbo# grub-install /dev/hda2

<nickr> alright
<nickr> now fucking do update-grub
<dneighbo> Could not find /boot/grub/menu.lst file. Would you like one generated for you? (y/N) 
<nickr> yes
<dneighbo> ok printed bunch of stuff then quit
<dneighbo> After you have edited /boot/grub/menu.lst , please re-run 'update-grub'.
<dneighbo> aegagrus:/home/dneighbo# 
<dneighbo> are last lines
<nickr> okay, now you have to edit some comments in that file
<nickr> update-grub does a fairly magical thing
<nickr> it uses comments in you menu.lst as arguments
<dneighbo> ok tell me what i need to update
<nickr> look for the DO NOT UNCOMMENT THEM line
<nickr> slightly after there is what we're editing
<nickr> first adjust kopt=
<dneighbo> ok there
<nickr> change the root device to hda2
<dneighbo> make it what?
<dneighbo> # kopt=root=/dev/hda2 ro
<nickr> yea
<nickr> thats fine actuall
<dneighbo> shoudl it be ro?
<dneighbo> or rw?
<nickr> ro
<dneighbo> otay
<dneighbo> any other changes
<nickr> change groot to (hd0,1)
<nickr> everything else should be fine for now
<nickr> save quick rerun update-grub
<dneighbo> # groot=(hd0,1)
<dneighbo> anymore?
<chillywilly> why doesn't friggin grub-0install ever work for me?
<nickr> save quit rerun update-grub
Action: chillywilly usually makes a boot diosk and doe sit manually in the shell
<nickr> chillywilly: because you don't know how to make it work
<chillywilly> then boot it manually and install proper config files
<chillywilly> I just do it how the info file tells you to without grub-install script
<dneighbo> nickr: sorry missed that line... (probably think im a dumb ass)
<nickr> dneighbo: yes I do
<nickr> save quit rerun update-grub
<dneighbo> seems to have gone well
<nickr> okay, now try rebooting and you should have a pretty meny
<nickr> you can continue to talk to us during reboot
<chillywilly> uh?
<dneighbo> ok rebooting now
dneighbo (dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<nickr> hope I didn't fuck up his system
<nickr> :)
<chillywilly>  hehe
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> we'll find out soon enough
<chillywilly> dude that grub-install script never works for me
<nickr> what does it do?
<chillywilly> babers:~# grub-install /dev/hda
<chillywilly> /dev/hda does not have any corresponding BIOS drive.
<nickr> are you using the right device?
<chillywilly> yea the master ide drive
<nickr> it might be that ide-scsi is interfering
<derek> i got grub
<derek> and it seems to be reloading
<chillywilly> it doesn't work on my laptop either
<derek> GDM is back up
<nickr> derek: nice menu eh?
<chillywilly> but anyway, I install via a different method
<derek> yip
<chillywilly> nickr: how do you commonly set up CUPS?
<chillywilly> with th4e web thingy?
<nickr> derek: cool
<derek> gack
<nickr> chillywilly: yea
<derek> it killed my networking though
<nickr> what?
<nickr> oh
<derek> i tried to use xchat and says bad host
<derek> so i do ifconfig and get nothing
<nickr> derek: the driver name might have changed
<nickr> derek: what do you have?
<derek> realtek something
<nickr> derek: pci?
<derek> um on board
<derek> but shsows up in pci
<nickr> then its pci :)
<derek> realtek 8139
<nickr> derek: lemme see
<derek> how do i change the driver 
<chillywilly> you just load the module
<derek> modconf
<chillywilly> modprobe or insmod
<nickr> derek: hrm just a sec
<nickr> derek: you can use modconf to adjust your drivers you know
<derek> im doing it already
<chillywilly> yes it is printing
<chillywilly> woooo
<chillywilly> I think it is anyway
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> heh the test page has a little simley in the uppper left corner?
<chillywilly> that's it
<chillywilly> ?
dneighbo (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> hi mom
<dneighbo> i got it to work 
<chillywilly> sup dawg
<dneighbo> yeah :
<chillywilly> fuck it won't do it again
<nickr> I'm just too good.
<chillywilly> where does cups log things?
<nickr> um
<nickr> /var/log ?
<nickr> :)
<dneighbo> so back to sound
<dneighbo> now that we have new kernel now what?
<dneighbo> i tried modconf to load ac7
<dneighbo> and it loaded ok
<chillywilly> nickr: duh
<dtm> chillywilly: does your initrd boot to a software riad device?
<dneighbo> but do i need to do something to configure sound?
<chillywilly> dtm: no
<chillywilly> dtm: it's not even a valid image
<chillywilly> ;P
<dneighbo> and is ac7 proper module
<dtm> chillywilly: it switches to an alternate root, right?
<chillywilly> dtm: I don;t really need it I ust left it there
<nickr> dneighbo: I dunno, is it? :)
<derek> im not sure :(
<derek> i just have chipset number
<derek> vt82c686b
<nickr> dneighbo: thats generally what the drivers are named after
<nickr> dneighbo: go into modconf and find it.. its in sound
<derek> well this is the motherboard chipset not sound card chip set
<derek> 7. (12/28/2001 Ver 0.91A) Red Hat Linux 7.2/7.1 VT82C686B/VT8231/VT8233/VT8233C Audio Driver Installation Guide
<derek> This document describes four methods of installing the audio driver for VIA's south bridge chips: (1) OS built-in driver, (2) VIA driver, (3) ALSA driver from the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture project, and (4) OSS driver from 4Front Technologies. The instruction for each method and a comparison of their respective features are provided.
<derek> was from that one
<derek> ok foundit and installed it
<derek> now what?
<nickr> derek: try catting something to /dev/audio and see if it makes noise :)
<chillywilly> I tried to orint the test page 3 more times and now ti won't go
<chillywilly> this fucking blows man
<chillywilly> hijs driver sucks
<chillywilly> er, whatever the friggin thiung is called
<chillywilly> now it prints
<chillywilly> (switched drivers)
<chillywilly> yay
<dneighbo> win.wav >/dev/audio
<dneighbo> didnt seem to produce noise
<chillywilly> woohoo
<chillywilly> now I just need to get the scanner working
<nickr> dneighbo: do you have an output plugged in?
<dneighbo> yes let me triple check though
<nickr> hrm
<dneighbo> cable slightly tugged on
<dneighbo> when i pulled case out a minute ago
<dneighbo> turned up speakers now and hear light gargle
<dneighbo> so am getting some 'noise'
<nickr> well wavs won't play from /dev/audio
<nickr> try catting /vmlinuz
<nickr> its a very good test
<dneighbo> yikes
<dneighbo> need to turn sound down now :0
<dneighbo> i get lots of noise now :0
<nickr> okay
<nickr> thats good
<nickr> do you have a mic plugged in?
<dneighbo> i just need samba up
<dneighbo> um
<chillywilly> hehe
<dneighbo> what package is smbmount in?
<dneighbo> or the equivalent there of
<nickr> dneighbo: samba
<dneighbo> you have to get the server?
<dneighbo> i tried getting just smbclient
<dneighbo> but will get all of samba i suppose
Action: chillywilly should go watch scifi as a reward to himself for getting the printer to work ;)
<chillywilly> scifi channel even
<nickr> heh
Action: dneighbo thinks chillywilly is gonna punch the clown while watching lexx
stbain (GunAndGiz@ip68-10-44-170.rn.hr.cox.net) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<nickr> Lexx rocks!
<dneighbo> grr getting samba still doesnt give me samba mount
<nickr> haah
<nickr> apt-cache search smbmount
Action: dneighbo thinks smbclient was probably enought
<dneighbo> smbfs
<nickr> ah
<nickr> yea
<chillywilly> lexx does indeed rule
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> xmmms reports
<dneighbo> 1. you have the correct output plugin selected
<chillywilly> HOWEVER, wrt dneighbo's comment: "In this crazy world we don't spank the monkey the monkey spanks us!"
<dneighbo> 2. no other programs are blocking the soundcare
<dneighbo> 3. your soundcard is configured properly
<nickr> dneighbo: if you're in gnome try setting your output plugin to esound
<dneighbo> hmmmm this is weird
<chillywilly> lp is hte print command in cups right?
<dneighbo> i thin xxms toasted itself
<nickr> chillywilly: sure.
<nickr> chillywilly: if you installed cups-bsd
<chillywilly> I thought lpr was bsd?
<chillywilly> galeon prints like crap
<dneighbo> xmms just locks up
<dneighbo> when it tries to play an mp3 now
<dneighbo> but it doesnt get the other error
<nickr> xmms sucks bag.
<nickr> you might try a different player.
<nickr> or try killing esound and using the oss output plugin
<dneighbo> the oss output one is the one that complained
<nickr> right, thus my advise to kill esound before you try it :P
<dneighbo> how do you kill esound?
<nickr> killall esound
<dtm> isn't it 'killall esd'?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> dneighbo: do you in fact have any linux experience at all? :)
<dtm> dneighbo: i'll resend you the email i sent you this week
<dneighbo> esd: no process killed
<dneighbo> yeah, just coming from red hat originally for all this
<dneighbo> amazing you dont have to dick with it their tools do it for you
<dneighbo> last time i setup sound took 5 minutes
<dtm> dneighbo: ar eyou burned out, buddy?
<dneighbo> dtm: well that doesnt help either
<nickr> dneighbo: you have sound setup, just the things that use it aren't cooperating
<dneighbo> nickr: yeah, like my video. :
<dneighbo> :)
chillywilly_ (~danielb@d24.as8.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dtm> dneighbo: what doesn't help?
<dneighbo> its setup and works (just has that irrating static) one of those things that one day i will have to fix but for now it will get by
<chillywilly_> modems lick balls
<dneighbo> dtm: burn out, and configuring debian boxes
<dtm> dneighbo: oh sorry dood
<dtm> dneighbo: well just know that i'm genuinely concerned for your well being
<dtm> :)
<nickr> dneighbo: I suggest installing SuSE or something, I don't think you're really having a good debian experience. Maybe a nice Mandrake
<dtm> hehe
<dneighbo> no i like debian
<dtm> he really likes debian
<dneighbo> configuring it is brutal
<nickr> Mandrake is good, you don't have to think at all.
<dneighbo> when you dont do it everyday
<dneighbo> or even frequently
<nickr> point and drool all the way
<chillywilly_> amen to that brotha
<dtm> mdk is pretty darn good
<chillywilly_> mdk has some issues here and there though
<dtm> the sheer vastness of its software collection helps
<dtm> i've heard debian is similarly vast
<chillywilly_> whiuch distro has the most packages?
<dtm> and debian is sure more ported
<dtm> i dunno but mdk is sickeningly large, like > 4 CDs
<dtm> it's retarded
<chillywilly_> debian has over 6000 packages last time I looked
<nickr> dtm: Debian Woody is 8 CDs
<dtm> in fact one of the first rules to distro maintenance is for the core team to not be that diverse
<chillywilly_> heheh
<dtm> so as to have a core competency
<dtm> nickr: yeah that's a lot :)
<dtm> at one point, debian was the only one which had cfengine
<dtm> and then suse got it
<dtm> nobody else!
chillywilly (danielb@d68.as8.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) left irc: Killed (NickServ (Ghost: chillywilly_!~danielb@d24.as8.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net))
<dneighbo> so no advice for sound beyond this
Nick change: chillywilly_ -> chillywilly
<dtm> so i made a package on linuxppc based on suse's stupid way of making rpms
<dtm> dneighbo: did you search for a hardware conflict?
<dtm> dneighbo: most ia32 boxes have conflicts, or are sharing irqs
<nickr> dtm: its PCI
<dtm> dneighbo: linux may not like the irq sharing
<dtm> nickr: i know
<dtm> ia32 is garbage.
<nickr> PCI never doesn't work
<nickr> in my experience.
<dneighbo> well we were able to cat a file to it and get sound
<dneighbo> which makes me think its not a conflict
<dtm> nickr: your experience does not extend to the recent majority then :)
<nickr> dneighbo: ps awx |grep esound
<dtm> nickr: ia32's tiny number of irqs doesnt go very far and must be shared.  often oyu'll find sound, usb, and video sharing one irq.
<dneighbo> nickr: nothing
<nickr> dneighbo: hrm, so you're in gnome now, yes? try catting again
<dtm> i've seen cases where PCI doesn't sort out the irqs and there's a conflict
<dtm> and i've seen where each slot is hardcoded to an irq
<dtm> like in emachines
<dneighbo> nickr: loud as can be
<chillywilly> gnome-gv is b0rked
<nickr> dneighbo: okay, so OSS should be working. try installing another mp3 player aside from xmms
<nickr> chillywilly: yea, has been for quite a while
Action: chillywilly hasb;t noticed
<chillywilly> until now
<nickr> dneighbo: scratch that
<nickr> dneighbo: its probably a permission issue
<dneighbo> want me to run xmms as root?
<nickr> dneighbo: try running xmms as a user that can write to the sound device
<chillywilly> what groups you in?
<nickr> if that works we can address it easily
<dneighbo> thats it
<dneighbo> sound is working now 'as root'
<chillywilly> is it owned root.audio?
<dneighbo> so what is the easy fix
<nickr> dneighbo: sweet
<dneighbo> btw: thanks for the help, im really not a complete idiot, just an idiot minor
<nickr> dneighbo: make sure /dev/dsp* audio* mixer* are group sound
<chillywilly> if it is owned root.audio you just add yourself to the audio group
<nickr> er, audio group
<nickr> sorry
<dneighbo> yeah all audio
<nickr> then you adduser user audio where user is the user you want to be able to play stuff, for every user that you want to be able to play stuff
<nickr> make sure all those devices are group read and write also
<chillywilly> man galeon generates shitty ps
<nickr> chillywilly: its mozilla
<chillywilly> ok, moz then
<chillywilly> it blows
<chillywilly> I want it to look like my screen dam,nit
<nickr> dneighbo: oncey ou adduser to add the groups you have to log out of gnome nad log back in, buecause you have to have everything running with the new group
<chillywilly> why does printing under GNU/Linux have to be so shitty?
<nickr> chillywilly: I've never had problems in printing under linux
<nickr> I've never had problems with sound
<nickr> I've rarely had problems with video
<chillywilly> what kinda printer you got though ;)?
<nickr> I've had a number of different printers
<chillywilly> any of them new hp deskjets?
<nickr> the best was an HP LJ2100TN because it had JetDirect :)
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> brb
dneighbo (dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<nickr> chillywilly: never, because deskjets suck balls
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> agreed
<chillywilly> they bite the big one
<chillywilly> what is a goo GNU/Linux printer?
<chillywilly> er, good
<nickr> any printer that speaks Postscript is good in my book
<nickr> if it speaks LP or JetDirect AND Postscript its insanely great
<nickr> or IPP
<nickr> LP|IPP|JD
<chillywilly> lp  = line printer?
<nickr> printer515/tcpspooler# line printer spooler
<chillywilly> I knew this printer was going to bite the big one anyway
<nickr> er
<chillywilly> most new deskjets do
<nickr> c&p sure does slaughter spacing
<chillywilly> usually it doesn't
<chillywilly> only line breaks it murders
<chillywilly> what's jetdirect good for?
<nickr> its a remote printing protocol
<nickr> like IPP and LP
<chillywilly> ok
<nickr> cups supports it :)
