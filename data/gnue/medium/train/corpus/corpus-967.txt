<chillywilly> next they make you hold your eveyes open with toothpicks as the piss in your face
<nickr> well they are migratinga way from it, but they still have to support it
<nickr> since my skillset is on the other side, the person handling tech support and VB now will move more toward VB whlie I take up the web side
<chillywilly> or drill holes in your toe nails and hang you from fishing line
<chillywilly> maybe even chinese water torture

<chillywilly> sup my nigga?
<dneighbo> sigh cant get flash to work on debian box :(
<chillywilly> gah!
<chillywilly> screw flash
<dneighbo> well generally i dont hump technology
<dneighbo> the problem is too many sites use flash
<dneighbo> and they are sites my wife wishes to visit
<dneighbo> so if my options are 
<dneighbo> a. install windows so she can get what she wants 
<dneighbo> or
<chillywilly> works here I think
<chillywilly> try this usrl
<dneighbo> b. get flash to work on gnu/linux
<chillywilly> (it has flash debs)
<drochaid> dneighbo: have you tried the swf viewer for flash?
<dneighbo> i have it working on my laptop but for some reason dumb thing hangs on my debian box :(
<chillywilly> deb http://marillat.free.fr/ unstable main
<chillywilly> try that one dude
<dneighbo> trying now
<chillywilly> I thought that's where I got flash from
Action: chillywilly feels like listening to some neil young
<drochaid> :o
<drochaid> Sepultura
<chillywilly> dneighbo: or this one deb http://marillat.free.fr/ testing main
<chillywilly> s/deb//
<chillywilly> drochaid: rock on!
Action: chillywilly has some of that in his play list too ;)
<chillywilly> actually unstable has more packages I think
<chillywilly> dneighbo: apt-get install flashplayer-mozilla
<chillywilly> but it really is non-free
Action: chillywilly should apt-get remove it
<dneighbo> rock that worked!
Action: dneighbo was told to sign up for 'trading spaces'
<drochaid> trading spaces?
<chillywilly> wassat?
<chillywilly> yes
<dneighbo> tlc.discovery.com
<dneighbo> and click on 'trading spaces' link
<dneighbo> its where two neighbors switch houses for two days
<dneighbo> get 1000 a piece and redo the room in the other neighbors house
<psu> <brit_pride>we invented that</brit_pride>
<chillywilly> that's goofy
<chillywilly> oh gawd
<dneighbo> psu i think you all called it 'trading rooms'
<drochaid> ah, yes we did, didn't we psu :)
<drochaid> dneighbo: changing rooms
<dneighbo> or something, while the concept pretty much identical the production quality and show 'humor' is much better on 'trading spaces'

<dneighbo> heeeeellllp
<dneighbo> how do i get rid of GDM or rather how can i do multi displays w/ it?
Action: dneighbo nudges chillywilly and chillywilly_ with a smelly trout
<dsmith> dneighbo: Check out /etc/X11/gdm  Lots o config files in there.
<dsmith> Sorry. I lied.  I use wgm, and there are lots of comfigs in /etc/X11/wdm.
<dneighbo> dsmith: sigh, i just want to be able to do startx -- :1 in (alt-ctl f2)
<dneighbo> and then togggle back and forth
<dneighbo> i cant seem to do that on this machine :(
<dneighbo> i assume its because gdm
<dneighbo> so want to know how to disable it
<dneighbo> or work around it :)
<dsmith> I know it can be done.
Action: dsmith looks
<dneighbo> well i can do it just fine on redhat 6.2
<dneighbo> but i dont have gdm, xdm or kdm on it
<dneighbo> so i guess wrong or right im assuming gdm is the thing causing the issue
<dneighbo> as i can START the second display up and it runs fine
<dneighbo> it just wont let me switch back to the first display :(
<dsmith>   /etc/X11/wdm/Xservers
<dsmith> Not sure where that is for gdm though.
<dsmith> I currently don't have gdm installed. Sorry.
<dneighbo>  /etc/gdm/gdm.conf
<dneighbo> but who knows what 'setting' it is
<dsmith> You need to tell it which console to use.  vt7 or vt8 or whatever.
<dneighbo> DisplaysPerHost=1
<dneighbo> shoudl this be higher than one?
<dneighbo> [servers]
<dneighbo> 0=Standard vt7
<dneighbo> do i set this to
<dneighbo> 1=Standard vt8
<dneighbo> ?
<dsmith> ADD the 1=xx vt8
<dneighbo> what is xx
<dsmith> Dunno. Just a name?
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> i think you can define different 'servers'
<dneighbo> [server-Standard]
<dneighbo> name=Standard server
<dneighbo> command=/usr/bin/X11/X -deferglyphs 16 -nolisten tcp
<dneighbo> flexible=true
<dsmith> The 0 or 1 is the DISPLAY
<dneighbo> right
<dneighbo> im gonna leave it as Standard and try
<dneighbo> if i go away you know it puked on itself :

<dneighbo> can i kill it
<dneighbo> i dont get it....
<dsmith> What happened?
<dneighbo> that change now 'starts' to sessions one on vt7 and one on vt8 as best as i can tell
<dneighbo> HOWEVER i STILL CAN NOT FREAKING toggle between the two :(
<dsmith> CTL-ALT-7 Ctl-Alt-8 ?
<dsmith> What do you mean by toggle?
<dneighbo> yes
<dneighbo> ctl-alt-f7 ctl-alt-f8
<dneighbo> its gonna make me have to install windows if i cant figure it out
<dneighbo> as having to logout and login every time to have two people sahre a machine is utter HELL in my household
<dneighbo> anyone running debian that can tell me how to UNINSTALL gdm would be fine too
<dsmith> Doesn't C-A-f7 and C-A-f8 switch between the two?
<dneighbo> as i really dont care for it (exactly because of these issues)
<dneighbo> dsmith: normally it does
<dneighbo> but it KILLS the x session if switch that way :(
<dsmith> Well, just install another session manager like xdm or wdm.
<dneighbo> not kill and give me a prompt but HANG as in black nothingness
<dsmith> Gaaa!
<dsmith> Thats broke!

<dneighbo> but a apt-get remove gdm 
<dneighbo> wants to remove x-server
<jcater> ack
<jcater> that's fscked up
<dneighbo> just how do i SHUT IT OFF
Action: dneighbo is reminded of phrase...
<dneighbo> mommy, "please, make the bad man stop"
<dsmith> Well, just put an "exit 0"  in the /etc/init.d/gdm file, or use that tool to move the symlinks around.
<dneighbo> oh wait
<dneighbo> now apt-get remove gdm seems to work
<dsmith> update-rc.d or something
<dneighbo> i thiink before i did
<dneighbo> gmd xdm kdm
<dneighbo> as i wanted to get rid of all the evil display managers. :)
<dneighbo> hopefully this wont totally toast me
<dneighbo> i was actually starting to 'like' gdm (previously i abhored it)
<dsmith> They start frome the init scripts.  You can stop them that way too. /etc/init.d/gdm stop

<chillywilly> people just don't like change
<dneighbo> ok gdm and xdm are now both DEAD
<chillywilly> nope
<dneighbo> but i still can NOT switch between vt
<chillywilly> trued that first
<dneighbo> even with only ONE session up
<dsmith> dneighbo: Sounds like and X server problem to me.
<dneighbo> i.e. if i start x from vt1
<dneighbo> it starts it in vt7
<dsmith> Doesn't like your video card.
<dneighbo> and if go to vt2-6 and try to come back to vt7
<dneighbo> it flickers like it tries and then hangs eternal death
<dneighbo> where only atl-ctrl-bcksp saves it
<dneighbo> ANY idea where to start researching this :(
<dneighbo> i was thinking maybe its cause im on a switch box?
<dneighbo> and i think
<dneighbo> alt-ctrl-shift is the key combo to switch it....
<dsmith> What X, What video card?
<dneighbo> this just sucks cause i taught my wife concept of vt
<dneighbo> and she LOVED it
<dneighbo> and one thing that made moving to linux 'acceptable'
<dneighbo> um
<dneighbo> xfree86 4.x
<dneighbo> trident cyberblade videocard i think
<dneighbo> btw i my video settings arent that great
<chillywilly> I thought she GOT Free Software?
<dneighbo> i get a LOT of flickering
<chillywilly> that sounds like a cheap ass card ;)
<dneighbo> chillywilly its built on the motherboard
<chillywilly> where's the ATI All in Wonder Card or the GeForce eh?
<dsmith> Can you got to a text cosole and back with only one X running?
<dneighbo> but windows would look fine on it if not better than 
<dneighbo> anyhow
<dneighbo> no
<dneighbo> dsmith : that no was for you
<dneighbo> if i 'leave' X for antoher vt
<dneighbo> there is no going back :)
<dsmith> Thats BROKE.
<dneighbo> i can pop between NORMAL vt's just fine though
<dneighbo> which makes me think its not hte 'switch box'
<dneighbo> dsmith i agree
<dneighbo> but HOW do i fix it?
<dsmith> There *might* be some extra options and settings for your vid card.
Action: dneighbo goes back to dpkg-reconfigure x
<dsmith> Need to find some docs in the /usr/share/doc/X directoryes
<dneighbo> will be back in a moment if i go away
<chillywilly> dneighbo: you didn't happen to use google at all did you?
<chillywilly> I mean I know it is not as fun as bitch in #gnuenterprise
<chillywilly> er, bitching
<chillywilly> but you may be able to find an "answer"
<dsmith> dneighbo: Look in /usr/share/doc/xserver-xfree86
<dsmith> dneighbo: And I'd be running 4.1.x and not 4.0.x
Action: chillywilly has 4.1.x
<chillywilly> 4.1.0:
<chillywilly>     Support (accelerated where the chip supports it) for the TVGA8900D, TGUI9440AGi, TGUI9660, TGUI9680, ProVidia 9682, ProVidia 9685, 3DImage975, 3DImage985, Blade3D, Cyber9320, Cyber9382, Cyber9385, Cyber9388, Cyber9397, Cyber9397/DVD, Cyber9520, Cyber9525/DVD, CyberBlade/Ai1, CyberBlade/DSTN/Ai1, CyberBlade/DSTN/i1, CyberBlade/DSTN/i7, CyberBlade/e4, CyberBlade/i1, CyberBlade/i7, CyberBladeXP, and CyberBladeXPm is provided by t

<chillywilly> seems 4.1.x may have better support
<dsmith> dneighbo: Are you using xserver-xfree86 ?
<chillywilly> dneighbo: is that a laptop?
Action: chillywilly smacks dneighbo with a salmon to get hsi attention
<chillywilly> you could try the frame buffer device
<dneighbo> sorry back
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> reran config and seems slightly better, now can see it repaint instead of just black but it still locks

<dneighbo> i jusst cant use vt or multi display
<chillywilly> try the frame buffer you can always switch it back
<chillywilly> instead of 'trident'
<dsmith> What's happening is that the vid driver isn't talking to the chip properly
<dsmith> Some registers aren;t getting saved
<dsmith> OR are being used improperly
<dneighbo> can i update my xserver or something?
<dneighbo> how do i tell what DRIVER
<dneighbo> as i only get option of TRIDENT
<dneighbo> not a specific trident
<chillywilly> you know where you picked trident at?
<chillywilly> that's where you pcik them at
<dneighbo> yeah dpkg-reconfigure

<dneighbo> and i cant get to the web page
<dneighbo> i REALLY want to know why when i run xf86config
<chillywilly> that machine has a net connection right?
<dneighbo> it lets me pick trident/cyberblade
<chillywilly> obviously since you are here
<dneighbo> but when i try dpkg-reconfigure
<dneighbo> it only lists 'trident'
<chillywilly> does the ctberblade on work then?

<chillywilly> you can pick them all or
<chillywilly> you can say vga=ask

<chillywilly> (with your version in there)
<chillywilly> that just happens to be my current kernel image
<dneighbo> so i 'qoute' teh version
<chillywilly> no

<dneighbo> whew i got it back
<chillywilly> hehe, you panic too easily
<dneighbo> seems i can only run in 800x600 mode
<chillywilly> ;)
<dneighbo> something is JUST not write with this friggin driver
<chillywilly> yuck
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> it's foobarred
<dneighbo> as the spec says that it will support up to 1600x1200
<dneighbo> now the video card does have NO memory
<dneighbo> it uses shared memory so maybe this is part of the problem
<dneighbo> though last one i had did this as wel and was fine...
<chillywilly> no RAM on the card?
<dneighbo> im done screwing with it at this point
<dneighbo> i have wasted WAY too long on it
<chillywilly> plz
<dneighbo> will live to learn with getting my shit toasted

<dsmith> Well, the lastest-and-greatest is alway broke. It takes a while for the code to catch up.

<yogurt2unge> hello people I have a problem when I want connect GEAS to Postgres
<reinhard> yogurt2unge: i am here
<reinhard> what is your problem
dtm (dtm@ip22.promontory.sfo.interquest.net) left irc: "brb"
<yogurt2unge> The problem is How to connect to de DB
<yogurt2unge> I created the user in the postgress
<reinhard> yogurt2unge: may i ask what you are planning to do with geas?
<reinhard> use it in production
<reinhard> or play with it
<reinhard> or want to help with development?
<yogurt2unge> I put It is my first time with geas
<reinhard> just to inform you
<reinhard> the geas that is currently in the downloads area
<reinhard> or in cvs
<reinhard> is the "old" incarnation and we have stopped development on that
<reinhard> a complete rewrite from scratch is just about to be started
<reinhard> so i don't want to stop you but i think it could be wasted effort to put time into this "old" geas
<yogurt2unge> Ok, OK, you said that I must download the cvs and try run?
<reinhard> um no
<reinhard> what i wanted to say is
<yogurt2unge> this version "run"? or is to beta?
<reinhard> currently we have no "run" ("production") version of geas
<reinhard> we have that c code we got contributed from a company
<reinhard> which is what you are looking at now
<reinhard> we decided to no longer put efforts into that code
<reinhard> as it's too far away from what we would need
<reinhard> and the rewrite has not yet started
<reinhard> so i guess what i'm saying is
<reinhard> there is no "geas" at the moment
<reinhard> the old has died
<reinhard> the new has not yet been born
<reinhard> but keep your eyes open
<reinhard> the new one will arrive soon :)
<yogurt2unge> Ok, what's "soon" meaning of?
Action: reinhard hides
<reinhard> depends on how many are going to help
<reinhard> currently all of GNU Enterprise is volunteer work
<reinhard> we all do it in our spare time
<yogurt2unge> In this momment my company need to know about any Frameworks to start a project
<yogurt2unge> GNU Enterprise is in focus
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> remember you can use GNU Enterprise in 2-tier and in n-tier mode
<reinhard> 2-tier means forms talks directly to database
<reinhard> this is very usable already
<reinhard> and it _is_ used in production at several places
<reinhard> n-tier means that there is the appserver in between
<yogurt2unge> Yes, It was my first test and based it I made my recomendation
<reinhard> i believe it will be some months until that constellation is usabel in production
<reinhard> however if you and/or your company is willing to help we can speed that up a lot

<hobbes> someone here ?
<reinhard> yes
<hobbes> ok$
<hobbes> I just encountered gnue
<hobbes> most of the docs are real old
<hobbes> my question : is it usable now to manage a small business
<reinhard> hobbes: in a nutshell
<reinhard> gnue is two projects in one
<reinhard> a. create the tools that can be used to build powerful business applications
<reinhard> b. create the powerful business applications themselves
<dneighbo> reinhard really its 3 in 1 :)
<reinhard> we are currently in stage a.
<dneighbo> c. a meta package of GNU that bundles enterprise software for the GNU project :)
<reinhard> dneighbo: ok
<dneighbo> but other than that i agree 100% :)
<reinhard> hobbes: so it all depends what you are wanting to do
<reinhard> if you are looking at a tool that lets you build your own business apps
<reinhard> then you could use gnue for sure
<dneighbo> nutshell, if you are willing to build your own app w/ frame work, what are you waiting for :)
<reinhard> if you are looking for a ready to go accounting package
<dneighbo> if you are wanting to open the box and press the button to have accounting then nope :)
<reinhard> rofl
<dneighbo> DCL and Bayonne are both available and working
<reinhard> at least dneighbo and me agree :)
<hobbes> :-)
Action: reinhard is away: food
<dneighbo> but are not using the framework (this is part c) :) of meta package
<dneighbo> both are getting intergrated into the framework so they are good choices :)
<hobbes> ok, I'm considering creating my small business right now
<hobbes> it would be service to small business for which a full time It staff is not needed
<hobbes> I need accounting, but can do some developpment for it
<hobbes> (I'm not a developper but I know how a relational db system works)
<hobbes> I considered gnucash
<hobbes> but that wouldn't allow me to manage other things (stocks, sales,...)
<hobbes> and encountered gnue
<hobbes> do you think it would be usable with a small investment in development 
<hobbes> or it requires a big investment to be usable ?
<hobbes> (I'd like to use it because I could propose the solution to clients when it's ready)
<hobbes> (clients for which stocks, sales, invoices,... are requisites)
<hobbes> And if ti doesn't work now, approx when will it ?
<hobbes> (1 year, 5 years,...)
<hobbes> ?
<dneighbo> depends
<dneighbo> for example i expect DCL to be ready very soon
<dneighbo> for small business (SERVICE) based consultants
<hobbes> what is DCL ?  :-)))
<dneighbo> like software consultant shops
<dneighbo> dcl.sourceforge.net
<dneighbo> it is like a project management / help desk system
<dneighbo> we are adding strong CRM support into it
<dneighbo> and making it so that the work order side could be used to generate invoices
<dneighbo> i.e. a time entry/crm/billing solution for software consultants (or any service based company)
<dneighbo> it is quite usable today
<drochaid_> WOOOOOO
<hobbes> but now there is no way to do accounting, and it's not expected soon
Nick change: drochaid_ -> drochaid
<drochaid> dneighbo: are you involved with the DCL project?

<btami> hi all
<btami> is jamest here?
<jamest> not really
<jamest> wazzup?
<hobbes> lol
<btami> jamest: hello
<btami> have you received my email?
<jamest> when was it sent?
Action: jamest is _way_ behind on mail
<btami> yesterday
<jamest> to gnuenterprise.org?
<btami> jamest@gnuenterprise.org
<jamest> reading
<jamest> cool
<btami> :)
<jamest> did we send you copyright paperwork?
<btami> yes, I answered it too
<jamest> did you get paper copy in mail from FSF yet?
<btami> no
<btami> sorry for my poor english
<jamest> ah
Action: dsmith is away: Grrr!
<jamest> well to answer your mail
<jamest> cool about the interbase driver work
<btami> thanks
<jamest> when you mention toolbar not working do you mean the fact we could see the buttons but not the bar itself

<btami> no, nothing there= empty space
<jamest> wierd
<jamest> i didn't know about that but it's always looked funny on windows machines
<jamest> maybe this will fix that too :)
<btami> but icons are not goodlooking 
<btami> on win
<jamest> they are bad

<btami> pretty on a Mac screenshot
<btami> I want to say that only half of all icons are wisible on win 
<jamest> wierd
<jamest> that was old problem on win98 too that we got rid of
<jamest> i think it's safe to say we'd love more
<jamest> help
<jamest> one we get the copyright stuff cleared thru the FSF we can look at getting cvs access setup for you
<btami> nice
<btami> :)
<btami> what about reports?
<btami> is there any directions
<btami> or frozen ?
<jamest> um
<jamest> nothing in stone
<jamest> but jcater has been the only one coding on it
<jamest> so I imagine the docs are all in that head of his :)
<jamest> or in some text files in the reports/doc dir
<btami> so maybe I will ask him 
<jamest> cool
<btami> what the "lol" means
<jamest> i'll try and get your interbase patch in cvs soon

<dneighbo> btami : hwere are you located?
<btami> hungary
<dneighbo> i will give it a few days then call FSF to 'prod' them along if it has not yet arrived
<dneighbo> hobbes that is correct you can not do accounitng out of box today
<hobbes> dneighbo: what level of development is needed ?
<btami> in GNUe?
<hobbes> (I mean : development in gnue, or gnue framework is ready I just have to make my specific apps)
<dneighbo> app developers
<dneighbo> the framework or parts of it are highly usable
<dneighbo> btami as to reports
<dneighbo> the code works
<dneighbo> the biggest hang up is we need to 'define' our tags
<dneighbo> several of us have mentioned some things but no one made a 'proposal'
<dneighbo> once that is done i can do XSLT style sheets against them
<dneighbo> and we will have workign reports :)
<dneighbo> hobbes our framework is designd for BUSINESS ANALYST more thna 'programmers'
<dneighbo> so if you can understand table structures
<dneighbo> and know what you want your app to do
<dneighbo> doing it in GNUe shouldnt be too difficult even for a non 'programmer'
<hobbes> ok thanks, I'll look at it
<btami> dneighbo: can you tell me some words what do you think about 'tags'
<btami> these are about report layout?
<dneighbo> um setup and layout
<dneighbo> so you might hae like
<dneighbo> <title>my foo report</title>
<dneighbo> let me dig up something...
<dneighbo> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/reports.txt
<dneighbo> is something i dummied up when we talked about before in here
<dneighbo> basically that doc isnt what we WANT
<dneighbo> but it helps describe what we are looking for
<dneighbo> im all about starting simple
<dneighbo> and working way into more complex reporting ojbects :)
<btami> I will read
<btami> sometimes I misunderstand things, but if I understand
<btami> I will try a proposal

<chillywilly> the one you have is fine
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> just apt-get install kernel-source then you can compile that Sb Live driver against it
<drochaid> heh, ok chillywilly ... although I can't be more than 8 hours travel for you :)
<crazymike> i don't see anything in the man page about making it permanent

<dneighbo> nickr: give me two seconds trying to reboot
<dneighbo> whoo
<dneighbo> that was close, grub seems to be back in action
<dneighbo> nickr: give me a minute then will paste here the driver info
<dneighbo> iirc
<dneighbo> BoardName "CyberBlade/i1"
<dneighbo> BudID "1:0:0"
<dneighbo> Driver "trident"
<dneighbo> Screen 0
<dneighbo> VendorNAme "Trident"

<nickr> okay
<dneighbo> Indentifier "Device[0]"
<dneighbo> which didnt work
<nickr> don't worry about that
<dneighbo> so i had to remove it
<chillywilly> everything I have seen says use the fb device
<chillywilly> for that card
<chillywilly> but that is fun to get working isn't it ;)
<nickr> puh Option "NoAccel" "True"
<nickr> in the device section
<nickr> right under driver
<dneighbo> give me a second the reboot barfed on self
<dneighbo> fsck failed
<dneighbo> so trying a manual one and reboot
<dneighbo> man dat was ugly
<nickr> now to figure out what I have that goes wel with vodka
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> if you fix this you want paymentin vodka or us dollars
<nickr> USD, I need to do ltaudry.

<chillywilly> bah
<dneighbo> ah
<dneighbo> noaccell freaked it out hard
<nickr> freakid it out!?
<nickr> it should definitely not freak it out

<chillywilly> because that driver blows dude

<jcater> freaking out could mean
<dneighbo> in fact it looks almost identical to what happens when you try to toggle between vt's :)
<jcater> "working correctly"
<jcater> :D
<dneighbo> under the driver entry added
<dneighbo> Option "NoAccel" "True"
<dneighbo> thats what you asked for right?
<nickr> yen
<nickr> dneighbo: I'll sell you a rendition card for 20$, problem solved. :)
<dneighbo> pci?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> although I have a nice virge/vx

<nickr> get bent, it pays

<nickr> hehe
<dneighbo> nickr: its new hardware (not that it doesnt mean its not bad)

<nickr> why did you buy something with the word 'cyber' in it?
<dneighbo> i didnt 
<chillywilly> according to xf4.1.x docs that 'trident' driver is supposed to work with that card
<dneighbo> i bought what i could afford

<nickr> the AT version of which I'm currently using
<chillywilly> oh
<dneighbo> is it possible lspci -v is giving me back 'bad' info on the card?
<dneighbo> though that chipset seems to support that its trident
<nickr> dneighbo: Not likely.
<chillywilly> nickr: you never used the frame buffer?
<nickr> chillywilly: ?
<chillywilly> I mena do you have experience setting it up

<crazymike> nevermind
<crazymike> no, nevermind the nevermind
<crazymike> it says :
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike>         client dhclient
<chillywilly> yea, you want dhcp if it is dhcp
<crazymike> then I have to do pump -i eth0
<chillywilly> no it should use dhclient for you on boot up
<crazymike> I am setting static IP's
<chillywilly> *if*
<chillywilly> you have eth0 in the 'auto' line
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet ???
<chillywilly> as that specifies what interfaces to bring up on boot
<chillywilly>  iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike> but I don't have dhcp
<crazymike> anymore
<crazymike> right???
<chillywilly> then you want the static one
<chillywilly> I dunno did you change your router fconfig?
<crazymike> i am right now
<chillywilly> ok
<crazymike> doing both at once
<chillywilly> then you can use my previous static example
<crazymike> # /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)
<crazymike> # The loopback interface
<crazymike> # automatically added when upgrading
<crazymike> auto lo
<crazymike> iface lo inet loopback
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike>         client dhclient
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike> thats what I ahve right now
<chillywilly> add eth0 to the 'auto' line
<chillywilly> auto lo eth0
<chillywilly> like that
<crazymike>  auto lo eth0
<chillywilly> ye[
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> er, yep
<crazymike> # /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)
<crazymike> # The loopback interface
<crazymike> # automatically added when upgrading
<crazymike> auto lo eth0
<crazymike> iface lo inet loopback
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike>         client dhclient
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike> so I still want the dhcp part in there or not???
<chillywilly> on
<crazymike> I can edit that out, right
<chillywilly> er, no
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> comment it out
<chillywilly> or remove it
<chillywilly> you can't deifne the same interface twice ;)
<crazymike> #iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike>         client dhclient
<crazymike> just that part, right
<crazymike> the rest stays
<chillywilly> no, both lines
<chillywilly> otherwise it will get confused
<crazymike> oh, I thought that took care of both, hence the tab
<crazymike> but ok
<chillywilly> then you gotta go configure your dad's and sisters box's
<chillywilly> er, sister's box
<crazymike> my sister isn't online
<chillywilly> give them static IPs
<crazymike> she just ahs a computer
<crazymike> s/ahs/has
<chillywilly> well when they want to use it they won't be able to unless you set their shit up
<dneighbo> well i got it to accept SWCursor
<chillywilly> oh, ok
<chillywilly> dneighbo: cool
<dneighbo> copied someone elses X file
<dneighbo> from a NON DEBIAN machine
<dneighbo> i think debconf is loading some modules up front that kill some of the options
<chillywilly> probably
<chillywilly> BUT
<dneighbo> i still cant 'toggle' between vt's with this setup
<chillywilly> you can choose which ones
<dneighbo> but we will see if it fixes the cursor issue
Action: chillywilly thinks this channel should be #debian-support
<dneighbo> if so i can live with it for now until i find some X bad ass that can explain things to me
<dneighbo> tempted to try the no accel now
<chillywilly> maybe I should start my own support channel
<crazymike> lol
<crazymike> you should
<dneighbo> two other things
<chillywilly> gnu-linux-support
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> #gnu-linux-support
<dneighbo> a. it fixed my LARGE font gripe (yeah)
<dneighbo> b. it got rid of the 'flickering'
<dneighbo> if it
<dneighbo> c. fixes cursor
<dneighbo> i will be happy
<dneighbo> then if i can figure out vt
<dneighbo> i will be set :)
<dneighbo> though it appears to still be in 800x600
<dneighbo> NOT cool
<dneighbo> slowly but surely i will get there
<dneighbo> i just need to get it to point where im not getting support calls at work for the 'fscked up mouse'
<crazymike> for packet forwarding, do I ahve to forward the pop3 port or will it still do that automatically, for e-mail???
<chillywilly> dneighbo: what do you think of starting a *good* help channel
<dneighbo> btw: syphleed wont work for my wife :(
<chillywilly> why not?
<chillywilly> crazymike: you will be good
<crazymike> do I only need to set the FTP port
<dneighbo> as it doesnt display html mail fully and doesnt support clicking on email :(
<chillywilly> crazymike: yes
<dneighbo> so installed evolution for her
<crazymike> ok
<dneighbo> will see how it goes
<dneighbo> chillywilly: sounds good to me
<chillywilly> cause it is a 'serever' and will accept incoming requests
<crazymike> I'll brb...got to restart my computer
<crazymike> see if the net still works
<chillywilly> crazymike: you have ip forwarding turned on?
<crazymike> yeah
<chillywilly> (in your router)
<chillywilly> ok
<crazymike> I just set it to forward port 21 to my IP
<chillywilly> you need to forward the ftp port
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> also
<crazymike> then set my IP
<crazymike> and turned off DHCP
<chillywilly> I think you need to forward the data port
<chillywilly> I thin ftp uses 2 ports
<chillywilly> ftp-data  20/tcp
<chillywilly> ftp   21/tcp
<chillywilly> forwrad both of those
<chillywilly> to your IP

<crazymike> forget that last line
<crazymike> that didn;t work
<crazymike> forget all that shit
<chillywilly> crazymike: just see /etc/services ;)
<crazymike> yup
<crazymike> 20, and 21
<chillywilly> uhuh
<chillywilly> ok, give it a shot my man
<crazymike> ok...is that it then???
<chillywilly> yep
<crazymike> I should be set, right
<crazymike> ok
<crazymike> bbl
<chillywilly> ok

<dneighbo_> is there a way you can probe to see what resolution you are running
<chillywilly> uh
<chillywilly> not that I know of
<chillywilly> XFree86.0.log might contain some info though ;)

<chillywilly> wb crazymike
<crazymike> hi
<chillywilly> how goes it?
<crazymike> the internet still works
<chillywilly> can you do an ifconfig and see the interface up?
<crazymike> but I had to type dhclient
<chillywilly> er, did you haev to bring it up manually?
<crazymike> yeah
<chillywilly> blah
<chillywilly> thought you turned dhcp off
<chillywilly> also dude you need to set the router IP as your gateway then if you use static
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> like
<chillywilly> gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
<chillywilly> in the static interface definition part
Action: chillywilly forgot about that
<chillywilly> but seems the thing is still talking dhcp
<crazymike> whats the easiest way to find out my IP
<crazymike> the other one
<chillywilly> ifconfig
<crazymike> I just saw it but don't know where
<chillywilly> er?
<chillywilly> which one?
<crazymike> the house IP
<chillywilly> for the router
<chillywilly> the public IP?
<crazymike> yeah
<crazymike> the public
<chillywilly> crazymike@mke-65-31-133-230.wi.rr.com
<chillywilly> I guess it is 65.31.133.230 ;)
Action: chillywilly pings it
<crazymike> cool, thanks
<chillywilly> you are squashing ICMP packets though
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike>         gateway 65.31.133.230
<chillywilly> no silly
<crazymike> whats that mean
<chillywilly> you need the router's provate IP
<crazymike> oh
<chillywilly> not thw public one
<crazymike> 192.168.1.1
<chillywilly> it make all the hosts on your network look like packets come from that
<crazymike> like that
<chillywilly> then
<chillywilly> it reverses it and delivers stuff back to your orivate IPS
<chillywilly> you dig?
<chillywilly> that's called NAT
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> Network Address Translation
<chillywilly> (ip forwarding)
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike>         gateway 192.168.1.1
<chillywilly> bingo ;)
<chillywilly> did they cover the packet format i your networking class yet?
<chillywilly> like what IP packet headers look like
<chillywilly> (roughly)
<chillywilly> basically it pull the private IP off the packet and slaps on the public one and delivers it
<chillywilly> then it does the reverse
<chillywilly> yanks off the public IP and put the private back on and delivers it locally
<crazymike> kind of
<crazymike> brb
<chillywilly> ok

<chillywilly> wooooo!
<chillywilly> you da man!
<crazymike> no, you da man, niggie
<chillywilly> sheeeet
<crazymike> Gftp...will that allow me to setup an FTP???
<crazymike> or is it done somewhere else in Linux??
<chillywilly> gftp is a 'client' dude
<chillywilly> you need to install an ftp server
<chillywilly> (daemon)
<crazymike> well, alot of the clients for Windows, serve dual purpose
<crazymike> client/server
<crazymike> not alot but some, I should say
<chillywilly> well gftp is only a client
<chillywilly> as is ncftp
<crazymike> thats what I was asking
<chillywilly> althought there is ncftpd
<chillywilly> which is a server
<dneighbo> ok have tools now i need to work for an hour or so i guess :)
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> crazymike: okey dokey smokey
<chillywilly> crazymike: I;m not sure what the best ftp server is to use
<crazymike> wu-ftpd
<chillywilly> sure
<chillywilly> that'll work
<nickr> I should hook up the subwoofer and play tnhe THX sound as loud as it goes
<chillywilly> heheh
<crazymike> my book says that is the most popular :)
<chillywilly> there's also proftpd
<chillywilly> or just plain ftpd
<crazymike> I am getting wu=ftpd right now
<crazymike> it says ftpd sucks
<chillywilly> wuftp has a config program
<chillywilly> well a couple actually
<chillywilly> kwuftpd - wu-ftpd configuration tool
<chillywilly> webmin-wuftpd - wu-ftpd control module for webmin
<chillywilly> or you can be a real hacker and read your book and edit the files with vi
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> (or emacs)
<nickr> wuftpd? sacre vache!
<chillywilly> what's good nickr?
<nickr> hrm
<chillywilly> proftpd?
<chillywilly> ftpd suposedly blows goats
<chillywilly> er, supposedly
<nickr> well it depends on what you want
<chillywilly> he wants to run anon ftp off his computer to server up gufs shows
<chillywilly> etc.
<chillywilly> off his cable modem
<nickr> um gnutella?
<nickr> :)
<chillywilly> er, no
<chillywilly> woah
<chillywilly> there's a shit load of ftp servers
<dneighbo> um why run ftp?
<nickr> how about ..
<nickr> um
<chillywilly> crazymike: do apt-cache search ftpd
<nickr> muddleftp!
<nickr> lukemftp!
<dneighbo> why not use http?
<chillywilly> dneighbo: what should he run?
<nickr> +d
<dneighbo> http
<dneighbo> or
<dneighbo> scp
<nickr> vsftpd!
<dneighbo> if need anonymous file transfer use http
<chillywilly> it's for anonymous downloads
<nickr> http is much better for just downloady shit
<dneighbo> if you need authenticated use scp
<chillywilly> http is not as good as ftp
<nickr> just get freaking gn
<chillywilly> gn?
<dneighbo> just ftp is one more security hole
<nickr> chillywilly: based on what criteria?
<dneighbo> easier to just use http
<dneighbo> also almost everyone has a browser
<dneighbo> not everyone an ftp client
<nickr> chillywilly: its faster, lighter weight, can go though hostile firewalls, requires no authentication or dangerous trickery
<nickr> chillywilly: its universally supported
<chillywilly> http can't go through a firewall any better
<dneighbo> i would say if you merely want anon ftp dont use ftp :)
<dneighbo> use http
<dneighbo> chillywilly: sure it can
<chillywilly> you still have to open the http port
<dneighbo> at my work port 80 is open
<dneighbo> port 21 is not
<chillywilly> well whatever
<chillywilly> he wanted to run ftp
<dneighbo> just saying ftp is a liabilty
<nickr> for just downloads there are a lot of compelling reasons to use http over ftp
<dneighbo> and personally i would avoid unless some good reason (like legacy application or some special need)
<dneighbo> chillywilly: hell i bet you get your debs via http instead of ftp ;)
<chillywilly> well I know it's a potential security hole
<chillywilly> indeed I do
<chillywilly> crazymike: maybe you should setup apache ;)
<chillywilly> so these guys will shutup
<chillywilly> ;p
<crazymike> ummm...ok
<nickr> ne
<nickr> no
<crazymike> I don't care as long as it works
<nickr> apache is complicated and easy to break
<chillywilly> oh plz
<crazymike> and I don't know shit except what you guys tell me to do :)
<chillywilly> the default config is fine
Action: crazymike is stupid!!!
<nickr> try boa
<chillywilly> you setup apache
<chillywilly> put the files in /var/www/
<chillywilly> bingo bango
<chillywilly> you're done
<nickr> or thttpe
<nickr> thttpe
<chillywilly> no, apache
<nickr> thttpd
<nickr> damnit
<nickr> or wn
<chillywilly> piss on those other ones
<nickr> wn is really good, you just have to generate explicit indexes
<chillywilly> crazymike: apt-get isntall apache
<chillywilly> er, install
Action: crazymike ducks under the punches everyone is throwing at each other
<nickr> chillywilly: wtf is with you an apache? are you like getting excellent oral sex from it or something?
<crazymike> so should I get it or not???
<crazymike> AHAHAHAHAHA
<chillywilly> hell yea and you're a jealous little bitch nickr
<nickr> crazymike: get boa
<chillywilly> crazymike: get apache
Action: crazymike cries
<chillywilly> crazymike: who's going to help you out eh?
<crazymike> chillywilly: thats true
<chillywilly> who's your bro eh?
<chillywilly> don;t listen to this little chuckle head
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> that was a funny exchange
<dneighbo> <nickr> chillywilly: wtf is with you an apache? are you like getting excellent oral sex from it or something?

<dneighbo> has got to be the quote of the nite
Action: nickr boms

<chillywilly> [23:27:22] <chillywilly> hell yea and you're a jealous little bitch nickr
<dneighbo> chillywilly: mind tell me the source-list for that ;oral sex; apache?
<chillywilly> no
<dneighbo> dick
<chillywilly> punk
<dneighbo> i thought the freudian slip you made good too
<crazymike> apt-get install apache-oralpleasure

<chillywilly> how does that have anythign to do with oral sex?
<chillywilly> maybe you just need to get over you homophobic tendencies
<nickr> maybe.
Action: chillywilly troutslaps nickr upside his melon
Action: chillywilly has heart burn form mom's chilly
<nickr> yow
<nickr> :(
<nickr> I want some chilly
<chillywilly> crazymike: yup need to put that script in a place where it will execute stiff right after it brings the network interface up
<chillywilly> ummm actually....
<crazymike> I can't find the shit it installed
<chillywilly> how are yoi going to do that
<chillywilly> I havemy server box do it becasue I update my hostnames with the public IP
<chillywilly> I dunno how you can have your router do that
Action: chillywilly ponders some more
<chillywilly> crazymike: use find ;)
<crazymike> i tried
<chillywilly> and?
ithompson (~ianathomp@lsanca1-ar27-4-63-187-185.lsanca1.vz.dsl.gtei.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> do this
<crazymike> find -name ipcheck
<chillywilly> look for ipcheck.py
<chillywilly> find / -name ipcheck.py
<chillywilly> find / -name ipcheck.py -print
<crazymike> got it
<chillywilly> where did it put it?
<crazymike> /usr/sbin
<chillywilly> dude
<chillywilly> which ipcheck.py also works for executables
<chillywilly> it works for finding any executable
<chillywilly> (mostly)
<chillywilly> or 'whereis ipcheck.py'
<chillywilly> man which
<chillywilly> man whereis
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> manwhich
<chillywilly> ;P
<crazymike> Example 2: you are using the Linksys routing device
<crazymike> python ipcheck.py -l -L linksyspassword username password hostnames
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> you can have it use your router
<crazymike> username password hostnames for what???
<chillywilly> for your setup
<crazymike> my computer, my router
<crazymike> ???
<chillywilly> once you get a dydns.org account
<crazymike> i did get one
<crazymike> ohhh
<chillywilly> your dyndns.org account that allows you to update the host name
<crazymike> that username and shit
<chillywilly> your hostname(s)
<chillywilly> yep
<crazymike> crazymike@dyndns.org
<crazymike> :)
<chillywilly> that's not your account and username
<crazymike> i know
<chillywilly> just one of your hostnames
<crazymike> thats a hostname
<chillywilly> yep
<crazymike> Problems looking up hostname crazymike@dyndns.org
<crazymike> damn it
<chillywilly> it shouldn't be '@'
<chillywilly> should be
<chillywilly> crazymike.dyndns.org
<crazymike> ahhh
<crazymike> duh
<crazymike> I am a fucking idiot
<chillywilly> nah
<chillywilly> we should go to bed
<chillywilly> byw
<chillywilly> what you need to do now is
<chillywilly> up a script in
<chillywilly> /etc/network/if-up.d$
<chillywilly> that calls ipcheck.py
<chillywilly> so when the interface comesup
<chillywilly> it updates the dns entry
<chillywilly> automagically
<nickr> automagicr
<nickr> I'm starving.
<chillywilly> #!/bin/sh
<chillywilly> # cat /etc/hosts-up | sed -e s/--IP--/$PPP_LOCAL/g > /etc/hosts
<chillywilly> ipcheck.py -d /etc -i ppp0 --syslog --acctfile /etc/ipcheck.acct
<chillywilly> in /etc/ipcheck.acct I have my username and password for dyndns.org account
<chillywilly> er, -i eth0 for you
<crazymike> what's all that hsit
<crazymike> shit
<chillywilly> lets you update the host enrty automagically
<chillywilly> entry
<crazymike> I am supposed to put some shit in /etc/network/if-up.d
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> a script
<crazymike> all that that you typed???
<chillywilly> vi dyndns.org
<crazymike> or whats that
<chillywilly> enter that line
<chillywilly> line(s)
<chillywilly> #!/bin/sh
<chillywilly> [00:09:13] <chillywilly> # cat /etc/hosts-up | sed -e s/--IP--/$PPP_LOCAL/g > /etc/hosts
<chillywilly> [00:09:13] <chillywilly> ipcheck.py -d /etc -i ppp0 --syslog --acctfile /etc/ipcheck.acct
<chillywilly> [00:09:39] <chillywilly> in /etc/ipcheck.acct I have my username and password for dyndns.org account
<chillywilly> seee how it calls ipcheck.py?
<chillywilly> uses an 'account' file
<crazymike> it says it isn't midifiable
<crazymike> modifiable
<chillywilly> you root?
<crazymike> yeah
<chillywilly> you should just install ssh
<chillywilly> and opne the port ;)
<chillywilly> er,open
<chillywilly> create an account for me ;)
<chillywilly> I'll log i your box and hook you up
<chillywilly> then I can go tobed
<chillywilly> ;P
<crazymike> I have ssh
<chillywilly> do you have sshd running?
<crazymike> I dunno, but it is on my system
<chillywilly> you need to open and forward the port
<chillywilly> port 22
<chillywilly> btw, you should pick better passwords for root and yourself if you're going to open your box up to the world
<chillywilly> (running apache and ssh
<chillywilly> )
<crazymike> yeah
<crazymike> I need to do that
<crazymike> when you put in http://crazymike.dyndns.org in galeon it goes to my router setup
<crazymike> well, if you have the password
<crazymike> but that isn't right
<chillywilly> woah
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<chillywilly> yea, your router is a web server
<chillywilly> it has one it it to configure it...
<crazymike> try it
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> we'll need to work around that
<crazymike> but that is 192.168.1.1
<crazymike> that doesn't make sense
<crazymike> I didn't forward the shit to that
<crazymike> I dunno
<crazymike> so what do I need to do to set up ssh
<chillywilly> just
<chillywilly> apt-get install ssh
<chillywilly> then open and forward port 22
<crazymike> i did that
<chillywilly> btw, I cannto access your box form the outside
<chillywilly> on port 80
<crazymike> I forwarded 22
<crazymike> no???
<crazymike> do I need to reboot???
<chillywilly> your firewall must still be blocking
<crazymike> probably
<chillywilly> you shouldn't
<chillywilly> brb
<chillywilly> gotta piss
<crazymike> I don't ahve a firewall, the router is the firewall
<chillywilly> yes which means tyou have a firewall
<chillywilly> jsut because it is hardware doesn't mean you don't have one ;)
<crazymike> yeah, but forwarding the ports should open that
<crazymike> shouldn't it
<chillywilly> no
<crazymike> i don't see anything to open tehm
<crazymike> them
<chillywilly> forwarding has to do with routing
<chillywilly> (NAT stuiff again(
<chillywilly> a firewall block connections to various ports
<chillywilly> (i.e., packet filtering)
<crazymike> I know that
<crazymike> i need to filter???
<chillywilly> you need to stop dropping http packets ;)
<chillywilly> (port 80)
<chillywilly> you can;t turn it off anywhere?
<crazymike> i don't see anything for opening ports
<chillywilly> there's no firewall config that says what is allowed?
<chillywilly> damn and you have school tomorrow
<crazymike> there is filtering, forwarding, dynamic routing, static routing, DMZ Host
<chillywilly> go to filtering
<crazymike> damn, it still said DHCP was enabled...I disabled it
<chillywilly> blah
<chillywilly> give that thing a kick ;)
<crazymike> ok...I am at filtering
<crazymike> Filters enable you to prevent certain PCs on your network from accessing your Internet connection.
<crazymike> In order to use this feature, DHCP must be disabled on the router.
<chillywilly> you only want to filter the outside interface
<chillywilly> (public IP for the router)
<crazymike> nothing is listed on the filter list
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> well dude I think that's going to have to be something I come over and look at with you as I am not familiar with using a hardware router
<crazymike> thats an internal filtering thing
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> hmmm
reinhard (~rm@62.47.45.2) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> why the hell would you want to filter hosts on the internal network
<chillywilly> hey reinhard
<reinhard> mornin
<chillywilly> only for you ;)
<chillywilly> Tue Mar 12 00:28:05 CST 2002
<chillywilly> crazymike: you can't see anyway to control outside access to the router?
<chillywilly> dude
<crazymike> nope
<crazymike> reading this manual for the router it seems that forwarding it should open it
<chillywilly> Enable DMZ : Yes  No
<chillywilly> Multiple PCs can be exposed to the Internet for two-way communication, e.g. Internet gaming, video conferencing, or as VPN server / Clients. To use the DMZ, you must set a static IP address for a DMZ PC and set that PC to use the selected IP address.
<chillywilly> go to DMZ host
<crazymike> ok\
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> hmmm
<crazymike> it just asks for an IP
<crazymike> This feature sets a local user to be exposed to the Internet. Any user on the Internet can access in/out data from the DMZ host. Enable the feature as you wish to use special-purpose service.
<crazymike> that may be it, hey
<chillywilly> then you csan make your linus box filter the packets and forward ports...
<chillywilly> but that sound like a strange hack
<chillywilly> sorta makes your router obsolete then ;)
<crazymike> I dunno
<crazymike> naw, cause then I would need another nic card
<crazymike> :)
<crazymike> in my machin
<crazymike> e
<chillywilly> true
<chillywilly> well at least you got it so you're on the net at boot up right?

<yogurt2unge> I'm starting with forms and designer and I have a dude, exist any element to see a relationship 1:n? 
<yogurt2unge> When I worked in NEXTSTEP, I had a browse object that I can connect with the output of the SQL query
<dneighbo> ?
<dneighbo> you have a 'dude'?
<dneighbo> im here to help but not sure i understand what you are asking :)
<yogurt2unge> Ok, my english is very bad
<chillywilly> hey dudes
<chillywilly> wheich file has that generic function that loads db drivers?
<dneighbo> chillywilly ?
<chillywilly> I looked in the common code a while back
<chillywilly> there ws a function that did the per directory loading of the db drivers
<dneighbo> yogurt2unge im not familiar w/ NEXTSTEP
<chillywilly> which is also reused in gnurpc
<chillywilly> and loads the commdrivers
<chillywilly> IIRC
Action: chillywilly is responding to reinhard's draft API mail to gnue-dev
<chillywilly> i think this same code should be used to load authentication modules in the security subsystem
<chillywilly> to support more then one form of authentication
<chillywilly> another pluggable arhitecture
<yogurt2unge> dneighbo: Have I a element in forms to see all output a sql query, or a relationship 1:n?
<dneighbo> chillywilly ah sorry was thinking something diff (use the source luke)
<dneighbo> yogurt2unge i still am not sure i understand
<yogurt2unge> dneighbo: Any element like a browser element, in JAVA is jtable
<dneighbo> can you open designer?
<yogurt2unge> ok
<yogurt2unge> I have a designer open
<yogurt2unge> I have a designer opened
<jamest_> chillywilly: the code you are looking for is the dyn_import function
<chillywilly> yes!
<jamest_> in common/src/__init__.py
<chillywilly> thanks dude
<jamest_> it's also used to load UI drivers in forms
<chillywilly> uhuh
<chillywilly> it's just a nice utility
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> which should be used
<dneighbo> yogurt2unge in designer there is menu choice 'window'
<dneighbo> under it are options
<dneighbo> 'object navigator'
<dneighbo> 'data source editor'
<dneighbo> 'schema navigator'
<dneighbo> object navigator gives you a 'tree view' of all objects on a form
<dneighbo> and lets you launch a property editor for each object
<dneighbo> schema navigator lets you look at a database
<dneighbo> get a list of tables
<dneighbo> select a table and get a list of fields with data types etc
<yogurt2unge> Wait the minute please
<dneighbo> datasource editor is kind of inbetween
<dneighbo> im not sure if this what you are looking for or not
<dneighbo> you say SQL but im not sure if you mean the actual SQL statements or the 'uderlying table definitions'
<yogurt2unge> Ok, I see some choise, but ...
<yogurt2unge> I don't see a control object to show a table items
<yogurt2unge> dneighbo: I want to show some items a table, and the user must browse and choose one  
<yogurt2unge> dneighbo: do you undestand me?
<chillywilly> dneighbo: how do you run ispell on your emacs buffer?
<chillywilly> s/your/an
<yogurt2unge> chillywilly: use spell-buffer o spell-region
<chillywilly> what command though?
<yogurt2unge> I'm using M-x spell-buffer
<chillywilly> ok
<dneighbo> i dont understand yogurt2unge 
<dneighbo> when you say user do you mean developer
<dneighbo> or in forms itself
<dneighbo> maybe you mean a 'filter'
<dneighbo> if you are talking forms
<dneighbo> we dont have a 'lookup' widget done yet
<dneighbo> but you can do inline filtering
<yogurt2unge> dneighbo: Ok, be patient
<dneighbo> what is your native language?
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> M-x ispell seems to work fine ;)

<dneighbo> we have people who could readily translate
<StyXman> dneighbo: all yogurt2unge wants is to display a grid of items, being the amount of items variable...

<chillywilly> you ever listen to the linux show dneighbo?

<dneighbo> in cvs from 03.07.2002 is prequery broken?
<dneighbo> chillywilly no
<chillywilly> I have listened several times
<dneighbo> and
<chillywilly> it's pretty cool, imho
<nickr> 'yer mom' today on the Linux Show
<chillywilly> why does everyone make fun of it?
<chillywilly> they are ripping on it in gstreamer
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> er, #gstreamer
<nickr> Because their headlines sound cheesy
<nickr> ugh, need java
<chillywilly> for what?
<nickr> so I'll be all jittery and get things done?
<chillywilly> oh that kinda java
<nickr> tch, what'd you think I meant!?
<chillywilly> well let's see
<chillywilly> we are geeks
<chillywilly> this is a programming project
<chillywilly> my mind automatically thinks of a 'programming' langauge
<nickr> okay, but also note that java is the name of the unspeakable programming language that no one here likes, uses or even mentions because if you say its name three times it'll come and mess up all your software development process
<chillywilly> yes, we all loathe it here
<nickr> did I mention that its unspeakable?
<chillywilly> and you said 'ugh'
<chillywilly> so you see why I would think that?
<nickr> yea, I could see how it'd be misconstrued.
<nickr> I shoulda said 'oy grf,'

<chillywilly> dtm: why?
<dneighbo> no you are in the dawg pound ;)
<dtm> hehe
<chillywilly> dtm: what's crooked with it ;)
<dneighbo> chillywilly static means little specs of white that 'jump' around window edges when moving windows

<dtm> my goals are crooked   my path is crooked :)
<chillywilly> dneighbo: funky

<chillywilly> why are you not running GNU/Linux on that bugger?
<chillywilly> do I have to send the GNU inquisition?
<chillywilly> no one expects the GNU inwuisitiojn

<nickr> chillywilly: no way man
<dtm> nickr: of course, lha has to go.

<dtm> nickr: keep the lha
<chillywilly> easiest thing is

<nickr> Heh
<chillywilly> remove non-free packages
<chillywilly> then remove non-free section from sources.list

<nickr> chillywilly: how is that easy when I need to do 3d modeling?
<chillywilly> find some Free software
<chillywilly> damnit
<nickr> chillywilly: how is that easy when I want to download parts of my childhood?

<nickr> chillywilly: there aren't any that are usable.
<dtm> nickr: use openoffice instead!!
<nickr> chillywilly: and NONE that have internal video editing

<nickr> for me.
<dtm> so how do you deal with .zip now
<nickr> no, this is the list on my other computer which is crufted from a long time ago.
<chillywilly> there's Free versions of zip and unzip now
Action: chillywilly uses them
<dtm> i do have a very tight mix of proprietary vs. open/free software
<nickr> unzip non-US is free
<dtm> where i prefer the open/free anywhere it works
<nickr> appearently
<dtm> and i do so the instant i find it
<chillywilly> BSD licensed
<dtm> like for example i play divx movies on macos10 using Quicktime Player and GPL'd Quicktime components
<dtm> and i run the Aquified Mozilla on os10
<nickr> heh. bleh, macosx
<dtm> and vnc
<chillywilly> gstreamer will rock
Action: chillywilly should download 0.3.3 releae and try the player
<chillywilly> er, release
<dtm> yeah but i'm using the core standards and implementations...  once the free apps mature enough , they'll be using this same core anyway
<chillywilly> dude there's no movies I cannot play
Action: chillywilly uses mplayer
<dtm> but i have a powerbook andi use it for powerbooky things like sleeping, multiple displays (lcd, crt, ntsc) which can't be normally done with linux
<nickr> apple is the epitome of a sleezy, evil company
<dtm> nickr: no it is not.  get over it :)
<nickr> Yes, it is
<chillywilly> sure it is
<dtm> you guys have a fanatical perspective on that
<chillywilly> they even price their shit so poor people cannot buy it
<nickr> I consider them more evil than Microsoft
<dtm> nickr: well then you're nuts!  :)
<dtm> ;)
<dtm> heheh
<nickr> Microsoft is a bumbling evil giant
<dtm> they're not even in the same ballpark
<nickr> Apple is a slick little evil worm
<chillywilly> heheh

<chillywilly> ;P
<dtm> they're nothing like that.
<chillywilly> oh please

<nickr> oh god
<dtm> i've almost always had macs because they hold their value for at least 10 yrs
<nickr> they love that 'hippy' image
<drochaid> you called nickr?
<nickr> but its so fake
<dtm> my house is stocked with > 10yr old macs 
<chillywilly> dtm: you yourself expressed the frustration of tryin to get GNU.Linux running good ontheir hadware and the disfunctionality of apple Linux people
<dtm> nickr: well somehow you've convinced yourself that you know something about apple's culture but you're mistaken
<dtm> chillywilly: yeah and your summary of it is wrong.
<chillywilly> and the fighting you had to do with them
<dtm> chillywilly: it has _NOTHING_ to do with apple hardware
<chillywilly> exactly
<chillywilly> it has to do with their politics
<chillywilly> which is the whole point
<dtm> no it has nothing to do with apple at all; it has to do with having a laptop.
<nickr> dtm: I think I'm correct based on a lifetime of experience with them and the people that use them.
<dtm> which has very advanced features
<chillywilly> bah, lemme go talk to Jeff Carr and see what he thinks of Apple as a company ;)
<dtm> there are a handful of laptops whose free drivers can do all that functionality
<dtm> chillywilly: jeff's not the most objective person on that
<chillywilly> oh so we should only talk to people who did not have to fight tooth and nail with Apple
<dtm> nickr: so does everyone else who has irrational biases
<chillywilly> how objective of us
<dtm> chillywilly: ok well you're in 6 yr old bipolar mode again, so i'm gonna go get some dog food!
<dtm> :)
<chillywilly> nice
<chillywilly> resort to insults
<nickr> dtm: yes, its very easy to dismiss my opinions as irrational bias.
<dtm> chillywilly: that's my attempt to neutralize your stupid insults  :)
Action: chillywilly thinks all prop. software is the 'enemy'
<dtm> chillywilly: that's your basis of communication in generalizing stuff that you dont understnad but which you're convinced you disllike
<nickr> I obviously disagree with chillywilly 
<chillywilly> dtm: when did I insult you in this Apple discussion?
<dtm> chillywilly: that adversarial perspective is what polarizes your perspective
<dtm> chillywilly: and is why you're unable to have clear rational discussions about this type of stuff
<chillywilly> they are conterproductive to our goals
<chillywilly> dtm: wrong
<chillywilly> I can discuss this just fine
<dtm> chillywilly: you insulted a culture i'm loosely associated with and which we all benefit tremendously from.
<dtm> chillywilly: and you made blanketing and negative generalizations about my personal background as applied to your polarized viewpoint
<chillywilly> they're not all evil...in fact they have been doing some good by basing things on OS X
<dtm> regarding my experience with the ppc linux community
<chillywilly> er, freebsd
<chillywilly> wlel I thought that was your point
<chillywilly> when you sadi the things you said
<chillywilly> that Apple has always been a shit to you guys
<dtm> chillywilly: the point is that nobody's perfect and their good far outweighs their bad.  they do have a clear moral imperative to improve in a win/win way.  they have never been the enemy except in _certain_ ways for a period of time when they had idiot leadership like Scully.
<dtm> chillywilly: and even then, that was only _part_ of their culture
<dtm> chillywilly: no, apple has not always been bad to us!  there are negative side effects to the fact that they're a large corp, but almost nothing they do would be possible otherwise.
<dtm> to use a euphemistic cliche it's like a necessary evil
<dtm> not really but one can get the point
<dtm> they have the highest quality, most open standard hardware and software in the industry
<chillywilly> well you think long and hard about how we should treat each other and you tell me if not releasing code basd on profit motives is how people should live
<dtm> it has the lowest TCO and lowest direct price for its value (not always sticker price) of any name brand
<chillywilly> I just don't see it my friend, there has to be a better way
<dtm> if you compare their products directly, feature-per-feature, to the competition, they almost always come out ahead on price, quality, and value
<dtm> chillywilly: if you're going to judge a non-essential minority of the behavior of a global corporation in such a moral way (where morals have no direct application), then another person should get to judge the GNU community based on how they talk and tear each other down and that RMS dresses funny.
<dtm> and that's all wrong
<dtm> none of it is representative of what's really going on
<dtm> they _have_ to withhold some things
<chillywilly> I don't care about 'practicalities', all things break in time all material things become dust after a while
<nickr> chillywilly: thats sort of a defeatist argumest.
<dtm> and tha'ts why your perspecitve is so polarized and adversarial
<dtm> that perspective cannot work
<chillywilly> when I am old and my children look to me all that is ever going to matter is if I loved them
<nickr> chillywilly: by that token we should abandon all this shit. :)
<chillywilly> no, it's the reasons behind it that matter
<chillywilly> not the thing in itself
Action: chillywilly is away: I'm busy
<dtm> a lot of gnu's culture is based on negative reinforcement.  of tearing down or repelling from something else.  that's what provides most moral/ethical motivation in the world  :/
<dtm> fighting.
<dtm> that's just not quite as necessary so often in the information age
<dtm> it's much more flexible now

<dtm> nickr: as opposed to the printing subsystem
<chillywilly> this channel is bumpin'
<dtm> nickr: i.e. gimp-print
<nickr> An incredible number of people from Brooklyn live on Staten Island
<crazymike> chillywilly: how do I register this fucking name and stuff

<crazymike> lol
<chillywilly> dtm: blow me
<chillywilly> dtm: you mean RIGHT
<jcater> hey, guys
<jcater> is this a good response?
<jcater> ------------------
<jcater> There are in effect two different projects at work here. The first one is a database-backed application framework. Several of us are using the Forms and Designer components in a production (or commercial) environment in 2-tier mode (i.e., the client talks directly to the database and doesn't delegate any logic to an application server middleware). The Application Server (GEAS) is being reworked and is not, to my knowledge, used in
<jcater> ction environment. When you see comments about not preserving backwards compatability, they are referring to GEAS. 
<jcater> The second part, actual business applications (such as financials, supply chain management, etc) are still in the planning stages and are awaiting a working application server. 
<chillywilly> dtm: listen to your own advice
<jcater> So, to answer your question, yes, parts of it are being used in production. I use custom forms (designed inhouse) that connect to my Oracle database to run parts of our callcenter and warehouse. 
<jcater> Come check us out.
<jcater> ------------------
<nickr> dtm: Its not unified under any standard yet. The only real defacto standards are producing postscript and gfiving it to lpr
<crazymike> woohoo, I am registered now
<Scott> derek: in answer to your question, I'm this guy: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x7A34FADE
<nickr> dtm: lots of things provide boths sides of that interface
<chillywilly> jcater: nice response sir
<jamest> jcater: works for me
<nickr> jcater: sounds pretty good.
<chillywilly> you forgot
<chillywilly> fod
<chillywilly> (fuck off and die)
<nickr> gimme power over people in a palace with a perminant guard
<dtm> uh oh   if there was a linuxtoday article about gnue today, then we'd better behave ourselves
<dtm> someone might be watching
<chillywilly> eh
<jamest> sigh
<chillywilly> psu knows what to edit out
<jamest> looks like we'd better ban most the losers that hang out here
<jamest> including ourselves
<Scott> jamest: specially ourselves
<jamest> don't want to give the wrong impression
<chillywilly> hellz yea
Action: chillywilly refereshes the talkbacks
<chillywilly> damnit
#gnuenterprise: mode change '+o jamest' by ChanServ!ChanServ@services.
<chillywilly> I hate keyboards
<derek> i submitted two responses as well
<jamest> ok, whos first
<jamest> :)
<nickr> ring the bells, tell everyone, revolution can be fun
<derek> though for clarification ( i suppose we should document this better)
<chillywilly> hmmm, no jcater response yet
<derek> gnue is three things :)
<jcater> chillywilly: comment on what?
<derek> 1. a gnu meta package bundling gnu project packages that are enterprise related
<chillywilly> duh, LT
<jamest> 1) a time sink
<derek> 2. an application framework
<derek> 3. applications built using the framework 
<jamest> 2) slower than a lethargic sloth on nitol
<chillywilly> 1)  a place for masochistic trout lovers
<nickr> derek: is there a whatis section on the wesite?
<derek> Scott: yuo are public key?
<chillywilly> 2) a place for hot goats sex
<derek> ;)
<jamest> 3) responcible for shaving a full 10 years off my life
<chillywilly> 3) the beasting are free
<chillywilly> er, beatings
<jcater> chillywilly: it has to go thru moderation first
<chillywilly> uhuh
<Scott> derek: it's the best I can tell you :)
<jcater> jamest: only 10?
<jcater> I feel shorted then
<jamest> only 10
<jamest> for now
Action: nickr adds shave more years off jamest's life to his todo list.
<derek> nickr: http://www.gnuenterprise.org/sections.php?op=viewarticle&artid=24
<derek> What is GNUe?
<jamest> anyone feel like I should not commit the new interbase driver patches from Bajusz Tams
<derek> is first thing on the left corner of the webpage
<derek> jamest: we have assignment?
<nickr> ...
Action: chillywilly adds troutslap() to the geas v2 api
<nickr> maybe that should be right in the middle on the frontpage
<jamest> we have submitted paperwork
<derek> nickr: if only the 'blink' tag wasnt banned
<derek>  :)
<jamest> but no completed assignment
<nickr> <span style="font-size: 10em">Eh! What the frig is this shit?</span>
<jamest> the entire file after patching is 257 lines of code
<derek> its segregated enough i dont see a problem
<derek> if for some reason the paperwork never comes we simply remove the code
<jamest> and it now adds interbase support for forms and designer
<jamest> Bajusz Tams wants to become a gnue developer
<nickr> 10em font would be like half a screen high or so.
<jamest> wants to become a gnue developer
<chillywilly> troutslap() - use this function when people get out of line in #gnuenterprise or when you really need to get your point accross
<jamest> and work on reports
<nickr> chillywilly: dude, thats so lame.
<jamest> so he has started the paperwork trail
<chillywilly> nickr: like your mother
<jcater> Q: What is GNUe
<chillywilly> anyway....
<nickr> chillywilly: my mother is lame, whats your point?
<jcater> A: You don't know? well, hell, now we'll never find out
<jamest> jcater: :)
<nickr> chillywilly: she can't help it that she broke her leg when she leaped from the car she was kidnapped in
<chillywilly> nickr: uh, that too much information
<jamest> wow
<jamest> a GNUe commit
<chillywilly> nickr: why do you constantly redicule me?  you sick fuck
<jcater> wow
<jcater> cool 
<jcater> it;s been a week or so
<jamest> lets hope the cogs aren't to rusty and she makes it thru
<nickr> chillywilly: because you're an easy target
<Scott> 1 question, how easy is to make a test install of gnue tech?
<Scott> right now :)
<chillywilly> nickr: I just think your pissed off because I told you i don;t swing that way
<chillywilly> you cock smoker
<jamest> what platform
<jamest> ?
<jamest> Scott: what platform?
<nickr> chillywilly: but my sister is very attractive, you should go for her. I know you only like little boys.. I was just trying to help you out.
<Scott> jamest: intel, redhat gnu/linux
<Scott> 7.2
<jamest> you ok w/ CVS code?
Nick change: crazymike -> crazymike_away
<Scott> jamest: I am experienced with cvs.
<jamest> I'd d/l the latest cvs then in the top level dir run a 
<nickr> still no talkback
<Scott> jamest: it's just that I don't have a lot of time right now, so I wanted to give it a test run :)
<Scott> jamest: ok :)
<jamest> python setup-cvs.py
<chillywilly> nickr: let's see....you're single, you live in NY, you watch broadway plays....who's the homo?
<jamest> that will setup a developers install
<Scott> jamest: ok.
<jamest> we're still a bit of a bugger as far as dependencies :(
<jamest> and IIRC there was a RH 7.2 how to posted to the site a while back
<nickr> chillywilly: thats harsh man.
<jcater> dang
<jcater> 5 feedbacks now
<nickr> chillywilly: I mean, my gf left *yesterday*
<Scott> jamest: is it safe to use python 1.5.x?
<nickr> stone cold.
<jamest> Scott: nope
<Scott> jamest: probably. I just looked around the faq (and the neat top 10 questions)
<chillywilly> who the heck is rufus?
<jamest> 1.5.x isn't supported , we had too many things that were causing troubles in 1.5.2 so we jumped to 2.0 thinking the distros would be there by the time we were ready
<nickr> the guy from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure?
<Scott> jamest: that's worse. because of security on workplace we try very hard to avoid installing software that isn't signed by a known somewhat trusted key)
<Scott> jamest: rh8 will include it I think.
<jcater> Scott: python 2.0 is on the RedHat 7.x CDs
<jamest> I don't think anyone would trust us though
<jcater> it may not be installed by default
<jcater> but it is an option
<Scott> jcater: it is? I didn't notice. there's not many things I run that use python...
<Scott> jcater: that's good news.
<jamest> but people need to realize that derek is our only target of agression
<jcater> I no longer use RedHat
<Scott> jcater: that way, the risk will only be on gnue :)
<jcater> but I did use 7.1 and it was included
<jcater> gnue? risk? nah
<jcater> <snicker>
<jamest> so all the rm -rf commands embedded in it are keyed to username derek and an IP address that can be traced back to the state of AZ
<Scott> jcater: well, if debian would sign packages with keys  I could trust... 
<jcater> eh?
<jcater> well, to each his own...
<jcater> we need testers for all distros :)
<Scott> jcater: heh :)
<derek> funny exchange
<derek> ================
<derek> <chillywilly> you cock smoker
<derek> <jamest> what platform
<derek> ==================
<nickr> heh
<derek> Scott: i suggest you look at openBSD
<derek> its MUCH more secure than redhat or even debian
<jamest> gack!
Action: jcater rubs his eyes
<jamest> it's also a platform we don't have any testing on!
Action: derek assumed it was a security thing wanting things 'signed'
Action: jamest runs and hides
<derek> jamest: shhh its my evil ploy to get an openBSD tester
<Scott> derek: if I have to change from GNU/Linux, it will only be to GNU/Hurd.
<jcater> jamest: well, I have an openbsd firewall
<jcater> but I don't really want to test stuff on it
<jcater> ;)
Action: derek puts on his trout armor
Action: jamest doesn't want more bug reports 
<derek> jamest be glad
<derek> im training my office on the spirit of free software
<derek> and so i have started submiting bug reports on ALL software i use
<derek> not just gnue ;)
<derek> poor mozilla bastards got a lot of mail today via bugzilla ;)
<jcater> but, but, but
Action: jamest runs faster
<jamest> 2 commits
<jamest> thank you Bajusz Tams
<jcater> ToyMan_: you around?
<jcater> I just saw your comments about Zope + GNUe
<jcater> what do you have in mind?
<jcater> as I am doing an account maintenance center at the office in Zope
<jcater> and plan to tie it to GNUe when the time is right
<jamest> i too am using gnue/zope at work
<derek> sigh
<jcater> sigh?
<derek> we really shoudl just consider using zope as our appserver it seems
<jamest> i wouldn't 
<nickr> No
<jcater> I wouldn't either
<jamest> it's not even close
<derek> im being feticious
<jcater> where did that come from?
<nickr> zope is too web oriented as you said before
Action: derek is not a zope fan
<derek> not from a technology point of view
<jcater> feticious?
<jcater> does feticious derive from fetus or fetish?
<derek> but from i trust digital creations w/ python as much as i trust sun with java
<nickr> I think he meant fecicious
Action: jcater was teasing him :)
<derek> damn typos
Action: derek glares at jamest
<nickr> twisted looks cool though.
<nickr> i think I already said that.
<derek> facetious is what i meant
<nickr> geas should be in ObjC using our own base class library modelled after python.
<nickr> thats the one.
<jcater> lol
<jcater> I assumed you meant fecicious as well
<nickr> I just can't spel.
<jcater> we no
Action: Scott grins... you're nuts :)
Action: Scott is off to compile abiword to see if his changes to the rpm spec went fine. Then much desired sleep.
Action: Scott waves bye
<Scott> in the mean time, good luck with gnue :) if I can manage some spare time, I'll try to help.
<jcater> cool
<jcater> rest well
<Scott> thanks. bbye
Scott (Scott@213.22.64.87) left irc: "Bye Bye"
<jcater> sigh
Action: jcater runs to the pantry to find the tequila
<derek> hey in printtool
<derek> for remote printer
<derek> what do you put in remote queue?
<derek> is that the name of the queue on the server?
<nickr> derek: the lp protocol defines symbolic names for each printer
<jamest> derek: yes
<nickr> derek: if the remote printer is a standard lp, the default spool name is 'lp'
<derek> on the server i have Names (in printtool) as lp
<derek> cool
<jamest> nickr: don't give him too much info, if he gets everything working he'll start submitting bug reports again
<nickr> hehe
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> I'm going to go ahead and commit the currently broken nstti interface to forms
<jcater> cool
<jamest> as it'll be April before I can touch again
<jcater> dang
<jamest> not cool
<chillywilly> hey did scott say he would run GNU/Hurd?
<jcater> yip
<chillywilly> rock on!
<nickr> chillywilly: yea, but it seems unlikely anyway since it uses the debian package infrastructure
<jcater> rofl
<nickr> which he clearly has problems with
<chillywilly> wjhat?
<chillywilly> debs kick arse
<nickr> he claims they aren't signed by keys 'he can trust'
Action: chillywilly knows that crazymike_away is wathcing gilmore girls like a little bitch
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> that's lame
<chillywilly> don't you have ot have someone that can physically see you sign your key?
<nickr> chillywilly: ye
<nickr> yes
<nickr> and everything in the archive has signed md5 sums
<nickr> but anyway

<jcater> laurie: ok, but should we not tell derek?
<chillywilly> I mean
<chillywilly> mrs. masta
<laurie> i think his conclusion is he has patch that makes it work with our parser
<laurie> BUT
<laurie> wxWindows doesnt support unicode (and he hit same python bug i think we did)

<chillywilly> I juts registered #debian-support

<jcater> dneighbo: you may need to add aegagrys to your /etc/hosts.lpd
<nickr> dneighbo: so you're using lpr?
<nickr> dneighbo: bsd-lpd rather
<dneighbo> nickr: im just doing what jamest told me :)
<nickr> I can be of no help if you're doing that.

<nickr> its web based

<chillywilly> you go to

<dneighbo> hmmm i dont think these boxes have web servers
<jcater> dneighbo: what does your carpine printcap look like
<chillywilly> and use the config program
<chillywilly> it's easy
<dneighbo> jcater: where is printcap at?
<chillywilly> dneighbo: you don;t need one
<nickr> dneighbo: it doesn't use a server, it has a little servelet which is part of the IPP
<jcater> /etc/printcap
<chillywilly> just a browser
<chillywilly> the daemon wait on that port for you to connect to it

<dneighbo> how do i tell?
<dneighbo> jamest told me to apt-get printtool and run it
<jcater> dpkg --list|grep lp
<dneighbo> i did that, and i could print on server
<dneighbo> he then said do same for client only use remote queue

<jcater> yes
<dneighbo> in the dpkg list?
<jcater> removed iirc
<dneighbo> ah
<chillywilly> dneighbo: it's nice to know that you have confidence in *certain* ppl
<dneighbo> chillywilly: im HALF WAY IN SOMETHING
<dneighbo> if three weeks ago when i started you would have said lets do CUPS
<dneighbo> i would have
<chillywilly> I don't care
<nickr> I did say that
<dneighbo> jamest was the one willing to help then so i have started down this path
<nickr> when you first asked , I was like, use cups man its easy
<dneighbo> nickr: key was you said
<dneighbo> use cups its easy
<dneighbo> jamest said
<dneighbo> use printtool its easy and ill help
<dneighbo> ;)
<chillywilly> sheesh
<dneighbo> im willing to switch to cups if someone will help
<chillywilly> fuck this
<nickr> Heh, well you should know by this time the 'ill help' is implicit to my suggestion.

<chillywilly> well, I would never do that

<chillywilly> plus I could whip mike's ass in a heart beat

<chillywilly> you just need to come out of the closet

<dtm> ok just because you guys are being so nutty, i'm going to reboot to macos9 to scan some pictures!!
<dneighbo> since i dont have vt's working (sigh) i will be back in a minute need to logout off as wife so i can get me email. :)

<chillywilly> use SANE and set it up under a Free OS
<dtm> chillywilly: i'll be resarching SANE later
<chillywilly> cool
<dtm> first i'll do the printer which is more critical
<dtm> and which is allegedly supported by gimp-print
<chillywilly> what kinda printer?
<dtm> allegedly at quality higher than that of the proprietary macos/windows drivers from Epson
<dtm> epson stylus 580

<dtm> (@#*
<jcater> how does linux do w/usb digital cameras?
<chillywilly> using cups of course ;)
<chillywilly> I dunno
<dtm> jcater: it does pretty well, thanks to usb
<dtm> macos10 can pretty much use any digital camera with no device specific drivers, so that's encouraging

<dneighbo> hey chilly if you do an 
<dneighbo> apt-get update
<dneighbo> apt-get upgrade
<dneighbo> is there an easy way to see change log of packages that upgraded?
<dneighbo> i see a new syphleed and am curious as to what new features are there :)
<chillywilly> not unless you download it, but why can't you just go to their site and view the relase notes
<chillywilly> (and install it)
<jcater> what sylpheed do you have now?
<dneighbo> i upgraded it
<chillywilly> ooooh
<chillywilly> ok
<dneighbo> but am going to site to read changelog
<jcater> as the 0.7.2 release fixes several quirks
<dneighbo> just curious if there was easy wasy to tel
<jcater> but no biggie new features
<chillywilly> I tried sylpheed once
<chillywilly> I didn't like it much though
<dneighbo> um apt just upgraded me to 0.7.4
<chillywilly> I forget why
Action: jcater luvs it
<dneighbo> you behind the times jcater :)
<jcater> damn
<jcater> I upgraded 2 weeks ago
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> debian changes like every day
<jcater> no, dude
<dneighbo>     *  The bug in POP3 that lost UIDL information if any error occured before issuing UIDL command was fixed.
<dneighbo>     * Message retrieving is now cancelable from the menu even if the dialog is hidden.
<dneighbo>     * Some warnings on compiling with gcc-3.0 have been removed.
<dneighbo>     * The English manual has been updated.
<dneighbo>     * The FAQs in English, Spanish and French have been added.
<jcater> from their site
<chillywilly> 2 weeks is an eternity
<dneighbo> are 0.7.4 chagnes
<dneighbo> so no big changes
<dneighbo>     *  Attached files will be inherited on forwarding or reediting.
<dneighbo>     * Filter rules will be also updated when renaming or deleting folders.
<dneighbo>     * 'Get all' and 'Check for new messages' now works for IMAP4 and News accounts.
<dneighbo>     * Limit of Receive size for POP3 has been implemented.
<dneighbo>     * The new notebook tab interface for multipart messages has been implemented, and text parts are displayed on the text view all together.
<dneighbo>     * Separate user ID and password can be used for SMTP AUTH.
<dneighbo>     * ISO-8859-15 support has been added.
<dneighbo>     * Cancellation of POP3 session is now handled correctly.
<dneighbo>     * Some bugfixes have been made.
<dneighbo> 0.7.3 had some decent fixes though
<dneighbo> imap4 support
<dneighbo> the one that they dont have that i want is drag n drop folders
<dneighbo> as i created a bunch of rules (yes!)
<dneighbo> and it auto puts my mailing list mail into correct folders
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> i was dumb and didnt realize i had so many mailing lists
<dneighbo> so i want to create a folder called Mailing Lists
<dneighbo> and put the others under it
<dneighbo> but i cant seem to do that
<dneighbo> i would have export out
<dneighbo> delete current folders create new ones then import in (and im too lazy for that) ;)
<chillywilly> that's a lot of bs work too
<chillywilly> whihc is why it takes me forever to get around to fixing up mutt and stuff as I have too many damn config files to edit
<jcater> I gave up on all that crap
Action: chillywilly is also lazy
<jcater> and use an IMAP server at work 
<jcater> w/procmail
<chillywilly> you store it all on the server?
Action: chillywilly uses IMAP with fetchmail
Action: chillywilly uses fetchmail+procmail+mutt
<dneighbo> i am too nervous about IMAP still
<dneighbo> read its not installed on my host and tested heavily
<dneighbo> jcater: can you download mail locally?
<dneighbo> as when i rid the bus i like to read my mail and compose responses
<dneighbo> though now i dont use laptop for mail so i guess that will be hard....
<dneighbo> hmmmm
<jcater> hmmm
<dneighbo> currently i download mail to home box
<jcater> yeah, I think so
<chillywilly> you can remove the messages with IMAP
<dneighbo> and while i am out i shut off the download
<chillywilly> local download and stuff
<jcater> I think most IMAP clients (including sylpheed) keep a local cache
<dneighbo> so i can ssh into a server and read with pine
<chillywilly> a real hacker just telnet to the port ;P
<chillywilly> j/k
<dneighbo> while im out (vacation (like that happens) or such)
<chillywilly> fuck mail clients
<dneighbo> you know what
<dneighbo> once linux is configured it kicks ass
<chillywilly> damn skippy
<chillywilly> but getting ti there is a PITA sometimes
<chillywilly> s/ti/it
<dneighbo> if for nothing else you know what i cant stand about winders now when i have to use it
<dneighbo> lack of virtual desktops
<dneighbo> i mean it REALLY kills me
<dneighbo> i installed like 3 different 3rd party ones
<dneighbo> but they all use a 'pager' 
<dneighbo> and you cant drag windows around them
<dneighbo> etc etc etc
<dneighbo> oh and tabs on my browswer
<jcater> roflmao
<dneighbo> i cant use i.e. or older mozilla's anymore
<chillywilly> tabs rule
Action: jcater is reading my employee's livejournal
<jcater> trips me out
<dneighbo> galeon has me spoiled with tabs
<dneighbo> linkage linkage ;)
<jcater> "I was at work yesterday and the CFO of our company asked me what the bumper sticker on the back of my car (the one that reads "Coding is Not a Crime") means. And I told him, "Oh, I dunno. It helps me get girls." And err he started laughing, and so did that dork Brian Bockhold, and I looked over and the president of the company is standing a few feet away and laughin at me. Hahha ooops."
<jcater> sigh
<dneighbo> you reminded me this doesnt have logjam installed
<dneighbo> need to do that :
<dneighbo> )
<jcater> I gave him the "Coding is not a Crime" bumpersticker :)
<dneighbo> rofl
<jcater> dude
<jcater> this is our intern
<dneighbo> jcater: coding is techincally not a crime
<jcater> http://www.livejournal.com/users/masterh
<dneighbo> just ....
<dneighbo> publishing code
<dneighbo> executing code
<dneighbo> distributing code
<jcater> hehe... his grandmother thought it was a perverted bumper sticker
Action: jcater guesses she read it as "copulating is not a crime" or something
<dneighbo> well maybe she is on to the notion of 'mad goats'
<jcater> you know these youngun's with their code words, like "coding"
<dneighbo> rofl i like his picture
<jcater> "hey baby, wanna code"
<jcater> he is a friggin trip
<jcater> you'll notice he never mentions me
<jcater> ever
<jcater> but he makes fun of his coworker (my other guy) left and right
<jcater> (brian)
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> can I put together a team or what!
<jcater> ;)
<dneighbo> all i can say is galeons image rendering smokes the crap out of IE 4.0 and 5.5
<dneighbo> the images are like 50% clearer and much more crisp
<dneighbo> and this is with WORSE video card
<dneighbo> me is scared... jcater might read the vile crap i write about him and jamest in my journal
<jcater> um
<jcater> what's your login?
<jcater> nevermind
<jcater> I found the red shirt and pseudo-blond hair
<chillywilly> due has a whole story about that guy
<chillywilly> er, dude
<jcater> dude?
<jcater> ah
alexey (~Alexey@techkran.vladimir.ru) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> there's several stories there
Action: dneighbo reread a few just now
<dneighbo>  Life with kids is truly entertaining... Spent a few hours making chicken Kiev for the wife. It was so nice, and wonderful. Candle light dinner w/ nice wine and such. Sit down and throw a dvd on and a kid is screaming. Go to see whats up and she is puking all over. Oh how it can spoil a mood. :)
<dneighbo> is great
<chillywilly> does that Brian guy like to wear hats jcater?
<jcater> no
<jcater> everything on there is a joke
<chillywilly> why did he make up the hat sotry about him
<jcater> you'd just have to know him
<dneighbo> jcater i have some gnue questions...
<dneighbo> a. can you confirm or dispell notion that prequery isnt working
Action: jcater has never used prequery to my knowledge
<dneighbo> b. what is the datasources editor for exactly... (it appears to not do anything you cant do in properties or schema editor)
<dneighbo> c. are you open to suggestions on schema editor....
<jcater> datasource editor predated schema navigator
<dneighbo> actually thats a long conversation...
<chillywilly> liar
<jcater> and datasource editor will eventually be more than it is now 
<dneighbo> as would like to see us get more into database space
<dneighbo> i.e.
<dneighbo> show a tree view of drivers installed
<dneighbo> and let you config them
<dneighbo> and set optoins etc...
<dneighbo> but also allow you to create table defintions in designer
<dneighbo> but not important at this point
<jcater> sigh
<dneighbo> for now will look into dia2mdeansdataspec
<dneighbo> then we have xsl to convert from that to virtually all dbs
<dneighbo> dont sigh, i like things very much
<chillywilly> " i cannot believe that belief will stand up for long if you truly believe it"
<dneighbo> just listening to the complaints so to speak
<dneighbo> lots of people (the business users) are hung up on concept of having to hand write a sql script
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I started on such a thing
<dneighbo> that guy in here today yogurt (dont know exact nick)
<jcater> but this damn real life keeps interfering
<dneighbo> wanted dynamic table editor
<dneighbo> which might be pretty cool
<dneighbo> as example of python wx application that is not gnue but uses gnue-common
<dneighbo> basically fire it up and select a driver
<dneighbo> select a database
<dneighbo> select a table
<dneighbo> select some fields
<dneighbo> and it opens in a wxGrid
<dneighbo> at first i was like just make a form
<dneighbo> but then i recalled that i had such a tool i made in delphi one afternoon that was EXTREMELY valuable
<dneighbo> as it was a real easy way to view data in a lightweight way
<chillywilly> eeee, gad
<dneighbo> without having to make forms
<chillywilly> again witht eh delphi
<chillywilly> delphi schmelphi
<dneighbo> a dba kind of tool
<dneighbo> anyhow 
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> not sure I see how this is different
<jcater> than our "multi-row" layout option in the Simple Wizard
<jcater> Click
[23:08] Last message repeated 4 time(s).
<jcater> run
<chillywilly> stop
<dneighbo> not as lightweight
<chillywilly> www.com clickity clickity click click
<dneighbo> but more importantly have never gotten run to work in designer :)
<chillywilly> king of the hill is a funny show
<dneighbo> but as stated thought it might be a decent usage of gnue common outside gnue :)
<dneighbo> not saying WE should author it :)
<jcater> my only fear is
<dneighbo> ah thats the thing i wanted to mention
<jcater> that has SO much in common with forms
<jcater> that it would eventually compete
<dneighbo> gotcha
<jcater> wrt feature-creep
<dneighbo> in master detail wizard
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> something to think about anywho
<dneighbo> it says what is key for master
<dneighbo> then new box what is key for detail
<dneighbo> i think instead it should list all fields in master on left
<dneighbo> and all fields for detail on right
<dneighbo> you highlight the field in each you want
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> and click a button in the middle to bind them
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> how would that work w/multiple keys?
<jcater> btw
<jcater> that was demo code for jamest
<dneighbo> i was just gonna say thats the beauty
<dneighbo> is it works good that way
<jcater> showing him how to do another wizard
<dneighbo> as you can highlight multiple on both sides
<dneighbo> i think it needs to be on same screen as at work
<jcater> I did that wizard in a few minutes without ANY code changes to designer :)
<dneighbo> i have tables with say 100 columns
<dneighbo> columns like
<dneighbo> CATEGORY
<dneighbo> GROUP
<dneighbo> CATALOG
<dneighbo> CASOMETHING
<dneighbo> CASOMETIHNG ELSE
<dneighbo> and on two screen thing
<dneighbo> i might cliet CASOMETHING
<dneighbo> and get to second page and go crap did i click CASOMETHING OR CASOMETHING ELSE
<dneighbo> example today had table 
<dneighbo> dept
<dneighbo> dept_num
<dneighbo> dept_name
<dneighbo> (bad naming i know believe me i know)
<dneighbo> and then title
<dneighbo> dept
<dneighbo> title
<dneighbo> as fields
<dneighbo> clicked dept_num as key in master
<dneighbo> then in detail clicked dept and was like crap i think i clieck dept_name in master
<dneighbo> hope that makes sense
<jcater> well, like I said... this was a sample wizard to show what designer could do AS IT SITS :)
<dneighbo> btw: not trying to complain i thought the wizard KICKED butt
<jcater> never said it was the best or final way
<jcater> ;)
<dneighbo> other thing i noticed is we dont have real grids
<dneighbo> so an option should be how many rows the detail is
<jcater> sigh
<dneighbo> if you choose grid
<dneighbo> btw: is there sample code of our repeating rows w/ scrollbar anywhere?
<jcater> not sure
<dneighbo> btw: i didnt mean that as slam on grids (i see that i probably looked that way)
<jcater> btw, I've been torn wrt asking how many grid rows to show
<jcater> as that isn't actually a "grid" wizard but a simple demo wizard
<dneighbo> just w/o a scrollbar people dont think its a grid
<chillywilly> SHOW THEM ALL
<dneighbo> chillywilly: your high
<chillywilly> fucking fill up their video ram!
<dneighbo> it would crash X
<dneighbo> i know, ive done it :)
<chillywilly> crash their X server
<chillywilly> wooooo
<jcater> and I don't want to keep cramming options in that simple wizard
<jcater> so I'm torn
Action: chillywilly sews jcater back up
<dneighbo> if we made it automatically put a scrollbar on right
<jcater> btw
<dneighbo> then i dont think we need to ask
<jcater> I'd prefer to see Simple Wizard not change at all
<jcater> and us create another wizard
<jcater> that is actually "prodcution-quality" so to speak
<dneighbo> i have never seen sample of the scrollbar in action
<dneighbo> i would like to
Action: jcater either

<jcater> are you mental?
<derek> i get weird stuff on this machine
<derek> w/ gnue at times
<derek> it will do something like above
<derek> then instantly will rerun it it
<derek> and its fine
<derek> its voodoo
<derek> remember this box i cant 'save' files
<derek> as unicode is busted
<derek> need to get my new box all gnue'd up
<derek> i might have a heart attack as i think gnue is usable on my p233 64mb at work
<derek> and pretty kosher on my pIII 500 128mb laptop
<derek> on that new durn 1.2ghz i might fall over
<chillywilly> stop bragging
<derek> some folks want a gnue demo thursday but i remember now that i cant save designer forms cause of python2.2
<derek> crap crap crap
<jcater> sigh
<chillywilly> not here please
<jcater> downgrade, dude
<derek> will need to take laptop to work tomorrow and grab python2.1
<derek> and compile it and all the dependencies
<derek> jcater: bug...
<jcater> derek: no...
<derek> if i slap an entry widget on form in designer
<derek> then go to property editor and change rows to greater than one
<derek> it doesnt update the form
<derek> am i doing something wrong or bug?
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> I haven't had time to look at designer since we updated the 
<jcater> UI* stuff in forms
<jcater> it *basically* works
<jcater> but requires some patience
<derek> it works pretty good for me
<derek> i whipped up a title maintenance application for FY03 in about 2 minutes today (master detail)
<derek> i.e. it was quicker than writing the select statement
<derek> er update
<derek> DB000: Traceback (most recent call last):
<derek> DB000:   File "/home/dneighbo/cvs/gnue/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/designer/Instance.py", line 438, in OnDebugRun
<derek> DB000:     DebugSession(self)
<derek> DB000: NameError: global name 'DebugSession' is not defined
<derek> is what i always get when trying to 'run' from w/in designer
<derek> jcater you like older music like show tunes
<derek> from musicals?
<derek> i.e. do you like musicals at all
<jcater> well
<jcater> I didn't
<jcater> until I got into theatre productions
<jcater> then came to appreciate the talent behind musicals
<jcater> ;)
<jcater> got into = started going to
<derek> you like ska/punk type music at all?
<jcater> some
Action: jcater likes a little of everything
<jcater> but a lot of nothing
<derek> if so there is a group of punk musicians that liked theater and got together and decided to do cover tunes of musicals
<derek> they are GREAT
<jcater> cool
<derek> called
<derek> ME FIRST & THE GIMME GIMMES
<derek> some where over the rainbow rocks :)
<derek> as does that annie tune, (tomorrow?)
<derek> and several othes
<derek> others
<jcater> yay
<chillywilly> jcater: that intern of yours is bizzare man
<jcater> posted my first live journal
<jcater> chillywilly: yeah, isn't it great
<jcater> I plan to train him as my successor
<chillywilly> I can't stop laughing at his journal

<chillywilly> roflmao
<jcater> fuck
<derek> gack
<jcater> wassat
<chillywilly> What I'm really waiting for right now: E.T. the Extraterrestrial is coming back into the theaters. And I'm way excited, because that part at the end where Elliot totally rides the bike and you can tell right before that he smoked a whole blunt and he's so high and so is E.T., and right during that part, you can see E.T.'s lips move slightly and if you watch REALLY carefully, E.T. says "I could use some more motherfucking Reeses P
<chillywilly> ht now." I bet they cut that part out when they re-release it though.
<derek> was trying to post list of tunes
<chillywilly> roflmao!!!!!!
Action: chillywilly is going to piss himself
<derek> that is funny
<jcater> he says crap like that in the middle of the day
<derek> these are a few of my favorite things rocks too :)
<jcater> he has a Mr. T doll sitting on his monitor
<derek> http://store.artistdirect.com/store/artist/album/0,,846139,00.html
<derek> if you have realplayer you can listen to some of their tunes
<chillywilly> that dude should be a comedian
<chillywilly> I dream iof thinking up crazy shit like that
<derek> Though it doesn't sound like a brilliant idea, Me First & the Gimme Gimmes, an all-star cover band dedicated to regurgitating punk rock-style the most frothy music in their parents' record collections, are actually extraordinarily entertaining and can make the likes of John Denver and Barry Manilow sound not so bad. The lineup includes Fat Mike of NOFX, the guitarist from the Foo Fighters, a couple of the guys from Lagwagon , and Spi
<derek> awson, the Gimmes' sweet-voiced singer, who also plays bass for the Swingin' Utters. On their second record, Are a Drag, the Gimmes tackle all of their parents' favorite showtunes, claiming homage rather than satire. Most of their choices are songs that anybody even remotely into musicals knows by heart. Their cover of "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" has more choruses than the original, rocks pretty damn hard, and is certainly worthy of
<derek> irling slam pit. Though it's not as wild as John Coltrane's version, the Gimmes' "My Favorite Things" is raging enough to send Julie Andrews swan diving off the stage into a sea of sweaty punkers. They mess with the jazz standard "Summertime" by Gershwin, adding some fine surfy leads to a song that's been played a million times over. Also, there's their furious rendition of Andrew Lloyd Webber 's "Phantom of the Opera." On Are a Drag
<derek>  Gimmes succeed at playing showtunes that punk kids can dig, no small feat. ~ Adam Bregman,
<derek> the beauty of having nieces and nephews that are turing 15-18 are they turn me on to some cool music and popular culture :)
<nickr> and in many states yo ucan marry them also.
<nickr> like Wisconsin
<derek> or Tennessee
<chillywilly> pffft
<jcater> you can marry wisconsin?
<jcater> I knew corporations had the same rights as people these days
<jcater> but states too?
<derek> jcater: i cant grok scroll bars
<jcater> derek: is LogJam in sid?
<derek> yip
<derek> apt-get install logjam
<jcater> um
<jcater> rock
<nickr> ergh, I'm not getting enough email.
<nickr> whats logjam?
<jcater> nickr: what's your email?
<derek> livejournal entry tool
<jcater> I'll send you something
<jcater> dude
<jcater> this could get addicting quickly
<nickr> nick@[fargus.net|nspam.industrialmeats.com] or nickrusnov@debian.org
<nickr> I should make a live journal
<jcater> industrialmeats?
<jcater> sounds kinda sickening
<derek> grrrrrr
<nickr> hehe
<nickr> jcater: my website is nick.industrialmeats.com ;)
<derek> you want to compile logjam
<jcater> I do?
<derek> as if you compile it you can xmms support
<derek> and spell checking
<derek> i dont know how to get those with the deb file
<nickr> derek: file a big report :)
<derek> i will jsut post to evans journal
<derek> i started to fix some stuff in the logjam client
<derek> cause i ahd to complie from source on redhurt
<derek> but was choking on the fact its icky old C code
<derek> then i found evans stash of python libs to access livejournal :)
<derek> but decided i didnt need another project
<jcater> spell checking
<jcater> ?
Action: jcater hasn't used computerized spellchecking in like 2-3 years
<jcater> ok, nickr
<jcater> you have email
<jcater> ;)
<nickr> you'll be happy to know that it wasn't characterized as spam :)
<chillywilly> So, logically, I get on the fucking livejournal. Thanks, livejournal. You soul-sucking assholes. I didn't even want to post in this thing every day, and now it's like a crackhead's pipe - "oh oh what do I do now?" "smoke that crack. write in the journal."
<chillywilly> Rockin and rolling,
<chillywilly> Master H
<nickr> spamassasin is cool
<nickr> assassin
<jcater> dude
<jcater> I installed that last week
<jcater> and it has rocked my socks
<nickr> I like how it adds ****** SPAM ******* to spam :)
<jcater> derek: cool
<jcater> we could write a dbdriver backend for livejournal
<jcater> ;)
<nickr> haha
<jcater> with a forms front end
<dneighbo> would work for me
<nickr> then you could use the web forms client
<nickr> haha
<nickr> symmetry
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> we could do our appserver using zope
<jcater> so we'd have a web-based forms client
<jcater> using gnue-common to connect to a zope app server
<nickr> just make a forms client IN zope
<derek> jcater do you have any idea how scroll bar works
<jcater> which uses gnue-common to connect to the webservices of livejournal
<jcater> derek: nope
<dtm> jcater: what about xmlrpc to phpgroupware/
<dtm> ?
<jcater> ah
<jcater> tru
<dtm> jcater: well, do that then.  :)
<jcater> derek: I've never had the inclination or need to try scrollbars
<jcater> so I dunno how they work
<derek> never mind
<derek> 5.1.8 <scrollbar>
<derek> Only partially implemented at this time. Will show on form
<derek> but do nothing.
<derek> 5.1.8.1 Attributes
<derek> from the techref ;)
<jcater> lol
<jcater> well, at least the techref isn't misleading
<derek> my bug report to jamest was gonig to be
<jcater> ;)
<derek> they appear to show on form correctly, but apparently dont do anything
<derek> which is exactly how the techref explains them as working
<nickr> its nice to have parity in documentation.
<nickr> what is livejournal anyway?
<derek> an addicting piece of crap
<nickr> Heh.
<nickr> its like a blog no?
<derek> my two favorite moments on livejournal
<derek> the 18 year beverly hills chick who said I LOVE KRISPY KREME and I NEED A MAN
<derek> and the 13 year that posted in my log, your hot please message me 
<derek> the day after i told jcater i couldnt believe these birthdays being like 1985 and being intelligible etc
<nickr> I love krispy kreme
<jcater> nickr: that was you?
Action: jcater didn't know nickr was a 13 yr old girl
<derek> you should hook up with her
