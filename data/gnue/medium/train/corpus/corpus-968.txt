<yogurt2unge> hello people I have a problem when I want connect GEAS to Postgres
<reinhard> yogurt2unge: i am here
<reinhard> what is your problem
dtm (dtm@ip22.promontory.sfo.interquest.net) left irc: "brb"
<yogurt2unge> The problem is How to connect to de DB
<yogurt2unge> I created the user in the postgress
<reinhard> yogurt2unge: may i ask what you are planning to do with geas?
<reinhard> use it in production
<reinhard> or play with it
<reinhard> or want to help with development?
<yogurt2unge> I put It is my first time with geas
<reinhard> just to inform you
<reinhard> the geas that is currently in the downloads area
<reinhard> or in cvs
<reinhard> is the "old" incarnation and we have stopped development on that
<reinhard> a complete rewrite from scratch is just about to be started
<reinhard> so i don't want to stop you but i think it could be wasted effort to put time into this "old" geas
<yogurt2unge> Ok, OK, you said that I must download the cvs and try run?
<reinhard> um no
<reinhard> what i wanted to say is
<yogurt2unge> this version "run"? or is to beta?
<reinhard> currently we have no "run" ("production") version of geas
<reinhard> we have that c code we got contributed from a company
<reinhard> which is what you are looking at now
<reinhard> we decided to no longer put efforts into that code
<reinhard> as it's too far away from what we would need
<reinhard> and the rewrite has not yet started
<reinhard> so i guess what i'm saying is
<reinhard> there is no "geas" at the moment
<reinhard> the old has died
<reinhard> the new has not yet been born
<reinhard> but keep your eyes open
<reinhard> the new one will arrive soon :)
<yogurt2unge> Ok, what's "soon" meaning of?
Action: reinhard hides
<reinhard> depends on how many are going to help
<reinhard> currently all of GNU Enterprise is volunteer work
<reinhard> we all do it in our spare time
<yogurt2unge> In this momment my company need to know about any Frameworks to start a project
<yogurt2unge> GNU Enterprise is in focus
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> remember you can use GNU Enterprise in 2-tier and in n-tier mode
<reinhard> 2-tier means forms talks directly to database
<reinhard> this is very usable already
<reinhard> and it _is_ used in production at several places
<reinhard> n-tier means that there is the appserver in between
<yogurt2unge> Yes, It was my first test and based it I made my recomendation
<reinhard> i believe it will be some months until that constellation is usabel in production
<reinhard> however if you and/or your company is willing to help we can speed that up a lot
<reinhard> :)

<reinhard> yogurt2unge: the new incarnation of the application server will be written in python
<reinhard> however python is very easy to learn
<jamest> good day
<reinhard> hey jamest
<reinhard> good morning
<yogurt2unge> Python is very easy, I sow some about it because GNUE is Python

<dneighbo> you cant :)
<dneighbo> actually let me get you a url
<dneighbo> there is some 'precusory' stuff

<dneighbo> if you go to

<hobbes> someone here ?
<reinhard> yes
<hobbes> ok$
<hobbes> I just encountered gnue
<hobbes> most of the docs are real old
<hobbes> my question : is it usable now to manage a small business
<reinhard> hobbes: in a nutshell
<reinhard> gnue is two projects in one
<reinhard> a. create the tools that can be used to build powerful business applications
<reinhard> b. create the powerful business applications themselves
<dneighbo> reinhard really its 3 in 1 :)
<reinhard> we are currently in stage a.
<dneighbo> c. a meta package of GNU that bundles enterprise software for the GNU project :)
<reinhard> dneighbo: ok
<dneighbo> but other than that i agree 100% :)
<reinhard> hobbes: so it all depends what you are wanting to do
<reinhard> if you are looking at a tool that lets you build your own business apps
<reinhard> then you could use gnue for sure
<dneighbo> nutshell, if you are willing to build your own app w/ frame work, what are you waiting for :)
<reinhard> if you are looking for a ready to go accounting package
<dneighbo> if you are wanting to open the box and press the button to have accounting then nope :)
<reinhard> rofl
<dneighbo> DCL and Bayonne are both available and working
<reinhard> at least dneighbo and me agree :)
<hobbes> :-)
Action: reinhard is away: food
<dneighbo> but are not using the framework (this is part c) :) of meta package
<dneighbo> both are getting intergrated into the framework so they are good choices :)
<hobbes> ok, I'm considering creating my small business right now
<hobbes> it would be service to small business for which a full time It staff is not needed
<hobbes> I need accounting, but can do some developpment for it
<hobbes> (I'm not a developper but I know how a relational db system works)
<hobbes> I considered gnucash
<hobbes> but that wouldn't allow me to manage other things (stocks, sales,...)
<hobbes> and encountered gnue
<hobbes> do you think it would be usable with a small investment in development 
<hobbes> or it requires a big investment to be usable ?
<hobbes> (I'd like to use it because I could propose the solution to clients when it's ready)
<hobbes> (clients for which stocks, sales, invoices,... are requisites)
<hobbes> And if ti doesn't work now, approx when will it ?
<hobbes> (1 year, 5 years,...)
<hobbes> ?
<dneighbo> depends
<dneighbo> for example i expect DCL to be ready very soon
<dneighbo> for small business (SERVICE) based consultants
<hobbes> what is DCL ?  :-)))
<dneighbo> like software consultant shops
<dneighbo> dcl.sourceforge.net
<dneighbo> it is like a project management / help desk system
<dneighbo> we are adding strong CRM support into it
<dneighbo> and making it so that the work order side could be used to generate invoices
<dneighbo> i.e. a time entry/crm/billing solution for software consultants (or any service based company)
<dneighbo> it is quite usable today
<drochaid_> WOOOOOO
<hobbes> but now there is no way to do accounting, and it's not expected soon
Nick change: drochaid_ -> drochaid
<drochaid> dneighbo: are you involved with the DCL project?

<jamest> that was old problem on win98 too that we got rid of
<jamest> i think it's safe to say we'd love more
<jamest> help
<jamest> one we get the copyright stuff cleared thru the FSF we can look at getting cvs access setup for you
<btami> nice

<btami> what about reports?
<btami> is there any directions
<btami> or frozen ?

<btami> hungary
<dneighbo> i will give it a few days then call FSF to 'prod' them along if it has not yet arrived
<dneighbo> hobbes that is correct you can not do accounitng out of box today
<hobbes> dneighbo: what level of development is needed ?
<btami> in GNUe?
<hobbes> (I mean : development in gnue, or gnue framework is ready I just have to make my specific apps)
<dneighbo> app developers
<dneighbo> the framework or parts of it are highly usable
<dneighbo> btami as to reports
<dneighbo> the code works
<dneighbo> the biggest hang up is we need to 'define' our tags
<dneighbo> several of us have mentioned some things but no one made a 'proposal'
<dneighbo> once that is done i can do XSLT style sheets against them
<dneighbo> and we will have workign reports :)
<dneighbo> hobbes our framework is designd for BUSINESS ANALYST more thna 'programmers'
<dneighbo> so if you can understand table structures
<dneighbo> and know what you want your app to do
<dneighbo> doing it in GNUe shouldnt be too difficult even for a non 'programmer'
<hobbes> ok thanks, I'll look at it
<btami> dneighbo: can you tell me some words what do you think about 'tags'
<btami> these are about report layout?
<dneighbo> um setup and layout
<dneighbo> so you might hae like
<dneighbo> <title>my foo report</title>
<dneighbo> let me dig up something...
<dneighbo> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/reports.txt
<dneighbo> is something i dummied up when we talked about before in here
<dneighbo> basically that doc isnt what we WANT
<dneighbo> but it helps describe what we are looking for
<dneighbo> im all about starting simple
<dneighbo> and working way into more complex reporting ojbects :)
<btami> I will read
<btami> sometimes I misunderstand things, but if I understand
<btami> I will try a proposal

<dneighbo> i used rescue disk
<chillywilly> doh

<chillywilly> ok
<nickr> derek: noaccel?
<nickr> derek: what kind of card is it again?
<chillywilly> why not?
<dneighbo> noaccel?
<chillywilly> it shouldn't mount it read only
<chillywilly> should be rw
<dneighbo> its a trident/cyberblade i1
<dneighbo> well if i try
<nickr> dneighbo: just a sec
<dneighbo> cp men.good menu.lst
<dneighbo> i get 
Action: chillywilly modified his fstab with the rescue disks before
<dneighbo> cp: cannot create regular file 'menu.lst' : Read-only file system
<chillywilly> like yesterday and shit
<chillywilly> how stupid
<dneighbo> i had this happen before and jamest gave me some brutal mount command (iirc) to fix it
<chillywilly> you did what
<chillywilly> mount /dev/hdX /target ?
<nickr> dneighbo: mount -o remount,rw /
<chillywilly> why is it doing it read only?
<chillywilly> I've never had that happen
<nickr> dneighbo: whats the Driver line in /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 in the Device seciotn
<dneighbo> nickr: give me two seconds trying to reboot
<dneighbo> whoo
<dneighbo> that was close, grub seems to be back in action
<dneighbo> nickr: give me a minute then will paste here the driver info
<dneighbo> iirc
<dneighbo> BoardName "CyberBlade/i1"
<dneighbo> BudID "1:0:0"
<dneighbo> Driver "trident"
<dneighbo> Screen 0
<dneighbo> VendorNAme "Trident"
<dneighbo> where i got that info it said also to add 
<nickr> okay
<dneighbo> Indentifier "Device[0]"
<dneighbo> which didnt work
<nickr> don't worry about that
<dneighbo> so i had to remove it
<chillywilly> everything I have seen says use the fb device
<chillywilly> for that card
<chillywilly> but that is fun to get working isn't it ;)
<nickr> puh Option "NoAccel" "True"
<nickr> in the device section
<nickr> right under driver
<dneighbo> give me a second the reboot barfed on self
<dneighbo> fsck failed
<dneighbo> so trying a manual one and reboot
<dneighbo> man dat was ugly
<nickr> now to figure out what I have that goes wel with vodka
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> if you fix this you want paymentin vodka or us dollars
<nickr> USD, I need to do ltaudry.
<nickr> :)
<chillywilly> bah
<dneighbo> ah
<dneighbo> noaccell freaked it out hard
<nickr> freakid it out!?
<nickr> it should definitely not freak it out
<dneighbo> um scrunched it up and made it blink and go nuts
<chillywilly> because that driver blows dude
<jcater> nickr: given his history
<jcater> freaking out could mean
<dneighbo> in fact it looks almost identical to what happens when you try to toggle between vt's :)
<jcater> "working correctly"
<jcater> :D
<dneighbo> under the driver entry added
<dneighbo> Option "NoAccel" "True"
<dneighbo> thats what you asked for right?
<nickr> yen
<nickr> dneighbo: I'll sell you a rendition card for 20$, problem solved. :)
<dneighbo> pci?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> although I have a nice virge/vx
<nickr> and an MGA
<dneighbo> i uncomment that and it goes back to way it was before
<nickr> hrh
<nickr> thats very strange behavior
<nickr> NoAccell is supposed to make it slow but definietly stable
<dneighbo> two ll's or one
<nickr> one
<nickr> hrm
<chillywilly> read this dude
<chillywilly> talks about you offset pointer problem
<chillywilly> http://www.pairlist.net/pipermail/linux-laptop/2001-November/000314.html
<chillywilly>  had the same problem on a 352Tev. Adding these two lines in the
<chillywilly> XF86Config-4 file in the "Device" section
<chillywilly>        Option "NoAccel"
<chillywilly>        Option "SWCursor"
<nickr> yea.
<dneighbo> so add those two optoins?
<chillywilly> it's amamzing what google will do for you ;)

<nickr> uh oh, sounds like somebody's got a case of the 'mondays'
<chillywilly> that talks about it too
<chillywilly> uh?
<chillywilly> doh that's the same friggin url
Action: chillywilly needs t recopy that
<chillywilly> might want to try this config even
<dneighbo> ok SWCursor
<dneighbo> freaks it out too :(
<chillywilly> http://boreal321.com/vmg/XF86Config
<dneighbo> basically it just throws up a white screen and hangs
<nickr> dneighbo: maybe you have bad hardware, did the card get bent?
<chillywilly> it's onboard
<nickr> get bent, it pays
<chillywilly> they put that thing in a lot of laptops it seems ;)
<nickr> hehe
<dneighbo> nickr: its new hardware (not that it doesnt mean its not bad)
<dneighbo> but its onboard as chilly states so its not real likely that its bent or not 'seated' properly etc :)
<nickr> why did you buy something with the word 'cyber' in it?
<dneighbo> i didnt 
<chillywilly> according to xf4.1.x docs that 'trident' driver is supposed to work with that card
<dneighbo> i bought what i could afford
<dneighbo> chillywilly: thats what i saw too
<dneighbo> but its freaking out
<chillywilly> blech
<nickr> sucks
<nickr> at least its not a SiS
<nickr> this thing is so fucking slow
<nickr> I can't watch dvds on it
Action: chillywilly has an ATI Rage Mobility P/M
<chillywilly> no 3D support yet though :(
<dneighbo> this is supposed to be a 'decent' card from the specs (as on boards go)
Action: nickr has an ati rage pro 128 in his winders box
<nickr> not that that box works
<nickr> currently
jcater (jason@HubA-mcr-24-92-70-39.midsouth.rr.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"

<chillywilly> it's better than a SiS ;)
<nickr> chillywilly: remember that boalrd I broke?
<nickr> chillywilly: do you see an AGP slot on this board? :)
<nickr> thats the board with the SiS on it
<nickr> the AT version of which I'm currently using
<chillywilly> oh
<dneighbo> is it possible lspci -v is giving me back 'bad' info on the card?
<dneighbo> though that chipset seems to support that its trident
<nickr> dneighbo: Not likely.
<chillywilly> nickr: you never used the frame buffer?
<nickr> chillywilly: ?
<chillywilly> I mena do you have experience setting it up
<nickr> chillywilly: my card doesn't seem to work with the sisfb driver
<nickr> oh, yea sure. you just load the correct driver

<chillywilly> man iterfaces
<chillywilly> er, interfaces
<crazymike> fuck man interfaces
<crazymike> i read that thing like 2 times before
<chillywilly> ok, I'll paste mine
<crazymike> and it didn't help me
<chillywilly> # The loopback interface
<chillywilly> #auto lo
<chillywilly> # automatically added when upgrading
<chillywilly> auto lo eth0 ppp0
<chillywilly> iface lo inet loopback
<chillywilly> iface ppp0 inet ppp
<chillywilly>         provider voyager
<chillywilly> iface eth0 inet static
<chillywilly>         address 192.168.1.1
<chillywilly>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike>  iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike> <chillywilly>         address 192.168.1.1
<crazymike> <chillywilly>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike> thats the part I need
<chillywilly> yes
<crazymike> ty
<crazymike> then do I need to take out the part about dhcp???
<chillywilly> yes if you aren't using it anymore
<crazymike> just # that out
<chillywilly> you assgning static IPs now?
<crazymike> then how will I connect to the net???
<crazymike> neverminf
<crazymike> nevermind
<crazymike> no, nevermind the nevermind
<crazymike> it says :
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike>         client dhclient
<chillywilly> yea, you want dhcp if it is dhcp
<crazymike> then I have to do pump -i eth0
<chillywilly> no it should use dhclient for you on boot up
<crazymike> I am setting static IP's
<chillywilly> *if*
<chillywilly> you have eth0 in the 'auto' line
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet ???
<chillywilly> as that specifies what interfaces to bring up on boot
<chillywilly>  iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike> but I don't have dhcp
<crazymike> anymore
<crazymike> right???
<chillywilly> then you want the static one
<chillywilly> I dunno did you change your router fconfig?
<crazymike> i am right now
<chillywilly> ok
<crazymike> doing both at once
<chillywilly> then you can use my previous static example
<crazymike> # /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)
<crazymike> # The loopback interface
<crazymike> # automatically added when upgrading
<crazymike> auto lo
<crazymike> iface lo inet loopback
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike>         client dhclient
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike> thats what I ahve right now
<chillywilly> add eth0 to the 'auto' line
<chillywilly> auto lo eth0
<chillywilly> like that
<crazymike>  auto lo eth0
<chillywilly> ye[
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> er, yep
<crazymike> # /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)
<crazymike> # The loopback interface
<crazymike> # automatically added when upgrading
<crazymike> auto lo eth0
<crazymike> iface lo inet loopback
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike>         client dhclient
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike> so I still want the dhcp part in there or not???
<chillywilly> on
<crazymike> I can edit that out, right
<chillywilly> er, no
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> comment it out
<chillywilly> or remove it
<chillywilly> you can't deifne the same interface twice ;)
<crazymike> #iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike>         client dhclient
<crazymike> just that part, right
<crazymike> the rest stays
<chillywilly> no, both lines
<chillywilly> otherwise it will get confused
<crazymike> oh, I thought that took care of both, hence the tab
<crazymike> but ok
<chillywilly> then you gotta go configure your dad's and sisters box's
<chillywilly> er, sister's box
<crazymike> my sister isn't online
<chillywilly> give them static IPs
<crazymike> she just ahs a computer
<crazymike> s/ahs/has
<chillywilly> well when they want to use it they won't be able to unless you set their shit up
<dneighbo> well i got it to accept SWCursor
<chillywilly> oh, ok
<chillywilly> dneighbo: cool
<dneighbo> copied someone elses X file
<dneighbo> from a NON DEBIAN machine
<dneighbo> i think debconf is loading some modules up front that kill some of the options
<chillywilly> probably
<chillywilly> BUT
<dneighbo> i still cant 'toggle' between vt's with this setup
<chillywilly> you can choose which ones
<dneighbo> but we will see if it fixes the cursor issue
Action: chillywilly thinks this channel should be #debian-support
<dneighbo> if so i can live with it for now until i find some X bad ass that can explain things to me
<dneighbo> tempted to try the no accel now
<chillywilly> maybe I should start my own support channel
<crazymike> lol
<crazymike> you should
<dneighbo> two other things
<chillywilly> gnu-linux-support
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> #gnu-linux-support
<dneighbo> a. it fixed my LARGE font gripe (yeah)
<dneighbo> b. it got rid of the 'flickering'
<dneighbo> if it
<dneighbo> c. fixes cursor
<dneighbo> i will be happy
<dneighbo> then if i can figure out vt
<dneighbo> i will be set :)
<dneighbo> though it appears to still be in 800x600
<dneighbo> NOT cool
<dneighbo> slowly but surely i will get there
<dneighbo> i just need to get it to point where im not getting support calls at work for the 'fscked up mouse'
<crazymike> for packet forwarding, do I ahve to forward the pop3 port or will it still do that automatically, for e-mail???
<chillywilly> dneighbo: what do you think of starting a *good* help channel
<dneighbo> btw: syphleed wont work for my wife :(
<chillywilly> why not?
<chillywilly> crazymike: you will be good
<crazymike> do I only need to set the FTP port
<dneighbo> as it doesnt display html mail fully and doesnt support clicking on email :(
<chillywilly> crazymike: yes
<dneighbo> so installed evolution for her
<crazymike> ok
<dneighbo> will see how it goes
<dneighbo> chillywilly: sounds good to me
<chillywilly> cause it is a 'serever' and will accept incoming requests
<crazymike> I'll brb...got to restart my computer
<crazymike> see if the net still works
<chillywilly> crazymike: you have ip forwarding turned on?
<crazymike> yeah
<chillywilly> (in your router)
<chillywilly> ok
<crazymike> I just set it to forward port 21 to my IP
<chillywilly> you need to forward the ftp port
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> also
<crazymike> then set my IP
<crazymike> and turned off DHCP
<chillywilly> I think you need to forward the data port
<chillywilly> I thin ftp uses 2 ports
<chillywilly> ftp-data  20/tcp
<chillywilly> ftp   21/tcp
<chillywilly> forwrad both of those
<chillywilly> to your IP

<crazymike> forget that last line
<crazymike> that didn;t work
<crazymike> forget all that shit
<chillywilly> crazymike: just see /etc/services ;)

<crazymike> 20, and 21
<chillywilly> uhuh

<chillywilly> wb crazymike
<crazymike> hi
<chillywilly> how goes it?
<crazymike> the internet still works
<chillywilly> can you do an ifconfig and see the interface up?
<crazymike> but I had to type dhclient
<chillywilly> er, did you haev to bring it up manually?
<crazymike> yeah
<chillywilly> blah
<chillywilly> thought you turned dhcp off
<chillywilly> also dude you need to set the router IP as your gateway then if you use static
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> like
<chillywilly> gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
<chillywilly> in the static interface definition part
Action: chillywilly forgot about that
<chillywilly> but seems the thing is still talking dhcp
<crazymike> whats the easiest way to find out my IP
<crazymike> the other one
<chillywilly> ifconfig
<crazymike> I just saw it but don't know where
<chillywilly> er?
<chillywilly> which one?
<crazymike> the house IP
<chillywilly> for the router
<chillywilly> the public IP?
<crazymike> yeah
<crazymike> the public
<chillywilly> crazymike@mke-65-31-133-230.wi.rr.com
<chillywilly> I guess it is 65.31.133.230 ;)
Action: chillywilly pings it
<crazymike> cool, thanks
<chillywilly> you are squashing ICMP packets though
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike>         gateway 65.31.133.230
<chillywilly> no silly
<crazymike> whats that mean
<chillywilly> you need the router's provate IP
<crazymike> oh
<chillywilly> not thw public one
<crazymike> 192.168.1.1
<chillywilly> it make all the hosts on your network look like packets come from that
<crazymike> like that
<chillywilly> then
<chillywilly> it reverses it and delivers stuff back to your orivate IPS
<chillywilly> you dig?
<chillywilly> that's called NAT
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> Network Address Translation
<chillywilly> (ip forwarding)
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike>         gateway 192.168.1.1
<chillywilly> bingo ;)
<chillywilly> did they cover the packet format i your networking class yet?
<chillywilly> like what IP packet headers look like
<chillywilly> (roughly)
<chillywilly> basically it pull the private IP off the packet and slaps on the public one and delivers it
<chillywilly> then it does the reverse
<chillywilly> yanks off the public IP and put the private back on and delivers it locally
<crazymike> kind of

<chillywilly> how goes it?
<crazymike> it goes
<chillywilly> net connection?
<crazymike> yup
<chillywilly> wooooo!
<chillywilly> you da man!
<crazymike> no, you da man, niggie
<chillywilly> sheeeet
<crazymike> Gftp...will that allow me to setup an FTP???
<crazymike> or is it done somewhere else in Linux??
<chillywilly> gftp is a 'client' dude
<chillywilly> you need to install an ftp server
<chillywilly> (daemon)
<crazymike> well, alot of the clients for Windows, serve dual purpose
<crazymike> client/server
<crazymike> not alot but some, I should say
<chillywilly> well gftp is only a client
<chillywilly> as is ncftp
<crazymike> thats what I was asking
<chillywilly> althought there is ncftpd
<chillywilly> which is a server
<dneighbo> ok have tools now i need to work for an hour or so i guess :)
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> crazymike: okey dokey smokey
<chillywilly> crazymike: I;m not sure what the best ftp server is to use
<crazymike> wu-ftpd
<chillywilly> sure
<chillywilly> that'll work
<nickr> I should hook up the subwoofer and play tnhe THX sound as loud as it goes
<chillywilly> heheh
<crazymike> my book says that is the most popular :)
<chillywilly> there's also proftpd
<chillywilly> or just plain ftpd
<crazymike> I am getting wu=ftpd right now
<crazymike> it says ftpd sucks
<chillywilly> wuftp has a config program
<chillywilly> well a couple actually
<chillywilly> kwuftpd - wu-ftpd configuration tool
<chillywilly> webmin-wuftpd - wu-ftpd control module for webmin
<chillywilly> or you can be a real hacker and read your book and edit the files with vi
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> (or emacs)
<nickr> wuftpd? sacre vache!
<chillywilly> what's good nickr?
<nickr> hrm
<chillywilly> proftpd?
<chillywilly> ftpd suposedly blows goats
<chillywilly> er, supposedly
<nickr> well it depends on what you want
<chillywilly> he wants to run anon ftp off his computer to server up gufs shows
<chillywilly> etc.
<chillywilly> off his cable modem
<nickr> um gnutella?
<nickr> :)
<chillywilly> er, no
<chillywilly> woah
<chillywilly> there's a shit load of ftp servers
<dneighbo> um why run ftp?
<nickr> how about ..
<nickr> um
<chillywilly> crazymike: do apt-cache search ftpd
<nickr> muddleftp!
<nickr> lukemftp!
<dneighbo> why not use http?
<chillywilly> dneighbo: what should he run?
<nickr> +d
<dneighbo> http
<dneighbo> or
<dneighbo> scp
<nickr> vsftpd!
<dneighbo> if need anonymous file transfer use http
<chillywilly> it's for anonymous downloads
<nickr> http is much better for just downloady shit
<dneighbo> if you need authenticated use scp
<chillywilly> http is not as good as ftp
<nickr> just get freaking gn
<chillywilly> gn?
<dneighbo> just ftp is one more security hole
<nickr> chillywilly: based on what criteria?
<dneighbo> easier to just use http
<dneighbo> also almost everyone has a browser
<dneighbo> not everyone an ftp client
<nickr> chillywilly: its faster, lighter weight, can go though hostile firewalls, requires no authentication or dangerous trickery
<nickr> chillywilly: its universally supported
<chillywilly> http can't go through a firewall any better
<dneighbo> i would say if you merely want anon ftp dont use ftp :)
<dneighbo> use http
<dneighbo> chillywilly: sure it can
<chillywilly> you still have to open the http port
<dneighbo> at my work port 80 is open
<dneighbo> port 21 is not
<chillywilly> well whatever
<chillywilly> he wanted to run ftp
<dneighbo> just saying ftp is a liabilty
<nickr> for just downloads there are a lot of compelling reasons to use http over ftp
<dneighbo> and personally i would avoid unless some good reason (like legacy application or some special need)
<dneighbo> chillywilly: hell i bet you get your debs via http instead of ftp ;)
<chillywilly> well I know it's a potential security hole
<chillywilly> indeed I do
<chillywilly> crazymike: maybe you should setup apache ;)
<chillywilly> so these guys will shutup
<chillywilly> ;p
<crazymike> ummm...ok
<nickr> ne
<nickr> no
<crazymike> I don't care as long as it works
<nickr> apache is complicated and easy to break
<chillywilly> oh plz
<crazymike> and I don't know shit except what you guys tell me to do :)
<chillywilly> the default config is fine
Action: crazymike is stupid!!!
<nickr> try boa
<chillywilly> you setup apache
<chillywilly> put the files in /var/www/
<chillywilly> bingo bango
<chillywilly> you're done
<nickr> or thttpe
<nickr> thttpe
<chillywilly> no, apache
<nickr> thttpd
<nickr> damnit
<nickr> or wn
<chillywilly> piss on those other ones
<nickr> wn is really good, you just have to generate explicit indexes
<chillywilly> crazymike: apt-get isntall apache
<chillywilly> er, install
Action: crazymike ducks under the punches everyone is throwing at each other
<nickr> chillywilly: wtf is with you an apache? are you like getting excellent oral sex from it or something?
<crazymike> so should I get it or not???
<crazymike> AHAHAHAHAHA
<chillywilly> hell yea and you're a jealous little bitch nickr
<nickr> crazymike: get boa
<chillywilly> crazymike: get apache
Action: crazymike cries
<chillywilly> crazymike: who's going to help you out eh?
<crazymike> chillywilly: thats true
<chillywilly> who's your bro eh?
<chillywilly> don;t listen to this little chuckle head
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> that was a funny exchange
<dneighbo> <nickr> chillywilly: wtf is with you an apache? are you like getting excellent oral sex from it or something?
Action: crazymike is apt-getting some shit
<dneighbo> has got to be the quote of the nite
Action: nickr boms
<nickr> bows
Action: chillywilly thought his response to that was better
<chillywilly> [23:27:22] <chillywilly> hell yea and you're a jealous little bitch nickr
<dneighbo> chillywilly: mind tell me the source-list for that ;oral sex; apache?
<chillywilly> no
<dneighbo> dick
<chillywilly> punk
<dneighbo> i thought the freudian slip you made good too
<crazymike> apt-get install apache-oralpleasure

<crazymike> chillywilly: how do I set this bitch up
<chillywilly> umm did it start it up?
<nickr> derek: 'when #debian won't cut it ... which is always'
<chillywilly> you just need to copy files to /var/www and they need to have proper permissions (chmod 644 should be good enough)
<crazymike> it installed (i think) but nothing started up
<derek> nickr: i was trying to be polite :)
<chillywilly> /etc/init.d/apache start
<crazymike> i don't have that much space on this drive for that shit
<derek> the topic inthere when i was trying to get help tonight
<derek> was
<chillywilly> crazymike: make a symlink then
<derek> 'i wish apt could apt-grow weed'
<derek> or something like that
<crazymike> it says it is already started, I guess
<chillywilly> cd /var
<crazymike> I dunno
<chillywilly> mv www www.old
<nickr> derek: that would be a time saver
<chillywilly> ln -s /wgere/Igots/my/shiznit/at www
<chillywilly> cd ..
<chillywilly> chmod 755 www
<crazymike>  ln -s /wgere/Igots/my/shiznit/at www
<chillywilly> cd www
<crazymike> lol
<chillywilly> chmod 644 *
<chillywilly> then I would get a dyndns.org host name
<chillywilly> and set it up
<crazymike> where do I put the link though
<chillywilly> cd /var
<crazymike> in www
<crazymike> just in cd /var
<crazymike> ???
<chillywilly> no in /var

<derek> Q:WHY DOES THE EASTER BUNNY HIDE HIS EGGS?

<crazymike> i just need a dynamic right
<crazymike> nevermind
<chillywilly> er, I mean a real domain name
<chillywilly> like crazymike.mofo.org
<crazymike> Use of the MyDynDNS Custom DNS service requires a donation of $30 for each domain you wish to use
<crazymike> what the fuck is that???
<chillywilly> that's for 'custom'
<chillywilly> afaik
<crazymike> so, how is yours then???
<crazymike> if it isn't chillywilly.mofo.org
<chillywilly> it is the free shit wehre you pick
<chillywilly> hostname.dyndns.org
<crazymike> oh, thats it, ok
<chillywilly> dynamic dns
<crazymike> wtf
<crazymike> ahhhhh
<chillywilly> not static dns
<crazymike> fuck their site
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> maybe they started charging a one time fee
Action: chillywilly doesn't have to pay thogh
<crazymike> i signed up...they will e-mail me now
<crazymike> in a sec I guess
<chillywilly> gah
<chillywilly> really?
<chillywilly> and it is free?
<chillywilly> oh my bad
<chillywilly> custom != dynamic
<crazymike> it is free

<chillywilly> how does that have anythign to do with oral sex?
<chillywilly> maybe you just need to get over you homophobic tendencies

<nickr> yow
<nickr> :(
<nickr> I want some chilly
<chillywilly> crazymike: yup need to put that script in a place where it will execute stiff right after it brings the network interface up
<chillywilly> ummm actually....
<crazymike> I can't find the shit it installed
<chillywilly> how are yoi going to do that
<chillywilly> I havemy server box do it becasue I update my hostnames with the public IP
<chillywilly> I dunno how you can have your router do that
Action: chillywilly ponders some more
<chillywilly> crazymike: use find ;)
<crazymike> i tried
<chillywilly> and?
ithompson (~ianathomp@lsanca1-ar27-4-63-187-185.lsanca1.vz.dsl.gtei.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> do this
<crazymike> find -name ipcheck
<chillywilly> look for ipcheck.py
<chillywilly> find / -name ipcheck.py
<chillywilly> find / -name ipcheck.py -print
<crazymike> got it
<chillywilly> where did it put it?
<crazymike> /usr/sbin
<chillywilly> dude
<chillywilly> which ipcheck.py also works for executables
<chillywilly> it works for finding any executable
<chillywilly> (mostly)
<chillywilly> or 'whereis ipcheck.py'
<chillywilly> man which
<chillywilly> man whereis
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> manwhich
<chillywilly> ;P
<crazymike> Example 2: you are using the Linksys routing device
<crazymike> python ipcheck.py -l -L linksyspassword username password hostnames
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> you can have it use your router
<crazymike> username password hostnames for what???
<chillywilly> for your setup
<crazymike> my computer, my router
<crazymike> ???
<chillywilly> once you get a dydns.org account
<crazymike> i did get one
<crazymike> ohhh
<chillywilly> your dyndns.org account that allows you to update the host name
<crazymike> that username and shit
<chillywilly> your hostname(s)
<chillywilly> yep
<crazymike> crazymike@dyndns.org
<crazymike> :)
<chillywilly> that's not your account and username
<crazymike> i know
<chillywilly> just one of your hostnames
<crazymike> thats a hostname
<chillywilly> yep
<crazymike> Problems looking up hostname crazymike@dyndns.org
<crazymike> damn it
<chillywilly> it shouldn't be '@'
<chillywilly> should be
<chillywilly> crazymike.dyndns.org
<crazymike> ahhh
<crazymike> duh
<crazymike> I am a fucking idiot
<chillywilly> nah
<chillywilly> we should go to bed
<chillywilly> byw
<chillywilly> what you need to do now is
<chillywilly> up a script in
<chillywilly> /etc/network/if-up.d$
<chillywilly> that calls ipcheck.py
<chillywilly> so when the interface comesup
<chillywilly> it updates the dns entry
<chillywilly> automagically
<nickr> automagicr
<nickr> I'm starving.
<chillywilly> #!/bin/sh
<chillywilly> # cat /etc/hosts-up | sed -e s/--IP--/$PPP_LOCAL/g > /etc/hosts
<chillywilly> ipcheck.py -d /etc -i ppp0 --syslog --acctfile /etc/ipcheck.acct
<chillywilly> in /etc/ipcheck.acct I have my username and password for dyndns.org account
<chillywilly> er, -i eth0 for you
<crazymike> what's all that hsit
<crazymike> shit
<chillywilly> lets you update the host enrty automagically
<chillywilly> entry
<crazymike> I am supposed to put some shit in /etc/network/if-up.d
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> a script
<crazymike> all that that you typed???
<chillywilly> vi dyndns.org
<crazymike> or whats that
<chillywilly> enter that line
<chillywilly> line(s)
<chillywilly> #!/bin/sh
<chillywilly> [00:09:13] <chillywilly> # cat /etc/hosts-up | sed -e s/--IP--/$PPP_LOCAL/g > /etc/hosts
<chillywilly> [00:09:13] <chillywilly> ipcheck.py -d /etc -i ppp0 --syslog --acctfile /etc/ipcheck.acct
<chillywilly> [00:09:39] <chillywilly> in /etc/ipcheck.acct I have my username and password for dyndns.org account
<chillywilly> seee how it calls ipcheck.py?
<chillywilly> uses an 'account' file
<crazymike> it says it isn't midifiable
<crazymike> modifiable
<chillywilly> you root?
<crazymike> yeah
<chillywilly> you should just install ssh
<chillywilly> and opne the port ;)
<chillywilly> er,open
<chillywilly> create an account for me ;)
<chillywilly> I'll log i your box and hook you up
<chillywilly> then I can go tobed
<chillywilly> ;P
<crazymike> I have ssh
<chillywilly> do you have sshd running?
<crazymike> I dunno, but it is on my system
<chillywilly> you need to open and forward the port
<chillywilly> port 22
<chillywilly> btw, you should pick better passwords for root and yourself if you're going to open your box up to the world
<chillywilly> (running apache and ssh
<chillywilly> )
<crazymike> yeah
<crazymike> I need to do that
<crazymike> when you put in http://crazymike.dyndns.org in galeon it goes to my router setup
<crazymike> well, if you have the password
<crazymike> but that isn't right
<chillywilly> woah
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<chillywilly> yea, your router is a web server
<chillywilly> it has one it it to configure it...
<crazymike> try it
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> we'll need to work around that
<crazymike> but that is 192.168.1.1
<crazymike> that doesn't make sense
<crazymike> I didn't forward the shit to that
<crazymike> I dunno
<crazymike> so what do I need to do to set up ssh
<chillywilly> just
<chillywilly> apt-get install ssh
<chillywilly> then open and forward port 22
<crazymike> i did that
<chillywilly> btw, I cannto access your box form the outside
<chillywilly> on port 80
<crazymike> I forwarded 22
<crazymike> no???
<crazymike> do I need to reboot???
<chillywilly> your firewall must still be blocking
<crazymike> probably
<chillywilly> you shouldn't
<chillywilly> brb
<chillywilly> gotta piss
<crazymike> I don't ahve a firewall, the router is the firewall
<chillywilly> yes which means tyou have a firewall
<chillywilly> jsut because it is hardware doesn't mean you don't have one ;)
<crazymike> yeah, but forwarding the ports should open that
<crazymike> shouldn't it
<chillywilly> no
<crazymike> i don't see anything to open tehm
<crazymike> them
<chillywilly> forwarding has to do with routing
<chillywilly> (NAT stuiff again(
<chillywilly> a firewall block connections to various ports
<chillywilly> (i.e., packet filtering)
<crazymike> I know that
<crazymike> i need to filter???
<chillywilly> you need to stop dropping http packets ;)
<chillywilly> (port 80)
<chillywilly> you can;t turn it off anywhere?
<crazymike> i don't see anything for opening ports
<chillywilly> there's no firewall config that says what is allowed?
<chillywilly> damn and you have school tomorrow
<crazymike> there is filtering, forwarding, dynamic routing, static routing, DMZ Host
<chillywilly> go to filtering
<crazymike> damn, it still said DHCP was enabled...I disabled it
<chillywilly> blah
<chillywilly> give that thing a kick ;)
<crazymike> ok...I am at filtering
<crazymike> Filters enable you to prevent certain PCs on your network from accessing your Internet connection.
<crazymike> In order to use this feature, DHCP must be disabled on the router.
<chillywilly> you only want to filter the outside interface
<chillywilly> (public IP for the router)
<crazymike> nothing is listed on the filter list
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> well dude I think that's going to have to be something I come over and look at with you as I am not familiar with using a hardware router
<crazymike> thats an internal filtering thing
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> hmmm
reinhard (~rm@62.47.45.2) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> why the hell would you want to filter hosts on the internal network
<chillywilly> hey reinhard
<reinhard> mornin
<chillywilly> only for you ;)
<chillywilly> Tue Mar 12 00:28:05 CST 2002
<chillywilly> crazymike: you can't see anyway to control outside access to the router?
<chillywilly> dude
<crazymike> nope
<crazymike> reading this manual for the router it seems that forwarding it should open it
<chillywilly> Enable DMZ : Yes  No
<chillywilly> Multiple PCs can be exposed to the Internet for two-way communication, e.g. Internet gaming, video conferencing, or as VPN server / Clients. To use the DMZ, you must set a static IP address for a DMZ PC and set that PC to use the selected IP address.
<chillywilly> go to DMZ host
<crazymike> ok\
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> hmmm
<crazymike> it just asks for an IP
<crazymike> This feature sets a local user to be exposed to the Internet. Any user on the Internet can access in/out data from the DMZ host. Enable the feature as you wish to use special-purpose service.
<crazymike> that may be it, hey
<chillywilly> then you csan make your linus box filter the packets and forward ports...
<chillywilly> but that sound like a strange hack
<chillywilly> sorta makes your router obsolete then ;)
<crazymike> I dunno
<crazymike> naw, cause then I would need another nic card
<crazymike> :)

<Arturas> Could someone please explain me one English sentence (found it in documentation, so it sounds very officially and i don't understand it perfectly :(  )
<Arturas> "In this release, wxString only supports contruction from a unicode string, but in net one it will be capable of also stpring it's internal data in either ASCII or unicode."
<Arturas> sorry: net => next
<jamest_> i think they are saying that the current wxString can only store unicode data but after the next release of wxwindows the wxstring will be able to store either unicode data or ascii data

<yogurt2unge> I'm starting with forms and designer and I have a dude, exist any element to see a relationship 1:n? 
<yogurt2unge> When I worked in NEXTSTEP, I had a browse object that I can connect with the output of the SQL query
<dneighbo> ?
<dneighbo> you have a 'dude'?
<dneighbo> im here to help but not sure i understand what you are asking :)
<yogurt2unge> Ok, my english is very bad
<chillywilly> hey dudes
<chillywilly> wheich file has that generic function that loads db drivers?
<dneighbo> chillywilly ?
<chillywilly> I looked in the common code a while back
<chillywilly> there ws a function that did the per directory loading of the db drivers
<dneighbo> yogurt2unge im not familiar w/ NEXTSTEP
<chillywilly> which is also reused in gnurpc
<chillywilly> and loads the commdrivers
<chillywilly> IIRC
Action: chillywilly is responding to reinhard's draft API mail to gnue-dev
<chillywilly> i think this same code should be used to load authentication modules in the security subsystem
<chillywilly> to support more then one form of authentication
<chillywilly> another pluggable arhitecture
<yogurt2unge> dneighbo: Have I a element in forms to see all output a sql query, or a relationship 1:n?
<dneighbo> chillywilly ah sorry was thinking something diff (use the source luke)
<dneighbo> yogurt2unge i still am not sure i understand
<yogurt2unge> dneighbo: Any element like a browser element, in JAVA is jtable
<dneighbo> can you open designer?
<yogurt2unge> ok
<yogurt2unge> I have a designer open
<yogurt2unge> I have a designer opened
<jamest_> chillywilly: the code you are looking for is the dyn_import function
<chillywilly> yes!
<jamest_> in common/src/__init__.py
<chillywilly> thanks dude
<jamest_> it's also used to load UI drivers in forms
<chillywilly> uhuh
<chillywilly> it's just a nice utility
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> which should be used
<dneighbo> yogurt2unge in designer there is menu choice 'window'
<dneighbo> under it are options
<dneighbo> 'object navigator'
<dneighbo> 'data source editor'
<dneighbo> 'schema navigator'
<dneighbo> object navigator gives you a 'tree view' of all objects on a form
<dneighbo> and lets you launch a property editor for each object
<dneighbo> schema navigator lets you look at a database
<dneighbo> get a list of tables
<dneighbo> select a table and get a list of fields with data types etc
<yogurt2unge> Wait the minute please
<dneighbo> datasource editor is kind of inbetween
<dneighbo> im not sure if this what you are looking for or not
<dneighbo> you say SQL but im not sure if you mean the actual SQL statements or the 'uderlying table definitions'
<yogurt2unge> Ok, I see some choise, but ...
<yogurt2unge> I don't see a control object to show a table items
<yogurt2unge> dneighbo: I want to show some items a table, and the user must browse and choose one  
<yogurt2unge> dneighbo: do you undestand me?
<chillywilly> dneighbo: how do you run ispell on your emacs buffer?
<chillywilly> s/your/an
<yogurt2unge> chillywilly: use spell-buffer o spell-region
<chillywilly> what command though?
<yogurt2unge> I'm using M-x spell-buffer
<chillywilly> ok
<dneighbo> i dont understand yogurt2unge 
<dneighbo> when you say user do you mean developer
<dneighbo> or in forms itself
<dneighbo> maybe you mean a 'filter'
<dneighbo> if you are talking forms
<dneighbo> we dont have a 'lookup' widget done yet
<dneighbo> but you can do inline filtering
<yogurt2unge> dneighbo: Ok, be patient
<dneighbo> what is your native language?
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> M-x ispell seems to work fine ;)

<chillywilly> we are geeks
<chillywilly> this is a programming project
<chillywilly> my mind automatically thinks of a 'programming' langauge
<nickr> okay, but also note that java is the name of the unspeakable programming language that no one here likes, uses or even mentions because if you say its name three times it'll come and mess up all your software development process
<chillywilly> yes, we all loathe it here
<nickr> did I mention that its unspeakable?
<chillywilly> and you said 'ugh'
<chillywilly> so you see why I would think that?

<dtm> so how do you deal with .zip now
<nickr> no, this is the list on my other computer which is crufted from a long time ago.
<chillywilly> there's Free versions of zip and unzip now
Action: chillywilly uses them
<dtm> i do have a very tight mix of proprietary vs. open/free software
<nickr> unzip non-US is free
<dtm> where i prefer the open/free anywhere it works
<nickr> appearently
<dtm> and i do so the instant i find it
<chillywilly> BSD licensed
<dtm> like for example i play divx movies on macos10 using Quicktime Player and GPL'd Quicktime components
<dtm> and i run the Aquified Mozilla on os10
<nickr> heh. bleh, macosx
<dtm> and vnc
<chillywilly> gstreamer will rock
Action: chillywilly should download 0.3.3 releae and try the player
<chillywilly> er, release
<dtm> yeah but i'm using the core standards and implementations...  once the free apps mature enough , they'll be using this same core anyway
<chillywilly> dude there's no movies I cannot play
Action: chillywilly uses mplayer
<dtm> but i have a powerbook andi use it for powerbooky things like sleeping, multiple displays (lcd, crt, ntsc) which can't be normally done with linux
<nickr> apple is the epitome of a sleezy, evil company
<dtm> nickr: no it is not.  get over it :)
<nickr> Yes, it is
<chillywilly> sure it is
<dtm> you guys have a fanatical perspective on that
<chillywilly> they even price their shit so poor people cannot buy it
<nickr> I consider them more evil than Microsoft
<dtm> nickr: well then you're nuts!  :)
<dtm> ;)
<dtm> heheh
<nickr> Microsoft is a bumbling evil giant
<dtm> they're not even in the same ballpark
<nickr> Apple is a slick little evil worm
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> the worm in the 'apple'
<chillywilly> ;P
<dtm> they're nothing like that.
<chillywilly> oh please
<dtm> lots of poor people have macs
drochaid (~drochaid@pc2-kirk2-0-cust175.ren.cable.ntl.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<nickr> oh god
<dtm> i've almost always had macs because they hold their value for at least 10 yrs
<nickr> they love that 'hippy' image
<drochaid> you called nickr?
<nickr> but its so fake
<dtm> my house is stocked with > 10yr old macs 
<chillywilly> dtm: you yourself expressed the frustration of tryin to get GNU.Linux running good ontheir hadware and the disfunctionality of apple Linux people
<dtm> nickr: well somehow you've convinced yourself that you know something about apple's culture but you're mistaken
<dtm> chillywilly: yeah and your summary of it is wrong.
<chillywilly> and the fighting you had to do with them
<dtm> chillywilly: it has _NOTHING_ to do with apple hardware
<chillywilly> exactly
<chillywilly> it has to do with their politics
<chillywilly> which is the whole point
<dtm> no it has nothing to do with apple at all; it has to do with having a laptop.
<nickr> dtm: I think I'm correct based on a lifetime of experience with them and the people that use them.
<dtm> which has very advanced features
<chillywilly> bah, lemme go talk to Jeff Carr and see what he thinks of Apple as a company ;)
<dtm> there are a handful of laptops whose free drivers can do all that functionality
<dtm> chillywilly: jeff's not the most objective person on that
<chillywilly> oh so we should only talk to people who did not have to fight tooth and nail with Apple
<dtm> nickr: so does everyone else who has irrational biases
<chillywilly> how objective of us
<dtm> chillywilly: ok well you're in 6 yr old bipolar mode again, so i'm gonna go get some dog food!
<dtm> :)
<chillywilly> nice
<chillywilly> resort to insults
<nickr> dtm: yes, its very easy to dismiss my opinions as irrational bias.
<dtm> chillywilly: that's my attempt to neutralize your stupid insults  :)
Action: chillywilly thinks all prop. software is the 'enemy'
<dtm> chillywilly: that's your basis of communication in generalizing stuff that you dont understnad but which you're convinced you disllike
<nickr> I obviously disagree with chillywilly 
<chillywilly> dtm: when did I insult you in this Apple discussion?
<dtm> chillywilly: that adversarial perspective is what polarizes your perspective
<dtm> chillywilly: and is why you're unable to have clear rational discussions about this type of stuff
<chillywilly> they are conterproductive to our goals
<chillywilly> dtm: wrong
<chillywilly> I can discuss this just fine
<dtm> chillywilly: you insulted a culture i'm loosely associated with and which we all benefit tremendously from.
<dtm> chillywilly: and you made blanketing and negative generalizations about my personal background as applied to your polarized viewpoint
<chillywilly> they're not all evil...in fact they have been doing some good by basing things on OS X
<dtm> regarding my experience with the ppc linux community
<chillywilly> er, freebsd
<chillywilly> wlel I thought that was your point
<chillywilly> when you sadi the things you said
<chillywilly> that Apple has always been a shit to you guys
<dtm> chillywilly: the point is that nobody's perfect and their good far outweighs their bad.  they do have a clear moral imperative to improve in a win/win way.  they have never been the enemy except in _certain_ ways for a period of time when they had idiot leadership like Scully.
<dtm> chillywilly: and even then, that was only _part_ of their culture
<dtm> chillywilly: no, apple has not always been bad to us!  there are negative side effects to the fact that they're a large corp, but almost nothing they do would be possible otherwise.
<dtm> to use a euphemistic cliche it's like a necessary evil
<dtm> not really but one can get the point
<dtm> they have the highest quality, most open standard hardware and software in the industry
<chillywilly> well you think long and hard about how we should treat each other and you tell me if not releasing code basd on profit motives is how people should live
<dtm> it has the lowest TCO and lowest direct price for its value (not always sticker price) of any name brand
<chillywilly> I just don't see it my friend, there has to be a better way
<dtm> if you compare their products directly, feature-per-feature, to the competition, they almost always come out ahead on price, quality, and value
<dtm> chillywilly: if you're going to judge a non-essential minority of the behavior of a global corporation in such a moral way (where morals have no direct application), then another person should get to judge the GNU community based on how they talk and tear each other down and that RMS dresses funny.
<dtm> and that's all wrong
<dtm> none of it is representative of what's really going on
<dtm> they _have_ to withhold some things
<chillywilly> I don't care about 'practicalities', all things break in time all material things become dust after a while
<nickr> chillywilly: thats sort of a defeatist argumest.
<dtm> and tha'ts why your perspecitve is so polarized and adversarial
<dtm> that perspective cannot work
<chillywilly> when I am old and my children look to me all that is ever going to matter is if I loved them
<nickr> chillywilly: by that token we should abandon all this shit. :)
<chillywilly> no, it's the reasons behind it that matter
<chillywilly> not the thing in itself
Action: chillywilly is away: I'm busy
<dtm> a lot of gnu's culture is based on negative reinforcement.  of tearing down or repelling from something else.  that's what provides most moral/ethical motivation in the world  :/
<dtm> fighting.
<dtm> that's just not quite as necessary so often in the information age
<dtm> it's much more flexible now

<dtm> i know that people who haven't worked extensively in a corporate environment, or who haven't set one up themselves, dont appreciate the extreme hard nosed practicality which is often required

<chillywilly> and then someone said that they thought not because of our comment on compatibility

<jcater> hey, guys
<jcater> is this a good response?
<jcater> ------------------
<jcater> There are in effect two different projects at work here. The first one is a database-backed application framework. Several of us are using the Forms and Designer components in a production (or commercial) environment in 2-tier mode (i.e., the client talks directly to the database and doesn't delegate any logic to an application server middleware). The Application Server (GEAS) is being reworked and is not, to my knowledge, used in
<jcater> ction environment. When you see comments about not preserving backwards compatability, they are referring to GEAS. 
<jcater> The second part, actual business applications (such as financials, supply chain management, etc) are still in the planning stages and are awaiting a working application server. 
<chillywilly> dtm: listen to your own advice
<jcater> So, to answer your question, yes, parts of it are being used in production. I use custom forms (designed inhouse) that connect to my Oracle database to run parts of our callcenter and warehouse. 
<jcater> Come check us out.
<jcater> ------------------
<nickr> dtm: Its not unified under any standard yet. The only real defacto standards are producing postscript and gfiving it to lpr
<crazymike> woohoo, I am registered now
<Scott> derek: in answer to your question, I'm this guy: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x7A34FADE
<nickr> dtm: lots of things provide boths sides of that interface
<chillywilly> jcater: nice response sir
<jamest> jcater: works for me
<nickr> jcater: sounds pretty good.
<chillywilly> you forgot
<chillywilly> fod
<chillywilly> (fuck off and die)
<nickr> gimme power over people in a palace with a perminant guard
<dtm> uh oh   if there was a linuxtoday article about gnue today, then we'd better behave ourselves
<dtm> someone might be watching
<chillywilly> eh
<jamest> sigh
<chillywilly> psu knows what to edit out
<jamest> looks like we'd better ban most the losers that hang out here
<jamest> including ourselves
<Scott> jamest: specially ourselves
<jamest> don't want to give the wrong impression
<chillywilly> hellz yea
Action: chillywilly refereshes the talkbacks
<chillywilly> damnit
#gnuenterprise: mode change '+o jamest' by ChanServ!ChanServ@services.
<chillywilly> I hate keyboards
<derek> i submitted two responses as well
<jamest> ok, whos first
<jamest> :)
<nickr> ring the bells, tell everyone, revolution can be fun
<derek> though for clarification ( i suppose we should document this better)
<chillywilly> hmmm, no jcater response yet
<derek> gnue is three things :)
<jcater> chillywilly: comment on what?
<derek> 1. a gnu meta package bundling gnu project packages that are enterprise related
<chillywilly> duh, LT
<jamest> 1) a time sink
<derek> 2. an application framework
<derek> 3. applications built using the framework 
<jamest> 2) slower than a lethargic sloth on nitol
<chillywilly> 1)  a place for masochistic trout lovers
<nickr> derek: is there a whatis section on the wesite?
<derek> Scott: yuo are public key?
<chillywilly> 2) a place for hot goats sex
<derek> ;)
<jamest> 3) responcible for shaving a full 10 years off my life
<chillywilly> 3) the beasting are free
<chillywilly> er, beatings
<jcater> chillywilly: it has to go thru moderation first
<chillywilly> uhuh
<Scott> derek: it's the best I can tell you :)
<jcater> jamest: only 10?
<jcater> I feel shorted then
<jamest> only 10
<jamest> for now
Action: nickr adds shave more years off jamest's life to his todo list.
<derek> nickr: http://www.gnuenterprise.org/sections.php?op=viewarticle&artid=24
<derek> What is GNUe?
<jamest> anyone feel like I should not commit the new interbase driver patches from Bajusz Tams
<derek> is first thing on the left corner of the webpage
<derek> jamest: we have assignment?
<nickr> ...
Action: chillywilly adds troutslap() to the geas v2 api
<nickr> maybe that should be right in the middle on the frontpage
<jamest> we have submitted paperwork
<derek> nickr: if only the 'blink' tag wasnt banned
<derek>  :)
<jamest> but no completed assignment
<nickr> <span style="font-size: 10em">Eh! What the frig is this shit?</span>
<jamest> the entire file after patching is 257 lines of code
<derek> its segregated enough i dont see a problem
<derek> if for some reason the paperwork never comes we simply remove the code
<jamest> and it now adds interbase support for forms and designer
<jamest> Bajusz Tams wants to become a gnue developer
<nickr> 10em font would be like half a screen high or so.
<jamest> wants to become a gnue developer
<chillywilly> troutslap() - use this function when people get out of line in #gnuenterprise or when you really need to get your point accross
<jamest> and work on reports
<nickr> chillywilly: dude, thats so lame.
<jamest> so he has started the paperwork trail
<chillywilly> nickr: like your mother
<jcater> Q: What is GNUe
<chillywilly> anyway....
<nickr> chillywilly: my mother is lame, whats your point?
<jcater> A: You don't know? well, hell, now we'll never find out
<jamest> jcater: :)
<nickr> chillywilly: she can't help it that she broke her leg when she leaped from the car she was kidnapped in
<chillywilly> nickr: uh, that too much information
<jamest> wow
<jamest> a GNUe commit
<chillywilly> nickr: why do you constantly redicule me?  you sick fuck
<jcater> wow
<jcater> cool 
<jcater> it;s been a week or so
<jamest> lets hope the cogs aren't to rusty and she makes it thru
<nickr> chillywilly: because you're an easy target
<Scott> 1 question, how easy is to make a test install of gnue tech?
<Scott> right now :)
<chillywilly> nickr: I just think your pissed off because I told you i don;t swing that way
<chillywilly> you cock smoker
<jamest> what platform
<jamest> ?
<jamest> Scott: what platform?
<nickr> chillywilly: but my sister is very attractive, you should go for her. I know you only like little boys.. I was just trying to help you out.
<Scott> jamest: intel, redhat gnu/linux
<Scott> 7.2
<jamest> you ok w/ CVS code?
Nick change: crazymike -> crazymike_away
<Scott> jamest: I am experienced with cvs.
<jamest> I'd d/l the latest cvs then in the top level dir run a 
<nickr> still no talkback
<Scott> jamest: it's just that I don't have a lot of time right now, so I wanted to give it a test run :)
<Scott> jamest: ok :)
<jamest> python setup-cvs.py
<chillywilly> nickr: let's see....you're single, you live in NY, you watch broadway plays....who's the homo?
<jamest> that will setup a developers install
<Scott> jamest: ok.
<jamest> we're still a bit of a bugger as far as dependencies :(
<jamest> and IIRC there was a RH 7.2 how to posted to the site a while back
<nickr> chillywilly: thats harsh man.
<jcater> dang
<jcater> 5 feedbacks now
<nickr> chillywilly: I mean, my gf left *yesterday*
<Scott> jamest: is it safe to use python 1.5.x?
<nickr> stone cold.
<jamest> Scott: nope
<Scott> jamest: probably. I just looked around the faq (and the neat top 10 questions)
<chillywilly> who the heck is rufus?
<jamest> 1.5.x isn't supported , we had too many things that were causing troubles in 1.5.2 so we jumped to 2.0 thinking the distros would be there by the time we were ready
<nickr> the guy from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure?
<Scott> jamest: that's worse. because of security on workplace we try very hard to avoid installing software that isn't signed by a known somewhat trusted key)
<Scott> jamest: rh8 will include it I think.
<jcater> Scott: python 2.0 is on the RedHat 7.x CDs
<jamest> I don't think anyone would trust us though
<jcater> it may not be installed by default
<jcater> but it is an option
<Scott> jcater: it is? I didn't notice. there's not many things I run that use python...
<Scott> jcater: that's good news.
<jamest> but people need to realize that derek is our only target of agression
<jcater> I no longer use RedHat
<Scott> jcater: that way, the risk will only be on gnue :)
<jcater> but I did use 7.1 and it was included
<jcater> gnue? risk? nah
<jcater> <snicker>
<jamest> so all the rm -rf commands embedded in it are keyed to username derek and an IP address that can be traced back to the state of AZ
<Scott> jcater: well, if debian would sign packages with keys  I could trust... 
<jcater> eh?
<jcater> well, to each his own...
<jcater> we need testers for all distros :)
<Scott> jcater: heh :)
<derek> funny exchange
<derek> ================
<derek> <chillywilly> you cock smoker
<derek> <jamest> what platform
<derek> ==================
<nickr> heh
<derek> Scott: i suggest you look at openBSD
<derek> its MUCH more secure than redhat or even debian
<jamest> gack!
Action: jcater rubs his eyes
<jamest> it's also a platform we don't have any testing on!
Action: derek assumed it was a security thing wanting things 'signed'
Action: jamest runs and hides
<derek> jamest: shhh its my evil ploy to get an openBSD tester
<Scott> derek: if I have to change from GNU/Linux, it will only be to GNU/Hurd.
<jcater> jamest: well, I have an openbsd firewall
<jcater> but I don't really want to test stuff on it
<jcater> ;)
Action: derek puts on his trout armor
Action: jamest doesn't want more bug reports 
<derek> jamest be glad
<derek> im training my office on the spirit of free software
<derek> and so i have started submiting bug reports on ALL software i use
<derek> not just gnue ;)
<derek> poor mozilla bastards got a lot of mail today via bugzilla ;)
<jcater> but, but, but
Action: jamest runs faster
<jamest> 2 commits
<jamest> thank you Bajusz Tams
<jcater> ToyMan_: you around?
<jcater> I just saw your comments about Zope + GNUe
<jcater> what do you have in mind?
<jcater> as I am doing an account maintenance center at the office in Zope
<jcater> and plan to tie it to GNUe when the time is right
<jamest> i too am using gnue/zope at work
<derek> sigh
<jcater> sigh?
<derek> we really shoudl just consider using zope as our appserver it seems
<jamest> i wouldn't 
<nickr> No
<jcater> I wouldn't either
<jamest> it's not even close
<derek> im being feticious
<jcater> where did that come from?
<nickr> zope is too web oriented as you said before
Action: derek is not a zope fan
<derek> not from a technology point of view
<jcater> feticious?
<jcater> does feticious derive from fetus or fetish?
<derek> but from i trust digital creations w/ python as much as i trust sun with java
<nickr> I think he meant fecicious
Action: jcater was teasing him :)
<derek> damn typos
Action: derek glares at jamest
<nickr> twisted looks cool though.
<nickr> i think I already said that.
<derek> facetious is what i meant
<nickr> geas should be in ObjC using our own base class library modelled after python.
<nickr> thats the one.
<jcater> lol
<jcater> I assumed you meant fecicious as well
<nickr> I just can't spel.
<jcater> we no
Action: Scott grins... you're nuts :)
Action: Scott is off to compile abiword to see if his changes to the rpm spec went fine. Then much desired sleep.
Action: Scott waves bye
<Scott> in the mean time, good luck with gnue :) if I can manage some spare time, I'll try to help.
<jcater> cool
<jcater> rest well
<Scott> thanks. bbye
Scott (Scott@213.22.64.87) left irc: "Bye Bye"
<jcater> sigh
Action: jcater runs to the pantry to find the tequila
<derek> hey in printtool
<derek> for remote printer
<derek> what do you put in remote queue?
<derek> is that the name of the queue on the server?
<nickr> derek: the lp protocol defines symbolic names for each printer
<jamest> derek: yes
<nickr> derek: if the remote printer is a standard lp, the default spool name is 'lp'
<derek> on the server i have Names (in printtool) as lp
<derek> cool
<jamest> nickr: don't give him too much info, if he gets everything working he'll start submitting bug reports again
<nickr> hehe
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> I'm going to go ahead and commit the currently broken nstti interface to forms
<jcater> cool
<jamest> as it'll be April before I can touch again
<jcater> dang
<jamest> not cool
<chillywilly> hey did scott say he would run GNU/Hurd?
<jcater> yip
<chillywilly> rock on!
<nickr> chillywilly: yea, but it seems unlikely anyway since it uses the debian package infrastructure
<jcater> rofl
<nickr> which he clearly has problems with
<chillywilly> wjhat?
<chillywilly> debs kick arse
<nickr> he claims they aren't signed by keys 'he can trust'
Action: chillywilly knows that crazymike_away is wathcing gilmore girls like a little bitch
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> that's lame
<chillywilly> don't you have ot have someone that can physically see you sign your key?
<nickr> chillywilly: ye
<nickr> yes
<nickr> and everything in the archive has signed md5 sums

<chillywilly> I mean
<chillywilly> mrs. masta

<jcater> dneighbo: you may need to add aegagrys to your /etc/hosts.lpd
<nickr> dneighbo: so you're using lpr?
<nickr> dneighbo: bsd-lpd rather
<dneighbo> nickr: im just doing what jamest told me :)
<nickr> I can be of no help if you're doing that.
<jamest> um

<dneighbo> the one that they dont have that i want is drag n drop folders
<dneighbo> as i created a bunch of rules (yes!)
<dneighbo> and it auto puts my mailing list mail into correct folders
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> i was dumb and didnt realize i had so many mailing lists
<dneighbo> so i want to create a folder called Mailing Lists
<dneighbo> and put the others under it
<dneighbo> but i cant seem to do that
<dneighbo> i would have export out
<dneighbo> delete current folders create new ones then import in (and im too lazy for that) ;)
<chillywilly> that's a lot of bs work too
<chillywilly> whihc is why it takes me forever to get around to fixing up mutt and stuff as I have too many damn config files to edit
<jcater> I gave up on all that crap
Action: chillywilly is also lazy
<jcater> and use an IMAP server at work 
<jcater> w/procmail
<chillywilly> you store it all on the server?
Action: chillywilly uses IMAP with fetchmail
Action: chillywilly uses fetchmail+procmail+mutt
<dneighbo> i am too nervous about IMAP still
<dneighbo> read its not installed on my host and tested heavily
<dneighbo> jcater: can you download mail locally?
<dneighbo> as when i rid the bus i like to read my mail and compose responses
<dneighbo> though now i dont use laptop for mail so i guess that will be hard....
<dneighbo> hmmmm
<jcater> hmmm
<dneighbo> currently i download mail to home box
<jcater> yeah, I think so
<chillywilly> you can remove the messages with IMAP
<dneighbo> and while i am out i shut off the download
<chillywilly> local download and stuff
<jcater> I think most IMAP clients (including sylpheed) keep a local cache
<dneighbo> so i can ssh into a server and read with pine
<chillywilly> a real hacker just telnet to the port ;P
<chillywilly> j/k
<dneighbo> while im out (vacation (like that happens) or such)
<chillywilly> fuck mail clients
<dneighbo> you know what
<dneighbo> once linux is configured it kicks ass
<chillywilly> damn skippy
<chillywilly> but getting ti there is a PITA sometimes
<chillywilly> s/ti/it
<dneighbo> if for nothing else you know what i cant stand about winders now when i have to use it
<dneighbo> lack of virtual desktops
<dneighbo> i mean it REALLY kills me
<dneighbo> i installed like 3 different 3rd party ones
<dneighbo> but they all use a 'pager' 
<dneighbo> and you cant drag windows around them
<dneighbo> etc etc etc
<dneighbo> oh and tabs on my browswer
<jcater> roflmao
<dneighbo> i cant use i.e. or older mozilla's anymore
<chillywilly> tabs rule
Action: jcater is reading my employee's livejournal
<jcater> trips me out
<dneighbo> galeon has me spoiled with tabs
<dneighbo> linkage linkage ;)
<jcater> "I was at work yesterday and the CFO of our company asked me what the bumper sticker on the back of my car (the one that reads "Coding is Not a Crime") means. And I told him, "Oh, I dunno. It helps me get girls." And err he started laughing, and so did that dork Brian Bockhold, and I looked over and the president of the company is standing a few feet away and laughin at me. Hahha ooops."
<jcater> sigh
<dneighbo> you reminded me this doesnt have logjam installed
<dneighbo> need to do that :
<dneighbo> )
<jcater> I gave him the "Coding is not a Crime" bumpersticker :)
<dneighbo> rofl
<jcater> dude
<jcater> this is our intern
<dneighbo> jcater: coding is techincally not a crime
<jcater> http://www.livejournal.com/users/masterh
<dneighbo> just ....
<dneighbo> publishing code
<dneighbo> executing code
<dneighbo> distributing code
<jcater> hehe... his grandmother thought it was a perverted bumper sticker
Action: jcater guesses she read it as "copulating is not a crime" or something
<dneighbo> well maybe she is on to the notion of 'mad goats'
<jcater> you know these youngun's with their code words, like "coding"
<dneighbo> rofl i like his picture
<jcater> "hey baby, wanna code"
<jcater> he is a friggin trip
<jcater> you'll notice he never mentions me
<jcater> ever
<jcater> but he makes fun of his coworker (my other guy) left and right
<jcater> (brian)
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> can I put together a team or what!
<jcater> ;)
<dneighbo> all i can say is galeons image rendering smokes the crap out of IE 4.0 and 5.5
<dneighbo> the images are like 50% clearer and much more crisp
<dneighbo> and this is with WORSE video card
<dneighbo> me is scared... jcater might read the vile crap i write about him and jamest in my journal
<jcater> um
<jcater> what's your login?
<jcater> nevermind
<jcater> I found the red shirt and pseudo-blond hair
<chillywilly> due has a whole story about that guy
<chillywilly> er, dude
<jcater> dude?
<jcater> ah
alexey (~Alexey@techkran.vladimir.ru) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> there's several stories there
Action: dneighbo reread a few just now
<dneighbo>  Life with kids is truly entertaining... Spent a few hours making chicken Kiev for the wife. It was so nice, and wonderful. Candle light dinner w/ nice wine and such. Sit down and throw a dvd on and a kid is screaming. Go to see whats up and she is puking all over. Oh how it can spoil a mood. :)
<dneighbo> is great
<chillywilly> does that Brian guy like to wear hats jcater?
<jcater> no
<jcater> everything on there is a joke
<chillywilly> why did he make up the hat sotry about him
<jcater> you'd just have to know him
<dneighbo> jcater i have some gnue questions...
<dneighbo> a. can you confirm or dispell notion that prequery isnt working
Action: jcater has never used prequery to my knowledge
<dneighbo> b. what is the datasources editor for exactly... (it appears to not do anything you cant do in properties or schema editor)
<dneighbo> c. are you open to suggestions on schema editor....
<jcater> datasource editor predated schema navigator
<dneighbo> actually thats a long conversation...
<chillywilly> liar
<jcater> and datasource editor will eventually be more than it is now 
<dneighbo> as would like to see us get more into database space
<dneighbo> i.e.
<dneighbo> show a tree view of drivers installed
<dneighbo> and let you config them
<dneighbo> and set optoins etc...
<dneighbo> but also allow you to create table defintions in designer
<dneighbo> but not important at this point
<jcater> sigh
<dneighbo> for now will look into dia2mdeansdataspec
<dneighbo> then we have xsl to convert from that to virtually all dbs
<dneighbo> dont sigh, i like things very much
<chillywilly> " i cannot believe that belief will stand up for long if you truly believe it"
<dneighbo> just listening to the complaints so to speak
<dneighbo> lots of people (the business users) are hung up on concept of having to hand write a sql script
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I started on such a thing
<dneighbo> that guy in here today yogurt (dont know exact nick)
<jcater> but this damn real life keeps interfering
<dneighbo> wanted dynamic table editor
<dneighbo> which might be pretty cool
<dneighbo> as example of python wx application that is not gnue but uses gnue-common
<dneighbo> basically fire it up and select a driver
<dneighbo> select a database
<dneighbo> select a table
<dneighbo> select some fields
<dneighbo> and it opens in a wxGrid
<dneighbo> at first i was like just make a form
<dneighbo> but then i recalled that i had such a tool i made in delphi one afternoon that was EXTREMELY valuable
<dneighbo> as it was a real easy way to view data in a lightweight way
<chillywilly> eeee, gad
<dneighbo> without having to make forms
<chillywilly> again witht eh delphi
<chillywilly> delphi schmelphi
<dneighbo> a dba kind of tool
<dneighbo> anyhow 
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> not sure I see how this is different
<jcater> than our "multi-row" layout option in the Simple Wizard
<jcater> Click
[23:08] Last message repeated 4 time(s).
<jcater> run
<chillywilly> stop
<dneighbo> not as lightweight
<chillywilly> www.com clickity clickity click click
<dneighbo> but more importantly have never gotten run to work in designer :)
<chillywilly> king of the hill is a funny show
<dneighbo> but as stated thought it might be a decent usage of gnue common outside gnue :)
<dneighbo> not saying WE should author it :)
<jcater> my only fear is
<dneighbo> ah thats the thing i wanted to mention
<jcater> that has SO much in common with forms
<jcater> that it would eventually compete
<dneighbo> gotcha
<jcater> wrt feature-creep
<dneighbo> in master detail wizard
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> something to think about anywho
<dneighbo> it says what is key for master
<dneighbo> then new box what is key for detail
<dneighbo> i think instead it should list all fields in master on left
<dneighbo> and all fields for detail on right
<dneighbo> you highlight the field in each you want
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> and click a button in the middle to bind them
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> how would that work w/multiple keys?
<jcater> btw
<jcater> that was demo code for jamest
<dneighbo> i was just gonna say thats the beauty
<dneighbo> is it works good that way
<jcater> showing him how to do another wizard
<dneighbo> as you can highlight multiple on both sides
<dneighbo> i think it needs to be on same screen as at work
<jcater> I did that wizard in a few minutes without ANY code changes to designer :)
<dneighbo> i have tables with say 100 columns
<dneighbo> columns like
<dneighbo> CATEGORY
<dneighbo> GROUP
<dneighbo> CATALOG
<dneighbo> CASOMETHING
<dneighbo> CASOMETIHNG ELSE
<dneighbo> and on two screen thing
<dneighbo> i might cliet CASOMETHING
<dneighbo> and get to second page and go crap did i click CASOMETHING OR CASOMETHING ELSE
<dneighbo> example today had table 
<dneighbo> dept
<dneighbo> dept_num
<dneighbo> dept_name
<dneighbo> (bad naming i know believe me i know)
<dneighbo> and then title
<dneighbo> dept
<dneighbo> title
<dneighbo> as fields
<dneighbo> clicked dept_num as key in master
<dneighbo> then in detail clicked dept and was like crap i think i clieck dept_name in master
<dneighbo> hope that makes sense
<jcater> well, like I said... this was a sample wizard to show what designer could do AS IT SITS :)
<dneighbo> btw: not trying to complain i thought the wizard KICKED butt
<jcater> never said it was the best or final way
<jcater> ;)
<dneighbo> other thing i noticed is we dont have real grids
<dneighbo> so an option should be how many rows the detail is
<jcater> sigh
<dneighbo> if you choose grid
<dneighbo> btw: is there sample code of our repeating rows w/ scrollbar anywhere?
<jcater> not sure
<dneighbo> btw: i didnt mean that as slam on grids (i see that i probably looked that way)
<jcater> btw, I've been torn wrt asking how many grid rows to show
<jcater> as that isn't actually a "grid" wizard but a simple demo wizard
<dneighbo> just w/o a scrollbar people dont think its a grid
<chillywilly> SHOW THEM ALL
<dneighbo> chillywilly: your high
<chillywilly> fucking fill up their video ram!
<dneighbo> it would crash X
<dneighbo> i know, ive done it :)
<chillywilly> crash their X server
<chillywilly> wooooo
<jcater> and I don't want to keep cramming options in that simple wizard
<jcater> so I'm torn
Action: chillywilly sews jcater back up
<dneighbo> if we made it automatically put a scrollbar on right
<jcater> btw
<dneighbo> then i dont think we need to ask
<jcater> I'd prefer to see Simple Wizard not change at all
<jcater> and us create another wizard
<jcater> that is actually "prodcution-quality" so to speak
<dneighbo> i have never seen sample of the scrollbar in action
<dneighbo> i would like to
Action: jcater either

<jcater> dude
<jcater> python2.2?
<jcater> are you mental?
<derek> i get weird stuff on this machine
<derek> w/ gnue at times
<derek> it will do something like above
<derek> then instantly will rerun it it
<derek> and its fine
<derek> its voodoo
<derek> remember this box i cant 'save' files
<derek> as unicode is busted
<derek> need to get my new box all gnue'd up
<derek> i might have a heart attack as i think gnue is usable on my p233 64mb at work
<derek> and pretty kosher on my pIII 500 128mb laptop
<derek> on that new durn 1.2ghz i might fall over
<chillywilly> stop bragging
<derek> some folks want a gnue demo thursday but i remember now that i cant save designer forms cause of python2.2
<derek> crap crap crap
<jcater> sigh
<chillywilly> not here please
<jcater> downgrade, dude
<derek> will need to take laptop to work tomorrow and grab python2.1
<derek> and compile it and all the dependencies
<derek> jcater: bug...
<jcater> derek: no...
<derek> if i slap an entry widget on form in designer
<derek> then go to property editor and change rows to greater than one
<derek> it doesnt update the form
<derek> am i doing something wrong or bug?
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> I haven't had time to look at designer since we updated the 
<jcater> UI* stuff in forms
<jcater> it *basically* works
<jcater> but requires some patience
<derek> it works pretty good for me
<derek> i whipped up a title maintenance application for FY03 in about 2 minutes today (master detail)

<derek> jcater you like older music like show tunes
<derek> from musicals?
<derek> i.e. do you like musicals at all
<jcater> well
<jcater> I didn't
<jcater> until I got into theatre productions
<jcater> then came to appreciate the talent behind musicals
<jcater> ;)
<jcater> got into = started going to
<derek> you like ska/punk type music at all?
<jcater> some
Action: jcater likes a little of everything
<jcater> but a lot of nothing
<derek> if so there is a group of punk musicians that liked theater and got together and decided to do cover tunes of musicals
<derek> they are GREAT
<jcater> cool
<derek> called
<derek> ME FIRST & THE GIMME GIMMES
<derek> some where over the rainbow rocks :)
<derek> as does that annie tune, (tomorrow?)
<derek> and several othes
<derek> others
<jcater> yay
<chillywilly> jcater: that intern of yours is bizzare man
<jcater> posted my first live journal

<derek> gack
<jcater> wassat
<chillywilly> What I'm really waiting for right now: E.T. the Extraterrestrial is coming back into the theaters. And I'm way excited, because that part at the end where Elliot totally rides the bike and you can tell right before that he smoked a whole blunt and he's so high and so is E.T., and right during that part, you can see E.T.'s lips move slightly and if you watch REALLY carefully, E.T. says "I could use some more motherfucking Reeses P
<chillywilly> ht now." I bet they cut that part out when they re-release it though.
<derek> was trying to post list of tunes
<chillywilly> roflmao!!!!!!
Action: chillywilly is going to piss himself
<derek> that is funny
<jcater> he says crap like that in the middle of the day
<derek> these are a few of my favorite things rocks too :)
<jcater> he has a Mr. T doll sitting on his monitor
<derek> http://store.artistdirect.com/store/artist/album/0,,846139,00.html
<derek> if you have realplayer you can listen to some of their tunes
<chillywilly> that dude should be a comedian
<chillywilly> I dream iof thinking up crazy shit like that
<derek> Though it doesn't sound like a brilliant idea, Me First & the Gimme Gimmes, an all-star cover band dedicated to regurgitating punk rock-style the most frothy music in their parents' record collections, are actually extraordinarily entertaining and can make the likes of John Denver and Barry Manilow sound not so bad. The lineup includes Fat Mike of NOFX, the guitarist from the Foo Fighters, a couple of the guys from Lagwagon , and Spi
<derek> awson, the Gimmes' sweet-voiced singer, who also plays bass for the Swingin' Utters. On their second record, Are a Drag, the Gimmes tackle all of their parents' favorite showtunes, claiming homage rather than satire. Most of their choices are songs that anybody even remotely into musicals knows by heart. Their cover of "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" has more choruses than the original, rocks pretty damn hard, and is certainly worthy of
<derek> irling slam pit. Though it's not as wild as John Coltrane's version, the Gimmes' "My Favorite Things" is raging enough to send Julie Andrews swan diving off the stage into a sea of sweaty punkers. They mess with the jazz standard "Summertime" by Gershwin, adding some fine surfy leads to a song that's been played a million times over. Also, there's their furious rendition of Andrew Lloyd Webber 's "Phantom of the Opera." On Are a Drag
<derek>  Gimmes succeed at playing showtunes that punk kids can dig, no small feat. ~ Adam Bregman,
<derek> the beauty of having nieces and nephews that are turing 15-18 are they turn me on to some cool music and popular culture :)
<nickr> and in many states yo ucan marry them also.
<nickr> like Wisconsin
<derek> or Tennessee
<chillywilly> pffft
<jcater> you can marry wisconsin?
<jcater> I knew corporations had the same rights as people these days
<jcater> but states too?
<derek> jcater: i cant grok scroll bars
<jcater> derek: is LogJam in sid?
<derek> yip
<derek> apt-get install logjam
<jcater> um
<jcater> rock
<nickr> ergh, I'm not getting enough email.
<nickr> whats logjam?
<jcater> nickr: what's your email?
<derek> livejournal entry tool
<jcater> I'll send you something
<jcater> dude
<jcater> this could get addicting quickly
<nickr> nick@[fargus.net|nspam.industrialmeats.com] or nickrusnov@debian.org
<nickr> I should make a live journal
<jcater> industrialmeats?
<jcater> sounds kinda sickening
<derek> grrrrrr
<nickr> hehe
<nickr> jcater: my website is nick.industrialmeats.com ;)
<derek> you want to compile logjam
<jcater> I do?
<derek> as if you compile it you can xmms support
<derek> and spell checking
<derek> i dont know how to get those with the deb file
<nickr> derek: file a big report :)
<derek> i will jsut post to evans journal
<derek> i started to fix some stuff in the logjam client
<derek> cause i ahd to complie from source on redhurt
<derek> but was choking on the fact its icky old C code
<derek> then i found evans stash of python libs to access livejournal :)
<derek> but decided i didnt need another project
<jcater> spell checking
<jcater> ?
Action: jcater hasn't used computerized spellchecking in like 2-3 years
<jcater> ok, nickr
<jcater> you have email
<jcater> ;)
<nickr> you'll be happy to know that it wasn't characterized as spam :)
<chillywilly> So, logically, I get on the fucking livejournal. Thanks, livejournal. You soul-sucking assholes. I didn't even want to post in this thing every day, and now it's like a crackhead's pipe - "oh oh what do I do now?" "smoke that crack. write in the journal."
<chillywilly> Rockin and rolling,
<chillywilly> Master H
<nickr> spamassasin is cool
<nickr> assassin
<jcater> dude
<jcater> I installed that last week
<jcater> and it has rocked my socks
<nickr> I like how it adds ****** SPAM ******* to spam :)
<jcater> derek: cool
<jcater> we could write a dbdriver backend for livejournal
<jcater> ;)
<nickr> haha
<jcater> with a forms front end
<dneighbo> would work for me
<nickr> then you could use the web forms client
<nickr> haha
<nickr> symmetry
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> we could do our appserver using zope
<jcater> so we'd have a web-based forms client
<jcater> using gnue-common to connect to a zope app server
<nickr> just make a forms client IN zope
<derek> jcater do you have any idea how scroll bar works
<jcater> which uses gnue-common to connect to the webservices of livejournal
<jcater> derek: nope
<dtm> jcater: what about xmlrpc to phpgroupware/
<dtm> ?
<jcater> ah
<jcater> tru
<dtm> jcater: well, do that then.  :)
<jcater> derek: I've never had the inclination or need to try scrollbars
<jcater> so I dunno how they work
<derek> never mind
<derek> 5.1.8 <scrollbar>
<derek> Only partially implemented at this time. Will show on form
<derek> but do nothing.
<derek> 5.1.8.1 Attributes
<derek> from the techref ;)
<jcater> lol
<jcater> well, at least the techref isn't misleading
<derek> my bug report to jamest was gonig to be
<jcater> ;)
<derek> they appear to show on form correctly, but apparently dont do anything
<derek> which is exactly how the techref explains them as working
<nickr> its nice to have parity in documentation.
<nickr> what is livejournal anyway?
<derek> an addicting piece of crap
<nickr> Heh.
<nickr> its like a blog no?
<derek> my two favorite moments on livejournal
<derek> the 18 year beverly hills chick who said I LOVE KRISPY KREME and I NEED A MAN
<derek> and the 13 year that posted in my log, your hot please message me 
<derek> the day after i told jcater i couldnt believe these birthdays being like 1985 and being intelligible etc
<nickr> I love krispy kreme
<jcater> nickr: that was you?
Action: jcater didn't know nickr was a 13 yr old girl
<derek> you should hook up with her

<nickr> I don't even know what LJ is.
<derek> jcater: have you followed wxUniversal at all
<jcater> not recentlyt
dtm (dtm@ip22.promontory.sfo.interquest.net) left irc: "upgrade to 2.4.17  ;)"
<derek>  The advantage of wxUniversal is that you have precise control over the
<derek> controls' appearance (it is not always possible to change all aspects of the
<derek> native controls) and the theme support: the same program may be changed to
<derek> look completely differently without changing a single line of its code but
<derek> just changing the theme.
<derek>  Another advantage is that it makes writing ports of wxWindows for other
<derek> platforms (such as OS/2, BeOS or QNX) much simpler, so it is of special
<derek> interest to people interested in porting wxWindows to another platform.
<derek>  However, wxUniversal doesn't have a 100% native look and feel unlike the

<chillywilly> why are you ducking?
<jcater> because chickens are just plain messy
<nickr> you really should use magicpoint
<nickr> magicpoint is awes-ome
<derek> magicpoint is cool how it broadcasts to other machines
<derek> but its a pain to EASILY setup a presentation
<derek> you have to 'learn' magic point
<chillywilly> heh on the linux show
<nickr> its not like its hard to learn
<nickr> but it'd be nice if there was a wysiwyg thing
<chillywilly> they said that RMS's stalin-like way of running the FSF has driven the original founders away
<nickr> Stalin-like?
<nickr> Stalin wouldn't have let them run away
<nickr> he would've sent them to a gulag
<jcater> do we really know RMS didn't try?

<chillywilly> due I have been meaning to set that up
<chillywilly> but I am lazy
<chillywilly> er, dude
<nickr> i have it just notating spam, and it makes recieving spam interesting :)
<chillywilly> it didn't look very intuitive to setup
<nickr> Pretty soon I'll sort all the notated spam into asseparate folder
<nickr> Its not hard. We're using postfix with procmail local delivery
<chillywilly> not exim?
<nickr> god no.
<chillywilly> why not?
<chillywilly> who is *we8?
<nickr> fargus.net/industrialmeats.com/zorcat.com
<chillywilly> those clients?
<nickr> I'm going to install it for vetlost.net today
<nickr> svetlost.
<nickr> chillywilly: no, its my friend's cgompanty, he uses me for tech support
<nickr> same with svetlost
<nickr> different friend though
<chillywilly> and he doesn't pay you?
<chillywilly> er, they don't
<nickr> the swetlost guy does
<nickr> the other one is getting me a job at his dayjob
<chillywilly> in OR?
<nickr> well he pays me in a sense, the svetlost guy, right now I've used up all the money he payed me and he treats me to lunch every other day
<nickr> yea in OR
<chillywilly> well a man needs more than one meal a day
<nickr> everyotherday
<nickr> I have some food stores. He also lets me get stuff at costco sometimes.
<chillywilly> how much work you doing for this guy?
<nickr> I'm tired of the arrangement though.
<nickr> Well, I manage the box and I've been working on a webs-ite 
<chillywilly> you need tot all him to show you the money
<chillywilly> er, tell
<chillywilly> ;P
<nickr> Heh. I don't rceally think thats justified fiven the amount of money he has given me dircetly and indirectly
<chillywilly> well why are you so broke then?
<chillywilly> and have no food
<chillywilly> you buying weed with that money
<nickr> because I've been in this arrangement for 8 months :)
<chillywilly> ;)
<nickr> And all the money I got was spent over 4 months ago
<chillywilly> don't you have any cash flow right now?
<nickr> No.
<chillywilly> but you are still doing tech support?
<nickr> Yes, I think a few meals a week is worth what I do for him.
<nickr> which isn't that much.
<chillywilly> well what foes that entail....I still think you are getting gipped
<chillywilly> er, does
<chillywilly> mike says why do you keep assuming the position for that guy
<nickr> It doesnt't matter, I'm not gonna get any money from dhim so I'm satisfied with the situation given that I hopefully will have a fulltime job in a month
<chillywilly> whatever floats yor boat dude, I just don't like seeing you all broke and shit....good luck with your job dude

<nickr> heh. thanks.
<nickr> I really just complain. I'd rather not have money or having to spend it at all
<chillywilly> ok, so how to I setup spamassassin
Action: chillywilly is too lazt to rtfm
<chillywilly> er, lazy
<nickr> in exim?
<nickr> I have no idea
<nickr> You can probably call procmail from your .forward and then call spamassasin from there
<chillywilly> well exim calls procmail form it's config out of the box
<chillywilly> er, from
<nickr> okay, then add this to your .procmailrc:
<chillywilly> hmmm, I suppse I could use a .forward file
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> shoot
<nickr> :0fw
<nickr> | spamassassin -P -p ~/.spamassassin/local.cf
<nickr> :0e
<nickr> {   
<nickr>     EXITCODE=$?
<nickr> }
<nickr> except without the -p 
<nickr> -p ...
<nickr> rather
<chillywilly> ummmm
<chillywilly> you mean wihtout the -p and everything after it?
<nickr> yes
<chillywilly> | spamassassin -P
<chillywilly> liek that./
<chillywilly> doh
<chillywilly> I don't like this laptop keyboard
<nickr> yea
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> any other specialization I should do?
<nickr> nope
<chillywilly> alright lemme try this biz0tch out
<nickr> now all your messages will get an X-Spam-Status header
<nickr> hopefully
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> which you can filter on right>?
<chillywilly> with procmil
<chillywilly> er, procmail
<nickr> yea
<nickr> Its probably a cgood idea ot let it go and  see if its filtering works for you
<chillywilly> wlel yea
<chillywilly> well
<nickr> once you've used it for a while you can decide which score to require, and then filter it into a separate folder
<chillywilly> they get scored?
<chillywilly> based on spamness or something ;)
<nickr> yes
<nickr> the default required score is 5
<chillywilly> cool
<nickr> I'm thinking of lowering my to 3
<nickr> each rule has a certain score associated with it that you can adjust too
<chillywilly> ok, holf on stop typing so I can copy this easier ;)
<chillywilly> er, hold
<chillywilly> hmmm, how can I test this
<chillywilly> btw, I put it before all my other filters
<chillywilly> is that how you do it or is it best to be at the end?
<nickr> at the beginning
<chillywilly> ok
<nickr> all your mails should have X-Spam-Status hedaers now
<chillywilly> hmmm, ok
<chillywilly> what is the name of that algorithm that spamassassin uses?
<nickr> It uses lots of different ones
<nickr> afaik
<nickr> it passes a lot of rules over the message
<chillywilly> something sabout razor
<nickr> each rule has a score
<nickr> it can use razor also
<nickr> razor is a distributed message hash thing
<chillywilly> alrighty
<chillywilly> X-Spam-Status: No, hits=-4.0 required=5.0 tests=IN_REP_TO,TO_LOCALPART_EQ_REAL version=2.11
<chillywilly> on a recent Hurd message
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: chillywilly wants to get some spam so he can see what it does
<nickr> do you get spam normally?
<chillywilly> hellz yea
<chillywilly> too much bs
<chillywilly> especially sine I went through this credit counseling place
<chillywilly> the hurd lists of course get soammed as you should now
<chillywilly> er, know
<chillywilly> spammed
<nickr> well its just a matter of waiting then
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> btw, how does spam get to you if it is not even adressed to you?
<chillywilly> I knwo the the list admin adresses would spam everyone
<chillywilly> but sometimes I just get spam with not to header that is not from a list admin address
<chillywilly> s/not/no
<nickr> the envelope to is to you, even though theres no To header
<nickr> the spammer's mta is devilering it directly to yours
<chillywilly> oh
<nickr> dingdingding
<nickr> 2 N   Mar 14 DIGITAL CLON    (   0) *****SPAM***** CD?????????? ???? ?? ???????? CD???? ?? ???? 170??????????[????]
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> it changes the subject too eh?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> you can set it not to
<chillywilly> does spamass collect stat?
<nickr> it adds a detailed report of the rules to the body, also
<chillywilly> er, stats
<nickr> I don't know.
Action: chillywilly thinks it should literally assassinate spammers
<chillywilly> it should issues mob hits out on them
<nickr> when the internet is a place for secure, ananymous, difgital tarnasactions, that'll be possible
<nickr> digital transactions
<nickr> wow, rleally biffed that one
<chillywilly> you type like me
<chillywilly> anyway, that wouldn't be possible if it was anonymous
<nickr> why?
<chillywilly> you wouldn't know who was spamming you
<chillywilly> ;P
<nickr> no, the money moving is the anonymous part
<nickr> the spam is still nonymous
<nickr> huh
<chillywilly> you didn't say that
<chillywilly> but anyway
<nickr> that'd be an interesting science fiction story

<Arturas2> ok :)
<dneighbo> biggest question is have you sent anything to the wxWindows/wxPython mailing lists

<Arturas2> not

<dneighbo> hi mdean 
<mdean> high
<mdean> 2 sick kids today
<mdean> tho I think one of them is feigning illness
<mdean> got 2 offers to help develop features today
<mdean> you probably saw one of them via the dev list
<dneighbo> right
<dneighbo> im a little leary of that one
<dneighbo> i think we want RBAC
<dneighbo> but im either pro
<dneighbo> a. do it right even if it takes a long time
Yurik (~yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> b. do a hack to meet current needs knowing it needs to be done right eventually
<dneighbo> this is kind of a middle of road approach
<dneighbo> it seems more thought out than 'quick hack'
<dneighbo> but i dont think its the 'long term'
<mdean> I think he'll go for RBAC
<dneighbo> the key is getting them to buy into dcl vision :)
<mdean> what he described is more like a cross between rbac and acl
<dneighbo> right
<dneighbo> curious as to what other call to help is
<dneighbo> fwiw: i htink i about have all my ducks in a row at home
<dneighbo> so will be continuing DCL screens ASAP
<mdean> Particular things I'd like to work on to start are
<mdean> authentication, enhanced configuration, and additional
<mdean> look-and-feel template sets. These are things I'd like to
<mdean> work with the DCL developers on, rather than go off and do
<mdean> my own thing. I strongly believe in community development
<mdean> where possible.
<mdean> that's from the other guy

<psu> ok, official style guide now
<Yurik> chillywilly hi
<chillywilly> reinhard sup
<reinhard> hey chillywilly
<dneighbo> mdean thats cool
<chillywilly> what do you mean by tree query thing?
<reinhard> i don't know
<reinhard> i just know that it is there in common :)
<psu> I always in KC refer to "GNUe Forms", "GNUe Application Server" etc
Action: psu is back
<reinhard> psu that's perfect
<psu> is it now "GNUe DCL"?
<psu> ;-)
<reinhard> lol
<mdean> hmmmm
<mdean> I'm not sure how we should approach that...
<mdean> jcater!!!!!!!!!!!!
<mdean> chillywilly!!!!!!!!!
<psu> mdean: actually, that's more a proprietary s/w trick
Action: mdean sits in awe of the sudden outburst of threads...
<psu> Thanks to the wonders of GPL, I guess it can never become "Microsoft DCL"
<chillywilly> er, query tree
Action: psu runs 
<chillywilly> mdean !
<mdean> chillywilly!
<chillywilly> reinhard where is the code for that at?
<dneighbo> psu for now call it DCL
<chillywilly> (the query tree)
<dneighbo> we havent worked out specifics of GNUe DCL
<dneighbo> i imagine as it advances it will be
<dneighbo> GNUe HelpDesk
<dneighbo> GNUe Project Managment
<dneighbo> or something
<dneighbo> but we are a ways off from that :)
Action: reinhard figures he should'nt talk about things he doesn't know about
<mdean> it's a tricky thing, since DCL has built its own brand
<dneighbo> i think initially DCL is like Bayonne in that its a project under GNUe
<dneighbo> but it slowly will start to get GNUe front ends (but still keep its back ends)
<reinhard> chillywilly: i know about those query trees from IRC talks with jcater and jamest
<reinhard> i haven't looked at the code at all
<dneighbo> and then over time start to use contacts module of gnue
<reinhard> plus i said "i'm not sure" or something like that
<dneighbo> accounting module of gnue 
<dneighbo> invoice etc etc
<dneighbo> where then it will be much more of a 'hybrid'
<dneighbo> ultimately its up to mdean
<dneighbo> im cool with GNUe DCL
<dneighbo> or DCL
<dneighbo> or even my mommas underpants :)
<dneighbo> as long as it continues to evolve :)
<mdean> I would reserve GNUe DCL for a GNUe framework implementation
<dneighbo> mdean: i tend to agree
<mdean> like your DCL forms
<reinhard> chillywilly: so i guess what i wanted to express is "be careful with assuming we will use OQL it's not yet set in stone"
<dneighbo> basically there are still tons of steps :)
<chillywilly> reinhard well, this is what I was saying before that the interface to the app server would be different than the interfaces to the elational back ends as we give objects out not 'records'
<dneighbo> but the first and biggest has been taken
Action: mdean nods
<chillywilly> reinhard ok
<dneighbo> and that is to work together on a much deeper level than just acknowledging one anothers projects as a nicety
<dneighbo> but rather immerse the visions of both projects into a reality (how about that for marketing spew)
<chillywilly> can someone explain what these query trees are?
<dneighbo> psu causes it by the way... as i know i will be quoted :)
<dneighbo> j/k
<dneighbo> chillywilly its a way to build a complex query
<dneighbo> like
<mdean> hehe
<dneighbo> select my.foo, your.foo, his.from from my, your, his where my.foo > your.foo AND his.foo=my.foo
<dneighbo> etc etc
<chillywilly> reinhard btw, OQL does more thasn just query it can invoike methods and create objects
<chillywilly> dneighbo ok
<dneighbo> at least thats how i understoood it from teh conversation
<dneighbo> its an EASY way to build queries on the fly
<dneighbo> w/o knowing SQL but rather passing some values into the tree
<chillywilly> reinhard and those methods can be invoked at runtime (you get polymorphism with it)
<dneighbo> er that was said kind of wrong, but hopefully you get what i meant
<chillywilly> er, I mean you can call methods of a parent interface and have it pick the right methods of the runtime type
<reinhard> chillywilly: that is not API, that's behaviour
<chillywilly> I know that
<reinhard> the api is how you tell it to call a method
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> sorry i'm so stubborn
<reinhard> only wanting to talk about api at the moment
<reinhard> :)

<reinhard> mdean: lol
<Yurik> thus beta :)
<reinhard> Yurik: may i warn you to upgrade from girlfriend 5.0 to wife 1.0
<Yurik> reinhard: :-)
<reinhard> wife 1.0 is incompatible with many other applications

<jcater> just make sure you have girlfriend 4.0 completely uninstalled before performing the upgrade
<Yurik> lol
<Yurik> s/tamp/stamp/
<mdean> chillywilly: sex 3.1 has bugs...you should downgrade to sex 3.0
<Yurik> cu later, dudes

<Mr_You> re
<Mr_You> In regards to the packages discussion week or so ago.. seems to me, how would I get real functionality with just a 2-tier app?
<Mr_You> ie. its just a data in/out app, not much functionality beyond that.
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
sjc__ (~sjc@modem-2271.cougar.dialup.pol.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Mr_You> hi psu and sjc
<psu> hi Mr_You
<sjc__> Mr_You: Hi
Action: psu is away: busy filing paperwork - but still lurking
<jcater> Mr_You: there's no less functionality than in n-tier mode
<jcater> it's just where does the functionality lie
<jcater> lay
<jcater> or whatever
Action: psu is back
<Mr_You> so how do I get "external" functionality?  such as, data is inputed, email of data is sent
<Mr_You> without having something monitor the database tables
<psu> Mr_You: I would guess that you would attatch a trigger to something on the form
<psu> e.,g the submnit button
<psu> & write some python to do it
<jcater> yes
<jcater> it would be no different than in n-tier mode
<nickr> you could put a pl/sql trigger in no?
Action: psu has a "Python for bozos" book on the shelf but hasn;t read it properly yet
<jcater> in n-tier you have triggers watching transactions at the middle-ware level
<nickr> psu: are you a bozo?
<jcater> well in 2-tier you either move that to the database-leve (with database triggers) or you move it to the clients
<psu> nickr: problem with a pl/sql trigger is that it is d/b specific
<psu> a forms trigger will work with any back end 
<nickr> true, true.
<psu> nickr:  no, but I play one on irc ;-)
<Mr_You> how would a trigger execute code?
<jcater> that's what a trigger is
<jcater> code
<Mr_You> ok, hmm I thought a trigger was db code.. I'm talking about python or perl or script or whatever..
<Mr_You> or whatever I need to do to interface with mail, etc.
<jcater> that'd be at the forms/client level, then
<nickr> you just have the form call a python thing that does it
<Mr_You> ok, and that is builtin to GNUe Forms functionality right now?
<nickr> the reason I liked the database level trigger is you only have to deal with sending mail in one spot then and get mail working on one computer
<psu> nickr: agreed. 
<Mr_You> actually.. it would require to be on the server side because of multiple clients no?  I couldn't expect a form to know how to send email from wintel and unix, no?
<jcater> nickr: when that's a big deal for my stuff, I just have an xml-rpc instance running on the server to listen for those events
<nickr> jcater: that makes sense
<nickr> as I was typing it I thought of a way to do it client neutraly
<nickr> you could have like a webform email thing and url encode it.
<nickr> its hacky though.
<jcater> well, truth be known, I don't have a client-server setup
<jcater> I have a host-based setup
<jcater> I either use (in the old system) telnet sessions to run curses based forms
<jcater> or (in the new system) I have all LTSP clients running off the main server
<jcater> but that's just my setup :)
<jcater> ymmv
<Mr_You> with DB triggers, is there a "mail function" or a method of executing external scripts?
<jcater> it all depends on the database
<Mr_You> postgres
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> I'm sure there is
<jcater> but I don't use that in prodcution yet
<nickr> postgres you can embed a perl scrip.t
<nickr> or a pl/sql script
<nickr> I know in perl its pretty easy to send mail :)
<Mr_You> ok.. hmm.

<dneighbo> if the registry wasnt bad enough
<dneighbo> they want to make the file system an object database?
<dneighbo> egads
<dneighbo> the horror
Action: dneighbo thinks its mostly a ploy to:
<dneighbo> a. distract free software developers (like .net)
<dneighbo> b. way to get people to pay for upgrades by BREAKING old products (like .net)
<dneighbo> c. way to further lock out free software developers with proprietary and evil APIs (like .net)
<dneighbo> i.e. .net was the web services attack
<dneighbo> this new file system would be the hardware/os api attack
<dneighbo> i think it MIGHT back fire on them

<Mr_You> derek: Oracle thinks the same way
<Mr_You> and I think MySQL is working on a file system.
<Mr_You> hmm neat. Mini-ITX Form Factor, I see a motherboard but first I've heard about it, wonder if any cases are out yet
<Mr_You> http://www.via.com.tw/en/VInternet/mini_itx.jsp
<dneighbo> im not saying m$ is crazy in that regards
<dneighbo> oracle pronounced the idea first (from recent companies that are large) about 3 years ago i think
<dneighbo> if not longer ago
<dneighbo> my point is faster 'searching' at the cost of having in a db is not a trade i want to make :)
<dneighbo> example: registry
<dneighbo> i mean registry has 1,000 pluses compared to config/ini files on PAPER
<dneighbo> but in practicality
<dneighbo> how many times has a bad entry in your apache.conf or smb.conf
<dneighbo> rendered your machine SCREWED
<dneighbo> compared to times a bad or corrupt registry put you 'panic' mode
<dneighbo> ask ToyMan_ about good ole Access (m$ leading db technology for the most part) though mssql is getting comparalbe to others
<dneighbo> and ask him if he wants the same 'studs' that made access turing his file system into a database ;)
<Mr_You> and it seems Oracle has had no success 
<Mr_You> to the extent they wanted that is

<chillywilly> wtf is that?
<nickr> chillywilly: put your client in passive mode
<chillywilly> netbois, hrrrm
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> what is th difference anyway?
<jcater> passive doesn't open up another port on the server machine
<chillywilly> ah
<jcater> important for firewalls
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> I see
<chillywilly> why does it open another one?
<chillywilly> one for ftp data
<chillywilly> ?
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> I didn't design the original ftp
<chillywilly> how do I make ncftp do it
<jcater> or any subsequent for that matter
<nickr> passive doesn't open another on the CLIENT
<chillywilly> I know
<jcater> is it a command line prog?
<chillywilly> yep
<jcater> passv
<jcater> usually
<nickr> see, normally FTP the client side opens a port and listens for the server to push the data
<chillywilly> hrrrm, ok
<chillywilly> why would it bitc that there's no route to host?
<chillywilly> er, bitch
<dtm> *)@#
<nickr> in passive mode, the client lets the server open a port which it connects to
<dtm> ftp doesn't use udp.
<dtm> fyi
<chillywilly> dtm: you're a bit late
<dtm> yeah
<dtm> just a second opinion.
<dtm> except it's not an opinion.  I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE #@*)'S GOING ON.
<dtm> :)  heheh
<chillywilly> nickr: I see...in active mode does the client pick some random port number?
<nickr> yea
<chillywilly> that's a problem then
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> now f I could figure out how to make ncfto use passive mode
<chillywilly> er, if
<jcater> ah
<jcater> I had it backwards
<jcater> oh, well
<nickr>  passive
<jcater> nickr seems to know :)
<chillywilly> that makes sense though
<chillywilly> it is passive
<chillywilly> and therefore does not take any action
<dtm> chillywilly: 'man ncftp' and search for passivE!
<dtm> or start ncftp and do 'help'
<chillywilly> did that dude
<dtm> it's technical.
<chillywilly> that was the frist thing
<dtm> no doubt
<dtm> :)
Action: chillywilly uses info
<chillywilly> set passive on
<chillywilly> yay ;)
<chillywilly> damn
<chillywilly> it is still bitched
<chillywilly> might be my fucked up config
<chillywilly> hrrrm, I see why now
<chillywilly> it is using a private IP back to make the connection
<chillywilly> ftp> ls
<chillywilly> 227 Entering Passive Mode (192,168,1,101,130,69).
<chillywilly> which results in no route to host
<dtm> chillywilly: are you loading your ip masq module?
<chillywilly> he has this friggin linksys router
<dtm> @#*)
<chillywilly> I can ssh into his box
<dtm> well i'd think that the linksys should work though, or at worst would have an option to fix it in its stupid web gui admin tool
<chillywilly> he can reach the outside work and vice versa
<chillywilly> yea, well linksys doe sshit ass backawrds
<chillywilly> you can clamp it all down
<chillywilly> but you cannot open ports
<dtm> yeah i pity the fool who does vpn from behind that stuff
<chillywilly> it wqill forward ports
<chillywilly> and it has filters for the proivate IPS
<dtm> certainly not multiple masqueraded vpn clients
<chillywilly> how stupid is that?
<nickr> vpn only needs one open port
<nickr> if you do it right.
<dtm> nickr: some of those appliances dont understand GRe
<dtm> GRE
<nickr> GRE?
<nickr> maybe I have a completely different view of how vpns work..
<dtm> nickr: and the pptp and ipsec protocols are not made for masquerading but some clever routers can sorta get around it
<chillywilly> swhy doesn't masquerade that connection from the ftp server?
<chillywilly> that is the question
<dtm> nickr: i'm not sure how many views are possible :)
<dtm> chillywilly: try ftp'ing to another server which you know uses PASV
<nickr> I always see it in terms of linking a client *network* into a host *network*
<nickr> everything is much simpler. :)
<dtm> nickr:  oh i see
<chillywilly> I dunno of one that uses pasv
<dtm> nickr: yeah the typical consumer way is just desktop host to vpn server
<dtm> nickr: if you connect networks it's much better off
<nickr> yes.
<dtm> nickr: and these consumer routers tend not to have vpn clients in em, so you therefore have to masquerade or bypass them
<dtm> nickr: the world of VPNs is a sad state of affairs
<nickr> I like things like ssh tunnel VPNs
<dtm> nickr: very complex and inflexible
<dtm> nickr: anything beyond the aforementioned defaults is just about crazy
<nickr> I've had very good luck with ssh tunnel VPNs... linking a series of networks together
<dtm> nickr: but then, anything beyond those probably should be implemented by VNC or http
<dtm> nickr: not by an entire virtualized transport layer
<nickr> people try to get too clever with it. :P
<dtm> too lazy, often
<dtm> coz they want to do things based on a whole transport layer... network filesystems, remote desktop apps
<dtm> stupid stuff like tha
<dtm> t
<dtm> some of it is understandable but mostly for purely legacy reasons
<nickr> I don't really see a problem with that the way I've done things, but maybe I'm just lucky.
<dtm> it's preferable to use techniques which are designed for secure remote access, like webdav, http, vnc
<dtm> yeah you're lucky compared to some
<dtm> then you have the issue of compatibility
<dtm> pptp is _not_ a security protocol, but people use it for compatibility and cost effectiveness for Windows clients
<dtm> pptp != security
<dtm> no implementation of pptp involves security, because it is a M$ embrace-and-extend
<dtm> they let a standards body establish it, then they broke it and dominated it through sheer numbers and leveraging

<dtm> but that's probably the last thing i'd ever hafta explain to _this_ crowd  ;)
<dtm> i'm venting
<dtm> i spent months researching it
<dtm> trying to set it up on linux

Nick change: chillywilly_ -> chillywilly
<chillywilly> hrrm
Action: chillywilly just did passive mode ftp for ftp.kernel.org ans itworked fine
<chillywilly> it has to be the NAT issue
<chillywilly> wtf
<chillywilly> I don't get it
<dtm> chillywilly: did you look up that appliance's web GUI admin tool?
<chillywilly> no i didn't fuck with that yet
<chillywilly> I dunno why it would not masq that connection as it does all the others
<dtm> maybe because active ftp is a totally different protocol which has to be specifically supported, possibly by turning it on in the admin toool
<chillywilly> dtm: that makes no sense as the masq stuff is done at a packet level
<dtm> ok but that's how it is!
<chillywilly> well i know but what other protocol could it use besides tcp or udp/
<dtm> that's why all linux masq routers have to load a kernel module for specifically that protocol.  same with DCC
<chillywilly> umm, what do you mean?
<dtm> it doesn't use other ip protocols; it's just that its state is handled differently coz it's dumb
<chillywilly> ok
<dtm> it requires for the client to also be a server
<dtm> the client connects to the ftp server and the ftp server has a mini-client which connects back to the client 
<dtm> that's ftp's active mode
<dtm> that's why you're setting passive mode
<dtm> however
<chillywilly> bah
<dtm> if i'm not mistaken i think i've also seen problems with PASV ftp
<dtm> when masqueraded
<dtm> ftp is junk these days
<chillywilly> well he wants to allow people to upload stuff too
<dtm> i think the sole reason to use ftp is that http doesn't support wildcards!!  :)
<chillywilly> I didn't feel like writing a script
<dtm> then he should get a better protocol like webdav or some http web app
<nickr> I considered pptp, but things like tinc looked much better.
<dtm> no scripts are to be written
<dtm> nothing custom
<dtm> these problems have been solved a billion times over
<chillywilly> well I didn't feel like doing html either
<dtm> they're just not shipped by default with the OS
<dtm> and what on earth are you talking about having to custom-make?
<chillywilly> in order to do upload via http
<dtm> heheh
Action: dtm hands chillywilly some matches
<dtm> fire has already been discovered, bro
<dtm> ther'es also hotline
<dtm> which is now an open standard , open src
<chillywilly> due aI know it suports it but as aI said I did not want to write an html form
<dtm> much to my surprise
<dtm> yeah and in response to that, i said "fire has already been discovered".  but you can clearly see that in the scrollback :)
<dtm> so just install something that's already been made.
<chillywilly> do tno speak to me in riddles
<dtm> which happens to not be ftp
<dtm> the only thing that's riddling you is that there exists software which solves this problem without ftp.
<chillywilly> well they used to have an ftp server, so he wants to just keep it the same
<dtm> so, just chew on that and maybe after a while you'll remember the existance of sf.net and freshmeat.net and such :)
<dtm> oh well!  good luck!
<chillywilly> dtm: dude
<dtm> ftp it is!
<chillywilly> just don't talk to me man, you're being very condescending
<chillywilly> I don;t appreciate it
<dtm> i'm responding humorously to your profound density :)
<chillywilly> I knwo there's other things that could be used
<dtm> i dont at all mean to be condescending
<chillywilly> omg
<chillywilly> again wihtt he insults
<dtm> and i'm trying to be compassionate to the fact that it's a nutty situation
<chillywilly> you are being far from that
<dtm> it's not an insult; it's an observation; sorry i'm not more polite
<chillywilly> you just said I was profoundly dense
<dtm> you're the one soliciting input, and i've told you everything i know!
<dtm> and you're not even attempting to use it
<dtm> you're just arguing into the sky
<chillywilly> I;m not asking you anything
<dtm> the thing obviously isn't going to work as is, so reconfigure it or replace it
<chillywilly> you're too l337 for me
<dtm> wellsorry chillywilly
<chillywilly> I am trying to debug it
<nickr> I'm completely lost as to the point of this conversation.
<chillywilly> point is to ridicule and belittle people for not being top notch sys admins
<dtm> nickr: he desperately wants to make ftp work behind a broken masquerading appliance, but without attempting to reconfigure it
<chillywilly> no one said I was doign that
<dtm> chillywilly: nobody _said_ it; that's just what you're doing.
<chillywilly> I just tried to get the web thingy up
<nickr> I was under the impression that a linux box was being used for masquerading
<nickr> rather for NAT
<chillywilly> it didn't like the text browser
<dtm> nickr: negative
<chillywilly> some people liek to talk out their oproblems
<nickr> well theres the mistake, then. :)
<chillywilly> nickr: nah, thsi stupid router
<dtm> chillywilly: yeah i guess they like to talk it out but not respond to help :)
<chillywilly> dtm: you need to relax as I am listening and doing things to rectofy it
<chillywilly> but you have a bug up your ass
<nickr> that sounds unpleasent
<dtm> yeah it is
<dtm> chillywilly: as a close dear friend, i'd like to ask you for assistance with this bug up my ass   ;)
<dtm> chillywilly: here     just ... reach..    over there.......
<dtm> NO
<chillywilly> dtm: shutup
<dtm> yeah ok there
<dtm> chillywilly: I LVOE YOU CHILDRYWILY.
<dtm> chillywilly: i'm sorrry i'm all de time so mean to you

<chillywilly> the only one being childish is you
<dtm> :(
<dtm> i'll stop
<chillywilly> I was just trying to get something working you cold've simply said passice mode ftp protocol sucks and left it at that
<dtm> well ok
<dtm> as punishment i will now reinstall macos9.1
<dtm> :[
<chillywilly> again with the sarcasm
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<dtm> no i'm fuh real
<dtm> you weren't even being bad and i was picking on you
<chillywilly> doesn't matter as I am too pissed off to want to ewven talk to you anymore
<dtm> :<
[20:19] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
Action: chillywilly has enough stress
<dtm> yes you do
<nickr> dtm: no, stop, its not worth the torment
<chillywilly> nickr: eh?
<nickr> chillywilly: don't worry be happy
<chillywilly> well I must eat or will pass out
Action: chillywilly feels like shit

<nickr> everyone can look at my cool site though
<nickr> nick.industrialmeats.com
<dtm> which site
<dtm> oh
<dtm> that's one heck of a domain name

<nickr> Three boxes of thin mints.
<nickr> I already ate half of one. I think I need some protien now. :P
<chillywilly> god I feel like shit
<chillywilly> kill me now
Action: jcater shoots in chillywilly's direction
Action: chillywilly falls over dead
<jcater> wait... is WI north-by-northeast of TN right?
<chillywilly> *thud*
<jcater> or just northeast?
Action: nickr posts a rant about ST IV.
<chillywilly> erm
<chillywilly> dunno
<chillywilly> I'd have to look at a map
<nickr> are you sure that WI is NE of TN?
<chillywilly> well it is in thwat direction yes
<chillywilly> I'm not sure what it means to be north-by-northeast
<nickr> its halfway between north and northeast
<chillywilly> ah
Action: chillywilly tries to visualize the us map
<chillywilly> N-by-NE is probably a good assesssment
Action: jcater aims N-by-NE
