<yogurt2unge> hello people I have a problem when I want connect GEAS to Postgres
<reinhard> yogurt2unge: i am here
<reinhard> what is your problem
dtm (dtm@ip22.promontory.sfo.interquest.net) left irc: "brb"
<yogurt2unge> The problem is How to connect to de DB
<yogurt2unge> I created the user in the postgress
<reinhard> yogurt2unge: may i ask what you are planning to do with geas?
<reinhard> use it in production
<reinhard> or play with it
<reinhard> or want to help with development?
<yogurt2unge> I put It is my first time with geas
<reinhard> just to inform you
<reinhard> the geas that is currently in the downloads area
<reinhard> or in cvs
<reinhard> is the "old" incarnation and we have stopped development on that
<reinhard> a complete rewrite from scratch is just about to be started
<reinhard> so i don't want to stop you but i think it could be wasted effort to put time into this "old" geas
<yogurt2unge> Ok, OK, you said that I must download the cvs and try run?
<reinhard> um no
<reinhard> what i wanted to say is
<yogurt2unge> this version "run"? or is to beta?
<reinhard> currently we have no "run" ("production") version of geas
<reinhard> we have that c code we got contributed from a company
<reinhard> which is what you are looking at now
<reinhard> we decided to no longer put efforts into that code
<reinhard> as it's too far away from what we would need
<reinhard> and the rewrite has not yet started
<reinhard> so i guess what i'm saying is
<reinhard> there is no "geas" at the moment
<reinhard> the old has died
<reinhard> the new has not yet been born
<reinhard> but keep your eyes open
<reinhard> the new one will arrive soon :)
<yogurt2unge> Ok, what's "soon" meaning of?
Action: reinhard hides
<reinhard> depends on how many are going to help
<reinhard> currently all of GNU Enterprise is volunteer work
<reinhard> we all do it in our spare time
<yogurt2unge> In this momment my company need to know about any Frameworks to start a project
<yogurt2unge> GNU Enterprise is in focus
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> remember you can use GNU Enterprise in 2-tier and in n-tier mode
<reinhard> 2-tier means forms talks directly to database
<reinhard> this is very usable already
<reinhard> and it _is_ used in production at several places
<reinhard> n-tier means that there is the appserver in between
<yogurt2unge> Yes, It was my first test and based it I made my recomendation
<reinhard> i believe it will be some months until that constellation is usabel in production
<reinhard> however if you and/or your company is willing to help we can speed that up a lot
<reinhard> :)

<reinhard> yogurt2unge: the new incarnation of the application server will be written in python
<reinhard> however python is very easy to learn
<jamest> good day
<reinhard> hey jamest
<reinhard> good morning
<yogurt2unge> Python is very easy, I sow some about it because GNUE is Python

<dneighbo> you cant :)
<dneighbo> actually let me get you a url
<dneighbo> there is some 'precusory' stuff

<dneighbo> if you go to

<hobbes> someone here ?
<reinhard> yes
<hobbes> ok$
<hobbes> I just encountered gnue
<hobbes> most of the docs are real old
<hobbes> my question : is it usable now to manage a small business
<reinhard> hobbes: in a nutshell
<reinhard> gnue is two projects in one
<reinhard> a. create the tools that can be used to build powerful business applications
<reinhard> b. create the powerful business applications themselves
<dneighbo> reinhard really its 3 in 1 :)
<reinhard> we are currently in stage a.
<dneighbo> c. a meta package of GNU that bundles enterprise software for the GNU project :)
<reinhard> dneighbo: ok
<dneighbo> but other than that i agree 100% :)
<reinhard> hobbes: so it all depends what you are wanting to do
<reinhard> if you are looking at a tool that lets you build your own business apps
<reinhard> then you could use gnue for sure
<dneighbo> nutshell, if you are willing to build your own app w/ frame work, what are you waiting for :)
<reinhard> if you are looking for a ready to go accounting package
<dneighbo> if you are wanting to open the box and press the button to have accounting then nope :)
<reinhard> rofl
<dneighbo> DCL and Bayonne are both available and working
<reinhard> at least dneighbo and me agree :)
<hobbes> :-)
Action: reinhard is away: food
<dneighbo> but are not using the framework (this is part c) :) of meta package
<dneighbo> both are getting intergrated into the framework so they are good choices :)
<hobbes> ok, I'm considering creating my small business right now
<hobbes> it would be service to small business for which a full time It staff is not needed
<hobbes> I need accounting, but can do some developpment for it
<hobbes> (I'm not a developper but I know how a relational db system works)
<hobbes> I considered gnucash
<hobbes> but that wouldn't allow me to manage other things (stocks, sales,...)
<hobbes> and encountered gnue
<hobbes> do you think it would be usable with a small investment in development 
<hobbes> or it requires a big investment to be usable ?
<hobbes> (I'd like to use it because I could propose the solution to clients when it's ready)
<hobbes> (clients for which stocks, sales, invoices,... are requisites)
<hobbes> And if ti doesn't work now, approx when will it ?
<hobbes> (1 year, 5 years,...)
<hobbes> ?
<dneighbo> depends
<dneighbo> for example i expect DCL to be ready very soon
<dneighbo> for small business (SERVICE) based consultants
<hobbes> what is DCL ?  :-)))
<dneighbo> like software consultant shops
<dneighbo> dcl.sourceforge.net
<dneighbo> it is like a project management / help desk system
<dneighbo> we are adding strong CRM support into it
<dneighbo> and making it so that the work order side could be used to generate invoices
<dneighbo> i.e. a time entry/crm/billing solution for software consultants (or any service based company)
<dneighbo> it is quite usable today
<drochaid_> WOOOOOO
<hobbes> but now there is no way to do accounting, and it's not expected soon
Nick change: drochaid_ -> drochaid
<drochaid> dneighbo: are you involved with the DCL project?

<jamest> that was old problem on win98 too that we got rid of
<jamest> i think it's safe to say we'd love more
<jamest> help
<jamest> one we get the copyright stuff cleared thru the FSF we can look at getting cvs access setup for you
<btami> nice

<btami> what about reports?
<btami> is there any directions
<btami> or frozen ?

<btami> hungary
<dneighbo> i will give it a few days then call FSF to 'prod' them along if it has not yet arrived
<dneighbo> hobbes that is correct you can not do accounitng out of box today
<hobbes> dneighbo: what level of development is needed ?
<btami> in GNUe?
<hobbes> (I mean : development in gnue, or gnue framework is ready I just have to make my specific apps)
<dneighbo> app developers
<dneighbo> the framework or parts of it are highly usable
<dneighbo> btami as to reports
<dneighbo> the code works
<dneighbo> the biggest hang up is we need to 'define' our tags
<dneighbo> several of us have mentioned some things but no one made a 'proposal'
<dneighbo> once that is done i can do XSLT style sheets against them
<dneighbo> and we will have workign reports :)
<dneighbo> hobbes our framework is designd for BUSINESS ANALYST more thna 'programmers'
<dneighbo> so if you can understand table structures
<dneighbo> and know what you want your app to do
<dneighbo> doing it in GNUe shouldnt be too difficult even for a non 'programmer'
<hobbes> ok thanks, I'll look at it
<btami> dneighbo: can you tell me some words what do you think about 'tags'
<btami> these are about report layout?
<dneighbo> um setup and layout
<dneighbo> so you might hae like
<dneighbo> <title>my foo report</title>
<dneighbo> let me dig up something...
<dneighbo> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/reports.txt
<dneighbo> is something i dummied up when we talked about before in here
<dneighbo> basically that doc isnt what we WANT
<dneighbo> but it helps describe what we are looking for
<dneighbo> im all about starting simple
<dneighbo> and working way into more complex reporting ojbects :)
<btami> I will read
<btami> sometimes I misunderstand things, but if I understand
<btami> I will try a proposal

<dneighbo> i used rescue disk
<chillywilly> doh

<chillywilly> ok
<nickr> derek: noaccel?
<nickr> derek: what kind of card is it again?
<chillywilly> why not?
<dneighbo> noaccel?
<chillywilly> it shouldn't mount it read only
<chillywilly> should be rw
<dneighbo> its a trident/cyberblade i1
<dneighbo> well if i try
<nickr> dneighbo: just a sec
<dneighbo> cp men.good menu.lst
<dneighbo> i get 
Action: chillywilly modified his fstab with the rescue disks before
<dneighbo> cp: cannot create regular file 'menu.lst' : Read-only file system
<chillywilly> like yesterday and shit
<chillywilly> how stupid
<dneighbo> i had this happen before and jamest gave me some brutal mount command (iirc) to fix it
<chillywilly> you did what
<chillywilly> mount /dev/hdX /target ?
<nickr> dneighbo: mount -o remount,rw /
<chillywilly> why is it doing it read only?
<chillywilly> I've never had that happen
<nickr> dneighbo: whats the Driver line in /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 in the Device seciotn
<dneighbo> nickr: give me two seconds trying to reboot
<dneighbo> whoo
<dneighbo> that was close, grub seems to be back in action
<dneighbo> nickr: give me a minute then will paste here the driver info
<dneighbo> iirc
<dneighbo> BoardName "CyberBlade/i1"
<dneighbo> BudID "1:0:0"
<dneighbo> Driver "trident"
<dneighbo> Screen 0
<dneighbo> VendorNAme "Trident"
<dneighbo> where i got that info it said also to add 
<nickr> okay
<dneighbo> Indentifier "Device[0]"
<dneighbo> which didnt work
<nickr> don't worry about that
<dneighbo> so i had to remove it
<chillywilly> everything I have seen says use the fb device
<chillywilly> for that card
<chillywilly> but that is fun to get working isn't it ;)
<nickr> puh Option "NoAccel" "True"
<nickr> in the device section
<nickr> right under driver
<dneighbo> give me a second the reboot barfed on self
<dneighbo> fsck failed
<dneighbo> so trying a manual one and reboot
<dneighbo> man dat was ugly
<nickr> now to figure out what I have that goes wel with vodka
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> if you fix this you want paymentin vodka or us dollars
<nickr> USD, I need to do ltaudry.
<nickr> :)
<chillywilly> bah
<dneighbo> ah
<dneighbo> noaccell freaked it out hard
<nickr> freakid it out!?
<nickr> it should definitely not freak it out
<dneighbo> um scrunched it up and made it blink and go nuts
<chillywilly> because that driver blows dude
<jcater> nickr: given his history
<jcater> freaking out could mean
<dneighbo> in fact it looks almost identical to what happens when you try to toggle between vt's :)
<jcater> "working correctly"
<jcater> :D
<dneighbo> under the driver entry added
<dneighbo> Option "NoAccel" "True"
<dneighbo> thats what you asked for right?
<nickr> yen
<nickr> dneighbo: I'll sell you a rendition card for 20$, problem solved. :)
<dneighbo> pci?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> although I have a nice virge/vx
<nickr> and an MGA
<dneighbo> i uncomment that and it goes back to way it was before
<nickr> hrh
<nickr> thats very strange behavior
<nickr> NoAccell is supposed to make it slow but definietly stable
<dneighbo> two ll's or one
<nickr> one
<nickr> hrm
<chillywilly> read this dude
<chillywilly> talks about you offset pointer problem
<chillywilly> http://www.pairlist.net/pipermail/linux-laptop/2001-November/000314.html
<chillywilly>  had the same problem on a 352Tev. Adding these two lines in the
<chillywilly> XF86Config-4 file in the "Device" section
<chillywilly>        Option "NoAccel"
<chillywilly>        Option "SWCursor"
<nickr> yea.
<dneighbo> so add those two optoins?
<chillywilly> it's amamzing what google will do for you ;)

<nickr> uh oh, sounds like somebody's got a case of the 'mondays'
<chillywilly> that talks about it too
<chillywilly> uh?
<chillywilly> doh that's the same friggin url
Action: chillywilly needs t recopy that
<chillywilly> might want to try this config even
<dneighbo> ok SWCursor
<dneighbo> freaks it out too :(
<chillywilly> http://boreal321.com/vmg/XF86Config
<dneighbo> basically it just throws up a white screen and hangs
<nickr> dneighbo: maybe you have bad hardware, did the card get bent?
<chillywilly> it's onboard
<nickr> get bent, it pays
<chillywilly> they put that thing in a lot of laptops it seems ;)
<nickr> hehe
<dneighbo> nickr: its new hardware (not that it doesnt mean its not bad)
<dneighbo> but its onboard as chilly states so its not real likely that its bent or not 'seated' properly etc :)
<nickr> why did you buy something with the word 'cyber' in it?
<dneighbo> i didnt 
<chillywilly> according to xf4.1.x docs that 'trident' driver is supposed to work with that card
<dneighbo> i bought what i could afford
<dneighbo> chillywilly: thats what i saw too
<dneighbo> but its freaking out
<chillywilly> blech
<nickr> sucks
<nickr> at least its not a SiS
<nickr> this thing is so fucking slow
<nickr> I can't watch dvds on it
Action: chillywilly has an ATI Rage Mobility P/M
<chillywilly> no 3D support yet though :(
<dneighbo> this is supposed to be a 'decent' card from the specs (as on boards go)
Action: nickr has an ati rage pro 128 in his winders box
<nickr> not that that box works
<nickr> currently
jcater (jason@HubA-mcr-24-92-70-39.midsouth.rr.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"

<chillywilly> it's better than a SiS ;)
<nickr> chillywilly: remember that boalrd I broke?
<nickr> chillywilly: do you see an AGP slot on this board? :)
<nickr> thats the board with the SiS on it
<nickr> the AT version of which I'm currently using
<chillywilly> oh
<dneighbo> is it possible lspci -v is giving me back 'bad' info on the card?
<dneighbo> though that chipset seems to support that its trident
<nickr> dneighbo: Not likely.
<chillywilly> nickr: you never used the frame buffer?
<nickr> chillywilly: ?
<chillywilly> I mena do you have experience setting it up
<nickr> chillywilly: my card doesn't seem to work with the sisfb driver
<nickr> oh, yea sure. you just load the correct driver

<chillywilly> man iterfaces
<chillywilly> er, interfaces
<crazymike> fuck man interfaces
<crazymike> i read that thing like 2 times before
<chillywilly> ok, I'll paste mine
<crazymike> and it didn't help me
<chillywilly> # The loopback interface
<chillywilly> #auto lo
<chillywilly> # automatically added when upgrading
<chillywilly> auto lo eth0 ppp0
<chillywilly> iface lo inet loopback
<chillywilly> iface ppp0 inet ppp
<chillywilly>         provider voyager
<chillywilly> iface eth0 inet static
<chillywilly>         address 192.168.1.1
<chillywilly>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike>  iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike> <chillywilly>         address 192.168.1.1
<crazymike> <chillywilly>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike> thats the part I need
<chillywilly> yes
<crazymike> ty
<crazymike> then do I need to take out the part about dhcp???
<chillywilly> yes if you aren't using it anymore
<crazymike> just # that out
<chillywilly> you assgning static IPs now?
<crazymike> then how will I connect to the net???
<crazymike> neverminf
<crazymike> nevermind
<crazymike> no, nevermind the nevermind
<crazymike> it says :
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike>         client dhclient
<chillywilly> yea, you want dhcp if it is dhcp
<crazymike> then I have to do pump -i eth0
<chillywilly> no it should use dhclient for you on boot up
<crazymike> I am setting static IP's
<chillywilly> *if*
<chillywilly> you have eth0 in the 'auto' line
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet ???
<chillywilly> as that specifies what interfaces to bring up on boot
<chillywilly>  iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike> but I don't have dhcp
<crazymike> anymore
<crazymike> right???
<chillywilly> then you want the static one
<chillywilly> I dunno did you change your router fconfig?
<crazymike> i am right now
<chillywilly> ok
<crazymike> doing both at once
<chillywilly> then you can use my previous static example
<crazymike> # /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)
<crazymike> # The loopback interface
<crazymike> # automatically added when upgrading
<crazymike> auto lo
<crazymike> iface lo inet loopback
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike>         client dhclient
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike> thats what I ahve right now
<chillywilly> add eth0 to the 'auto' line
<chillywilly> auto lo eth0
<chillywilly> like that
<crazymike>  auto lo eth0
<chillywilly> ye[
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> er, yep
<crazymike> # /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)
<crazymike> # The loopback interface
<crazymike> # automatically added when upgrading
<crazymike> auto lo eth0
<crazymike> iface lo inet loopback
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike>         client dhclient
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike> so I still want the dhcp part in there or not???
<chillywilly> on
<crazymike> I can edit that out, right
<chillywilly> er, no
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> comment it out
<chillywilly> or remove it
<chillywilly> you can't deifne the same interface twice ;)
<crazymike> #iface eth0 inet dhcp
<crazymike>         client dhclient
<crazymike> just that part, right
<crazymike> the rest stays
<chillywilly> no, both lines
<chillywilly> otherwise it will get confused
<crazymike> oh, I thought that took care of both, hence the tab
<crazymike> but ok
<chillywilly> then you gotta go configure your dad's and sisters box's
<chillywilly> er, sister's box
<crazymike> my sister isn't online
<chillywilly> give them static IPs
<crazymike> she just ahs a computer
<crazymike> s/ahs/has
<chillywilly> well when they want to use it they won't be able to unless you set their shit up
<dneighbo> well i got it to accept SWCursor
<chillywilly> oh, ok
<chillywilly> dneighbo: cool
<dneighbo> copied someone elses X file
<dneighbo> from a NON DEBIAN machine
<dneighbo> i think debconf is loading some modules up front that kill some of the options
<chillywilly> probably
<chillywilly> BUT
<dneighbo> i still cant 'toggle' between vt's with this setup
<chillywilly> you can choose which ones
<dneighbo> but we will see if it fixes the cursor issue
Action: chillywilly thinks this channel should be #debian-support
<dneighbo> if so i can live with it for now until i find some X bad ass that can explain things to me
<dneighbo> tempted to try the no accel now
<chillywilly> maybe I should start my own support channel
<crazymike> lol
<crazymike> you should
<dneighbo> two other things
<chillywilly> gnu-linux-support
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> #gnu-linux-support
<dneighbo> a. it fixed my LARGE font gripe (yeah)
<dneighbo> b. it got rid of the 'flickering'
<dneighbo> if it
<dneighbo> c. fixes cursor
<dneighbo> i will be happy
<dneighbo> then if i can figure out vt
<dneighbo> i will be set :)
<dneighbo> though it appears to still be in 800x600
<dneighbo> NOT cool
<dneighbo> slowly but surely i will get there
<dneighbo> i just need to get it to point where im not getting support calls at work for the 'fscked up mouse'
<crazymike> for packet forwarding, do I ahve to forward the pop3 port or will it still do that automatically, for e-mail???
<chillywilly> dneighbo: what do you think of starting a *good* help channel
<dneighbo> btw: syphleed wont work for my wife :(
<chillywilly> why not?
<chillywilly> crazymike: you will be good
<crazymike> do I only need to set the FTP port
<dneighbo> as it doesnt display html mail fully and doesnt support clicking on email :(
<chillywilly> crazymike: yes
<dneighbo> so installed evolution for her
<crazymike> ok
<dneighbo> will see how it goes
<dneighbo> chillywilly: sounds good to me
<chillywilly> cause it is a 'serever' and will accept incoming requests
<crazymike> I'll brb...got to restart my computer
<crazymike> see if the net still works
<chillywilly> crazymike: you have ip forwarding turned on?
<crazymike> yeah
<chillywilly> (in your router)
<chillywilly> ok
<crazymike> I just set it to forward port 21 to my IP
<chillywilly> you need to forward the ftp port
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> also
<crazymike> then set my IP
<crazymike> and turned off DHCP
<chillywilly> I think you need to forward the data port
<chillywilly> I thin ftp uses 2 ports
<chillywilly> ftp-data  20/tcp
<chillywilly> ftp   21/tcp
<chillywilly> forwrad both of those
<chillywilly> to your IP

<crazymike> forget that last line
<crazymike> that didn;t work
<crazymike> forget all that shit
<chillywilly> crazymike: just see /etc/services ;)

<crazymike> 20, and 21
<chillywilly> uhuh

<chillywilly> wb crazymike
<crazymike> hi
<chillywilly> how goes it?
<crazymike> the internet still works
<chillywilly> can you do an ifconfig and see the interface up?
<crazymike> but I had to type dhclient
<chillywilly> er, did you haev to bring it up manually?
<crazymike> yeah
<chillywilly> blah
<chillywilly> thought you turned dhcp off
<chillywilly> also dude you need to set the router IP as your gateway then if you use static
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> like
<chillywilly> gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
<chillywilly> in the static interface definition part
Action: chillywilly forgot about that
<chillywilly> but seems the thing is still talking dhcp
<crazymike> whats the easiest way to find out my IP
<crazymike> the other one
<chillywilly> ifconfig
<crazymike> I just saw it but don't know where
<chillywilly> er?
<chillywilly> which one?
<crazymike> the house IP
<chillywilly> for the router
<chillywilly> the public IP?
<crazymike> yeah
<crazymike> the public
<chillywilly> crazymike@mke-65-31-133-230.wi.rr.com
<chillywilly> I guess it is 65.31.133.230 ;)
Action: chillywilly pings it
<crazymike> cool, thanks
<chillywilly> you are squashing ICMP packets though
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike>         gateway 65.31.133.230
<chillywilly> no silly
<crazymike> whats that mean
<chillywilly> you need the router's provate IP
<crazymike> oh
<chillywilly> not thw public one
<crazymike> 192.168.1.1
<chillywilly> it make all the hosts on your network look like packets come from that
<crazymike> like that
<chillywilly> then
<chillywilly> it reverses it and delivers stuff back to your orivate IPS
<chillywilly> you dig?
<chillywilly> that's called NAT
<crazymike> ok
<chillywilly> Network Address Translation
<chillywilly> (ip forwarding)
<crazymike> iface eth0 inet static
<crazymike>         address 192.168.1.101
<crazymike>         netmask 255.255.255.0
<crazymike>         gateway 192.168.1.1
<chillywilly> bingo ;)
<chillywilly> did they cover the packet format i your networking class yet?
<chillywilly> like what IP packet headers look like
<chillywilly> (roughly)
<chillywilly> basically it pull the private IP off the packet and slaps on the public one and delivers it
<chillywilly> then it does the reverse
<chillywilly> yanks off the public IP and put the private back on and delivers it locally
<crazymike> kind of

<chillywilly> how goes it?
<crazymike> it goes
<chillywilly> net connection?
<crazymike> yup
<chillywilly> wooooo!
<chillywilly> you da man!
<crazymike> no, you da man, niggie
<chillywilly> sheeeet
<crazymike> Gftp...will that allow me to setup an FTP???
<crazymike> or is it done somewhere else in Linux??
<chillywilly> gftp is a 'client' dude
<chillywilly> you need to install an ftp server
<chillywilly> (daemon)
<crazymike> well, alot of the clients for Windows, serve dual purpose
<crazymike> client/server
<crazymike> not alot but some, I should say
<chillywilly> well gftp is only a client
<chillywilly> as is ncftp
<crazymike> thats what I was asking
<chillywilly> althought there is ncftpd
<chillywilly> which is a server
<dneighbo> ok have tools now i need to work for an hour or so i guess :)
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> crazymike: okey dokey smokey
<chillywilly> crazymike: I;m not sure what the best ftp server is to use
<crazymike> wu-ftpd
<chillywilly> sure
<chillywilly> that'll work
<nickr> I should hook up the subwoofer and play tnhe THX sound as loud as it goes
<chillywilly> heheh
<crazymike> my book says that is the most popular :)
<chillywilly> there's also proftpd
<chillywilly> or just plain ftpd
<crazymike> I am getting wu=ftpd right now
<crazymike> it says ftpd sucks
<chillywilly> wuftp has a config program
<chillywilly> well a couple actually
<chillywilly> kwuftpd - wu-ftpd configuration tool
<chillywilly> webmin-wuftpd - wu-ftpd control module for webmin
<chillywilly> or you can be a real hacker and read your book and edit the files with vi
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> (or emacs)
<nickr> wuftpd? sacre vache!
<chillywilly> what's good nickr?
<nickr> hrm
<chillywilly> proftpd?
<chillywilly> ftpd suposedly blows goats
<chillywilly> er, supposedly
<nickr> well it depends on what you want
<chillywilly> he wants to run anon ftp off his computer to server up gufs shows
<chillywilly> etc.
<chillywilly> off his cable modem
<nickr> um gnutella?
<nickr> :)
<chillywilly> er, no
<chillywilly> woah
<chillywilly> there's a shit load of ftp servers
<dneighbo> um why run ftp?
<nickr> how about ..
<nickr> um
<chillywilly> crazymike: do apt-cache search ftpd
<nickr> muddleftp!
<nickr> lukemftp!
<dneighbo> why not use http?
<chillywilly> dneighbo: what should he run?
<nickr> +d
<dneighbo> http
<dneighbo> or
<dneighbo> scp
<nickr> vsftpd!
<dneighbo> if need anonymous file transfer use http
<chillywilly> it's for anonymous downloads
<nickr> http is much better for just downloady shit
<dneighbo> if you need authenticated use scp
<chillywilly> http is not as good as ftp
<nickr> just get freaking gn
<chillywilly> gn?
<dneighbo> just ftp is one more security hole
<nickr> chillywilly: based on what criteria?
<dneighbo> easier to just use http
<dneighbo> also almost everyone has a browser
<dneighbo> not everyone an ftp client
<nickr> chillywilly: its faster, lighter weight, can go though hostile firewalls, requires no authentication or dangerous trickery
<nickr> chillywilly: its universally supported
<chillywilly> http can't go through a firewall any better
<dneighbo> i would say if you merely want anon ftp dont use ftp :)
<dneighbo> use http
<dneighbo> chillywilly: sure it can
<chillywilly> you still have to open the http port
<dneighbo> at my work port 80 is open
<dneighbo> port 21 is not
<chillywilly> well whatever
<chillywilly> he wanted to run ftp
<dneighbo> just saying ftp is a liabilty
<nickr> for just downloads there are a lot of compelling reasons to use http over ftp
<dneighbo> and personally i would avoid unless some good reason (like legacy application or some special need)
<dneighbo> chillywilly: hell i bet you get your debs via http instead of ftp ;)
<chillywilly> well I know it's a potential security hole
<chillywilly> indeed I do
<chillywilly> crazymike: maybe you should setup apache ;)
<chillywilly> so these guys will shutup
<chillywilly> ;p
<crazymike> ummm...ok
<nickr> ne
<nickr> no
<crazymike> I don't care as long as it works
<nickr> apache is complicated and easy to break
<chillywilly> oh plz
<crazymike> and I don't know shit except what you guys tell me to do :)
<chillywilly> the default config is fine
Action: crazymike is stupid!!!
<nickr> try boa
<chillywilly> you setup apache
<chillywilly> put the files in /var/www/
<chillywilly> bingo bango
<chillywilly> you're done
<nickr> or thttpe
<nickr> thttpe
<chillywilly> no, apache
<nickr> thttpd
<nickr> damnit
<nickr> or wn
<chillywilly> piss on those other ones
<nickr> wn is really good, you just have to generate explicit indexes
<chillywilly> crazymike: apt-get isntall apache
<chillywilly> er, install
Action: crazymike ducks under the punches everyone is throwing at each other
<nickr> chillywilly: wtf is with you an apache? are you like getting excellent oral sex from it or something?
<crazymike> so should I get it or not???
<crazymike> AHAHAHAHAHA
<chillywilly> hell yea and you're a jealous little bitch nickr

<chillywilly> crazymike: who's going to help you out eh?
<crazymike> chillywilly: thats true
<chillywilly> who's your bro eh?
<chillywilly> don;t listen to this little chuckle head
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> that was a funny exchange
<dneighbo> <nickr> chillywilly: wtf is with you an apache? are you like getting excellent oral sex from it or something?
Action: crazymike is apt-getting some shit
<dneighbo> has got to be the quote of the nite
Action: nickr boms
<nickr> bows
Action: chillywilly thought his response to that was better
<chillywilly> [23:27:22] <chillywilly> hell yea and you're a jealous little bitch nickr
<dneighbo> chillywilly: mind tell me the source-list for that ;oral sex; apache?
<chillywilly> no

<crazymike> apt-get install apache-oralpleasure
<dneighbo> isntall apache

<crazymike> chillywilly: how do I set this bitch up
chillywilly (~danielb@d70.as28.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<crazymike> derek: what did you do to chillywilly
Topic changed on #gnuenterprise by derek!~derek@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net: Install ftp, get bitch slapped!  Just Released... 'Apache-Oral-Pleasure'....

Topic changed on #gnuenterprise by derek!~derek@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net: GNUe... Its where you go for debian support when #debian wont cut it..
<chillywilly> roflmao
<crazymike> chillywilly: how do I set this bitch up
<chillywilly> umm did it start it up?
<nickr> derek: 'when #debian won't cut it ... which is always'
<chillywilly> you just need to copy files to /var/www and they need to have proper permissions (chmod 644 should be good enough)
<crazymike> it installed (i think) but nothing started up
<derek> nickr: i was trying to be polite :)
<chillywilly> /etc/init.d/apache start
<crazymike> i don't have that much space on this drive for that shit
<derek> the topic inthere when i was trying to get help tonight
<derek> was
<chillywilly> crazymike: make a symlink then
<derek> 'i wish apt could apt-grow weed'
<derek> or something like that
<crazymike> it says it is already started, I guess
<chillywilly> cd /var
<crazymike> I dunno
<chillywilly> mv www www.old
<nickr> derek: that would be a time saver
<chillywilly> ln -s /wgere/Igots/my/shiznit/at www
<chillywilly> cd ..
<chillywilly> chmod 755 www
<crazymike>  ln -s /wgere/Igots/my/shiznit/at www
<chillywilly> cd www
<crazymike> lol
<chillywilly> chmod 644 *
<chillywilly> then I would get a dyndns.org host name
<chillywilly> and set it up
<crazymike> where do I put the link though
<chillywilly> cd /var
<crazymike> in www
<crazymike> just in cd /var
<crazymike> ???
<chillywilly> no in /var
<chillywilly> mv www www.old
<derek> Q:WHY DOES THE EASTER BUNNY HIDE HIS EGGS?
<derek> A:HE DOESN'T WANT TO ADMIT HE HAS BEEN SCREWING A CHICKEN
<chillywilly> then make a link to your www
<nickr> hahaa
