<derek> jcater: have you followed wxUniversal at all
<jcater> not recentlyt
dtm (dtm@ip22.promontory.sfo.interquest.net) left irc: "upgrade to 2.4.17  ;)"
<derek>  The advantage of wxUniversal is that you have precise control over the
<derek> controls' appearance (it is not always possible to change all aspects of the
<derek> native controls) and the theme support: the same program may be changed to
<derek> look completely differently without changing a single line of its code but
<derek> just changing the theme.
<derek>  Another advantage is that it makes writing ports of wxWindows for other
<derek> platforms (such as OS/2, BeOS or QNX) much simpler, so it is of special
<derek> interest to people interested in porting wxWindows to another platform.
<derek>  However, wxUniversal doesn't have a 100% native look and feel unlike the
<derek> other wxWindows ports - this is the price to pay for the extra flexibility.
<derek> i thought on the list they were talking about working QNX
<derek> gnue forms on a Sharp Zaurus would just be an ass kicker

<nickr> you really should use magicpoint
<nickr> magicpoint is awes-ome
<derek> magicpoint is cool how it broadcasts to other machines
<derek> but its a pain to EASILY setup a presentation
<derek> you have to 'learn' magic point
<chillywilly> heh on the linux show
<nickr> its not like its hard to learn

<chillywilly> they said that RMS's stalin-like way of running the FSF has driven the original founders away

<chillywilly> due I have been meaning to set that up
<chillywilly> but I am lazy
<chillywilly> er, dude
<nickr> i have it just notating spam, and it makes recieving spam interesting :)
<chillywilly> it didn't look very intuitive to setup
<nickr> Pretty soon I'll sort all the notated spam into asseparate folder
<nickr> Its not hard. We're using postfix with procmail local delivery
<chillywilly> not exim?
<nickr> god no.
<chillywilly> why not?
<chillywilly> who is *we8?

<nickr> different friend though

<chillywilly> er, they don't
<nickr> the swetlost guy does
<nickr> the other one is getting me a job at his dayjob
<chillywilly> in OR?
<nickr> well he pays me in a sense, the svetlost guy, right now I've used up all the money he payed me and he treats me to lunch every other day
<nickr> yea in OR
<chillywilly> well a man needs more than one meal a day
<nickr> everyotherday
<nickr> I have some food stores. He also lets me get stuff at costco sometimes.
<chillywilly> how much work you doing for this guy?
<nickr> I'm tired of the arrangement though.
<nickr> Well, I manage the box and I've been working on a webs-ite 
<chillywilly> you need tot all him to show you the money
<chillywilly> er, tell
<chillywilly> ;P
<nickr> Heh. I don't rceally think thats justified fiven the amount of money he has given me dircetly and indirectly
<chillywilly> well why are you so broke then?
<chillywilly> and have no food
<chillywilly> you buying weed with that money
<nickr> because I've been in this arrangement for 8 months :)
<chillywilly> ;)
<nickr> And all the money I got was spent over 4 months ago
<chillywilly> don't you have any cash flow right now?
<nickr> No.
<chillywilly> but you are still doing tech support?
<nickr> Yes, I think a few meals a week is worth what I do for him.
<nickr> which isn't that much.
<chillywilly> well what foes that entail....I still think you are getting gipped
<chillywilly> er, does
<chillywilly> mike says why do you keep assuming the position for that guy
<nickr> It doesnt't matter, I'm not gonna get any money from dhim so I'm satisfied with the situation given that I hopefully will have a fulltime job in a month

<chillywilly> ok, so how to I setup spamassassin
Action: chillywilly is too lazt to rtfm
<chillywilly> er, lazy
<nickr> in exim?
<nickr> I have no idea
<nickr> You can probably call procmail from your .forward and then call spamassasin from there
<chillywilly> well exim calls procmail form it's config out of the box
<chillywilly> er, from
<nickr> okay, then add this to your .procmailrc:
<chillywilly> hmmm, I suppse I could use a .forward file
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> shoot
<nickr> :0fw
<nickr> | spamassassin -P -p ~/.spamassassin/local.cf
<nickr> :0e
<nickr> {   
<nickr>     EXITCODE=$?
<nickr> }
<nickr> except without the -p 
<nickr> -p ...
<nickr> rather
<chillywilly> ummmm
<chillywilly> you mean wihtout the -p and everything after it?
<nickr> yes
<chillywilly> | spamassassin -P
<chillywilly> liek that./
<chillywilly> doh
<chillywilly> I don't like this laptop keyboard
<nickr> yea
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> any other specialization I should do?
<nickr> nope
<chillywilly> alright lemme try this biz0tch out
<nickr> now all your messages will get an X-Spam-Status header
<nickr> hopefully
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> which you can filter on right>?
<chillywilly> with procmil
<chillywilly> er, procmail
<nickr> yea
<nickr> Its probably a cgood idea ot let it go and  see if its filtering works for you
<chillywilly> wlel yea
<chillywilly> well
<nickr> once you've used it for a while you can decide which score to require, and then filter it into a separate folder
<chillywilly> they get scored?
<chillywilly> based on spamness or something ;)
<nickr> yes
<nickr> the default required score is 5
<chillywilly> cool
<nickr> I'm thinking of lowering my to 3
<nickr> each rule has a certain score associated with it that you can adjust too
<chillywilly> ok, holf on stop typing so I can copy this easier ;)
<chillywilly> er, hold
<chillywilly> hmmm, how can I test this
<chillywilly> btw, I put it before all my other filters
<chillywilly> is that how you do it or is it best to be at the end?
<nickr> at the beginning
<chillywilly> ok
<nickr> all your mails should have X-Spam-Status hedaers now
<chillywilly> hmmm, ok
<chillywilly> what is the name of that algorithm that spamassassin uses?
<nickr> It uses lots of different ones
<nickr> afaik
<nickr> it passes a lot of rules over the message
<chillywilly> something sabout razor
<nickr> each rule has a score
<nickr> it can use razor also
<nickr> razor is a distributed message hash thing
<chillywilly> alrighty
<chillywilly> X-Spam-Status: No, hits=-4.0 required=5.0 tests=IN_REP_TO,TO_LOCALPART_EQ_REAL version=2.11
<chillywilly> on a recent Hurd message
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: chillywilly wants to get some spam so he can see what it does
<nickr> do you get spam normally?
<chillywilly> hellz yea
<chillywilly> too much bs
<chillywilly> especially sine I went through this credit counseling place
<chillywilly> the hurd lists of course get soammed as you should now
<chillywilly> er, know
<chillywilly> spammed
<nickr> well its just a matter of waiting then
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> btw, how does spam get to you if it is not even adressed to you?
<chillywilly> I knwo the the list admin adresses would spam everyone
<chillywilly> but sometimes I just get spam with not to header that is not from a list admin address
<chillywilly> s/not/no
<nickr> the envelope to is to you, even though theres no To header
<nickr> the spammer's mta is devilering it directly to yours
<chillywilly> oh
<nickr> dingdingding
<nickr> 2 N   Mar 14 DIGITAL CLON    (   0) *****SPAM***** CD?????????? ???? ?? ???????? CD???? ?? ???? 170??????????[????]
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> it changes the subject too eh?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> you can set it not to
<chillywilly> does spamass collect stat?
<nickr> it adds a detailed report of the rules to the body, also
<chillywilly> er, stats
<nickr> I don't know.
Action: chillywilly thinks it should literally assassinate spammers
<chillywilly> it should issues mob hits out on them
<nickr> when the internet is a place for secure, ananymous, difgital tarnasactions, that'll be possible
<nickr> digital transactions
<nickr> wow, rleally biffed that one
<chillywilly> you type like me
<chillywilly> anyway, that wouldn't be possible if it was anonymous
<nickr> why?
<chillywilly> you wouldn't know who was spamming you
<chillywilly> ;P
<nickr> no, the money moving is the anonymous part
<nickr> the spam is still nonymous
<nickr> huh

<dneighbo> hi mdean 
<mdean> high
<mdean> 2 sick kids today
<mdean> tho I think one of them is feigning illness
<mdean> got 2 offers to help develop features today
<mdean> you probably saw one of them via the dev list
<dneighbo> right
<dneighbo> im a little leary of that one
<dneighbo> i think we want RBAC
<dneighbo> but im either pro
<dneighbo> a. do it right even if it takes a long time
Yurik (~yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> b. do a hack to meet current needs knowing it needs to be done right eventually
<dneighbo> this is kind of a middle of road approach
<dneighbo> it seems more thought out than 'quick hack'
<dneighbo> but i dont think its the 'long term'
<mdean> I think he'll go for RBAC
<dneighbo> the key is getting them to buy into dcl vision :)
<mdean> what he described is more like a cross between rbac and acl
<dneighbo> right
<dneighbo> curious as to what other call to help is
<dneighbo> fwiw: i htink i about have all my ducks in a row at home
<dneighbo> so will be continuing DCL screens ASAP
<mdean> Particular things I'd like to work on to start are
<mdean> authentication, enhanced configuration, and additional
<mdean> look-and-feel template sets. These are things I'd like to
<mdean> work with the DCL developers on, rather than go off and do

<mdean> where possible.

<psu> ok, official style guide now
<Yurik> chillywilly hi
<chillywilly> reinhard sup
<reinhard> hey chillywilly
<dneighbo> mdean thats cool
<chillywilly> what do you mean by tree query thing?
<reinhard> i don't know
<reinhard> i just know that it is there in common :)
<psu> I always in KC refer to "GNUe Forms", "GNUe Application Server" etc
Action: psu is back
<reinhard> psu that's perfect
<psu> is it now "GNUe DCL"?
<psu> ;-)
<reinhard> lol
<mdean> hmmmm
<mdean> I'm not sure how we should approach that...
<mdean> jcater!!!!!!!!!!!!
<mdean> chillywilly!!!!!!!!!
<psu> mdean: actually, that's more a proprietary s/w trick
Action: mdean sits in awe of the sudden outburst of threads...
<psu> Thanks to the wonders of GPL, I guess it can never become "Microsoft DCL"
<chillywilly> er, query tree
Action: psu runs 
<chillywilly> mdean !
<mdean> chillywilly!
<chillywilly> reinhard where is the code for that at?
<dneighbo> psu for now call it DCL
<chillywilly> (the query tree)
<dneighbo> we havent worked out specifics of GNUe DCL
<dneighbo> i imagine as it advances it will be
<dneighbo> GNUe HelpDesk
<dneighbo> GNUe Project Managment
<dneighbo> or something
<dneighbo> but we are a ways off from that :)
Action: reinhard figures he should'nt talk about things he doesn't know about
<mdean> it's a tricky thing, since DCL has built its own brand
<dneighbo> i think initially DCL is like Bayonne in that its a project under GNUe
<dneighbo> but it slowly will start to get GNUe front ends (but still keep its back ends)
<reinhard> chillywilly: i know about those query trees from IRC talks with jcater and jamest
<reinhard> i haven't looked at the code at all
<dneighbo> and then over time start to use contacts module of gnue
<reinhard> plus i said "i'm not sure" or something like that
<dneighbo> accounting module of gnue 
<dneighbo> invoice etc etc
<dneighbo> where then it will be much more of a 'hybrid'
<dneighbo> ultimately its up to mdean
<dneighbo> im cool with GNUe DCL
<dneighbo> or DCL
<dneighbo> or even my mommas underpants :)
<dneighbo> as long as it continues to evolve :)
<mdean> I would reserve GNUe DCL for a GNUe framework implementation
<dneighbo> mdean: i tend to agree
<mdean> like your DCL forms
<reinhard> chillywilly: so i guess what i wanted to express is "be careful with assuming we will use OQL it's not yet set in stone"
<dneighbo> basically there are still tons of steps :)
<chillywilly> reinhard well, this is what I was saying before that the interface to the app server would be different than the interfaces to the elational back ends as we give objects out not 'records'
<dneighbo> but the first and biggest has been taken
Action: mdean nods
<chillywilly> reinhard ok
<dneighbo> and that is to work together on a much deeper level than just acknowledging one anothers projects as a nicety
<dneighbo> but rather immerse the visions of both projects into a reality (how about that for marketing spew)
<chillywilly> can someone explain what these query trees are?
<dneighbo> psu causes it by the way... as i know i will be quoted :)
<dneighbo> j/k
<dneighbo> chillywilly its a way to build a complex query
<dneighbo> like
<mdean> hehe
<dneighbo> select my.foo, your.foo, his.from from my, your, his where my.foo > your.foo AND his.foo=my.foo
<dneighbo> etc etc
<chillywilly> reinhard btw, OQL does more thasn just query it can invoike methods and create objects
<chillywilly> dneighbo ok
<dneighbo> at least thats how i understoood it from teh conversation
<dneighbo> its an EASY way to build queries on the fly
<dneighbo> w/o knowing SQL but rather passing some values into the tree
<chillywilly> reinhard and those methods can be invoked at runtime (you get polymorphism with it)
<dneighbo> er that was said kind of wrong, but hopefully you get what i meant
<chillywilly> er, I mean you can call methods of a parent interface and have it pick the right methods of the runtime type
<reinhard> chillywilly: that is not API, that's behaviour
<chillywilly> I know that
<reinhard> the api is how you tell it to call a method
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> sorry i'm so stubborn
<reinhard> only wanting to talk about api at the moment
<reinhard> :)

<reinhard> jcater: thanks a lot
<jcater> ;)
<chillywilly> well there's no real point of me talking about it without writing something down so that's why I said it is all heresay
<chillywilly> hello?
<chillywilly> did everyone die?
<jcater> hi
<reinhard> no just working
<chillywilly> on what?

Action: mdean is too
Action: jcater is cussing out his users
<mdean> hehehe
Action: Yurik will go to wife beta version shortly
<jcater> beta wife?
<jcater> you mean you get to test and make suggestions?
Action: jcater is jealous
<mdean> not yet ready for release?
<reinhard> look at the interface?
<mdean> has bugs? 
<chillywilly> ew
<Yurik> well, just not became official wife :)
<reinhard> mdean: lol
<Yurik> thus beta :)
<reinhard> Yurik: may i warn you to upgrade from girlfriend 5.0 to wife 1.0
<Yurik> reinhard: :-)
<reinhard> wife 1.0 is incompatible with many other applications
<reinhard> like beer 2.5

<jcater> just make sure you have girlfriend 4.0 completely uninstalled before performing the upgrade
<Yurik> lol
<Yurik> s/tamp/stamp/
<mdean> chillywilly: sex 3.1 has bugs...you should downgrade to sex 3.0
<Yurik> cu later, dudes

<Mr_You> re
<Mr_You> In regards to the packages discussion week or so ago.. seems to me, how would I get real functionality with just a 2-tier app?
<Mr_You> ie. its just a data in/out app, not much functionality beyond that.
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
sjc__ (~sjc@modem-2271.cougar.dialup.pol.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Mr_You> hi psu and sjc
<psu> hi Mr_You
<sjc__> Mr_You: Hi
Action: psu is away: busy filing paperwork - but still lurking
<jcater> Mr_You: there's no less functionality than in n-tier mode
<jcater> it's just where does the functionality lie
<jcater> lay
<jcater> or whatever
Action: psu is back
<Mr_You> so how do I get "external" functionality?  such as, data is inputed, email of data is sent
<Mr_You> without having something monitor the database tables
<psu> Mr_You: I would guess that you would attatch a trigger to something on the form
<psu> e.,g the submnit button
<psu> & write some python to do it
<jcater> yes
<jcater> it would be no different than in n-tier mode
<nickr> you could put a pl/sql trigger in no?
Action: psu has a "Python for bozos" book on the shelf but hasn;t read it properly yet
<jcater> in n-tier you have triggers watching transactions at the middle-ware level
<nickr> psu: are you a bozo?
<jcater> well in 2-tier you either move that to the database-leve (with database triggers) or you move it to the clients
<psu> nickr: problem with a pl/sql trigger is that it is d/b specific
<psu> a forms trigger will work with any back end 
<nickr> true, true.
<psu> nickr:  no, but I play one on irc ;-)
<Mr_You> how would a trigger execute code?
<jcater> that's what a trigger is
<jcater> code
<Mr_You> ok, hmm I thought a trigger was db code.. I'm talking about python or perl or script or whatever..
<Mr_You> or whatever I need to do to interface with mail, etc.
<jcater> that'd be at the forms/client level, then
<nickr> you just have the form call a python thing that does it
<Mr_You> ok, and that is builtin to GNUe Forms functionality right now?
<nickr> the reason I liked the database level trigger is you only have to deal with sending mail in one spot then and get mail working on one computer
<psu> nickr: agreed. 
<Mr_You> actually.. it would require to be on the server side because of multiple clients no?  I couldn't expect a form to know how to send email from wintel and unix, no?
<jcater> nickr: when that's a big deal for my stuff, I just have an xml-rpc instance running on the server to listen for those events
<nickr> jcater: that makes sense
<nickr> as I was typing it I thought of a way to do it client neutraly
<nickr> you could have like a webform email thing and url encode it.
<nickr> its hacky though.
<jcater> well, truth be known, I don't have a client-server setup
<jcater> I have a host-based setup
<jcater> I either use (in the old system) telnet sessions to run curses based forms
<jcater> or (in the new system) I have all LTSP clients running off the main server
<jcater> but that's just my setup :)
<jcater> ymmv
<Mr_You> with DB triggers, is there a "mail function" or a method of executing external scripts?
<jcater> it all depends on the database
<Mr_You> postgres
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> I'm sure there is
<jcater> but I don't use that in prodcution yet
<nickr> postgres you can embed a perl scrip.t
<nickr> or a pl/sql script
<nickr> I know in perl its pretty easy to send mail :)
<Mr_You> ok.. hmm.

<dneighbo> if the registry wasnt bad enough
<dneighbo> they want to make the file system an object database?
<dneighbo> egads
<dneighbo> the horror
Action: dneighbo thinks its mostly a ploy to:
<dneighbo> a. distract free software developers (like .net)
<dneighbo> b. way to get people to pay for upgrades by BREAKING old products (like .net)
<dneighbo> c. way to further lock out free software developers with proprietary and evil APIs (like .net)
<dneighbo> i.e. .net was the web services attack
<dneighbo> this new file system would be the hardware/os api attack
<dneighbo> i think it MIGHT back fire on them

<Mr_You> derek: Oracle thinks the same way
<Mr_You> and I think MySQL is working on a file system.
<Mr_You> hmm neat. Mini-ITX Form Factor, I see a motherboard but first I've heard about it, wonder if any cases are out yet
<Mr_You> http://www.via.com.tw/en/VInternet/mini_itx.jsp
<dneighbo> im not saying m$ is crazy in that regards
<dneighbo> oracle pronounced the idea first (from recent companies that are large) about 3 years ago i think
<dneighbo> if not longer ago
<dneighbo> my point is faster 'searching' at the cost of having in a db is not a trade i want to make :)
<dneighbo> example: registry
<dneighbo> i mean registry has 1,000 pluses compared to config/ini files on PAPER
<dneighbo> but in practicality
<dneighbo> how many times has a bad entry in your apache.conf or smb.conf
<dneighbo> rendered your machine SCREWED
<dneighbo> compared to times a bad or corrupt registry put you 'panic' mode
<dneighbo> ask ToyMan_ about good ole Access (m$ leading db technology for the most part) though mssql is getting comparalbe to others
<dneighbo> and ask him if he wants the same 'studs' that made access turing his file system into a database ;)
<Mr_You> and it seems Oracle has had no success 
<Mr_You> to the extent they wanted that is
<Mr_You> Oracle is basicly everything except the OS now, it seems.

<chillywilly> wtf is that?
<nickr> chillywilly: put your client in passive mode
<chillywilly> netbois, hrrrm
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> what is th difference anyway?
<jcater> passive doesn't open up another port on the server machine
<chillywilly> ah
<jcater> important for firewalls
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> I see
<chillywilly> why does it open another one?
<chillywilly> one for ftp data
<chillywilly> ?
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> I didn't design the original ftp
<chillywilly> how do I make ncftp do it
<jcater> or any subsequent for that matter
<nickr> passive doesn't open another on the CLIENT
<chillywilly> I know
<jcater> is it a command line prog?
<chillywilly> yep
<jcater> passv
<jcater> usually
<nickr> see, normally FTP the client side opens a port and listens for the server to push the data
<chillywilly> hrrrm, ok
<chillywilly> why would it bitc that there's no route to host?
<chillywilly> er, bitch
<dtm> *)@#
<nickr> in passive mode, the client lets the server open a port which it connects to
<dtm> ftp doesn't use udp.
<dtm> fyi
<chillywilly> dtm: you're a bit late
<dtm> yeah
<dtm> just a second opinion.
<dtm> except it's not an opinion.  I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE #@*)'S GOING ON.
<dtm> :)  heheh
<chillywilly> nickr: I see...in active mode does the client pick some random port number?
<nickr> yea
<chillywilly> that's a problem then
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> now f I could figure out how to make ncfto use passive mode
<chillywilly> er, if
<jcater> ah
<jcater> I had it backwards
<jcater> oh, well
<nickr>  passive
<jcater> nickr seems to know :)
<chillywilly> that makes sense though
<chillywilly> it is passive
<chillywilly> and therefore does not take any action
<dtm> chillywilly: 'man ncftp' and search for passivE!
<dtm> or start ncftp and do 'help'
<chillywilly> did that dude
<dtm> it's technical.
<chillywilly> that was the frist thing
<dtm> no doubt
<dtm> :)
Action: chillywilly uses info
<chillywilly> set passive on
<chillywilly> yay ;)
<chillywilly> damn
<chillywilly> it is still bitched
<chillywilly> might be my fucked up config
<chillywilly> hrrrm, I see why now
<chillywilly> it is using a private IP back to make the connection
<chillywilly> ftp> ls
<chillywilly> 227 Entering Passive Mode (192,168,1,101,130,69).
<chillywilly> which results in no route to host
<dtm> chillywilly: are you loading your ip masq module?
<chillywilly> he has this friggin linksys router
<dtm> @#*)
<chillywilly> I can ssh into his box
<dtm> well i'd think that the linksys should work though, or at worst would have an option to fix it in its stupid web gui admin tool
<chillywilly> he can reach the outside work and vice versa
<chillywilly> yea, well linksys doe sshit ass backawrds
<chillywilly> you can clamp it all down
<chillywilly> but you cannot open ports
<dtm> yeah i pity the fool who does vpn from behind that stuff
<chillywilly> it wqill forward ports
<chillywilly> and it has filters for the proivate IPS
<dtm> certainly not multiple masqueraded vpn clients
<chillywilly> how stupid is that?
<nickr> vpn only needs one open port
<nickr> if you do it right.
<dtm> nickr: some of those appliances dont understand GRe
<dtm> GRE
<nickr> GRE?
<nickr> maybe I have a completely different view of how vpns work..
<dtm> nickr: and the pptp and ipsec protocols are not made for masquerading but some clever routers can sorta get around it
<chillywilly> swhy doesn't masquerade that connection from the ftp server?
<chillywilly> that is the question
<dtm> nickr: i'm not sure how many views are possible :)
<dtm> chillywilly: try ftp'ing to another server which you know uses PASV
<nickr> I always see it in terms of linking a client *network* into a host *network*
<nickr> everything is much simpler. :)
<dtm> nickr:  oh i see
<chillywilly> I dunno of one that uses pasv
<dtm> nickr: yeah the typical consumer way is just desktop host to vpn server
<dtm> nickr: if you connect networks it's much better off
<nickr> yes.
<dtm> nickr: and these consumer routers tend not to have vpn clients in em, so you therefore have to masquerade or bypass them
<dtm> nickr: the world of VPNs is a sad state of affairs
<nickr> I like things like ssh tunnel VPNs
<dtm> nickr: very complex and inflexible
<dtm> nickr: anything beyond the aforementioned defaults is just about crazy
<nickr> I've had very good luck with ssh tunnel VPNs... linking a series of networks together
<dtm> nickr: but then, anything beyond those probably should be implemented by VNC or http
<dtm> nickr: not by an entire virtualized transport layer
<nickr> people try to get too clever with it. :P
<dtm> too lazy, often
<dtm> coz they want to do things based on a whole transport layer... network filesystems, remote desktop apps
<dtm> stupid stuff like tha
<dtm> t
<dtm> some of it is understandable but mostly for purely legacy reasons
<nickr> I don't really see a problem with that the way I've done things, but maybe I'm just lucky.
<dtm> it's preferable to use techniques which are designed for secure remote access, like webdav, http, vnc
<dtm> yeah you're lucky compared to some
<dtm> then you have the issue of compatibility
<dtm> pptp is _not_ a security protocol, but people use it for compatibility and cost effectiveness for Windows clients
<dtm> pptp != security
<dtm> no implementation of pptp involves security, because it is a M$ embrace-and-extend
<dtm> they let a standards body establish it, then they broke it and dominated it through sheer numbers and leveraging

<dtm> but that's probably the last thing i'd ever hafta explain to _this_ crowd  ;)
<dtm> i'm venting
<dtm> i spent months researching it
<dtm> trying to set it up on linux

Nick change: chillywilly_ -> chillywilly
<chillywilly> hrrm
Action: chillywilly just did passive mode ftp for ftp.kernel.org ans itworked fine
<chillywilly> it has to be the NAT issue
<chillywilly> wtf
<chillywilly> I don't get it
<dtm> chillywilly: did you look up that appliance's web GUI admin tool?
<chillywilly> no i didn't fuck with that yet
<chillywilly> I dunno why it would not masq that connection as it does all the others
<dtm> maybe because active ftp is a totally different protocol which has to be specifically supported, possibly by turning it on in the admin toool
<chillywilly> dtm: that makes no sense as the masq stuff is done at a packet level
<dtm> ok but that's how it is!
<chillywilly> well i know but what other protocol could it use besides tcp or udp/
<dtm> that's why all linux masq routers have to load a kernel module for specifically that protocol.  same with DCC
<chillywilly> umm, what do you mean?
<dtm> it doesn't use other ip protocols; it's just that its state is handled differently coz it's dumb
<chillywilly> ok
<dtm> it requires for the client to also be a server
<dtm> the client connects to the ftp server and the ftp server has a mini-client which connects back to the client 
<dtm> that's ftp's active mode
<dtm> that's why you're setting passive mode
<dtm> however
<chillywilly> bah
<dtm> if i'm not mistaken i think i've also seen problems with PASV ftp
<dtm> when masqueraded
<dtm> ftp is junk these days
<chillywilly> well he wants to allow people to upload stuff too
<dtm> i think the sole reason to use ftp is that http doesn't support wildcards!!  :)
<chillywilly> I didn't feel like writing a script
<dtm> then he should get a better protocol like webdav or some http web app
<nickr> I considered pptp, but things like tinc looked much better.
<dtm> no scripts are to be written
<dtm> nothing custom
<dtm> these problems have been solved a billion times over
<chillywilly> well I didn't feel like doing html either
<dtm> they're just not shipped by default with the OS
<dtm> and what on earth are you talking about having to custom-make?
<chillywilly> in order to do upload via http
<dtm> heheh
Action: dtm hands chillywilly some matches
<dtm> fire has already been discovered, bro
<dtm> ther'es also hotline
<dtm> which is now an open standard , open src
<chillywilly> due aI know it suports it but as aI said I did not want to write an html form
<dtm> much to my surprise
<dtm> yeah and in response to that, i said "fire has already been discovered".  but you can clearly see that in the scrollback :)
<dtm> so just install something that's already been made.
<chillywilly> do tno speak to me in riddles
<dtm> which happens to not be ftp
<dtm> the only thing that's riddling you is that there exists software which solves this problem without ftp.
<chillywilly> well they used to have an ftp server, so he wants to just keep it the same
<dtm> so, just chew on that and maybe after a while you'll remember the existance of sf.net and freshmeat.net and such :)
<dtm> oh well!  good luck!
<chillywilly> dtm: dude
<dtm> ftp it is!
<chillywilly> just don't talk to me man, you're being very condescending
<chillywilly> I don;t appreciate it
<dtm> i'm responding humorously to your profound density :)
<chillywilly> I knwo there's other things that could be used
<dtm> i dont at all mean to be condescending
<chillywilly> omg
<chillywilly> again wihtt he insults
<dtm> and i'm trying to be compassionate to the fact that it's a nutty situation
<chillywilly> you are being far from that
<dtm> it's not an insult; it's an observation; sorry i'm not more polite
<chillywilly> you just said I was profoundly dense
<dtm> you're the one soliciting input, and i've told you everything i know!
<dtm> and you're not even attempting to use it
<dtm> you're just arguing into the sky
<chillywilly> I;m not asking you anything
<dtm> the thing obviously isn't going to work as is, so reconfigure it or replace it
<chillywilly> you're too l337 for me
<dtm> wellsorry chillywilly
<chillywilly> I am trying to debug it
<nickr> I'm completely lost as to the point of this conversation.
<chillywilly> point is to ridicule and belittle people for not being top notch sys admins
<dtm> nickr: he desperately wants to make ftp work behind a broken masquerading appliance, but without attempting to reconfigure it
<chillywilly> no one said I was doign that
<dtm> chillywilly: nobody _said_ it; that's just what you're doing.
<chillywilly> I just tried to get the web thingy up
<nickr> I was under the impression that a linux box was being used for masquerading
<nickr> rather for NAT
<chillywilly> it didn't like the text browser
<dtm> nickr: negative
<chillywilly> some people liek to talk out their oproblems
<nickr> well theres the mistake, then. :)
<chillywilly> nickr: nah, thsi stupid router
<dtm> chillywilly: yeah i guess they like to talk it out but not respond to help :)
<chillywilly> dtm: you need to relax as I am listening and doing things to rectofy it
<chillywilly> but you have a bug up your ass
<nickr> that sounds unpleasent
<dtm> yeah it is
<dtm> chillywilly: as a close dear friend, i'd like to ask you for assistance with this bug up my ass   ;)
<dtm> chillywilly: here     just ... reach..    over there.......
<dtm> NO
<chillywilly> dtm: shutup
<dtm> yeah ok there
<dtm> chillywilly: I LVOE YOU CHILDRYWILY.
<dtm> chillywilly: i'm sorrry i'm all de time so mean to you
<dtm> :(
Action: dtm goes and sits in the corner
<chillywilly> the only one being childish is you
<dtm> :(
<dtm> i'll stop
<chillywilly> I was just trying to get something working you cold've simply said passice mode ftp protocol sucks and left it at that
<dtm> well ok
<dtm> as punishment i will now reinstall macos9.1
<dtm> :[
<chillywilly> again with the sarcasm
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<dtm> no i'm fuh real
<dtm> you weren't even being bad and i was picking on you
<chillywilly> doesn't matter as I am too pissed off to want to ewven talk to you anymore
<dtm> :<
[20:19] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
Action: chillywilly has enough stress
<dtm> yes you do
<nickr> dtm: no, stop, its not worth the torment
<chillywilly> nickr: eh?
<nickr> chillywilly: don't worry be happy
<chillywilly> well I must eat or will pass out
Action: chillywilly feels like shit
<nickr> I know how that oges
<nickr> everyone can look at my cool site though
<nickr> nick.industrialmeats.com
<dtm> which site
<dtm> oh
<dtm> that's one heck of a domain name
<dtm> frightening visual connotations
<dtm> like chainsaw massacre style
<nickr> well check the image on www.imeats
<nickr> ;)
<dtm> that's some cool stuph dewd
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I like the peanut butter girl scout cookies better than the thinmints
<dtm> hehehe
<chillywilly> eh, fuck this
<chillywilly> I have put too much time into fucking around with his box
<nickr> my gf's mom sent em to me.
<nickr> Three boxes of thin mints.
<nickr> I already ate half of one. I think I need some protien now. :P
<chillywilly> god I feel like shit
<chillywilly> kill me now
Action: jcater shoots in chillywilly's direction
Action: chillywilly falls over dead
<jcater> wait... is WI north-by-northeast of TN right?
<chillywilly> *thud*
<jcater> or just northeast?
Action: nickr posts a rant about ST IV.
<chillywilly> erm
<chillywilly> dunno
<chillywilly> I'd have to look at a map
<nickr> are you sure that WI is NE of TN?
<chillywilly> well it is in thwat direction yes
<chillywilly> I'm not sure what it means to be north-by-northeast
<nickr> its halfway between north and northeast
<chillywilly> ah
Action: chillywilly tries to visualize the us map
<chillywilly> N-by-NE is probably a good assesssment
Action: jcater aims N-by-NE
