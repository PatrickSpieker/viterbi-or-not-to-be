<stbain> greetings all
<chillywilly> sup
<stbain> I think I found the "Killer app" that will bring GNUe into the limelight
<ajmitch> sounds useful
<stbain> I'm a network engineer and I was out at one of my customer's locations today changing IP and routing information for his SCO box
<stbain> while we were waiting for Daimler-Chrysler support, he was explaining the relationship between ADP and their 16,000 automotive and truck dealerships
<stbain> ADP is pretty much gouging them for support, installation, and maintenance on obsolete technolog
<stbain> y
<stbain> it's nothing for some dealerships to spend up to $45K to add 12 users at an existing location to access their ADP box
<stbain> ADP maintains complete control over the machines (UNIX on Motorola servers)... refuses to give out root passwords or work with third party vendors to implement new technologies or add new sites
<stbain> I'm on the mailing list, but it's been a while since I've hit the CVS... is GNUe ready to build a Dealer Management System on?
<chillywilly> you could hack up a 2-tier app
<chillywilly> with the forms client
<chillywilly> use designer to desgin your forms
ToyMan (stuq@c5300-1-ip141.albany.thebiz.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<stbain> how's the ncurses front end?
<chillywilly> the geas forms driver is not done yet , afaik
<chillywilly> ncurses is probably old and rotting away
<chillywilly> I;m not sure
<chillywilly> there's going to be a UI rewrite soon
<stbain> crap... capitalizing on their existing hardware (dumb terminals) would be a big selling point
<chillywilly> jamest or jcater would know for sure
<stbain> oh... BTW... they're willing to fund us :)
<chillywilly> well I have some free time
<chillywilly> ;)
<stbain> hehe
<chillywilly> *some*
<chillywilly> I won't scoff at extra cash though ;)
<chillywilly> s/though//
<stbain> oh... and do you know off the top of your head how much it would take to port forms to a java swing interface?
<chillywilly> we have a Java forms client
<chillywilly> however
<chillywilly> the proper thing to do would be to write  java ui plugin
Action: stbain waits for the punchline
<stbain> hrmm
<chillywilly> and swing is non-free
<stbain> doh
<jcater> hmm
<stbain> what about using jython to compile the python ui into java bytecode?
<jcater> I came to this project
<chillywilly> madlocke has ben working on a web ui thing
<jcater> after actually writing a swing-based forms app
<jcater> and is was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO painfully slow
<chillywilly> s/ben/been
<jcater> that I couldn't use it in production
<jcater> hence, I'm here
<chillywilly> :)
<jcater> and helping w/GNUe
<chillywilly> python kicks java's ass
<stbain> and it always will kick java's ass
<jcater> but it is certainly possible to port forsm to java/swing
<jcater> actually, we consider the Python forms to be a 
<jcater> "reference" implementation
<jcater> not necessarily the "only" implementation
<stbain> but... doing the python/wxpython installation on every workstation might get to be a pain in the arse
<chillywilly> isn't there suppor though for ui plugins?
<chillywilly> support
<jcater> stbain: true
<stbain> what about compiling forms w/ py2exe?
<jcater> but I've done two things here
<chillywilly> so you could add to the exiting forms clien
<chillywilly> tclient
<jcater> stbain: these windows stations or linux?
<stbain> windows for now
<chillywilly> we have a setup.exe
<jcater> stbain: we have precompiled Windows binaries on the website
<stbain> and a few dumb terminals
<stbain> cool
<jcater> that contains EVERYTHING
<chillywilly> so easy winblows installation
<chillywilly> s/so/for
<stbain> so I guess it's the other tiers that need to be looked at
<jcater> stbain: I have two solutions here at NCS for linux
<chillywilly> long term I would hope you would want to use geas and define your business objects and methods, but ubtil then you could just use the forms client and a database and write som triggers and have a nice app
<jcater> 1. For one office, we use diskless terminals (LTSP)
<stbain> LTSP roxors
<jcater> so all the forms clients run on one server
<jcater> at our main office, I create a "static" python + wx install
<jcater> then tar it up
<jcater> and untar on all the other machines
<jcater> in effect creating a binary image
<jcater> btw, I'm not saying that is best or only way
<jcater> but an immediate solution I've come up with
<jcater> just food for thought
<stbain> well... the idea would be to get NADA support and have the entire dealer base in the country throw their weight behind the development effort(s)
<stbain> so we would definitely want to use a mature GEAS and use 3 tier design
<jcater> true
<jcater> of course, if this is REALLY short term, we can achieve 3-tier in other ways
<stbain> not really short term
<chillywilly> well if they have omney and time they can invest in GEAS development
<stbain> this whole idea just came up about 6 hours ago
<chillywilly> money
<chillywilly> btw, how far is reports jc?
<chillywilly> we could probably use help there too
<jcater> well, we need an output spec
<jcater> the engine works
<chillywilly> oh, ok
<stbain> I also discussed the problem w/ multiple vendors... GM, Chrysler, Ford, Honda, etc... they all have their proprietary protocols to access information from their networks
<jcater> but we need to figure out what our "Standard" xml output will be
<stbain> so I'm also thinking something along the lines of an Automotive Markup Language
<stbain> AML ;)
<chillywilly> need to specify the gfd fprmat?
<chillywilly> format
<jcater> chillywilly: eh??
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> sorry
<chillywilly> grd
<chillywilly> reports file
<jcater> the grd is specs pretty much
<jcater> but reports will output XML that will then be
<stbain> I'm thinking we can work with OASIS and try to lobby for some support in that area
<chillywilly> that's the standard xml you arevtalking abot right?
<jcater> transformed to PS, PDF, CSV, etc
<jcater> nope
<chillywilly> oh duh
<jcater> it's spec'd (basically)
<chillywilly> output
<jcater> crap
<jcater> this is interesting
Action: Yurik is back
<jcater> but I have a prior appointment
<jcater> so I will need to run in a sec
<chillywilly> k
<jcater> stbain: if you see dneighbo in here, hit him up
<jcater> he's good w/organizing, thinking, etc
<jcater> s/thinking/planning
<jcater> (we're all good at thinking :)
<chillywilly> nah, I suck

<stbain> what's the designer status?
<stbain> 0.1.0 good to go?
<chillywilly> very usable
<stbain> ok
<chillywilly> with new features added every day
<chillywilly> (prectically)
<jcater> cvs rocks!
<chillywilly> thansk to jcater
<chillywilly> no
<chillywilly> you rock jcater!
<chillywilly> :)
<jcater> it will display fields in a table
<jcater> and you can drag the fields onto the grid
<jcater> and it will automatically create the entries
<jcater> (this was done in the last week)

<Yurik> jcater hi
<dneighbo> whoaaa.
<dneighbo> too much good stuff :)
<dneighbo> stbain: if you are on windows dont use cvs
<Yurik> dneighbo re
<dneighbo> instead grab the .exe's
<dneighbo> that way you dont have to install any dependencies
<dneighbo> they are all included
<dneighbo> we are PRIMED to run on vt100 as soon as curses support is back
<dneighbo> i think what you are asking is DEFINITELY do able w/ two tier as it sits right now
<dneighbo> as to java/swing, i would AVOID at ALL costs
<dneighbo> i see no value
<dneighbo> i.e. if you wanted java, i would write from scratch in java
<dneighbo> and not bother toying w/ gnue
<dneighbo> nevermind stbain is gone
<dneighbo> duh
<nickr> Heh
<chillywilly> doh!
<fitzix> he
<fitzix> heh
<fitzix> swing is frought with compat perils...
<fitzix> then again, so are all the java GUI extensions
Action: fitzix thinks GTK+ is much more system-neutral
<jcater> dneighbo: well, I addressed some of your points, although maybe not as thoroughly :)
<dneighbo> yeah the backlog is hard to read in bitchx
<chillywilly> still at work?
<dneighbo> not sure what the questions were in some regards
<dneighbo> i.e. is stbain asking can this be done
<dneighbo> or asking for us to do it?
<dneighbo> if that makes sense
<jcater> um
<jcater> not really sure
<dneighbo> chillywilly : i dont work im unemployed
<chillywilly> hey, I am all for offering my services ;)
<chillywilly> what?
<chillywilly> seriously?!?
<chillywilly> what happened?
<dneighbo> no just kidding
<chillywilly> goof ball
<chillywilly> you just wanted to get me going
<chillywilly> ;)
<dneighbo> btw: jcater i have been carrying long threads w/ A+
<dneighbo> a gpl implementation of APL
<dneighbo> APL a derivative of A
<dneighbo> created at morgan stanley 
<dneighbo> its a 'gnarly' language that is pretty much all array based
<dneighbo> and lightning for math applications
<dneighbo> anyhow i use it a lot here at work
<jcater> cool
<dneighbo> for OLAP engine work
<jcater> you should use COBOL
<jcater> <snicker>
<dneighbo> i think they (a+ developers) might be willing to write an OLAP engine
<jcater> cool
<dneighbo> jcater: we use cobol a lot too (on the os/390)
<chillywilly> OLAP is what again?
<chillywilly> that funky array sotrage replication stuff?
<dneighbo> Online Analytical Processing
<dneighbo> yeah
<dneighbo> its 
<chillywilly> storage
<dneighbo> cubes, dimensions, lists etc
<dneighbo> think of 'multidimensional' storage
<fitzix> and processing of that storage?
<dneighbo> that is duplicated for quick retreival
<dneighbo> and moving its 'views' quickly
<dneighbo> to make decisions
<chillywilly> a wannabe RAID or something ;)
<dneighbo> i think it  will be VERY important for larger enterprises
<chillywilly> well not really
<chillywilly> where can you learn about it?
<fitzix> I could see that being VERY useful in databases
<chillywilly> are there any FS tools out there for it?
<fitzix> could be great for implementing XML and rdf parsers
<chillywilly> damn, I forgot to watch Star Trek
<chillywilly> fudge!
<chillywilly> my night is ruined now
<dneighbo> http://www.aplusdev.org/
<dneighbo> is a+ home page
<dneighbo> btw: morgan stanley appears to be funding the development of this
<dneighbo> for those that are not 'market players'
<dneighbo> morgan stanley is one of the largest financial advice firms around
<dneighbo> http://www.morganstanley.com
Action: chillywilly new that even though he is not a 'market player'
<chillywilly> knew
Action: Yurik is out to smoke
<dneighbo> http://www.olapcouncil.org/
<dneighbo> might be good olap resource
<chillywilly> k
Action: jcater doesn't wanna think about olap
<jcater> gives me a headache
<chillywilly> hehe
<nickr> eek, it uses strang echracters
<chillywilly> it sufficiently fcks with your mind
<dneighbo> um APL is the strangest thing you will see
<chillywilly> olap I know
<dneighbo> imagine the best calculus minds in the country
<chillywilly> s/olap//
<chillywilly> write an olap engine in brain fuck
<dneighbo> doing vector analysis on financial data
<dneighbo> and ask them to do it wiht a computer
<dneighbo> and you end up with APL
<nickr> looks a little bit like haskell
<dneighbo> it might look a bit 'jacked up'
<dneighbo> but some of what it can do is truly amazing
<dneighbo> i would never want to write a db application w/ it
Action: jcater is using designer w/Oracle + schema support
Action: jcater is very happy
<dneighbo> but when you are talking 'cubes' (basically groups of arrays)
Action: jcater may do a little dance
<dneighbo> you probably couldnt pick a better language
<dneighbo> nickr you think the characters are funny you can use 'ascii' mode
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> if you are german you are hosed
<dneighbo> i think you have to either buy a new keyboard or get special mapping files from teh net :)
<dneighbo> was speakign with guys
<dneighbo> and now are trying to move this into debian
<nickr> dneighbo: yes I see the difference in the pictures of it they have
<dneighbo> i think it will be
<nickr> with the little <- and ^ and such
<dneighbo> aplplus-fsf
<dneighbo> btw: the guys on that list blow me away
<dneighbo> several months ago i said i want somethign that does x y z
<dneighbo> 2 hours later the guy sent me source that did ALMOST what our commercial package here that we have over 800,000 bucks sunk in
<nickr> I'm impressed that Morgan STanley put out free software
<dneighbo> so my intention is to basically spec out a tool that does what im using here
<dneighbo> and there are volunteers there willing to do it
<dneighbo> as they are trying to get APL used in other places
<dneighbo> specifically linux and specifically the GPL version
<nickr> does this build cleanly on linux?
<dneighbo> i think it could be a NICE addition to the GNUe family
<dneighbo> im told it does build on linux
<dneighbo> they have a very helpful list
<dneighbo> what blows me away is most people on list are @ms.com
<dneighbo> i.e. this isnt some branch of MS code
<dneighbo> i think morgan stanley basically took all their APL stuff and is moving it GPL version
<dneighbo> as they see no value in a prop compiler
<nickr> Its a good plan
<dneighbo> as they arent in the software business
<nickr> hrm, maybe a good packaging project
<dneighbo> the APL guys of course are rabid to get anyone to try to APL :)
<fitzix> makes sense
<dneighbo> as its a religion to them
<fitzix> it looks like a properly complex math language
<nickr> sounds like the FOO partisans where FOO is any given language
<chillywilly> vecor analysis rules
<chillywilly> vector
<nickr> although if FOO isa  functional language such as haskell they are probably more rabid
<dneighbo> the kick off process to try to get it into debian was interesting

<fitzix> jcater: why yes, of course... actually, I was curious if you were doing the same.
<fitzix> brb - dinner
<fitzix> :)
<jcater> chillywilly: how'd you narrow it down to that?
<chillywilly> what?
<chillywilly> ooooh
<chillywilly> I just know that
<chillywilly> er,no
<chillywilly> it bitched at me
<chillywilly> I'll show you
<jcater> chillywilly: only reason I ask is another person is having issues
<jcater> and I wonder if that's their problem

<chillywilly> it is a debian fuck up
<chillywilly> I dunno which package it is though that is using the wrong libpng
<jcater> damn
<chillywilly> maybe wxgtk
<chillywilly> or something
<jcater> it'll have to be wxgtk
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> maybe I should rebuild it
<jcater> are you using an apt-got version?
<chillywilly> if I couls only remember how
<chillywilly> yes
<jcater> ah
<chillywilly> there's 2 libpngs in sid
<chillywilly> 1.0.12
<chillywilly> and
<chillywilly> 1.2.1
<chillywilly> they just need to get their shit together and compile everything against one of them
<chillywilly> imho
<chillywilly> 1.2.1 is binary incompatible
<chillywilly> with 1.0.12
<chillywilly> but
<chillywilly> even if I tell it to use the old one
<chillywilly> i get dialogs bitching about libpng

<chillywilly> it sucks
<chillywilly> i want to use designer
<jcater> well
<jcater> revert back to woody and stop using sid :)
<jcater> or compile your own version
<chillywilly> or recompile wxgtk package
<jcater> I think that's why it's called "unstable" ;)
<chillywilly> hmm
<chillywilly> yes, I know
<chillywilly> I will find a work around
<chillywilly> shit happend ya know
<chillywilly> happens
<jcater> it's not difficult to compile wx
<chillywilly> I've had these damn libpng problems before
<chillywilly> I had to remove the 3.1.2.1 -dev package
<chillywilly> so galeon would not use it when I compiled it
<jcater> fuck
<jcater> it's < 40 degrees outside
<jcater> it's raining
<jcater> and my top is down on the convertable
<jcater> and I must now go home
<jcater> sigh

<jcater> yeah
<chillywilly> what kind?
<jcater> lol

<miguel> Anyone know where I can get complete rpms of Gnu Enterprise?
<chillywilly> we suck, we don't have rpms
<miguel> Mhm.   
Action: miguel ponders whether there is a Debian machine he can log into
<chillywilly> this is THE miguel?
<chillywilly> or what?
<chillywilly> ;)
<miguel> I am one instance of miguels ;-)
<miguel> So does GNU enterprise use WxWindows only?
<miguel> (and gtk through this?)
<miguel> I thought it had a pluggable architecture
<chillywilly> um, for now
<jcater> at the moment, yes
<chillywilly> it does
Action: miguel ponders
<jcater> it is currently our reference implementation
<miguel> Ok.
<miguel> Fair enough
<jcater> next up will be a curses-based plugin
<jcater> followed by an html
<miguel> I could swear I saw screenshots of that in the past
<jcater> then we will work in various graphics plugins
<jcater> eh?
<jcater> screenshots of which?
<miguel> Of an earlier `Forms' client in cursrs
<miguel> Of an earlier `Forms' client in curses
<jcater> probably so
<jcater> we have been gutting parts of it and now need to get
<jcater> curses back up to speed
<miguel> Oh, makes sense
<miguel> Yeah, this is probably an 9-old month memory
<miguel> Rodrigo Moya was quite excited about GNUE a few months ago
<miguel> Are you guys using his libgda thing?
<jcater> I think we might support it as a plugin at some point
<jcater> but at moment, we have our own drivers
<miguel> I see.  
<miguel> Is GNUE end-user ready?
<jcater> (we like to plug everything :)
<miguel> I am going to ask someone at Ximian to make rpms ;-)
<jcater> the forms client is in production use several places
<miguel> I have become one lazy dude
<jcater> for example, I have a call-center using it
<jcater> the designer ide is coming along nicely
<miguel> it is sweet
<jcater> and we've gotten positive feedback from developers
<miguel> what are you using for the designer?
<jcater> wx
<jcater> wxWindows + Python
<miguel> Ok, so you are not reusing anything like glade
<miguel> (totally understandable)
<jcater> no
<miguel> different audience than glade
<jcater> we have an entry on that in our faq
<jcater> exactly
<jcater> glade is EXCELLENT for designing GTK apps
<miguel> Is the form thing grid-based?
<jcater> but that is not what we do
<jcater> at the moment, yes
Action: miguel agrees violently
<jcater> someone has submitted some lay0out managers for use
<jcater> but I'm not sure where we stand on that
<jcater> all our examples use a grid-based system
<miguel> Well, from the screenshots things looked quite advanced
<miguel> And I was curious
<miguel> Kind of browsing whats new out there
<jcater> ah
<jcater> well, we are getting ready for a new release
<miguel> But am an rpm-based man ;-)
<jcater> lol
<miguel> heh
<miguel> So you hack on it?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> I've done the designer
<miguel> what piece do you own?
<miguel> Oh, wow
<jcater> and am working on reports
<jcater> and help w/the forms client
<jcater> jamest (who is away) is main hacker
<jcater> he and derek are project leaders
<jcater> I'm just a lowly hacker :)
<miguel> haha
<miguel> well, good job man
<chillywilly> a one man coding machine
<nickr> a god among men
<nickr> or is that dog?
<fitzix> hehe
<jcater> well, if you ask my wife
<jcater> the answer would be the latter, I'm sure
<nickr> haha
<jcater> but my goldfish listen to me
Action: jcater is god over his goldfish
<nickr> we all need a kingdom
<jcater> I tell them to stay, and they never leave their bowl
<jcater> pretty impressive, eh?
Action: jcater wishes his son listened that well :)
<fitzix> jcater: make him aquatic in nature and you're halfway there :)
<jcater> fitzix: he's still in diapers and is ALWAYS wet
<jcater> that count?
<fitzix> hehe - does he walk?
<jcater> oh, yeah
<jcater> he's 3 1/2
<jcater> he can almost change his diaper
<ajmitch> hehe
<fitzix> then, no - that just means he gets everything else wet :)
<jcater> lol
<chillywilly> kids
<miguel> Ok, so what should I subscribe to if I want to know when you guys make rpms of the new release?
<jcater> gnue-announce
<chillywilly> gnue-annouce@gnu.org
<jcater> lemme find out lists page

<derek> im sure thats what it means

<chillywilly> I listen to you
<chillywilly> and agree
<dsmith> chillywilly: something happen with ximian recently?
<derek> 8 months ago i would have been PLEASED as punch that ximian was interested
<derek> now it just frightens the hell out of me
<derek> as i see two possibilities
Action: chillywilly is very firghtened by it
<chillywilly> frightened
<derek> a. they muscle in and fork w/ more developers and kill gnue as it sits
--- Fri Jan 18 2002
<derek> b. they bastardize it for profit
