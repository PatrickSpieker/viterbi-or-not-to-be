<derek> guess they might be suprised when some of our 'secret' press releases come out soon :)
<derek> muhahaha
<derek> i guess i shouldnt bag on them
<ajmitch> hehe
<derek> hopefully they will bring resources and good intentions
<chillywilly> er?
<chillywilly> secret press releases?
<derek> as god knows we need resources :)
<nickr> derek: yes, this is what we all hope
<chillywilly> nevermind
<chillywilly> I gotcha now
<chillywilly> duh
<chillywilly> damn I need sleep
<derek> i need sleep, worked too hard today, really bummed i missed miguel
<chillywilly> fitzix was looking for you
<derek> for me?
<derek> i didnt see anything in the log
<chillywilly> #gnue-discuss
<derek> ah
<nickr> theres a #gnue-discuss now?
<derek> its for something different
<derek> were carrying some dotgnu / gnue related banging around
<derek> its not a 'permanent' channel
<derek> was just something for a day or two to hash out some group politics on how we could collaborate
<derek> with out cluttering this channel :)

<derek> *** it looks as though rsync for cvsweb and lxr (gnue.org) are not working anymore, can we fix that or is it a jade thing?
<derek> ****
alexey (~alexey@195.151.214.34) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest_> back
<jamest_> i setup rsync on ash
<jamest_> but never switched the cvsweb or lxr over from jade's stuff
<jamest_> so it's a jade thing
<jamest_> however I may have time this weekend
<jamest_> to switch it all over 
<jamest_> ra3vat: still here?
<jamest_> worth mentioning: I have a Mac user that just tried out unix (linux) for the first time
<jamest_> he HATES it
<jamest_> #1 reason why he hates it
<jamest_> stability
<jamest_> not the OS itself
<jamest_> but the current mix of "office" applicatoins
<jamest_> kword seqfaults when saving
<jamest_> abiword makes random formatting changes when saving
<jamest_> staroffice is bloated and slow
<jamest_> and java support prevents him from using specific sites on the web

madlocke (madlocke@p50806E21.dip.t-dialin.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<madlocke> hi
<jamest_> hey!
<jamest_> madlocke!
<jamest_> you here?
<madlocke> yes
<jamest_> sigh, i have a meeting in a few minutes
<jamest_> had a little time to look at the code
<madlocke> i have time today....
<jamest_> you've got a lot of work done on the layout mgr
<jamest_> it seems
<madlocke> code changed... lot of bug fixes... gridbaglayout for wxpython works!...
<jamest_> rock!
<jamest_> couple of issues though
<madlocke> just looking for one bug i still have in html layout... 
<madlocke> ok...
<jamest_> i can't see us replacing GParser
<madlocke> i have time we can discuss it later
<jamest_> as forms and designer both use it heavily
<madlocke> for now i only wrote own one because it was easier and i wanted to try some things...
<jamest_> and it does lots of stuff for us, typecasting, default values, file structure validation, automatic upgrade of depreciated features
<jamest_> er, ok cool
<jamest_> i didn't notice any IO system
<madlocke> but still thinking of getting rid of this phaseinit... but not now...
<madlocke> more important things to do
<jamest_> lol
<jamest_> phaseinit replaced a single init system
<madlocke> it was there in an older version... just wanted to concentrate on layouting
<jamest_> that just didn't work for our multipart system
<jamest_> cool
<jamest_> i was wondering if we could fold the layout manager into the current code base w/ a few changes
<jamest_> then see about adding in the html stuff along side our current UI rewrite
<madlocke> where to find this rewrite?
<jamest_> um
<jamest_> in our heads
<jamest_> :)
<madlocke> ah... ok...  ;)
<jamest_> it is really dependent upon the html clients needs
<madlocke> just getting a saw ;)
<jamest_> jcater and I have discussed it somewhat
<jamest_> but nothing on paper yet
<jamest_> as we wanted to see what you had done
<jamest_> dangit
<jamest_> just a sec
<madlocke> ok... when did you discuss it so i can read it and join the discussion
<jamest_> ah
<madlocke> jsut the day
<jamest_> just a sec
<jamest_> it's just been comments in passing 
<jamest_> typically in a private window
<jamest_> we were talking about having a single process on the web server
<jamest_> using sessoins/cookies to driver mutliple UIhtml sessions
<jamest_> for different users
<jamest_> however
<jamest_> we didn't go into it very deep
<jamest_> as we knew you were working on it
<madlocke> ok
<jamest_> ahhhhh
<jamest_> meeting postponed till 11
<madlocke> ok
<jamest_> what do you think?
<jamest_> I don't recall what the june code you had did
Action: jamest_ has bad memory
<jcater> madlocke: hi
<madlocke> first i want finish this html bug, then discuss what you want for the rewrite
<madlocke> hi jcater
<madlocke> and very important i think is i18n
<jamest_> madlocke: i have i18n patches sent in today
<madlocke> cool
<jamest_> for 0.1.0 inclusion
<jcater> really?
<jcater> cool
<jamest_> actually they were sent Dec 4th
<jamest_> but I didn't get them I guess
<jamest_> ra3vat was nice enough to send me a new copy
<madlocke> great
dsmith (dsmith@208.40.56.34) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jamest_> i hope to have them merged in this weekend
dneighbo (dneighbo@mail.libertydistribution.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> dneighbo!
<jcater> wassup?
<jamest_> madlocke: on the layout manager
<jamest_> in the gfd file
<jamest_> i was thinking about keeping the number of entities to a minimum
<jamest_> so instead of <boxLayout>, <etcLayout>
<jamest_> we'd have <container style="box"> 
<jamest_> <container style="grid">
<jamest_> etc,etc
<dneighbo> hi jcater 
<madlocke> what to do with special styles for lms?
<jcater> madlocke: what do you mean?
<jamest_> lms?
<madlocke> lms=layoutmanagers.
Action: jamest_ is blanking on what lms stands for?
<madlocke> for example: box layout can do layouting horizontal or vertical
alexey (alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jamest_> ah
<madlocke> other layoutmanagers may need other attributes
<jamest_> hmmmmm
<jamest_> we could either allow optional attributes
<jcater> imho, it critical that we keep the number of tags to a minimum
<jamest_> or we could provide some general attribute that takes a string of values
<jcater> as that's helped us grow so far
<jamest_> my goal however was for forms to be able to fall back when it hits something it didn't know how to handle
<jamest_> for instance when curses and wxpython both worked
<jamest_> the curses client didn't know how to do dropdowns
<jamest_> since dropdown was an entry style it didn't matter
<jamest_> the forms with dropdown still worked on curses and still did input validation
<jamest_> you just couldn't pick from a list
<jamest_> if we had done <dropdown> as it's own thing
<jamest_> then the form would not have displayed at all
<jamest_> same would hold true for layout mangers
<jamest_> if the UI in question didn't know what to do then it could fall back to something basic
<jamest_> like
<jamest_> widget<cr>
[10:45] Last message repeated 3 time(s).
<jamest_> so the form may look bad but it would still be able to functoin
Action: jamest_ hopes he's making sence
<madlocke> to the problem with the dropdown
<madlocke> i was thinking of something like a widget hierarchy
<madlocke> means that these fall backs can be automated
<madlocke> for example you define features that a ui is able to support
<madlocke> then you ask some class to return a widget for a tag
<madlocke> so it would be transparent
<madlocke> so you ask a widget builder... hey give me a dropdown
<madlocke> for uiwxpython you will get a dropdown and for curses a normal entry field
<madlocke> if the ui does not explicitly say: i can support a tag that tag falls back until a good widget class is found
<madlocke> hope you understand my thinkings :)
<jamest_> which is basically what we attempt now w/o the classes
<madlocke> thoughts.
<jamest_> I'm still of a mind set to keep the number of tags low
Action: jamest_ hates modern widget sets
<madlocke> lot of people like modern widget sets
<jcater> I don't think we are in a position to define a new modern widget set
<jcater> as there are plenty of them
<madlocke> not a new one but don't use only old ones
<dneighbo> madlocke, i will say this...
<jcater> I could foresee that taking on a life of its own and getting out of hand quickly
<jamest_> my goal for the gfd was to describe a functionality
<dneighbo> the more complex the widget set teh harder to support a myriad of UI's
<dneighbo> but more importantly
<dneighbo> the most PRODUCTIVE applications i have seen for (business)
<dneighbo> are old curses terminals
<dneighbo> on vt100
<dneighbo> i.e. like unix
<dneighbo> a little hard to 'learn' but once you learn VERY efficient to use
<madlocke> dneighbo: may be true. but how much curses terminals are you seeing compared to other solutions
<dneighbo> um lots
<jcater> madlocke: a lot 
<dneighbo> madlocke dont take this wrong
<madlocke> i don't
<dneighbo> but what is the biggest organization you have written software for?
<dneighbo> my last three application domains were
<dneighbo> 1 org - 13,000 users
<madlocke> siemens was biggest
<dneighbo> 100+ orgs - avg 400 users per org
<dneighbo> 100-+ orgs - avg 100 users per org
<madlocke> of course i understand that it is very important to have basic
<dneighbo> all of these pretty much had thier CORE applications as curses base
<madlocke> stuff that is working but by denying new things it is difficult to make
<madlocke> a step forward
<dneighbo> and auxillary lesser applicatoins in gui or combo gui/curses
<dneighbo> now when you start talking software that serves only a fist full of orgs
<dneighbo> that are minimum users
<dneighbo> you rarely see gui
<dneighbo> btw: i am NOT ANTI gui
<dneighbo> just saying all the bells and whistles of complex widget sets dont == better software
<jamest_> I'm not anti-gui either
<jamest_> but
<madlocke> i don't tell that the software gets better. i just think it attracts more users
<jcater> I agree with jamest_, though, that we are describing a "functionality" in a GFD, not necessarily a "widget layout"
<jamest_> what I like now is
<jamest_> that I can show a .gfd to a non-programmer
<jamest_> and they can "get" it
<madlocke> so you want that people are able to create forms without designer easily
<madlocke> if i understand correctly
<jamest_> um, not exactly
<jamest_> damn
<jamest_> i have to go
<jcater> that should always be a possibility
<jcater> but I don't think that's the main point
<jamest_> this meeting is with my boss
<dneighbo> i think a primary point of gnue has always been
<jcater> when you start tying to specific layouts/widgets/etc, you can quickly create a UI-specific application
<madlocke> jamest_: you know how long it takes?
<dneighbo> that its more a business analyst tool 
<dneighbo> than a programmer tool
<dneighbo> read you should have to be a C hacker to use gnue and extend applications
<dneighbo> s/should/shouldnt
<madlocke> hm
<madlocke> i was reading about some people asking for trees and other widgets. how are you thinking about this?
<madlocke> dneighbo, jcater?
<madlocke> not support it, later support it?
<jcater> I think the consensus was those would be custom widgets that we would not support
<jcater> but would provide hooks for those who "insisted" they need them
<jcater> iirc
<dneighbo> btw: im not opposed to 'extended' widgets
<dneighbo> so say a tree widget
<dneighbo> we could have that
<dneighbo> and support it in the ui's that can support it
<dneighbo> but we make it a 'use at own risk'
<dneighbo> and we dont use it for GNUe Apps that are official
<dneighbo> i.e. i think we are willing to let widgets make it into cvs
<dneighbo> but we would put that we dont support them so if the original author stops supporting them you are SOL
<madlocke> ok. then we need some docs/specs about this
<dneighbo> i.e. we arent opposed to people making gnue fit their needs
<dneighbo> but we dont want to drag down the principals of gnue for specific usages
<dneighbo> i.e. gnue's goal is to be 'all things to all people' ;)
<madlocke> the widgets supported at the moment by gnuef define the standard already or is it too much/less?
<dneighbo> the current thinking is start simple
<dneighbo> lets get entry/label/etc working WELL
<dneighbo> and supported on many different UI's
<dneighbo> and used in applications
<dneighbo> then lets see what other widgets could be really beneficial and such and look at implementing them
<dneighbo> i.e. classic lets do a few things really well
<dneighbo> instead of a lots of things really bad
<madlocke> k
<madlocke> ok

<dneighbo> can you co current cvs and tar it for me?
<dneighbo> i cant get cvs at work

<jcater> sure
<jcater> btw
<jcater> I think we should do this weekly (automatically)
<jcater> and post to website
<dneighbo> yes
<jcater> (with a disclaimer of course)
<dneighbo> only i would say nightly
<dneighbo> if i get access on ash again
<dneighbo> i will look at setting this up
<jcater> you don't have ash access?
<dneighbo> or if you are up to it you can set it up :)
<dneighbo> jcater: yes i have access, but i dont have sudo/root
<dneighbo> so cant do many things
<dneighbo> btw: its my own fault i tossed the password on accident
<dneighbo> just wanted to clarify that for the logs :)
<jcater> I'll have that in a sec
<jcater> my internet conn is slow today
<jamest_>  /msg jcater actually I paid his wife to toss the password but dont tell him that
<jcater> dneighbo: http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/gnue-cvs-020118.tar.gz
<jcater> anyone mind if I automate that on ash today???
<jcater> I'm thinking of having gnue-cvs-<date>.tar.gz and keep the last 5 days worth
<jamest_> jcater: please do
<jamest_> anything to keep masta away from root
<jamest_> :)
<dneighbo> agree
<dneighbo> on both the automation
<dneighbo> and keeping me from root
<dneighbo> please put in like downloads/nightlies/
<dneighbo> or something
<dneighbo> if you copy the current one there i will release a story on the home page stating that we offer them now and pointing to the official place
<jcater> I'm automating now
<jcater> so give me a few
<dneighbo> one
<dneighbo> two
<dneighbo> three
<dneighbo> few
<dneighbo> ok
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> is there any way to stop cvs from asking for password
<jcater> other than ssh certificate?
<jcater> ping
<dneighbo> um i dont think so
<dneighbo> grdcvs
<dneighbo> what is that?
<dneighbo> reports daemon?
<dneighbo> i.e. report server?
<jcater> ah, nevermind
<jcater> yip
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/snapshots/
<dneighbo> cool
<dneighbo> we should probably put under downloads/snapshots
<dneighbo> as would like to get to point where you can go to downloads/
<jcater> well, I used an Apache Alias
<dneighbo> and get variety of things
<jcater> lemme figure out that
<dneighbo> ok cool
<jcater> as it's actually in a subdirectory in my home
<dneighbo> i think downloads/ already exists
<jcater> ok, then I should be able to alias it there
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/download/snapshots/
<jcater> how's that?
<jcater> dneighbo: you might wanna do an index.php or something
<dneighbo> should be downloads
<dneighbo> as there is gnuenterprise.org/downloads/
<dneighbo> and if possible if the file really exists under that same structure so
<jcater> argh
<jcater> ok
<dneighbo> 'snapshots' show up in that listing
<dneighbo> there is an 'option' in apache for dir listings we can turn on that will make it so you can see whole file name as well
<jcater> your wife must be really patient
<jcater> ;)
<dneighbo> :)
<dneighbo> its not high priority
<dneighbo> you can leave as is
<dneighbo> im happy just to have it done nightly :)
<jcater> ok
<jcater> I forgot downloads was there
<jcater> so I just created a symlink
<jcater> that way it'll show up in /downloads list

<jcater> I could only provide an invalid answer at the moment
dres_ (~dres@4.18.171.42) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> actually one i see as interesting is 'sorting'
<dneighbo> currently we dont have way to sort (other than hardcode in form)
<dneighbo> and then via triggers
<dneighbo> but could have a 'sort' menu
<dneighbo> and based on selection call trigger to resort
<dneighbo> or is there better way to handle this?
Action: dneighbo is thinking
<jcater> definitely
<dneighbo> type="trigger" location="way to define trigger name"
<dneighbo> definitely better way to handle right now?
Action: jamest_ smacks dneighbo
<jamest_> no more features until after next release!
<jamest_> :)
Action: dneighbo isnt sure why
<dneighbo> im not saying put it in right now
<dneighbo> i just always state everytime i go to write something i hit 'walls', so get frustrated and stop :)
Yurik (~yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Yurik> re
<dneighbo> so i am asking... is there a way to do it that im not thinking of?
<jamest_> dneighbo: I'm talking the sort
<dneighbo> i.e. how are you doing sorting currently
<jamest_> and I'm basically giving you crap
<jcater> at the datasource level
<jamest_> as I need field sorting in forms too
<jamest_> bbias
jamest_ (jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) left irc: "[x]chat"
<dneighbo> jcater: i mean i know sorting is 'supported'
<dneighbo> but i mean 'dynamic' sorting
<dneighbo> at run time
<jcater> not there yet
<dneighbo> only way i can think of is make buttons
<dneighbo> and have them issue triggers
<jcater> I think that'll tie into your lookup box
<dneighbo> so my question was
<dneighbo> if we put trigger calls in navigator
<dneighbo> then you could have
<dneighbo> Sort
<dneighbo>   -- By something
<dneighbo>   -- by other something
<dneighbo> in a menu
<dneighbo> that called the trigger to resort the form
<dneighbo> if that makes sense
<dneighbo> not best 'long' term solution
<dneighbo> but would give us sorts dynamically today
<dneighbo> and shouldnt break forms as it would be in navigator
<dneighbo> reinhard: the release thing
<dneighbo> er re: not reinhard 
<dneighbo> but im just talking out loud
<dneighbo> i see other uses of being able to call triggers from menus
<dneighbo> like for launching external processes or such
<jcater> but what trigger would it call?
<jcater> as navigator would create a forms instance
<jcater> but how would calling a trigger before hand help?
<dneighbo> ?"
<dneighbo> im thinking
<dneighbo> i open a form
<dneighbo> it has data in it
<dneighbo> then i choose sort->by title
<dneighbo> and it 'requeries' the open dataset by title
<jcater> ok
<jcater> not sure I see that as part of navigator, though
<dneighbo> sigh
<jcater> but that "shouldn't" be hard
<dneighbo> it wouldnt be 'part' of navigator
<dneighbo> im thinking navigator just calls a trigger
<dneighbo> and the code in the trigger does the requery/sort
<dneighbo> i.e. we add generic trigger support to navigator
<dneighbo> so
<dneighbo>       <step type="trigger" src="myfile.py" location="resort('title')"
<dneighbo>             description="something"/>
<dneighbo> might be a sample 'navigator' definition
<dneighbo> if that makes sense?
<dneighbo> i dont profess to understand navigator internals so maybe its way off base
jamest_ (~jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> but i see value to being able to call triggers from the menu system
<dneighbo> this would just be using that feature to do sorts
Action: dneighbo fears that the silence equates to jcater 'reloading'
<jamest_> menus should work like buttons
<jamest_> which just call triggers
<Mr_You> hi guys
Action: jamest_ is jumping into conversation w/o reading logs
<Mr_You> any comments on the HR proposal?
<Mr_You> guess its been a while
<dneighbo> jamest_ that is what i am requesting (i think) ;)
<jcater> I half agree derek :)
<jamest_> btw - I'm talking about forms with user def menu entries
<jcater> I'm not sure how a trigger in navigator would resort a datasource in forms
<jamest_> the std entries on the forms program might provide hooks but I don't see then being triggers
<jamest_> navigator supports triggers now?
Action: jamest_ is out of touch
<jcater> jamest_: nope
<jcater> well, nope about triggers
<dneighbo> couldnt you pass it the information
<dneighbo> like you pass it datasourcename and field
<dneighbo> so you create trigger sortit(dsName,field)
<jcater> not nope about being out of touch
<jamest_> ouch
<dneighbo> jcater: well im not saying i know the answers
<dneighbo> at this point i think calling triggers would be nice
Action: jamest_ falls back to previous approach......reaches over and smacks derek
<Mr_You> what is navigator?
<dneighbo> but making them part of menuing in the 'form frame' will be more critical i think
<Mr_You> hello?
<jcater> navigator/ GNUe Navigator is a menuing system for GNUe Forms and Reports. It
<jcater>            presents a consistent menuing interface (in GUI or Text) based on

<dneighbo> is a navigator i am currently playing with for a small sample library checkout program
<jcater> dneighbo: it's not functional yet, but try gncvs -u web <file>.gpd
<jcater> dneighbo: what theme is that?
<jcater> oh, wait... you use gnome
<jcater> never mind
<Mr_You> derek: good start I guess ;-)
<Mr_You> thats all that matters right now anyways
<jcater> Mr_You: it's better than nothing :)
<Mr_You> yeah
<jcater> it's easier to build on something than to build on nothing
<Mr_You> but in 10 years I expect GNUe to take out my trash and wash my dishes
<Mr_You> and pretty little buttons to click on ;-)
<dneighbo> jcater interesting
<dneighbo> what are you using as the html viewer?
<dneighbo> wxhtml?
<dneighbo> it brings up the front screen but fails on any clicking ( i assume thats what you mean by not functional) :)

<ajmitch> cool
<madlocke> you are doing great work with this! thx
Action: ajmitch doesn't think he's read 9, 10, 11 yet ;)
<psu> aj - I haven't quoted you for a while
<psu> so probably no need ;-)
<psu> madlocke - thanks for the suggestion re topics
<ajmitch> i still need to keep up with what's happening ;)
<psu> It turned out that Zack had been having similar thoughts
<psu> and we got something in place fairly quickly
<psu> http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/topics.html
<psu> This works well for something like GNUe
<psu> which is a significant number of sub-projects in one
<psu> Quite how Zack's going to apply it to the main Kernel Traffic summaries
<psu> I have no idea - I would expect topics to be all over the place
<madlocke> cool
<psu> Zack's been doing the main Kernel Traffic now for three years
<psu> Got slashdotted this week
<ajmitch> hey i was quoted in #10, no fair :)

<psu> AFAIK
<ajmitch> who's the debian maintainer?
<ajmitch> i see someone's willing to do GEAS, what about other GNUe software?
<nickr> I have gnue-* in my package list

<nickr> gnue-designer - A Rapid Application Development tool for GNU Enterprise.

<psu> I think he was "persuaded" to do the lot
<ajmitch> heh cool
<ajmitch> saves me from having to do work then ;)
<nickr> hrm, it has a bug
<nickr> it doesn't depend on wxpython
<psu> You could always do some docs ;-)
<psu> nickr - I thought the python version did
<ajmitch> i'm currently doing some dotgnu packages & will do a dcl one, anyway
<psu> which is all we really have at moment
<nickr> psu: the package doesn't Depend on it like it should
<psu> should be "Recommended" instead?
<nickr> designer requires it
<nickr> and it doesn't Depend: like it should
<psu> oops
<nickr> hrm, and pyxml
<psu> "I'd raise a bug against the package if I were you"
<psu> heard someone say that last week 
<psu> sounded cool
<psu> might even have been you
<nickr> Yea, I'll do it

<derek> holy shit
<derek> aol is staging to buy red hat
<derek> http://www.washtech.com/news/media/14759-1.htmlb
<derek> makes sense tw wants them
<ajmitch> i wonder if it'd go thru
<derek> as m$ is creeping into media space
<derek> so only makes sense aol/tw wants to creep into software space
<derek> already they own aol (msn competition)
<derek> aim (msn messenger competition)
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> this good or bad?
<derek> netscape (internet explorer competition)
<derek> jcater: aol is just as evil as ms
<jcater> imho aol tw is a worse monopoly than m$
<derek> however in DIFFERENT ways
<derek> i.e. i think they would probably be PRO keeping software open source to a degree (look at netscape)

<derek> i mean redhat is linux (which is gpl) so there are limits
<derek> however, i could see them doing things to 'lock microsoft out' :)
<derek> who knows if they 'understand' that software is a tool and not a 'product'
<derek> and they find ways to channel content instead it might not be 'that evil'
jamest (~jamest@fh-dialup-201026.flinthills.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> though admittedly its a wash
<derek> i see it as
<derek> pro:
<derek> linux would have as much money as microsoft for once (between ibm, hp and aol throwing money at it)
<derek> con:
<derek> aol is as bad or worse than m$ when it comes to business practices 
<Mr_You> I imagine it would be similar to how Netscape Navigator is developed.. 
<derek> but i use debian not red hat so dont know how worried to be :)
<derek> Mr_You: i agree
<Mr_You> I'll take a guess.. if RedHat gets bought.. it will continue running similar.. will just be in TWs back pocket with huge potential
<Mr_You> tho RedHat will now have to answer to all of TWs quams
<Mr_You> which might not be bad
<Mr_You> yeah the biz practices is the worse con :-((
<jcater> um
<jcater> as a publisher
Action: jcater works in the Magazine industry
<jcater> TW does not allow competing products to advertise in its magazines typically
<jcater> to date, M$ Windows is not a competing product
<jcater> The TW enterprise includes a LOT of magazines
<jcater> Fortune
<jcater> People
<jcater> Time
<jcater> ad nauseum
<jcater> (Money, Real Simple, ...)
<Mr_You> GPL lives off GrassRoots so it will always exist and possibly prevail ;-)
<jcater> :)
<Mr_You> its already beginning to prevail around the world in gov't and other orgs
<Mr_You> I can see M$ becoming more of a niche comparative to Apple
<Mr_You> who knows ;-)
<jcater> crap
