<Yurik> madlocke re
<madlocke> hi yurik... still awake or again?
<chillywilly> hello
<madlocke> hey chilly
<Yurik> madlocke have slept for few hours :)
Action: Yurik -> smoke
<chillywilly> the funny thing about smoking is it'll kill you
Action: Yurik is back
<Yurik> chillywilly life will kill, too
<chillywilly> heh
Action: chillywilly has heard that excuse a million times
<Yurik> hehe :)
<chillywilly> but anyway, I;m not here to lecture anyone
<chillywilly> hey madlocke how goes the hacking :)?
Action: chillywilly wonders where ra3vat has disappeared to
<chillywilly> haven't seen him in a while
<Yurik> chillywilly if he is young, may be an examinations
<chillywilly> nah, he's an old man ;)
Action: chillywilly feels like an old man
<chillywilly> Yurik: you have exams or something/
<chillywilly> s#/#?#
<Yurik> chillywilly nope
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> what did you do to madlocke he's not talking anymore ;)?
<Yurik> chillywilly dunno :)
<Yurik> chillywilly probably he is sleepy? :))
Action: madlocke is coding ;)
<chillywilly> kewl :)
<chillywilly> what are you coding?
<Isomer> hrm
Action: Isomer reads the KC
<chillywilly> hi Isomer
<madlocke> on layout managers. trying other widgets now
Action: Yurik is writing specification... it will never end :] argh..
<madlocke> hope we don't have to follow the specifications ;)
<chillywilly> or polymethylcyclohexane to be more precise :P
Action: Isomer thinks that mono is to .NET as wine is to win32, dotGNU is to .NET as KDE is to win32, and someone really should be working on gnome :)
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> how is dotGNU like KDE is to win32?
<chillywilly> someone is working on Gnome
<chillywilly> in fact I think it is good for Gnome that ximian/miguel is distracted with Mono ;P
<Isomer> dotGNU is basically taking .NET and implementing the same thing again with all the same problems etc
<Isomer> cw: heh :)
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> that's not the goal of DotGNU
Action: Isomer still doesn't understand why they need a "IL"
<chillywilly> DotGNU wants to be downwardly compatible
<Isomer> you certainly don't need a IL to implement a single signon protocol.
<chillywilly> but, they want to tie the rest of the GNU software together with their own web services framework, imho
<chillywilly> thta's just the portable.net stuff
<chillywilly> that's
<chillywilly> there's the SEE, DEE, and other components
<Isomer> yeah
<chillywilly> Secure Execution Environment, Distributed Execution Environment
<Isomer> defining a really nice web services framework I think is a really good idea
Action: madlocke likes .net too
<Isomer> SOAP, XMLRPC, CORBA's RPC (whatever it is)
<Isomer> (IOL?)
<chillywilly> yep and Java, C# (M$ shit), will all be pluggable
<Isomer> we do web services at work, and everyone appears to think that "CSV" is really 'neat'
<chillywilly> CSV?
<chillywilly> comma separated values ;P
<Isomer> yeah
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> I was joking
<chillywilly> no xml?
<Isomer> Ebay is the only one that uses something resembling XML
<Isomer> it's weird
<chillywilly> ah
<chillywilly> that's interesting
<Isomer> yeah
<Isomer> thats what I thought
<chillywilly> so a potential market for dotGNU Inc. (yes they are forming a copany) could be e-commerce
<Isomer> having a nice standard way of exporting information would be great
<Isomer> yep
<Isomer> you really don't want to know how web payment gateways work
<chillywilly> sure I do
<madlocke> me too ;)
<madlocke> explain
Action: chillywilly thinks it might be a bit scary
<Isomer> basically you have "www.a.com" who's an ecommerce site.  "www.b.com" is a credit card clearing company.
<chillywilly> btw, corba is an rpc for objects
<chillywilly> like soap
<chillywilly> but it uses IIOP instead of xml
<Isomer> cw: yeah, I know.  I was just trying to remember what the acronym for the protocol was (IIOP)
Action: chillywilly wants to write a pluggable OO rpc thingy so you could use whatever you wanted
<Isomer> when you go through checkout on "www.a.com" it bounces you to a url "www.b.com/foo/?id=12", www.b.com fetches a preprogrammed URL ("www.a.com/foo/?id=12") and gets the information from it.  When the customer successfully pays it fetches ("www.a.com/success") or ("www.a.com/fail") and redirects the web browser to som page (www.a.com/continue)
<Isomer> so if you can guess the success / fail urls
<Isomer> you can spoof things
<Isomer> some are even less secure than that
<chillywilly> wow, that is shitty
<chillywilly> so, knowing what you know do you stil buy things online?
<Isomer> I don't buy anything online :)
<Isomer> I don't have a credit card
<madlocke> hm... was thinking there are lot of payment protocols like iKP for example... these are not used?
<Isomer> madlocke: companies want to charge you a lot more for those
Action: chillywilly doesn't use credit cards either, but I do use my VISA check card
<Isomer> and ecommerce sites want to save every single cent.
Action: chillywilly 's credit cards are all mzed out :P
<Isomer> iKP is probably used by the credit card clearing webistes (www.b.com in the example)
<chillywilly> Isomer: I would recommend ou never get one
<chillywilly> s/ou/you
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: chillywilly is not familiar with this iKP protocol
<Isomer> cw: neither
<Isomer> for the ecommerce code we do, I got them to clean it up a bit
<chillywilly> hey
<Isomer> for example, having them store all passwords as one way hashes and doing verification (instead of storing the password and comparing)
<madlocke> so it is only part because if i remember correctly iKP defines the whole transaction.
<chillywilly> can any of you python gurus whip me up a one liner to print put the IP address for a machine?
<Isomer> and then we encrypt the users CC information with their password
<chillywilly> s/put/out
<Isomer> chillywilly: a machine can have multiple IP addresses
<chillywilly> well lets assume that it doesn't and you can use ifconfig
<chillywilly> how can I use the python interpreter to execute a program form the command line?
Action: chillywilly should stop being lazy and look it up
<Isomer> __import__("posix").popen("ls").readlines()
<Isomer> map(lambda x:x.split(":"),__import__("posix").popen("/sbin/ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet addr'").readlines())[0][1]
<Isomer> I think is the IP address
<Isomer> and a very hidious python line 
<Isomer> warning: untested :)
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> what siwtch can I give the interpreter to take that line and execute it?
<chillywilly> without stikcing it into a file
<Isomer> python -c '.....'
<Isomer> I think from memory
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> do you need to quote it?
<chillywilly> 'cmd'
<chillywilly> it didn't like it
<Isomer> you probably do yes
<chillywilly> danielb@obfuscation:~$ python -c 'map(lambda x:x.split(":"),__import__("posix").popen("/sbin/ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet addr'").readlines())[0][1]'
<chillywilly>   File "<string>", line 1
<chillywilly>     map(lambda x:x.split(":"),__import__("posix").popen("/sbin/ifconfig eth0 | grep inet
<Isomer> ah
<Isomer> hrm
<chillywilly> er
<Isomer> stick \'s around the ''s in the 'inet addr' 's
<chillywilly> ith the '^' pointing at inet
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> like this: \'inet addr\'") ?
<Isomer> yeah
<chillywilly> bah the shell is doing continuation now
<Isomer> shrug
<Isomer> might be better to do it in the interpreter
<Isomer> what are you trying to do andwhy?
<Isomer> that script's a very hidious hack
<chillywilly> it needs to be a one liner
<Isomer> if you wanted to do it in shell, why involve python at all?
<chillywilly> yes, it uses lambda
<Isomer> hrm
<Isomer> I was refering to the use of "__import__()" :P
<chillywilly> because ppl on the LUG list are having this little goofy contest
<Isomer> lambda is kinda nice
<chillywilly> and they have sheel utilities and perl one liners
<chillywilly> shell
<chillywilly> so I wated to throw python in there
<chillywilly> for shits and grin
<chillywilly> s
<chillywilly> lambda is hairy just like all that functional programming stuff :P
<chillywilly> imho
<chillywilly> >>> map(lambda x:x.split(":"),__import__("posix").popen("/sbin/ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet addr'").readlines())[0][1] 
<chillywilly> '192.168.1.2  Bcast'
<chillywilly> almost worked
<chillywilly> I think the shell does ssomething wacky to the 's around the inet addr
<Isomer> bash-2.04$ python -c 'print map(lambda x:__import__("string").split(__import__("string").split(x,":")[1]," "),__import__("posix").popen("/sbin/ifconfig eth0|grep \"inet addr\"").readlines())[0][0]'
<Isomer> 10.1.1.99
<Isomer> now thats python to be afraid of
<chillywilly> kewl
<Isomer> never let it be said that it's impossible to write unreadble python code
<Isomer> did the gnue debian packages make it in?
<chillywilly> I think so...
<chillywilly> what do I need to use debian oackages for ;)
<chillywilly> packages
Action: Isomer assumes they aren't in testing yet tho?
Action: chillywilly uses the source
<chillywilly> beats me
<chillywilly> I don't have any testing machines
<chillywilly> all unstable
Action: Isomer grabs the cvs copy then
Action: chillywilly has write access too,so if I don't like something I can just change it ;P
<Isomer> always makes things easier :)
<Isomer> hrm
<Isomer> certificate is out of date on gnuenterprise.org
<chillywilly> what certificate?
<Isomer> and it's selfsigned ;)
<Isomer> https://www.gnuenterprise.org/dclgw/
<Isomer> does gnue have a bug/task tracking system?
<chillywilly> we use savannah
<Isomer> ah ha
<chillywilly> (not the best thing I know)
<Isomer> no link off the front page that I can find
<chillywilly> complain to the web masters ;)
<chillywilly> (i.e, jamest, jcater)
Action: Isomer complains to the channel in general :)
<chillywilly> won't do you any good right now though
<chillywilly> hey pnet is apt-gettable now thanks to ajmitch
<chillywilly> Debian packages of Portable.NET released
<chillywilly> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<chillywilly> Andrew Mitchell has released Debian packages of DotGNU Portable.NET
<chillywilly> which are now available from http://www.dotgnu.org -- those who run
<chillywilly> Debian GNU/Linux can put this line into /etc/apt/sources.list to
<chillywilly> allow easy installation with apt-get.  Packages for GNU/Hurd are
<chillywilly> also planned, but not available yet.
<madlocke> cw: what does a better job than savannah?
<chillywilly> dunno, I think they want to interface with gnats
<chillywilly> but I have no idea how good gnats is
<chillywilly> does anyone use gnats anywhere?
<chillywilly> (any OS/FS project)
<madlocke> tried it long time ago... don't remember... lot of people like bugzilla
<chillywilly> some ppl also find it to be weird ;)
<madlocke> :)
<madlocke> what's wrong with savannah so they want to change it
Action: Isomer never really understood gnats
<chillywilly> I think a bug system shouldn't assume that all bugs are coming from users
<Isomer> hrm
<Isomer> you know
<chillywilly> developers find bugs in their code all the time
<chillywilly> and they should be abel to note it as such
<Isomer> gnu enterprise could write a good bug/job tracking system :)
<chillywilly> :D
<Isomer> and have forms distributed with it to browse/submit bugs :)
<Isomer> t'would be a good example of a complicated tool for gnue :)
Action: chillywilly wishes he had the money to go to LinuxWorld
<Isomer> what debian packages are required for gnue?
Action: chillywilly wonder where the gnue packages are
<chillywilly> wonders
<chillywilly> apt-get install gnue-designer gnue-common gnue-forms
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> apt-get install geas
<chillywilly> you'd have it all then
<chillywilly> apt-get instal geas-doc
<Isomer> E: Couldn't find package gnue-designer
<Isomer> hrm
<chillywilly> testing?
<Isomer> yeah
<chillywilly> these are in sid
<Isomer> wxpython appears to be for python1.5
<Isomer> well, I have to wait 10 days then :)
<chillywilly> apt-get update
<chillywilly> apt-get dist-upgrade
<chillywilly> ;P
<Isomer> what do they depend on?
<Isomer> in particular, what wxpython package?
<chillywilly> you only need to grab designer
<chillywilly> the other get pulled along
<chillywilly> others
<chillywilly> the geas one is old though as the cvs code is more funtional, imho
Action: Isomer has installed most of the dependances for python1.5, 2.0, 2.2, and now 2.1
<Isomer> I'll get a full set of dependancies one day :P
Action: chillywilly installs gnue debs for kicks
Action: Isomer worries about the gnue coders and their fascination with sheep :)
Action: chillywilly thinks that the desginer deb won't run either because of a borked wxgtk
<chillywilly> it's goats
<chillywilly> not sheep
<chillywilly> http://goats.gnue.org
Action: chillywilly wonders if 0.0.6 is the laste geas release we did
<Isomer> "Waddaya mean "Baa! B-Baa! ! Baa!"?... "Sheep ya dern fool!"
<chillywilly> wassat from?
<chillywilly> someone's sig?

<chillywilly> shouldn't forms depend on more than python-2.1 and gnue-common?
<Yurik> re
<chillywilly> howdy
<chillywilly> the description is a bit off though
<chillywilly> forms works in 2-tier with almost any database

<chillywilly> kewl
<chillywilly> 0.1.1?
<jamest> yes
<chillywilly> excellent
<jamest> should be out today
<jamest> in release form
<chillywilly> cool

<derek> Yurik:a few things
<jamest> back
<derek> the certificate is self signed and will remain that way unless you want to drop 150 US dollars to get it signed
<derek> we already have bug/tracking its called DCL
<derek> there are works porting it to the gnue architecture already
<derek> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/service_requests.jpg
<derek> for example is a ROUGH form for such a thing
<derek> hi jamest
<derek> btw: that screen shot is from 'production' usage :)
<derek> at one of the largest local govt's in the united states ;)
<jamest> hi derek
<jamest> can you test tarballs today
<derek> yeah
<derek> what about .exe's
<jamest> I'm working on them now
<derek> rpms?
Action: derek cant test rpms but am wondering :)
<jamest> maybe
<jamest> i have other things i need to do today
<derek> i wish we could coordinate w/ debian maintainer to get debs loaded (the new release)
<jamest> all gnue related :)
<jamest> you have his email?
<derek> as i ahve a 'virgin' debian box that i need gnue installed on :)
<jamest> btw - I'm joinging all the db mailing lists i can find today
<jamest> and going to ask for testers
<derek> ok
<jamest> derek: what backend you using in that pic?
<derek> what other gnue stuff you got going on today?
<derek> postgres
<jamest> joining the lists
<jamest> the basic release
<jamest> then I'm adding trigger enhancements in forms
<jamest> if time allows I'm redoing the event system as well so that it plays nicer w/ the mouse
<jamest> i'll also fold in the i18n stuff from the dude from india
<jamest> also want to get a good look into madlocke's layout mgr
<jamest> and see what it'll take to add that in as well
Action: jamest has a busy day ahead
<jamest> oh yeah
<jamest> plan on doing an install guide too
<jamest> for maintainers
<jamest> wanted to be on it sooner 
<jamest> but had to go to store, then had to clean some driveways of snow

<derek> im doing it via odbc

<jamest> then they can snap up the DSL market
<jamest> wonder if they ever stopped to think there will not be a DSL market once cable is std
<jamest> morrons
<derek> rofl
<jamest> dude
<derek> i think its just an anti jamest campaign personally
<jamest> I'm almost 100% serious
<derek> but what do i know :)
<jamest> they are trying everything they can to fuck the ISPs
<jcater> jamest: it's a conpiracy against free software
<derek> when you have something in your cvs tree called 
<jcater> and in manhattan, ks he's the rep for free software
<derek>  camelproviders/
<jamest> in the mean time cable is making huge inroads here
<derek> it think the joke has gone too far :)
<jcater> who's cvs?
<derek> evolution
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> note to self: 
<jamest> dude
<derek> configure.in says:
<derek> camel_providerdir='$(libdir)/evolution/camel-providers/'$EVOLUTION_MAJOR_VERSION.$EVOLUTION_MINOR_VERSION
<derek> which results in:
<derek> camel_providerdir = $(libdir)/evolution/camel-providers/1.1
<derek> appearing in all Makefiles.
<derek> But the mail/Makefile.in *also* defines
<jamest> I'm uploading the win32 bins
<jamest> but if they don't work
<jamest> someone else may what to rebuild
<jamest> as it's a 5-10 minute process to upload one of four files
<jamest> what = want
<jamest> GNUe-Designer-0.1.1-debug.exe uploaded
<jcater> "You are not authorized to view this page"
<jamest> ?
<jamest> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jamest/pre-release/
<jcater> if I click on any of the ZIP filkes
<jcater> it'll download
<jcater> if I click on an .exe fle, I get that
<jamest> try now
<jcater> HTTP Error 403 - Forbidden 
<jcater> much mo betta
<jcater> downloading now
Action: jamest prepairs to be disgusted
<jcater> why?
Action: jamest is waiting for the "got it" from jcater
<jcater> nah
Action: jcater is getting HORRIBLE service recently
<jamest> <jcater> Um, I've downloaded the file 10 times in the last 5 minutes and it keeps telling me it's not a valid exe file
<jamest> <jamest> let me upload a new one,  try again on the 21st
<jcater> dude... it's taking me 4 minutes to download
<jamest> ahhhhhhh
<jamest> that new firewall rule works
<jamest> if broadband detected rate_limit_to_14.4
<jcater> dude!
<jcater> the exe is corrupt
<jcater> j/k
<jcater> ;)
<jcater> man
<jcater> wx looks so much better under win98 than gtk
<jcater> wish they'd work on that
<jcater> ahh
<jcater> designer is so purdy
Action: jamest thinks about his evil plans for it
<jcater> eh?
<jamest> i've been trying to grok how to use the data source editor
<jamest> and thinking that a tree of the schema layout might be easier to deal with
<jamest> dude
<jamest> I've been uploading the next file since 1:43
<jamest> I'm 82% done
Action: jcater grabs his datasource editor and holds it close
<jcater> "I'll protect you from that tree-huggin hippy"
<jcater> actually, I never foresaw the data source editor being the main schema tool

<jamest> you'll have forms to test out in about 5 min i hope
<jcater> cool
<jcater> I can only test dataless forms from here
<jcater> :(
<jamest> 64%
<jamest> we're rocking!
<derek> rofl
<derek> its like watching the abbott and costello release party :)
<jamest> i now know we can't release more often
<jamest> we have to wait for my modem to catch up
<jamest> maybe I should burn them onto cd and mail them to jcater
<jamest> it might be faster
<jamest> i'm putting together a list of db  driver authors and mailing lists
<jamest> and am contacting them about our drivers 
<jamest> looking for people to help give us the info we need for introspection
<jamest> as well as testers
<jamest> is there anything else I should address?
<jcater> well, of course mention our features, in an "oh, by the way" style
<jcater> ;)
<jamest> btw 79%
Action: jcater wonders if jamest has thought about bzipping the files, then scp, them bunzipping?
<jamest> i thought the exe's were already compacted
Action: jamest runs off to try it
<jcater> are they?
<jcater> they may be
<derek> mail woudl be to slow
<derek> but if you burned them
<derek> and then stood on street corner w/ sign 'memphis or bust'
<derek> you might find someone to 'carry them for you same day' ;)
<jamest> :)
<derek> if some one (ahem) will PLEASE get ssl postgres workign somewhere
<derek> i will fix the contact manager (as it really does work
<derek> so that we can put all contacts for gnue in it
<jamest> rock!
<jamest> bzip saves 40k
<jamest> that's like 15 minutes upload time!
<jcater> wow
<derek> as just today someone asked for baux's email address (our deb maintainer)
<derek> i have some of the data already
<jamest> 4758296 char exe 4711401 exe.bz
<jamest> lol
<jamest> that someone was me
<jamest> and i didn't get an answer
<jamest>  /msg jcater i think he's picked up on our policy of ignoring requests for features or info
<jamest> :)
<jamest> rock! debug forms available
<jamest> derek: can you win32 test?
<jamest> whoop non-debug at 11%
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> dude
<jcater> what was that keyerror you were getting on win32
<jcater> ?
<jcater> did you fix that?
<jamest> um
<jamest> crap
<jamest> no
<jamest> a key error in GFEntry error
<jcater> as I'm getting it with the intro.gfd
<jamest> yip
<jamest> that was the issue
Action: jamest whimpers
<jcater> btw, I wonder if rsyncing against the already uploaded binaries would help w/your "speed" problem
<derek> i can test jamest but not until after bills are done
<jcater> ah, nevermind
<jcater> does the keyerror cause a problem?
<jamest> jcater: i'd have to make the names match
<jcater> as the form still works
<jamest> no
<jamest> and it didn't happen on a sample form against a db
<jcater> ah
<jcater> actually, I think I recall this happening last time
<jcater> so I'm not too worried
<jcater> but we should probably trace it next time
<jamest> ok
<jcater> err, by next time, the problem will have probably gone away

<ajmitch> to see your partition table, you'd need to boot off a floppy or cdrom, and run fdisk
<ajmitch> ok
<derek> ok tried 1 2 and 3
<derek> any other ideas
<dsmith> You need to boot off rescue media to have a working system so you can inspect things.
<dsmith> Floppy or cd
<dsmith> Well, I'll be back in about .5 hour.  Gotta take my son over a friends house for a sleepover.
<derek> sigh i hope i can find the floppy
<ajmitch> i should be around for a little while i hope
<derek> do i use rescue or root/
<ajmitch> rescue
<derek> ok rescue comes up with
<derek> boot:
<derek> now what?
<derek> as i dont want to 'reinstall'
<ajmitch> hit tab
<derek> resuce root=/dev/fd0
<derek> maybe?
<ajmitch> i guess it'll have a 'linux' entry
<derek> linux starts install
<ajmitch> just hit enter then
<derek> this better not reinstall :)
<ajmitch> when you hit enter?
<ajmitch> so what's going down?
<derek> sorry had to go to the crapper :)
<derek> ok
<derek> parition chec:
<derek>   hda: hda1 hda2 hda3
<derek> VFS: Insert root floppy disk to be loaded into RAM disk and press ENTER
<derek> are last lines
<derek> putting in root.bin
<derek> and getting ready to hit enter
<ajmitch> ok
<derek> ok hit enter and its chugging away
<derek> once this comes up what shoudl i do?
<derek> yikes
<ajmitch> k
<ajmitch> if it does start the install, you can stop it :)
<derek> it gives me an install
<derek> i dont think i want this :)
<derek> help.....
<ajmitch> what?
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> you on a gnu/linux box right now?
<ajmitch> well?
<derek> i put rescue disk back in
<derek> and then at boot:
<derek> i did rescue root=/dev/hda3
<derek> and am letting it go
<derek> ok on reboot got through /dev/hda3 check
<derek> but then kernel panicked at
<derek> Calculating module dependencies... Kernel panic: VFS: LRU block list corrupted
<ajmitch> ouch
<ajmitch> something is wrong with that filesystem i'm sure
<ajmitch> can you write bootdisks from the system you're currently on?
<derek> um is root.bin
<derek> a boot disk?
<derek> ajmitch.... how do i make a boot disk
ajmitch_ (~me@p30-max7.dun.ihug.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> ajmitch.... how do i make a boot disk
<derek> also how is a boot disk diff from rescue disk?
ajmitch (me@p57-max7.dun.ihug.co.nz) left irc: Killed (NickServ (Ghost: ajmitch_!~me@p30-max7.dun.ihug.co.nz))

<ajmitch> you can usually make boot disks like a parted disk or tomsrtbt using dd

<derek> sigh
<derek> i guess im fscked
<ajmitch> no
<derek> ajmitch thats not helpful enough info to do me good
<derek> and i have wasted 3 hours now on this
<ajmitch> so you want me to step you thru this each step at a time?
<derek> and i only have 20 hours worth of work on the machine
<derek> yes
<ajmitch> hrmm
<derek> also explain how this is 'different' than the rescue disk
<ajmitch> what machines do you have access to at the moment
<derek> ie. if the rescue disk dont work why would a 'boot' disk work
<derek> i have a redhat 6.2 machine
<ajmitch> a rescue disk is just another boot disk with some utitlies on it
<derek> but dont know i can get the floppy to work
<derek> its ONLY machine ihave with a floppy
<derek> i have a debian box on this network as well but no floppy in it
<ajmitch> ok, so the machine you're trying to fix is only one with floppy?
<derek> possibly
<derek> let me play some
<derek> easiest way to find out is tell me what to do :)
<ajmitch> argh
<ajmitch> since it would be good if you could download a rescue/boot floppy image off the net, write it to disk, and then use that to boot up :)
<derek> ok
<derek> tell me the steps
<derek> worse case i have to reboot my laptop to get access to a floppy
<ajmitch> http://www.toms.net/rb/download.html
<derek> mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/fd0,
<derek>        or too many mounted file systems
<derek> i get that on all floppy drives i try
<derek> how do i download it?
<derek> i clieck to download it takes me to a home page
<derek> i click download on the home page it takes me back to wehre i started

<derek> what file do i want
<derek> mdean i asked if that was possible
<derek> and no one would answer me :)
<derek> i.e. "how come i cant just use the rescue disk" :)
<ajmitch> tomsrtbt-1.7.361.tar.gz
<mdean> it's what I normally do
<derek> so how do i do it using the rescue disk?
<mdean> I hate floppy disks ;-)
<ajmitch> mdean: depends on what's on the rescue disk
<derek> if it requires floppy + cd im screwed
<mdean> shouldn't the debian install disk be sufficient?
<ajmitch> mdean: if the rescue disk has no root fs, then you can't run fsck ;)
<derek> as the cd in that machine is toast now
<derek> i have a new one, but havent installed it yet (still in back seat of car)
<ajmitch> mdean: btw, i have a nicely broken dcl package put together (after changing the scripts to accomodate changes in filenames, locations)
<derek> ajmitch: i have both .zip and tar.gz
<mdean> hehe - I got deb on my laptop, but need to get the dhcp going - it's b0rked right now
<derek> mdean: if you have a way to do this w/ just rescue disk please let me know
<derek> ajmitch: what do i do with the tar.gz file?
<ajmitch> derek: the .zip is for installation from dos
<ajmitch> derek: what do you normally do with tar.gz files? unpack it!
<derek> ok un packed
<ajmitch> http://www.toms.net/rb/tomsrtbt.FAQ
<derek> sigh
<derek> another rtfm person
<ajmitch> further install instructions are in there
<derek> btw: i hate that
<ajmitch> sorry, i hate answering every obvious question
<derek> btw: ajmitch it wouldnt have hurt to say go to directory you just untarred and run
<derek> ./install.s
<ajmitch> you were asking what to do with a tar.gz
<derek> i assume once this disk is built i simply put in dead machine
<ajmitch> yes
<derek> and reboot it
<derek> ajmitch: fwiw: oven times on this kind of stuff you dont untar/zip it
<derek> tahts why i asked
<ajmitch> it's rare for a boot disk, since it need a boot sector & fs first on the disk
<mdean> derek: looking at the potato(e) cd, I started the installer, switched to virtual console 2, and you should have access to e2fsck and fdisk from the /sbin dir
<derek> i dont have a 'cd'
Action: ajmitch hasn't used the debian cd for months
<derek> but if i put in rescue
<derek> then it goes to bin
<derek> er root.bin
<derek> then when at installer go to different console
<derek> and i have fsck?
<ajmitch> well, a couple of months actually :)
<ajmitch> i guess you might
<mdean> that's the way it is on the cd
Action: derek is trying
<mdean> is that the box you need to replace your drive on?
<ajmitch> the disks should be the same as cd
<derek> mdean fi works you out smarted 381 folks in #debian
<derek> as i asked the question at least 15 times
<derek> why do i need to make disks when i have two bootable disks in front of me
<derek> ajmitch: im still making the boot disk just in case
<mdean> this is exactly why people need to cut their teeth on slackware ;-)
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> mdean: i started off with mandrake, and i worked out fine ;)
<derek> mdean: i tend to disagree :)
<derek> i think in general people shouldnt really have to know this crap :)
<derek> i.e. it shouldnt be mandatory to programming computers
<ajmitch> i've done this sort of stuff a few times
Action: derek has serious allergy to hardware and low level kernel crap
<mdean> I agree, but also disagree - this is something I learned to do from slackware (using install CD to get to system and help it along)
<ajmitch> i have a directory with a few boot disk images, and a few bootable cds lying about ;)
<derek> i just want to be 'productive' writing software and diong what i need to do :)
<ajmitch> i do recall using the potato cd one time
<derek> BUT someone out there needs to know this stuff :)
<derek> and that type of person shoudl cut teeth on slackware :)
<ajmitch> most of the time i've found the mandrake rescue image on the cd to be quite good
<ajmitch> ok, so i actually started on a zipslack derivative ;)
<mdean> ja - I've also used slackware disks to rescue redhat machines
<mdean> but that's in the past
<derek> ok im there
<derek> fsck /dev/hda3
<derek> its doing its thang
Action: derek is seriously crossing fingers
Action: ajmitch starts praying
<derek> ok
<derek> fsck gets a segfault
<derek> how you like them apples
<mdean> ow
<ajmitch> now that's something not good
<mdean> is this the machine you need to replace the cdrom on?
<derek> yes
<derek> im thinking the mother board is toastified
<mdean> ja
Action: derek is ready to put an ass whooping on it
<mdean> that's what I'm starting to think
<mdean> how did you determine the cdrom is bad?
<derek> um in middle of a burn it failed
<derek> i rebooted and it wouldnt access it
<derek> wouldnt spit out disk
<derek> woudl hang windows if i tried to access it
<derek> i thought DUMB windows
<derek> so booted into debian to get my disk 'back'
<mdean> did you try it in another box to be sure?
<derek> and debian said 'f you mutha' that disk be jacked
<derek> i figured (stoopid me) that if both windows and debian were rejecting it that it wasnt 'software'
<derek> and since it had worked fine on both before then
<derek> that it had just had its 'day'
<mdean> I think something else may have kicked the bucket
<derek> at that point i hadnt saw other problems in that made me suspect that it was board
<derek> i thought 'maybe' the cable
<derek> but that cable was for harddrive and connections were good so went and popped a new cd
<derek> if i can get this fixed and it aint the cd though :)
<derek> i can return that other drive :)
<derek> mdean: i thought it might be bad ram, but i pulled ram out of it and such and i think its just on its last leg
<derek> though what is weird
<derek> is i can boot the windows fine right
<derek> which makes me think its seeing that hard disk ok
<mdean> I wouldn't put much faith in windows in this case...
<derek> me either :)
<derek> it will run regardless of how jacked the environment is :)
Action: derek guesses it wouldnt run for long
<mdean> ja
<derek> in fact it didnt, thats what prompted me booting into linux in first place
<derek> was it shit out on wife other day
<mdean> what is the cpu in it?
<derek> k6 300 or k6 350 (i cant quite recall)
<mdean> ah
<mdean> those don't multitask very well ;-)
<mdean> becomes real evident in BeOS
Action: ajmitch has a k6-2 400 :)
<mdean> ajmitch: so does my daughter (my old one)
<derek> i wouldnt mind 'upgrading'
<derek> but if thats not the problem i hate to spend the money right now
<mdean> do you have another box you can build up?
<mdean> how big is the hdd btw?
<mdean> even if you have another desktop you can put the hd into and retrieve your data would be great
<derek> hdd is only like 3 or 4gig i think
<derek> mdean : hmmm thats true
<mdean> not that I've done this before ;-)
<derek> i just put linux on this a while back
<derek> nothing on windows i can think of that i 'need'
<derek> i did do about 20 hours of bills in gnucash
<derek> and thats all i need off linux
<derek> i do all email and work currently on my laptop
<derek> and i rsync my laptop to my 'server' w/ big drive regularly
<mdean> ja - I usually just snag the home directories and go from there
<derek> trying different ram again
<derek> and seeing if i will have better luck
<mdean> 100% different?
<derek> no
<derek> hmm no segfault now
<derek> fsck -c -v /dev/hda3
<derek> e2fsck 1.18, 11-Nov-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
<derek> Killed
<derek> Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
<derek> Killed
<derek> what does that mean?
<mdean> dunno - looks like it got the -9 somehow
<mdean> all in all, this is really flaky
<derek> hmmm i didnt -9 it
<mdean> I didn't think *you* did ;-)
<mdean> did you try a normal boot into linux?
<ajmitch> flaky? it's b0rken :)
<derek> mdean trying that now
<derek> ah crap stoopid me
<derek> there was easy answer....
<ajmitch> how so?
Action: derek pulls that 25lb sledge out of the tool box
<ajmitch> uh oh
<derek> smack
Action: mdean DCCs derek some patience...
<derek> crash
<derek> bang
<derek> well now there is no question
<derek> the motherboard is br0ked
<derek> in about 50 pieces on my floor :)O
<mdean> heh
<derek> ok new pain
<mdean> time for that athlon MP system ;-)
<ajmitch> heh
Action: ajmitch wants!
<derek> RAMDISK: Laoding 3496 blocks [1 disk] into ram disk... <0>Kernel panic: out of memory and no killable processes
<derek> BUT that explans the killed
<derek> :)
<derek> when fsck ran out of memory it killed itself :)
<derek> i think the machine isnt seeing the memory right
<mdean> and how much ram is allegedly in there?
<derek> which validates the dorked mb theory
<derek> um 128mb stick
<derek> plust 12mb stick
<mdean> hmmmm - don't you need 256MB for fsck? ;-)
<derek> nope
<derek> thats ms_fsck
<mdean> ha!
<mdean> well, in this case I'd stop dorking around with the hard drive in that box :)
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> mdean: you willing to donate some hardware over this way? ;)
<mdean> are you needy?
<ajmitch> yeah ;)
<ajmitch> my main box is a k6-2, you know 
<ajmitch> i'll probably try & upgrade in the next month or so
<mdean> athlon?
<ajmitch> probably
<ajmitch> currently i have 386mb ram, 21gb hard drive in this box
<mdean> sweet - I'm on a 1.33GHz 
<ajmitch> 384 i mean
<ajmitch> i think the DCL package needs quite a bit of work before it's worthy of being uploaded to debian ;)
<ajmitch> got to handle upgrades from earlier dcl packages
<mdean> it will be nice to have it maintained again, tho :)
<derek> ok have 'new line up in'
<derek> and rerunning fsck
<derek> it made it to pass2
<derek> woooo hoooo
<derek> btw: if all this works
<derek> im get some rsyncing love
<ajmitch> hehe
<derek> and try to switch cd in another box to see if it works
<ajmitch> i really have to start doing that once i get some space
<derek> if it does then i am gonna assum the mb of that box is hosed
<derek> if not
<ajmitch> my / partition was down to 25mb free earlier today
<derek> then i will assume i had an over heat
<derek> ok fsck finshed ok
<derek> woo hoo
<derek> try to boot normal now
<ajmitch> it's back up to 410mb free after apt-move
<mdean> ajmitch: just burn your pr0n collection onto CD - you don't need it on the hd ;-)
Yurik (~yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Yurik> re
<ajmitch> mdean: you see, i don't actually have a pr0n collection :)
<mdean> hey Yurik
<Yurik> mdean hi
<mdean> ajmitch: did you just rm -rf it?
<ajmitch> mdean: have never had one
Action: derek creams himself
<ajmitch> besides, if i did, it'd go on one of the other partitions
<derek> im back in
<derek> w/ normal bootup
<ajmitch> excellent
<ajmitch> so what was the actual problem?
<derek> ajmitch well memory is definitely 'finicky'
<derek> finally got right combo so i could do that fsck
<ajmitch> that not good
<derek> whether its what CAUSED the original problem
<derek> or whether the mb did im not sure
<derek> i think if i move that cdrom to another box and its still good
<derek> then its probably definitely a mb issue
Action: ajmitch needs to get out & shoot tomorrow
<derek> if the cdrom is bad on antoher box
<derek> then i have to question the memory or the cpu(heat)
<ajmitch> i had an issue with cpu overheating - the fan wasn't turning ;)
<derek> well im watching the fan turn
<ajmitch> it owuld lock up randomly every coupl of weeks or so
<derek> BUT i noticed this bastard has default screen saver as random
<derek> and i saw it runnig matrix the other night
<derek> and that is processor intensive
<derek> and on this little k6 probably fried it up good
<ajmitch> the box i had overheating doesn't usually run X
<ajmitch> (k6-233)
<derek> as on my pIII laptop it almost makes my box SMOKE :)

<derek> hey mdean you have mame working right?
<derek> on debina
<derek> er debian
dneighbo_ (dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<mdean> nope - deb is only on the laptop and it's not even speaking dhcp yet 
Action: ajmitch has had remarkably few problems with debian
gnuebot (eggdrop@mail.libertydistribution.com) got netsplit.

<derek> hmmm
<derek> i have a galeon process that wont die
<derek> kill -9 pid#
<derek> wont even kill it
<derek> is there a more 'violent' kill?
<mdean> is it Zombie?
<derek> dont know
<mdean> ps ax | grep galeon
<derek> restarting X
<mdean> see if 3rd column is Z
<derek> seeing if comes back
<derek> its gone now
<derek> when i do top
<derek> it shows 1 zombie
<derek> how do i find out what process it is?
<dsmith> derek: Do a ps ax -H next time (or pstree).  Kill the parent. If it's X, yeah, restart X.
<mdean> ps ax | grep Z
<mdean> there are more elegant solutions, I'm sure
<dsmith> ps ax| grep XXX   Use it all the time.
<dsmith> "ps ax | grep -v grep | grep XXX" keeps the grep from showing up.
<mdean> ja - but I'm too lazy to do that sometimes ;-)
<chillywilly> back
<derek> ok galeon bin is still there
<derek> and its zombie
<derek> how do i 'whack it'
<mdean> reboot 
<derek> seriously
<mdean> ja
<derek> what is this m$ linux ;()
<derek> are you pulling my leg or do you really have to reboot
<chillywilly> kill its parent
<chillywilly> ps ax -H
<derek> how do you find out what its parent is?
<dsmith> The only way to kill a zombie is for it's parent to call wait() on it, but the parent is gone, that's why it's a zombie.
<derek> um chillywilly there are two galeons
<derek> one type D
<derek> one type Z
<mdean> yup - zombie = lost child
<mdean> Z = zombie
<chillywilly>  PROCESS STATE CODES
<chillywilly>        D   uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
<derek> sigh
<chillywilly> ps ax -H shows parent child relationships
<dsmith> pstree and ps -H show parent/child relationships.
<derek> this is first time i have had to reboot linux
<derek> for something other than stupidity on my part
<derek> or hardware bastardization
<chillywilly> why would you reboot it?
Action: derek feels like he is being devirgined....
<dsmith> chillywilly: How do you keep typing just what I type befor I can?
<derek> my first uncontrollable zombie
<chillywilly> I am damn good ;)
<chillywilly> j/k
<chillywilly> psychic even
<derek> chillywilly: um cuz i thought you guys said that was only way to kill a zombie
<dsmith> derek: try a killall galeon

<laurie> you lose
<chillywilly> init will reap zombies...you shouldn't have to go that extreme if there are no immediate parents than perhaps X is a parent?
<laurie> laurie@grapevine:~$ ps -ax |grep Z

<laurie> laurie@grapevine:~$ 
<laurie> nope i tried it already but did again for kicks
<laurie> so sounds like mdean is closer to correct unless you have other ideas?
<dsmith> Did ps ax -H show the parent?
<chillywilly> you have not looked at parent child stuff
<laurie>  1002 ?        D      0:11   /usr/bin/galeon-bin --sm-client-id 117f000001000101 1023 ?        Z      0:00     [galeon-bin <defunct>]
<laurie> i pasted that earlier :)
<laurie> you told me to kill -9 1002 (the parent i assume)
<chillywilly> you cannot kill 1002?
<laurie> and no dice
<laurie> chillywilly: kill -9 1002 did not work
<laurie> if you have other suggestions im all ears
<chillywilly> is 1002 the parent?
<dsmith> it's kill 9 xxx not kill -9 xxx
<laurie> ?
<chillywilly> dsmith: umm, you can use -9
<dsmith> Ok.
<laurie> laurie@grapevine:~$ kill 9 1002
<laurie> bash: kill: (9) - No such process
<laurie> laurie@grapevine:~$ 
<laurie> dont think it works w/o the -
<dsmith> <laurie> Bad syntax, perhaps a bogus '-'?
<chillywilly> it is kill -9
<chillywilly> kill 9 is bs
<chillywilly> it si saying kill the process with id 9
<chillywilly> kill -9 says send SIGKILL
<dsmith> chillywilly: You are right.  I am wakky.
<laurie> regardless i have a D and a Z process out there
<laurie> that arent playing nice
<laurie> shall i reboot
<laurie> or do you have ideas?
<chillywilly> what is D's parent?
<laurie> how do i tell?
<chillywilly> ps -axH
<chillywilly> er
<dsmith> Or pstree
<chillywilly> ps ax H
<chillywilly> woops
<chillywilly> ps ax -H

<chillywilly> anyone know if pthread_t is the thread id or a struct?
<mdean> aren't _t names usually structs?
<chillywilly> beats me
<chillywilly> I just want to know the tid
<chillywilly> print it out in my debuggin' lines
<ajmitch> look in the headers
<chillywilly> I'm too lazy for that
<chillywilly> maybe if I can't find it I'll dig through headers
<mdean> looks like the ID
<mdean> according to my book, anyway
Action: chillywilly has this nice url to thic C book
<chillywilly> ok
<mdean> I have Practical Unix Programming :)
<chillywilly> you would thin info libc would show you ;)
Action: chillywilly looked briefly at glibc pthread stuff
<mdean> "The tid parameter of pthread_create points to the ID of the thread that is created."
<chillywilly> I know it is a pthread_t *
<chillywilly> maybe it is a typedef
<chillywilly> ah well I'll just print it once

<chillywilly> it is a DWORD on win32
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> the _tid
<chillywilly> hey ajmitch
<chillywilly> you ever upgrade mutt?
<ajmitch> who cares about win32?
<chillywilly> are those smutt id issues fixed?
<chillywilly> er, mutt ;)
<chillywilly> damnit
<chillywilly> that's not what I meant to type
<ajmitch> yeah, why?
<ajmitch> what issues?
<chillywilly> I just saw the apt bot talking about how mutt was broken a while ago
<chillywilly> because of GNU TLS
<chillywilly>  /msg apt news #debian
<chillywilly> that "talking"
Action: chillywilly can't afford to let mutt get b0rked
<chillywilly> what version of mutt you go installed?
<chillywilly> 1.3.14?
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> 1.3.24?
<ajmitch> i dunno which one is running
<chillywilly> what version you got installed?
<ajmitch> since i upgraded this morning & haven't restarted it
<chillywilly> ah
<chillywilly> looks to be fixed
<chillywilly> eek
<chillywilly>  [ 2]* do not upgrade to unstable's base-passwd (bug #130032)
<chillywilly> boy they are so detailed
<ajmitch> there's a new base-passwd that fixes that

<ajmitch> detailed?
<chillywilly> 0:12:07] -apt- if you've already done this, install testing's version of base-passwd, and hopefully it fixes things

<derek> sigh
<derek> back from dinner
<derek> and that reboot fried my system again
<chillywilly> uh?
<chillywilly> how?
<mdean> derek: if you haven't, stick that hd on another box and back up your data now! :)
<derek> i backed up my data
<derek> i did a shutdown
<derek> it must not have shutdown cleanly
<mdean> the worst that should happen in that case is some fsck magic
<mdean> unless you're running ReiserFS ;-)
<derek> btw: w/ ext2 i have seen this a lot
<chillywilly> umm, ext2 bit me hard one time
<derek> poor shutdown == you be fucked
<chillywilly> so I switched to xfs
<chillywilly> I would recommend upgrading to ext3 or something
<mdean> xfs isn't bad, but ext3 is pretty slow in my experience
<chillywilly> xfs is fast
<mdean> limited experience as it is ;-)
<mdean> xfs and reiser are both fast
<chillywilly> dunno about reiser
<derek> right now i would be happy w/ something that works consistently
<derek> as much as a i love debian
<derek> i ahvent had good luck w/ debian
<derek> i still have rh5.x and rh6.2 machines running
<chillywilly> do you ever have good luck?
<chillywilly> ;P
<mdean> derek: if this is to be your wife's machine, you would seriously be better off with Mandark
<derek> i wont touch mandrake
<derek> its debian or death
<mdean> mmmm ok
<derek> basically my big gripe on redhat or mandrake is maintenance
<derek> im seriously hooked on apt
<mdean> and your experience with debian thus far is....
<derek> i have heard of urpmi
<derek> i like debian a lot
<mdean> they have an update tool that works fine
<derek> it just wastes my time often
<chillywilly> that's why you keep detailed admin notes
Action: chillywilly has started this
<chillywilly> I don't have the capacity to remember it all
<derek> i have found its a trade off
Action: mdean DCCs chillywilly a noodle upgrade
<derek> debian problems generally make me 'learn' something about linux
<chillywilly> hehe
<dsmith> derek: Don't confuse Debian with Linux!
<derek> red hat problems generally just waste my time
<chillywilly> journaling file system are so nice
<mdean> chillywilly: preach on!
<derek> i think this machine is just running hot or something 
<derek> its got 'brain damage'
<derek> sigh
<chillywilly> well GNU/Linux mounts ext2 asynchronously which is bad if you crash
<dsmith> chillywilly: Have you heard about softupdates on *bsd filesystems?
<chillywilly> nope
<dsmith> They order the writes so that the fs is *always* in a consistent state.
<chillywilly> interesting
<dsmith> No need for a journal "bandaid" to help fsck.
<chillywilly> *bsd is real unix so I would expect something cool like that ;P
<chillywilly> not that i care much for their license though
<dsmith> When i's finished, there will be no fsck.
<dsmith> Ext2 can be hosed in shuch a way that fsck can't fix it.
<chillywilly> yup
<dsmith> Ohh, but I like Debian packages!
<chillywilly> It has happened to me already
<chillywilly> I learnt my lesson
<chillywilly> /dev/hda2 on / type xfs (rw)
<chillywilly> proc on /proc type proc (rw)
<chillywilly> /dev/hda1 on /boot type ext2 (rw)
<chillywilly> /dev/hda3 on /usr/local type xfs (rw)
<chillywilly> /dev/hda6 on /home type xfs (rw)
<dsmith> Always use sync writes?
<chillywilly> use journaling
<dsmith> AHhh. journals.
<chillywilly> (not ideal, but I don;t loose data
<chillywilly> )
<chillywilly> sync writes are really friggin slow though
<dsmith> softupdates is the speed of async with the safty of sync writes.
<derek> well i give up
Action: dsmith remembers this conversation.
<derek> wasted full day w/ that machine
<derek> sigh
<derek> will never get my laptop upgraded to debian at this rate
<dsmith> deja vu all over again
Action: chillywilly doesn't remember it
<chillywilly> poor masta
<dsmith> derek: So what was/is the problem?
Action: chillywilly kicks debian
<chillywilly> he fscked his ext2 partition?
<chillywilly> no pun intended ;)
<derek> same thing
<derek> i think there is hardware bug as this just isnt 'normal'
<derek> so i rebooted w/ rescue adn did fsck to fix
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> possibly
<derek> then in the middle of boot up it freaked on something]
<derek> and then segfaulted on insmod
<chillywilly> what kinda machine?
<derek> which then hung eth load
<dsmith> Bad memory?
<derek> dsmith, could be have played with it a bit
<derek> i think probably bad mother board
<chillywilly> :(
<derek> but at this point motherboard replacement for k6 300 
<mdean> me too - esp if cdrom works in another box
<derek> is more expensive than a athlon or duron w/ case, motherboard and cpu
<dsmith> Temperature problems?
<derek> dsmith: nah its running cool as cucumber
<derek> dust problems perhaps
Action: chillywilly goes to get a red mountain dew
<derek> it was very dirty
Action: mdean sips his Double Cherry Latte...
<derek> rofl
Action: dsmith hates wierd flakey hardware problems.
<mdean> derek: how about some good news?  20020120 was just released :)
<derek> i hate hardware period
<derek> mdean sigh thats not good news
<chillywilly> hehe
<derek> it means more catch up for me :)
Action: chillywilly was doing embedded systems for a while there
Action: dsmith used to fix ibm mainframes a long long time ago.
<mdean> derek: I had to upgrade the demo from 20010327 - went smooth as silk
<derek> i'd say what has changed
<derek> BUT
<dsmith> chillywilly: Emdedded is cool.
<derek> i suppose the 300 commit mails will tell me ;)
Action: derek is pining for a zaurus
<mdean> mmmmmmmmmm............Zaurus...............
<chillywilly> dsmith: hey man you need to be able to go to work and wire up a cricuit, hook up the oscpoe, burn your code into a chip, and go to town ;)
Action: dsmith is enjoying the rock solid stability of OpenBSD on his laptop.
<dsmith> chillywilly: All I needed was a bit and a scope for debugging.
<dsmith> None of this "debugger" stuff.
<dsmith> Bah!
<dsmith> :)
Action: chillywilly was debugging by pulling pins high ;)
<chillywilly> the software emulator was useful
<chillywilly> but not always
<dsmith> chillywilly: I had a cool static ram eprom simulator.  Didn't have to burn eproms.
<chillywilly> a hardware one?
<chillywilly> yes, we had one of those
<dsmith> Ya
<chillywilly> never used it though
<dsmith> Used make to build my code, dl it into ram, and run my test.
<chillywilly> I usually had a UV package that I could just cook
<chillywilly> to erase it
<dsmith> chillywilly: yep.
Action: dsmith wishes he was doing embedded systems stuff again.
Action: chillywilly does too

<chillywilly> damn him all to hell
<mdean> yeah!  everything should be public!
<chillywilly> well there should be a public method ;)
<chillywilly> so that I can get the tid of the thread
<mdean> at least a protected one
<chillywilly> yea

<dsmith> Was someone in here looking for a web based personal app?
<chillywilly> I was
<chillywilly> my buddy was asking me about getting ppl off of M$ money or something like that
<chillywilly> he's a unix admin for the police and fire stations in this suburb
<dsmith> Did you check out gnuledger?
<chillywilly> he wanted a web based thing
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> I'll have to email him
<chillywilly> where's that at? savannah?
<dsmith> http://webaccountant.sourceforge.net/
<chillywilly> I mentioned GNUe, but we don't have any fully functional apps yet
<chillywilly> well nothing like an accounting replacement yet
<dsmith> At least, it *looks* web based.
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> the comic is funny
<chillywilly> is this part of the gnu project?
<dsmith> Don't think so.
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> then why do they call it gnuledger?
<dsmith> It's not sql-ledger
<dsmith> Not everything gnu is gnu.
<chillywilly> they should get a swift kick in the ass for that
<chillywilly> if you're not gnu then don't use gnu, imho
<chillywilly> it's confusing
<dsmith> yes
Action: chillywilly mails his buddy
<dsmith> It's gpl.
<derek> agree
<derek> people call products
<derek> gnusomething
<derek> because they use the gnu gpl
<derek> they should instead say gplsomething
<derek> i.e. gpl-ledger

<mdean> oooh - they have the slashbox icons too
<chillywilly> 17 - 45
<chillywilly> it was a sad sad thing
<chillywilly> not that I really ecpected them to beat the Rams
<chillywilly> but I didn't expect them to lay an egg
<derek> i was busy fighting debian 
<derek> i walked in w/ 4 min left in fourth
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> pretty sad eh?
<chillywilly> 6 interceptions by Favre
<derek> hoping to get good football like i did in oakland / new england game i watched last 5 min of
<derek> but i saw score was 45 to under 20 and turned off the tv
<chillywilly> game was over at the end of the 3rd
<derek> i thought rams would beat on them a bit
<derek> but was more thinking 
<derek> 35 - 28
<derek> or something
<derek> or 35 - 21 at worst
<derek> but not a 45 - 17 spanking
<chillywilly> Favre sucked
<derek> who won the early game?
<derek> i watched it but i forget
<derek> ravens lost right
<chillywilly> yea
<derek> steelers won like 20 - 10 or something?
<chillywilly> steelers whooped 'em
<derek> mdean: i think that 'delete' user icon should be the 'help' icon :)
<chillywilly> I think 27 - 10
<dsmith> It is a Good Thin when the ravens lose.

dsmith (dsmith@oh-strongsville5a-64.clvhoh.adelphia.net) left irc: Ping timeout: 14400 seconds
<holsch> I mean: it doesn't even display a super-simple form with just a static text
<holsch> if it would, I could try and add other stuff, but so I'm hosed ...
<reinhard> holsch: UIcurses was done by a guy named arno
<reinhard> he had to stop because he got seriosly ill iirc
<reinhard> meanwhile a lot in forms has changed and so the UIcurses.py is no longer compatible with the rest i guess
<reinhard> jamest would be the right man to talk about this
<holsch> reinhard: thanks
<holsch> jamest: you listening?
<holsch> Ups, he's been idle for 34 hours ...
<reinhard> he stays logged in all the time
<reinhard> he usually gets up around 14:00 CET
<holsch> reinhard: I'd love to have even a minimal UIcurses that lacks almost all widgets
<holsch> reinhard: so that I can show a demo to my boss (you know, we are the people
<holsch> reinhard: with the mobile data terminals)
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> i understand
<reinhard> a lot of people in this project want curses
<reinhard> me too btw
<reinhard> :)
<holsch> :-)
<reinhard> but noone had the time till now
<holsch> I tried for 4 hours to understand enought of python and UI<whatever> to get something running
<holsch> but to no avail.
<holsch> Maybe even an totally empty UIskeleton.py would help. In that case I would probably try to
<holsch> create a UInewt.py (I like newt much more than curses)
<holsch> The problem is that python-newt currently only exists for python 1.5 ...
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> and forms _needs_ 2.0 at least
<holsch> derek: if you read this in the log: I can help you with SAP DB (adding tables etc)
<holsch> derek: i may be online at 19:00 met
<holsch> (that's utc-1 i think)
<derek> hi holsch
<derek> unfortunately i dont have sap db here only at work
<derek> as to UIskeleton.py thast a good idea
<derek> if python newt is maintained you could probably encourage them to get a 2.x version

<derek> it is a holiday 'martin luther king jr day'

<derek> mostly only government and banks
<derek> holsch: i generally have a good rapore w/ red hat
<derek> do you know who maintains it?
<derek> i.e. if its out of the rhad labs you have to talk to right people :)
<derek> holsch: have you tried it w/ python2?
<holsch> derek: redhat: my experience is only from reporting bugs to their bugzilla
<holsch> derek: not from rhlabs projects
<holsch> derek: I have only seen the RPMs for RH 7.2 and the *.deb, I did not download the source and
<holsch> derek: made my own RPM/DEB.
<holsch> but the rpms/debs have python1.5 as depency
<derek> they might have 1.5 as a dep
<derek> but what if you over ride that?
<holsch> derek: I'll try this this evening at home. Or I may even download the source from rhlabs.
<derek> i cant even find the home page for it
<derek> basically i would install it

<derek> ah smack
<derek> never mind
Action: derek has kids most of day so i will be useless

<holsch> newt-0.50.33-1.i386.rpm
<holsch> yes, it's called "snack"
<holsch> It's easier to program. However, I don't know if it can be used event-driven (I guess
<holsch> that forms needs some way to be event-driven)

<holsch> Ah, http://packages.debian.org/unstable/interpreters/python-newt.html, talks about python >= 2.1 < 2.2 dep
<derek> holsch: would be cool to offer 3 diff curses modes :)
<derek> as originally we were offering pyncurses (whose maintainer actually worked on gnue for a bit)
jcater (~jason@w202.z065105010.mem-tn.dsl.cnc.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> then we switched to curses that comes w/ python
<holsch> derek: it would be cool to have one WORKING curses modes
<holsch> derek: btw, newt doesn't use curses but slang
<derek> then jcater fudged up the cvs tree and no one wanted to go and work on it anymore, cause you 'cant' keep up with jcater :)
<derek> so to offer newt version would be sweet
<derek> if got all three up and moving
<derek> it woudl REALLY show the power of gnue
<derek> yeah we have 'character based' forms
<derek> which style you want? curses, pyncurses or newt?
<derek> ;)
<holsch> derek: it's really funny. Forms are designed for character based terms (i.e. absolute coordinates,
<holsch> ) but they don't run on them ...
<derek> holsch: to a large degree that was on purpose
<derek> they did
<derek> i promise they did
<derek> in fact if you grab an old release from the website it will work with curses
<holsch> derek: I was a discussion on this, but forms without a layout manager just suffer as soon as
<holsch> derek: it comes to i18n. Some languages use lots of more characters than english ... :-(
<derek> holsch: ?
<holsch> derek: but I'm not the first to recognize this ...  :-)
<derek> i dont think that layout manager is that huge of deal personally
<derek> nice to have sure
<derek> but i think you could have a kick ass product that is fully functional w/o it
<holsch> derek: do you know a foreign language?  If you do, you would understand why it would be helpful.
<holsch> derek: functionally you can have a kick ass product, totally agreed.
<derek> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/inventory_curses.jpg
<holsch> derek: it will just either look ugly or be uncomprehensible
<derek> is an old curses form
<derek> holsch: oui, je parle francais aussi.
<derek> holsch: point is you have the source
<derek> if it looked horrid in your language w/ a little work you could fix it :)
<holsch> holsch: The problem is that many english words are short, but they are long in hungarian or german and
<derek> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/inventory.jpg
<holsch> s/holsch/derek/
<holsch> derek: probably in other languages
<derek> is that same form as (inventory_curses.jpg) only for gtk
<holsch> derek: sometimes it's just some letters e.g. "age" -> "Alter", sometimes it can be lots of characters.
<derek> holsch: easy answer
<derek> speak english :)
<holsch> derek: You imperialist
Action: holsch smiles
<holsch> those packet shufflers in the warehouse usually speak turkish and have enought problems with german ... :-)
<derek> rofl
<derek> how about we comprimise
<derek> the americans start using the metric system
<derek> and everyone else starts using english
<derek> fair?
<holsch> derek: or we all use esperanto as language  :-)
<derek> um, no :)
<derek> jcater: i have a file here called jcater.ogg 
<derek> do i even want to know what it is?
<holsch> It's some music or sound encoded with the Ogg/Vorbis stuff (similar to MP3)
<jcater> lol
<jcater> I remember that
<jcater> "jcater: I choose you"
<jcater> in your best pokemon voice
<holsch> derek: by the way, there are lot's of americanisms in your forms, e.g. "middle name" or "state".
<holsch> Sorry,not in your forms. In the pictures in your directory.
<holsch> derek: hopefully the phone-numbers are free form and no longer ### ### #### ...
<derek> holsch: yes and no
<derek> we havent done anything 'official'
<derek> so stuff you see in my directory is [playing]
<derek> i.e. we have forms in place a quite a few shops
<derek> but they are using the tools to make their applications
<derek> which is fine
<derek> i suspect we will do some of that too
<derek> the 'official' stuff
<derek> will be far more non specific to locale
<derek> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~neilt/sc.html

<derek> i can see it now
<derek> the next upgrade of 'aol' version 10
<derek> it not only upgrades your dialup account
<derek> and your aim version
<derek> but ill be damned if you dont end up running redhat by the time your done :)
<derek> way i see it
<derek> aol's big thing w/ microsoft
<derek> was MSN
<derek> MSN basically came out teeth gnarled saying we will take AOL and Yahoo desktops adn be content kings
<derek> this was further pushed by their deal w/ qwest
<derek> and insult to injury they told AOL f you about being part of the windows desktop
<derek> i see AOL's interest in redhat
<derek> pure retribution
<derek> basically saying fine MS you want to keep us off YOUR desktop
<derek> we will have one of our own and our customers will flock to it like they hvae our services
<derek> i.e. i think AOL has a real model and that is content
<derek> i.e. they have the 'paid community' thing down
<derek> even my 80 year in=laws have and use aol
<derek> and love it
<derek> anyhow thats my take
<derek> netscape i think was the 'start of that'
<chillywilly> is this good for the community?
<derek> i think very soon you will see aol available for linux (supposedly its already done, just not released)
<chillywilly> if AOL buys redhat
<derek> using netscape
<derek> chillywilly: im torn
<derek> i think so
<derek> linux the kernel and most of the apps are GPL
<derek> so there they cant monkey
<derek> if they PLAY nice i see no foul
<derek> example: netscape
<derek> netscape the 'shipping' product doesnt really ahve more 'features' that are usefull in it
<derek> it has more 'content' driven stuff
<derek> so if aol paying netscape employees to make propreitary netscape
<derek> yields me a GPL'ed mozilla
<derek> damn right its good for the community
<chillywilly> what does nutscrape have in it that mozilla doesn't?
<derek> if AOL paying redhat developers nets getting a butt load of new desktop users
<derek> its worth it
<chillywilly> I suppose so
<derek> as long as they are giving something to the community at the same time
<jcater> chillywilly: well, nutscape works on a lot of sites that mozilla doesn't :)
<chillywilly> I don;t see how you can say that they both use gecko
<derek> i.e. i wouldnt use the 'hold some back' model personally as im a truist in many ways to the 'movement'
<derek> but i see the 'hold some back' model from the TOP money pushers as 'a start'
<derek> i.e. AOL or IBM throwing a couple billion dollars a free software world
<derek> is a good thing in many ways
<derek> even if on all points  i dont see eye to eye with them
<derek> basically i think they will start to understand the community and leverage it
<derek> in ways that are beneficial
<derek> i.e. i think all such corporations are out for a buck
<derek> but good corporations know that the buck stops when your consumer is no longer satisified
<derek> right now i think thats what is REALLY killing microsoft
<chillywilly> hopefully they can make that buck without screwing ppl too badly ;P
<derek> they dont understand that the GEENERAL public (their customer) is fed up in many ways worse than us free software freaks
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> 30 million ppl use AOL
<derek> chillywilly: i dont see paying aol 21.95 for dialup service as pure evil
<chillywilly> me either
<derek> in fact if i had to have dialup i would probably think it a pretty good deal
<chillywilly> but their software is prop.
<derek> if i didnt know a ton about cmoputs
<derek> er computers
<derek> chillywilly: my point is their model isnt selling software
<chillywilly> I want the world though ;P
<derek> so say opening the source to AOL client
<chillywilly> exactly
<derek> i dont think is the end of the world to them
<chillywilly> so they should GPL the AOL software ;)
<derek> i.e. in due time i think they probably would see it as valuable
<chillywilly> that's not going to happen though
<derek> especially if they use netscape
<derek> and do most of it in XUL
<derek> chillywilly: i think you would be suprised
<chillywilly> well..it would be a real nice surprise
<derek> to my knowledge aol didnt care that opne source clients were using aim so much
<derek> they changed the protocol to keep MSN from being compatiable
<derek> and honestly i dont blame them
<derek> as MSN has pretty much tried to muscle AOL out of its customers
<chillywilly> does anyone even use MSN?
<jcater> sigh
<derek> the same way it did with netscape
Action: jcater raises hand
<derek> chillywilly: LOTS of people do
<chillywilly> jcater: :(
<derek> all qwest customers just got converted
<chillywilly> ok
<derek> btw: historically aol was kicking msn ass in numbers
<derek> despite msn spending billions on the campaign
<derek> thats why you saw the qwest deal
<derek> INSTANT customer doubling on msn part
<derek> also they cut deal with dell to have msn on top so to speak for dell shipments
<chillywilly> someone was saying that AOL + GNU/Linux + Java and web services could kill .NET
<derek> believe me i dont claim to like AOL
<derek> and odnt want to 'defend' them too much
<derek> frankly the red hat deal scares the crap out of me
<derek> BUT
<derek> i ahve been REALLY impressed with management at red hat
<derek> form bob young on down the line
<chillywilly> heh. I wonder if the developers would even stay if AOL bought redhat
<derek> if there is one free software company that has a chance of making AOL UNDERSTAND the philosphy
<derek> i think its red hat
<derek> as they proved to be profitable in hard times with a free software model
<derek> and they are 'rationale' in approach
<derek> of course only time will tell
<derek> chillywilly: i wonder how you feel about SuSE
<derek> i mean you realize thats a COMMERCIAL linux distro
<derek> where you cant download an .iso
<chillywilly> er?
<derek> i.e. they basically try to hide themselves, very much like caldera
<derek> chillywilly: YaST and other suse programs
<chillywilly> I never used SuSE
<derek> dont 'attach' to the kernel
<derek> so they dont have to worry about licensing conflicts
<chillywilly> don't have much interest in commercial distros...especially rpm based ones
<derek> same way redhat can ship oracle w/ their distro for money
<derek> only iirc suse does this with whole distro
<derek> of course on request you get source for all gpl programs in the distro
<derek> chillywilly: im just pointing out suse is extremely prevalent in europe
<chillywilly> yes, I know
<derek> and has non friendly business practices today
<derek> but you seem to be vigilent on aol/redhat deal
<derek> that hasnt happened :)
<chillywilly> uh?
<derek> and if it did doesnt necessarily mean things at red hat would change :)
<chillywilly> was just talking about it
<derek> i know, good discussion too
<derek> just saying there are already 'evils' w/in the community
<derek> and people generally dont talk about them
<chillywilly> sure, there are plenty of them
<chillywilly> excecpt RMS ;)
<chillywilly> he's wuikc to point out all of them
<chillywilly> quick
<chillywilly> like IBM's billion dollar investment
<chillywilly> in "Linux"
<chillywilly> but anyway, yes I am willing to compromise
<chillywilly> I use a mozilla based even though I don't like then rolling it back into a prop. product
<chillywilly> based browser
<derek> get this
<derek> i built new shelving and moving my books
<derek> wife saw access97 bible and Delphi 4 book
Action: derek wants to preface that we had a toil the other night about windows being removed from our home
<chillywilly> ok
<derek> so she says 'you better get rid of those damn windows books, cause you dont do windows'
<chillywilly> haha
Action: derek tends to agree and so they are getting donated to work
<chillywilly> :)
Action: jcater hears a chorus of angels singing in the background
<jcater> Halleluah!
<chillywilly> lol
<jcater> no more references for derek to compare
<jcater> Designer to Delphi
<chillywilly> :D
<chillywilly> rofl
<derek> jcater: i havent fired up delphi for about a year
<derek> as last two times i had to change code in existing delphi programs
<derek> i just used emacs
<chillywilly> delphi is what object pascal or something with development tools?
<derek> and command line of delphi to compile
<derek> chillywilly: both
<chillywilly> er
<derek> delphi is borland object pascal
<chillywilly> yes
<derek> then they  created the VCL (visual compent library)
<chillywilly> I didn't mean one or the other
<derek> and then wrote delphi the tool/ide in delphi
<chillywilly> "object pascal or something" is referring to is it object pascal
<derek> its actually done really well
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> but pascal?
Action: chillywilly doesn't even know pascal
<derek> i think the ported all to linux as well (kylix)
<derek> and replaced VCL with CLX
<derek> which is a xplatform VCL
<derek> also looked fairly decent
<derek> but im a gnue'r now :)
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> you are just a freak
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> free software freak too
<jcater> dudes
<jcater> Designer is almost useful now
<chillywilly> kewl
<chillywilly> too bad my wxgtk is b0rked :(
<jcater> our Layout Editor is drag-n-drop + toolbar at top
<jcater> plus we have full schema introspection support
<jcater> plus a real syntax-highlighting code editor
<jcater> plus a data source editor
<chillywilly> hen you say "schema" do you mean how the datanase is layed out?
<chillywilly> database
<jcater> yip'
<chillywilly> tables and theor structure
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> well, it's abstracted out
<jcater> so for relational sources, it's "tables" + "fields"
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> but for object sources, it's "objects" + "attributes"
<jcater> or whatever the driver specifies
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> kewl
<jcater> so whenever GEAS works
<jcater> designer will be ready
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> good :)
<chillywilly> does forms handle relational and object sources?
<jcater> it uses GNUe-Common's driver support
<chillywilly> jcater: btw, good job
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> so it supports whatever that supports
<chillywilly> sounds good
<chillywilly> GRUb 0.91 released
<chillywilly> GRUB
<chillywilly> * JFS and XFS support is added.
<chillywilly> kewl :)))
<jcater> eh
<jcater> I use ext3 now
<chillywilly> well I use xfs
<chillywilly> do you use GRUB or lilo?
<jcater> lilo
<chillywilly> oh

<jcater> well, maybe their policies are kicking in 
<jcater> and debian is kicking back
<fitzix> hehe
<derek> um a few things
<derek> its fairly easy to prevent 'deconnection' for 'idle' time
<derek> however some ISP's now put connection limits anyhow idle or not
<fitzix> IRC will do it all by itself
<jcater> ja
<jcater> (as mdean would say)
<derek> but in this case its a small locally owned isp
<derek> and jamest knows owner (they are windows shop)

<fitzix> I used to get onto IRC just to keep a connection live...

<derek> jcater: you willing to go to toledo, OH march 12-13
<ajmitch> when is it?
<derek> if i can get you lined up as a speaker
<jcater> derek: give me a second... need to check my calendar
<fitzix> Well, I'll be speaking at the DotGNU panel at 2:30 on the 30th

<derek> guy spoke w/ us in SF

<ajmitch> fitzix: when?
<derek> instead of targetting developers its targetting users
<derek> guess its in its third year
<derek> they ahve city of toledo behind them (funding it from what i can tell)
<derek> imagine it will be 'small'
<derek> but probably good market for gnue
<derek> i think the guy said he would gladly give us free booth
<derek> and he was VERY interested in having you present gnue wrt your call center
<derek> since its put on by a lug we coudl probably get you free spot to crash
<derek> but dont know about travel
<derek> its only a 'two day' even
<derek> t
<jcater> 12 hour drive
<jcater> certainly doable
<jcater> but that's 4 days in middle of week
<jcater> so basically a week off work
<jcater> are you positive on dates?
<jcater> as that's a Tue + Wed
<jcater> kinda odd days
<derek> march 12-13 2002 is what flier says
<derek> im sure since city is sponsoring
<derek> its a city run civic center complex they are using
<derek> and those are dates probably that werent 'booked'
<derek> i was hoping it was a thurs fri or even fri sat
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> this is right outside of detroit, apparently
<jcater> I wish it wasn't in the middle of the week
<jcater> as this will be 1/2 my vacation for the year
<jcater> unless I catch a flu starting that monday
<jcater> <cough>
<jcater> do you have the times?
<jcater> is it in the evenings?
<jcater> if so, I might can do a 2.5 - 3 day trip
<chillywilly> you might can do dude
<chillywilly> I might can do a trout slappin;
<jcater> eh?
<derek> man i dont want to kill your vacation time man
<chillywilly> you know a might can do a few things if aI per ner git there
<chillywilly> yea man
<chillywilly> man th would suck man
<chillywilly> man
<jcater> unless I make a vacation out of it
<derek> wonder if you were speaker if they would pay your airfare
<jcater> apparently it overlooks Lake Erie
<ajmitch> chillywilly: you can be a little offensive at time in your jokes :)
<jcater> derek: well, that could tip the balance
<chillywilly> just making fun of their silly speech
<chillywilly> I'm not being "offensive"
<chillywilly> I love those guys
<chillywilly> man...
<jcater> good thing it's at the northern-most part of ohio

Action: jcater wonders if they've rescheduled since you got the flyer
<jws> Derek, are you a gnue maintainer?
<chillywilly> derek is da GNUe masta
<jws> I haven't been on irc since 96 so bear with my clumsy fumbling...
<jcater> jws: did you have a question?
<jws> I have been considering rolling my own erp package, then I found out about GNUe. I want to colaborate.
<derek> jws: define collaborate
<derek> if you mean work on gnue we definitely have room
<derek> if you mean you roll own erp package and we interface, we are definitely willing to talk and interested in such a thing
<derek> but it would be of much lower priority for us because of limited resources. :(
<jws> My company switched software due to our previous vendor imploding and the new package is a disappointment.
<jws> I have been banging out the table relations for all the different modules in my head for 6 months. I know how I want it to work pretty much.
<jws> The owner would never go for a totally from-scratch app, but if it had independant development momentum, I could make it happen.
<jws> I figure with the progress you guys are making, in 6 months to a year I could have a package equal to what we have now, just by hanging my table relations on your framework.
chillywilly (danielb@d51.as10.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) left irc: "night"
<derek> the framework is ready and in production right now
<derek> in two tier mode w/ about any imaginable database
<derek> i think if you had table structures ready
<derek> you could have a strong prototype by end of week
<derek> w/ new improvemetns to designer its harder to make your tables than it is the forms that use them
<derek> imho
<jws> well, the data model is always the hardest part to get right...
<jws> We are a small build-to-order manufacturing facility.
<jws> We have bumped up against silly assumptions in the database many,many times. I know what traps not to step into...
<jws> Assuming I have postgres running, is there a way to just load the core tables?
<derek> what do you mean load and which tables?
<derek> your tables or gnue tables?
<jws> the documentation talks about having basic tables, and then industry-specific modification packages which add extra tables and such. how does that work?
<derek> right
<derek> we are workign out the 'templates' constructs currently
<derek> basically all our proposal stuff has been done in n-tier which isnt ready for production
<derek> and there is a program that will load all the tables for that stuff
<derek> but there are not corresponding forms to go with them
<derek> and they wont make sense w/o application server as they are designed to hold object structures
<derek> what we have been doing for clients that need solutions immediately
<derek> is making custom solutions w/ the framework
<derek> in 2 tier mode
<derek> since its client specific stuff we dont have it released 
<jws> Where i'm going with this is rather interesting.
<derek> if you look in gnue/forms/samples/track/
<derek> there is a postgres sample of a contact manager
<derek> that creates the tables and such
<derek> and has the forms bound to them etc etc

<jws> forms interfaces are good for data entry, but not so good at analysis. all erp software is that way.
<jws> I have some ideas i'm developing with my boss that will be 'killer applications' for our niche.
<derek> well a few things there
<derek> we have a complex report server
<jws> the trouble is, we can't really do them with the package we have now.
<derek> it translates data from sql to xml
<derek> and then has transformation engine
<derek> that can convert it from XML to about anything from html, pdf, ps, latex, you name it
<derek> i ahve been speaking with developers at morgan stanley about a linux OLAP engine as well
<derek> which is KILLER for analysis
ajmitch_ (~me@p33-max2.dun.ihug.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Isomer> OLAP?
<derek> Online Analytical Processing
<jws> reports are more of a daily or weekly view of the manufacturing data. we are optimized to the point that we need real-time understanding of the process to be effective.
<jws> olap is something I am starting to appreciate. I allways understood the concept, but I never knew that's what olap was.
<jws> It just hit me one day. SQL was like that, too.
<derek> i use olap like daily
<jws> The manufacturing module is what really has me motivated to this. If i share code with the work you guys have already done, i'm set.
<derek> in govt setting where we have 13,000+ employees and about 2.6 billion in revenue a year
<jws> the olap stuff i'm interested in for sales trends and things of that nature.
<derek> its not manufacturing but there are lot of numbers to look at and OLAP makes it easy for management :)
<derek> i dimension swapping, list loving, cube building olap fool
<jws> We have a situation where we compete with a small number of other vendors for a few customers. we sometimes don't notice when a customer stops buying a particular type of product from us.
<jws> we want to sopt those kind of trends.
<jws> spot, i said, dammit
<derek> jws: you a linux shop currently?
<jws> for infrastructure only, web, dns, firewall. 
<derek> woudl you use linux as a back end?
ajmitch (me@p21-max7.dun.ihug.co.nz) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<jws> I have unprecedented clout with the owner. As long as I could work out a way to do hot backups of postgres, i'll use that.
<derek> um you arent limited to postgres :)
<derek> if you needed SUPER hot backups of DB
<derek> you could always use SAP-DB
<derek> its free (as in GPL) and its good enough for SAP R/3 im sure its good enough for anything a small company needs to do
<derek> plus i know for a fact it does hot backups
<jws> We currently have an app based on pervasive db and they support a linux version as well. I would probably proto on PGres.
<derek> and will allow writing direct to device (for speed) that postgres wont
<derek> if pervausive has free copies of db somewhere and drivers
<derek> email links to jcater
<jws> I'm not religous abot databasing.
<derek> w/in probably a few days you could have working db drivers for gnue
<derek> for pervasive
<derek> jws: i only mention it because you could make forms for your existing application in minutes if you so desired :)
<jcater> well, if pervasive has odbc drivers, you can already connect :)
<jws> I think you can get a 'workstation' edition and sdk free. local connections only. 
<derek> jcater: doh, forgot about that
<derek> but odbc has weak introspection :)
<jws> odbc, ado, jdbc, linux, netware, winnt, multithreaded for SMP...
<jcater> hmm
Action: jcater needs to finish those ado drivers
<jws> our current app(who will remain anonymous) is a cobol-based windows app. you can imagine...
<jws> formerly btreive based, now storing non-relational data in a relational system.
<jws> after spend a week trying to write a report in this crap, I swore to make a better system. vengence demands it.

<lilo--> hi all
Action: jcater peers back at lilo
<lilo--> hi jcater
<jcater> hellow
<jcater> how goes all?
<ajmitch> hey lilo--
Action: lilo-- wondered if someone could give him a quick summary of the development framework and what it compares to in the proprietary world
<lilo--> right now I'm stuck with Windows Powerbuilder and I wanted to know that there was at least something sane out there :)
<jcater> lilo--: direct comparison to Oracle Forms and PowerBuilder
<lilo--> hi ajmitch
<lilo--> jcater: fantastic
<ajmitch> nah, GNUe is better :)
<jcater> actually, the two main coders of GNUe Forms are ex-Oracle Forms users
<lilo--> oic :)
<jcater> who got burnt by oracle
<jcater> :)
<lilo--> what databases do you connect to?  the free ones only?
<jcater> yeah, only better ;)
<jcater> Postgres, MySQL, DB2, Oracle SAP-DB, Interbase, 
<jcater> Informix, any ODBC, 
Action: lilo-- asks because he keeps looking for an opening to squeeze some free software in at work 8)
<lilo--> is the dreaded MS SQL Server somewhere in there? :)
<jcater> err, there's a comma between Oracle and SAP-DB
<jcater> um
<lilo--> well, I have to ask
<jcater> we are working on an ADO driver
<lilo--> so that would do the job?
<jcater> but it's supported via ODBC at the moment
<jcater> yeah
<lilo--> so you can talk to MS SQL Server through ODBC?
<jcater> ADO is supposedly  MS Server's native interface format
<lilo--> oic
<jcater> note the *supposedly*
<lilo--> is there anything really missing in terms of functionality via ODBC?
<jcater> this is based on my research ;)
<jcater> um, yeah
<jcater> we use a public domain ODBC driver
<jcater> which is lacking introspection
<jcater> (schema) support
<lilo--> oic
Action: lilo-- is a bit new to SQL
<jcater> so our Designer can't automatically create forms
<lilo--> oic
<lilo--> hmmm
--- Tue Jan 22 2002
[00:00] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<lilo--> is this the piece that is equivalent to Powerbuilder?
<jcater> well, I haven't actually used PowerBuilder
Action: lilo-- is really new to all this stuff
<jcater> but I'd have to say, yeah
<jcater> Designer is our IDE
<jcater> Forms runs what Designer creates
<lilo--> are the forms the way to lay out access to database tables?
<jcater> forms can provide a window into the database tables
<lilo--> so the Designer does that job
<jcater> i.e., they pull from and save to the tables
<lilo--> it's the equivalent of Powerbuilder datawindows I guess
<jcater> it can be as simple as a visual representation of a table
<jcater> or can be as complex as you'd like
<lilo--> okay, now talk to me about debugging
<jcater> (i.e., pulling from many, many tables in one form)
<lilo--> Powerbuilder is horrible :)
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> well, where we are? or where we will be?
<lilo--> are you guys pretty early?  or are you happy with where you are?
<jcater> as right now, try not to make mistakes :)
Action: lilo-- nods :)
<jcater> j/k
<lilo--> well, I can accept that
<lilo--> Powerbuilder is that way and it will never get better ;)
<jcater> actually, the client software is in production use
<jcater> at my office and a few other guy's offices
<jcater> my IT team is starting to use designer
<lilo--> so I guess I should look at your stuff if I ever get time
<jcater> but it's fairly new
<jcater> now the other tools aren't as "mature"
<jcater> i.e., reporting, app server, etc
<lilo--> oic
<jcater> but we're getting there :)
<lilo--> I expect so
<lilo--> this is really good news
<jcater> and the more early adopters we have, the sooner we'll get there
<jcater> <hint>
<lilo--> I've been thinking since I started this job that there was a real opportunity for community people in the space
<lilo--> well, I wish I could be helpful there
<jcater> yeah, check us out...
<jcater> if you have any questions, you know where we are :)
<lilo--> but I spend most of my time doing the following:  trying to get quality time with my wife and 3 year old, suffering bouts of depression from working with Windows
<lilo--> and my left-over time is spent doing Powerbuilder coding :)
<lilo--> and actually throw OPN itself into that first list 8)
<jcater> ah, 3 year old
<jcater> I can relate
<lilo--> hehe
<jcater> "quality time" ???\
<jcater> wassat?
<lilo--> I'm trying to figure out if I spend more time working on OPN or having depressive episodes from coding with Windows :)
<jcater> j/k
<lilo--> my actual pay job falls in last 8)
<jcater> lol
<lilo--> it's really good to know you guys are working on this
<lilo--> I'll kick my boss' butt about it at first opportunity
<jcater> cool
<lilo--> I can sort of do that, he's my older brother 8)
<jcater> rofl
<lilo--> not that it does me any good
<lilo--> but sooner or later maybe I can nudge him in the right direction
<jcater> just kick harder
<jcater> or more strategically, perhaps?
<lilo--> well, I'm at this job because we ran out of money 1200 miles away :)
<lilo--> so my priority right now is not being homeless :)
<jcater> that's a good priority to have
Action: lilo-- nods
<lilo--> you guys doing this all on your own time, or is somebody paying hourly?
<jcater> mostly on our own time
<lilo--> good for you
<jcater> a few of us who use this at our jobs
<lilo--> ah, that's neat too :)
<jcater> can squeeze in some "on-the-hour" work
<jcater> ;)
<lilo--> these days VC worries me
<lilo--> for obvious reasons
Action: lilo-- thinks we all should have known better 8)
<jcater> yeah
<lilo--> it's not even a business issue
<lilo--> companies with VC don't do business very well 8)
<jcater> VC + free software aren't a good mix
<lilo--> say, maybe that *is* a business issue :)
<jcater> as VC expects a quick, high return
<lilo--> jcater: that's only because VC and flexibility, or VC and business return, aren't a good mix 8)
<jcater> but, we haven't really had to face that issue
<jcater> ;)
<lilo--> jcater: from what I saw, the problem was the reverse....take VC and you ended up swimming in other people's money, but no profit
<jcater> how true
<lilo--> it's hard to make a profit when you have too much of other people's money
<lilo--> the thing about the boom is, we didn't fail because our values aren't real world enough
<lilo--> we failed because VC values aren't :)
<lilo--> anyway, enough of me ranting :)
<lilo--> I'm glad to hear you guys are in business, and I don't think I ever officially welcomed you here
<lilo--> welcome to Open Projects Net :)
<jcater> lol
<jcater> thanks
<lilo--> and I'll try to get something going....what kind of resource do I need to demonstrate the software, you think?  big machine, medium sized?
<jcater> not too much at all, really
<lilo--> that's what I wanted to hear :)
<lilo--> I love free software :)
<jcater> I have 30 users all running on a dual 400 Mhz PII
<lilo--> sounds good
<jcater> gotta love it :)
Action: lilo-- nods :)
<lilo--> btw, if you need anything, let us know
<jcater> btw, that's full X-Sessions, KOffice, etc
<jcater> not just our software :)
<lilo--> I'm just really glad to see you here

<dneighbo> are you only interested in geas?
<dneighbo> as currently geas is under going some restructing
<rridley> What I want is the accounting stuff, but it looks like thats still in proposal?
<dneighbo> yes still in proposal
<dneighbo> the framework is highly usable in 2 tier mode (w/o application server)
<rridley> hmmm, what works and what can I mess with?
<Yurik> dneighbo probably I can find ra3vat e-mail

<rridley> of course, that greek to me
<dneighbo> rridley grab
<dneighbo> forms, common and designer

<dneighbo> FunkyTrix its highly usable
<dneighbo> in 2 tier mode
<dsmith> dneighbo: What do you guys mean by "2 tier" mode?
<dneighbo> not using the application server
<dneighbo> i.e. forms talks directly to the database server
<dneighbo> instead of talking to application server and application server talks to database server
<FunkyTrix> ah cool
<FunkyTrix> I wanted to do some time tracking assigning time slots to tasks, tasks to jobs, jobs to clients ...
<dneighbo> if you need help setting things up let us know and someone will walk you through it
<FunkyTrix> is it feasable?
<dneighbo> yes VERY
<dneighbo> in fact we are merging DCL into our framework which does similar things out of the box
<dneighbo> you might want to look at using DCL up front and then playing active role in the migration to GNUe Framework
<FunkyTrix> I'm very happy it uses python. python is just awesome, i'm using it for zope
<dneighbo> http://dcl.sourceforge.net
<dneighbo> of course if you wanted soemthing custom just use the frame work natively
<dneighbo> with new improvements to designer it will take you longer to write the SQL create scripts
<dneighbo> than it will to make the application :)
<FunkyTrix> you're developing it, right?
<FunkyTrix> oh, dcl looks great too
Action: Yurik is back
<dneighbo> jcater is our primary coder
<dneighbo> i am workign on porting dcl

<dneighbo> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/service_requests.jpg
<FunkyTrix> oh, the "goats" part of the addres scared me :-)
<FunkyTrix> dneighbo: would be possible to create bills from DCL (producing DocBook or LaTeX sources maybe, and then PDF)?
<FunkyTrix> I use PHP a lot, if the internals aren't crazy I could do it ...
<dneighbo> yes
<dneighbo> well kind of
<dneighbo> that is part of what we are doing and prompted the merge :)
<dneighbo> we have a report server that is xml based
<dneighbo> and w/ style sheets can do anything :)
<FunkyTrix> cool DocBook uses xml
<dneighbo> currently if you made an 'invoice' template in word, kword or staroffice, abiword etc
<dneighbo> you could then do a 'merge' to create your invoices
<dneighbo> with MINIMAL work
<dneighbo> if we hammer our 'schema' for reports
<dneighbo> i can write you a stylesheet for xslt
<FunkyTrix> xstl?
<dneighbo> that would convert to html or docbook if you so desired
<dneighbo> xstl = xml stylesheet transformation language (iirc)

<sklein> derek: you there?
<chillywilly> hey sklein
<sklein> hi chillywilly
<sklein> what's happening at the LinuxWorld?
<sklein> NY
<chillywilly> jcater might be there
<chillywilly> that's all we got going
<chillywilly> afaik
<sklein> will there be a BOF?
<sklein> I will be in NY that week, but I have lots of meetings and only might have a few hours Thursday to go to LW before I catch my train back to DC
<chillywilly> ok
<sklein> I will be at the IEEE Power Engineering Society meeting there
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> engineers rule
<chillywilly> :)
Action: chillywilly is member of IEEE
<sklein> from your keyboard to heaven directly
<chillywilly> you ever hear of this school: http://www.msoe.edu
<sklein> I'm working on a paper on the role of engineers i influencing public policy
<sklein> msoe?  I don't recognize it
<chillywilly> cool
<sklein> i=in
<chillywilly> Milwaukee School of Engineering
<sklein> can you spell it out?
<chillywilly> just did ;)
<sklein> is it part of a university?
<chillywilly> it is a university
<chillywilly> specializing in engineering
Action: chillywilly is an MSOE alumn
<sklein> don't recognize it off the top of my head
Action: chillywilly has a BS in Computer Engineering
<sklein> hardware and software?
<chillywilly> yes
<sklein> good area
<chillywilly> CS and EE courses
Action: ajmitch is doing a CS major, with electronics on the side
<sklein> good preparation
<chillywilly> http://www.msoe.edu/eecs/ce/cetrk29.htm
<sklein> any power systems work?
<chillywilly> nah
<chillywilly> that's for real EEs ;)
<chillywilly> EE-201  Linear Networks: Steady State Analysis
<chillywilly> EE-290  Combinational and Sequential Logic  
<chillywilly> EE-202  Linear Networks: Transient Analysis
<sklein> I've done a lot of domain work (radar, air traffic control, military,etc.  but electric power is one of the largest users of computers around
<chillywilly> EE-210  Electronic Devices and Computer Interfacing
<chillywilly> EE-370  Control Systems
<chillywilly> EE-393  VLSI Design
<chillywilly> that's all the EE courses
<sklein> do you know what SCADA is?
<chillywilly> umm, nope
<sklein> Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition -- the remote control of transmission and distribution substations
<chillywilly> power systems thing?
<sklein> I'm speaking at a session on information security protection of electric power SCADA systems
<chillywilly> I don't know power systems, I only know computer systems ;P
<sklein> you would be amazed how much of running a power system takes place in computer systems
<sklein> all the way down to embedded processing in substation equipment
<chillywilly> sure
<sklein> a lot of it is changing under deregulation/restructuring, but that just increases the role of computing
<chillywilly> computers are everywhere
<sklein> even in your toaster and breadmaker
Action: chillywilly did embedded systems development for a while
<chillywilly> best of both worlds
<chillywilly> get to play with hardware and software
<sklein> I attended a 3-day meeting related to UCITA.  One of the opponents (on the same side as me) talked about computers in breadmakers
<sklein> Internet connected, no less
Action: dsmith wishes he was doing embeded systems again
Action: dsmith sighs
Action: chillywilly does too
<chillywilly> dsmith: find a different job ;)
<dsmith> I'm looking.
<chillywilly> sklein: cool
<dsmith> Gonna put in a resume at hitachimed.  mri stuff, dsp's.
<chillywilly> medical stuff?
<dsmith> ya
<chillywilly> magnetic resonance imaging?
<sklein> I suppose I need to talk to jcater about LW-NY
<dsmith> yep
<chillywilly> sklein: probably
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> seeing as he will be the only one there
<sklein> derek had a note on the web page about wanting volunteers
Action: chillywilly had a second intervew with GE Medical Systems
<chillywilly> they turned me down
<sklein> is he planning to be there the whole 3 days?
<dsmith> :(
<dsmith> Or maybe :) ?
<chillywilly> dunno
<chillywilly> all I know is that I wish I could go
<chillywilly> maybe I will
<chillywilly> hmmm
<sklein> OK, maybe I'll email him.  I emailed derek, but haven't heard from him
<chillywilly> it's a bit late though
<sklein> you mean late in the day or late close to the meeting?
<sklein> I sent derek the email yesterday
<chillywilly> late to get things set up for LW
<chillywilly> to go there and run the booth
<chillywilly> maybe I am wrong
<sklein> I can't spend much time there.  I might be able to attend an evening BOF.  I only have the few hours Thursday
Action: chillywilly doesn't really know anyway
<sklein> OK, I'll keep trying to get to someone who knows more.  Maybe tomorrow
<chillywilly> if it ever comes back to chicago I'll be there for sure
<chillywilly> post to the list
<chillywilly> ;)
<sklein> PES is in Chicago next summer
<chillywilly> PES?
<sklein> Power Engineering Society
<chillywilly> chicago is only a 2 hour drive
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> why would ai want to go to that?
<chillywilly> s/ai/I
<chillywilly> no offense, but power systems ain't my thing
<sklein> no reason.  just commenting
<chillywilly> try gnue@gnu.org
<chillywilly> post there
<chillywilly> someone will respon I am sure
<sklein> they weren't mine at the start, but they grew on me over the years

<sklein> I know about the lists
<chillywilly> that one and gnue-dev@gnu.org and gnue-announce@gnu.org
<sklein> I just haven't had much time to be active on them lately
<sklein> I'm on gnue-discuss and gnue-dev
<chillywilly> ok
<sklein> chillywilly:  good talking to you, but it's getting close to my bedtime
