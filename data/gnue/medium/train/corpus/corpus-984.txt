<holsch> Question: is anybody caring for the UIcurses.py file?  It's in a sad state ...
dsmith (dsmith@oh-strongsville5a-64.clvhoh.adelphia.net) left irc: Ping timeout: 14400 seconds
<holsch> I mean: it doesn't even display a super-simple form with just a static text
<holsch> if it would, I could try and add other stuff, but so I'm hosed ...
<reinhard> holsch: UIcurses was done by a guy named arno
<reinhard> he had to stop because he got seriosly ill iirc
<reinhard> meanwhile a lot in forms has changed and so the UIcurses.py is no longer compatible with the rest i guess
<reinhard> jamest would be the right man to talk about this
<holsch> reinhard: thanks
<holsch> jamest: you listening?
<holsch> Ups, he's been idle for 34 hours ...
<reinhard> he stays logged in all the time
<reinhard> he usually gets up around 14:00 CET
<holsch> reinhard: I'd love to have even a minimal UIcurses that lacks almost all widgets
<holsch> reinhard: so that I can show a demo to my boss (you know, we are the people
<holsch> reinhard: with the mobile data terminals)
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> i understand
<reinhard> a lot of people in this project want curses
<reinhard> me too btw
<reinhard> :)
<holsch> :-)
<reinhard> but noone had the time till now
<holsch> I tried for 4 hours to understand enought of python and UI<whatever> to get something running
<holsch> but to no avail.
<holsch> Maybe even an totally empty UIskeleton.py would help. In that case I would probably try to
<holsch> create a UInewt.py (I like newt much more than curses)
<holsch> The problem is that python-newt currently only exists for python 1.5 ...
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> and forms _needs_ 2.0 at least
<holsch> derek: if you read this in the log: I can help you with SAP DB (adding tables etc)
<holsch> derek: i may be online at 19:00 met
<holsch> (that's utc-1 i think)
<derek> hi holsch
<derek> unfortunately i dont have sap db here only at work
<derek> as to UIskeleton.py thast a good idea
<derek> if python newt is maintained you could probably encourage them to get a 2.x version
Yurik (~yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) joined #gnuenterprise.
<reinhard> derek: is today a public holiday in the u.s.?
<holsch> derek: python newt is from Red Hat. I had usually bad experience with them, e.g. it was
<holsch> hard to get something out of them after filing a bug report to bigzilla.

<derek> it is a holiday 'martin luther king jr day'
<derek> but very few 'businesses' celebrate it
<derek> mostly only government and banks
<derek> holsch: i generally have a good rapore w/ red hat
<derek> do you know who maintains it?
<derek> i.e. if its out of the rhad labs you have to talk to right people :)
<derek> holsch: have you tried it w/ python2?
<holsch> derek: redhat: my experience is only from reporting bugs to their bugzilla
<holsch> derek: not from rhlabs projects
<holsch> derek: I have only seen the RPMs for RH 7.2 and the *.deb, I did not download the source and
<holsch> derek: made my own RPM/DEB.
<holsch> but the rpms/debs have python1.5 as depency
<derek> they might have 1.5 as a dep
<derek> but what if you over ride that?
<holsch> derek: I'll try this this evening at home. Or I may even download the source from rhlabs.
<derek> i cant even find the home page for it
<derek> basically i would install it
<derek> regardless of dependency
<derek> ah smack
<derek> never mind
Action: derek has kids most of day so i will be useless
Action: derek needs to pickup new mb
<holsch> derek: Just search for the "newt" homepage. Thy python stuff in in the normal newt-rpm e.g. in
<holsch> newt-0.50.33-1.i386.rpm
<holsch> yes, it's called "snack"
<holsch> It's easier to program. However, I don't know if it can be used event-driven (I guess
<holsch> that forms needs some way to be event-driven)
<derek> um forms has its own events system

<holsch> Ah, http://packages.debian.org/unstable/interpreters/python-newt.html, talks about python >= 2.1 < 2.2 dep
<derek> holsch: would be cool to offer 3 diff curses modes :)
<derek> as originally we were offering pyncurses (whose maintainer actually worked on gnue for a bit)
jcater (~jason@w202.z065105010.mem-tn.dsl.cnc.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> then we switched to curses that comes w/ python
<holsch> derek: it would be cool to have one WORKING curses modes
<holsch> derek: btw, newt doesn't use curses but slang
<derek> then jcater fudged up the cvs tree and no one wanted to go and work on it anymore, cause you 'cant' keep up with jcater :)
<derek> so to offer newt version would be sweet
<derek> if got all three up and moving
<derek> it woudl REALLY show the power of gnue
<derek> yeah we have 'character based' forms
<derek> which style you want? curses, pyncurses or newt?
<derek> ;)
<holsch> derek: it's really funny. Forms are designed for character based terms (i.e. absolute coordinates,
<holsch> ) but they don't run on them ...
<derek> holsch: to a large degree that was on purpose
<derek> they did
<derek> i promise they did
<derek> in fact if you grab an old release from the website it will work with curses
<holsch> derek: I was a discussion on this, but forms without a layout manager just suffer as soon as
<holsch> derek: it comes to i18n. Some languages use lots of more characters than english ... :-(
<derek> holsch: ?
<holsch> derek: but I'm not the first to recognize this ...  :-)
<derek> i dont think that layout manager is that huge of deal personally
<derek> nice to have sure
<derek> but i think you could have a kick ass product that is fully functional w/o it
<holsch> derek: do you know a foreign language?  If you do, you would understand why it would be helpful.
<holsch> derek: functionally you can have a kick ass product, totally agreed.
<derek> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/inventory_curses.jpg
<holsch> derek: it will just either look ugly or be uncomprehensible
<derek> is an old curses form
<derek> holsch: oui, je parle francais aussi.
<derek> holsch: point is you have the source
<derek> if it looked horrid in your language w/ a little work you could fix it :)
<holsch> holsch: The problem is that many english words are short, but they are long in hungarian or german and
<derek> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/inventory.jpg
<holsch> s/holsch/derek/
<holsch> derek: probably in other languages
<derek> is that same form as (inventory_curses.jpg) only for gtk
<holsch> derek: sometimes it's just some letters e.g. "age" -> "Alter", sometimes it can be lots of characters.
<derek> holsch: easy answer
<derek> speak english :)
<holsch> derek: You imperialist
Action: holsch smiles
<holsch> those packet shufflers in the warehouse usually speak turkish and have enought problems with german ... :-)
<derek> rofl
<derek> how about we comprimise
<derek> the americans start using the metric system
<derek> and everyone else starts using english
<derek> fair?
<holsch> derek: or we all use esperanto as language  :-)
<derek> um, no :)
<derek> jcater: i have a file here called jcater.ogg 
<derek> do i even want to know what it is?
<holsch> It's some music or sound encoded with the Ogg/Vorbis stuff (similar to MP3)
<jcater> lol
<jcater> I remember that
<jcater> "jcater: I choose you"
<jcater> in your best pokemon voice
<holsch> derek: by the way, there are lot's of americanisms in your forms, e.g. "middle name" or "state".
<holsch> Sorry,not in your forms. In the pictures in your directory.
<holsch> derek: hopefully the phone-numbers are free form and no longer ### ### #### ...
<derek> holsch: yes and no
<derek> we havent done anything 'official'
<derek> so stuff you see in my directory is [playing]
<derek> i.e. we have forms in place a quite a few shops
<derek> but they are using the tools to make their applications
<derek> which is fine
<derek> i suspect we will do some of that too
<derek> the 'official' stuff
<derek> will be far more non specific to locale
<derek> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~neilt/sc.html
<derek> should be the specs for that stuff

<chillywilly> how'd you make it crash?
<jcater> dunno
<chillywilly> If this rumor is even remotely true it'll make Apple's efforts to put Unix on the desk look like a fart in a whirlwind.
<chillywilly> if this rumor is true why don't they just have some sort of relationship going with redhat, why do they need to buy them out?
<chillywilly> a nice long contract
<chillywilly> or something
<derek> i can see it now
<derek> the next upgrade of 'aol' version 10
<derek> it not only upgrades your dialup account
<derek> and your aim version
<derek> but ill be damned if you dont end up running redhat by the time your done :)
<derek> way i see it
<derek> aol's big thing w/ microsoft
<derek> was MSN
<derek> MSN basically came out teeth gnarled saying we will take AOL and Yahoo desktops adn be content kings
<derek> this was further pushed by their deal w/ qwest
<derek> and insult to injury they told AOL f you about being part of the windows desktop
<derek> i see AOL's interest in redhat
<derek> pure retribution
<derek> basically saying fine MS you want to keep us off YOUR desktop
<derek> we will have one of our own and our customers will flock to it like they hvae our services
<derek> i.e. i think AOL has a real model and that is content
<derek> i.e. they have the 'paid community' thing down
<derek> even my 80 year in=laws have and use aol
<derek> and love it
<derek> anyhow thats my take
<derek> netscape i think was the 'start of that'
<chillywilly> is this good for the community?
<derek> i think very soon you will see aol available for linux (supposedly its already done, just not released)
<chillywilly> if AOL buys redhat
<derek> using netscape
<derek> chillywilly: im torn
<derek> i think so
<derek> linux the kernel and most of the apps are GPL
<derek> so there they cant monkey
<derek> if they PLAY nice i see no foul
<derek> example: netscape
<derek> netscape the 'shipping' product doesnt really ahve more 'features' that are usefull in it
<derek> it has more 'content' driven stuff
<derek> so if aol paying netscape employees to make propreitary netscape
<derek> yields me a GPL'ed mozilla
<derek> damn right its good for the community
<chillywilly> what does nutscrape have in it that mozilla doesn't?
<derek> if AOL paying redhat developers nets getting a butt load of new desktop users
<derek> its worth it
<chillywilly> I suppose so
<derek> as long as they are giving something to the community at the same time
<jcater> chillywilly: well, nutscape works on a lot of sites that mozilla doesn't :)
<chillywilly> I don;t see how you can say that they both use gecko
<derek> i.e. i wouldnt use the 'hold some back' model personally as im a truist in many ways to the 'movement'
<derek> but i see the 'hold some back' model from the TOP money pushers as 'a start'
<derek> i.e. AOL or IBM throwing a couple billion dollars a free software world
<derek> is a good thing in many ways
<derek> even if on all points  i dont see eye to eye with them
<derek> basically i think they will start to understand the community and leverage it
<derek> in ways that are beneficial
<derek> i.e. i think all such corporations are out for a buck
<derek> but good corporations know that the buck stops when your consumer is no longer satisified
<derek> right now i think thats what is REALLY killing microsoft
<chillywilly> hopefully they can make that buck without screwing ppl too badly ;P
<derek> they dont understand that the GEENERAL public (their customer) is fed up in many ways worse than us free software freaks
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> 30 million ppl use AOL
<derek> chillywilly: i dont see paying aol 21.95 for dialup service as pure evil
<chillywilly> me either
<derek> in fact if i had to have dialup i would probably think it a pretty good deal
<chillywilly> but their software is prop.
<derek> if i didnt know a ton about cmoputs
<derek> er computers
<derek> chillywilly: my point is their model isnt selling software
<chillywilly> I want the world though ;P
<derek> so say opening the source to AOL client
<chillywilly> exactly
<derek> i dont think is the end of the world to them
<chillywilly> so they should GPL the AOL software ;)
<derek> i.e. in due time i think they probably would see it as valuable
<chillywilly> that's not going to happen though
<derek> especially if they use netscape
<derek> and do most of it in XUL
<derek> chillywilly: i think you would be suprised
<chillywilly> well..it would be a real nice surprise
<derek> to my knowledge aol didnt care that opne source clients were using aim so much
<derek> they changed the protocol to keep MSN from being compatiable
<derek> and honestly i dont blame them
<derek> as MSN has pretty much tried to muscle AOL out of its customers
<chillywilly> does anyone even use MSN?
<jcater> sigh
<derek> the same way it did with netscape
Action: jcater raises hand
<derek> chillywilly: LOTS of people do
<chillywilly> jcater: :(
<derek> all qwest customers just got converted
<chillywilly> ok
<derek> btw: historically aol was kicking msn ass in numbers
<derek> despite msn spending billions on the campaign
<derek> thats why you saw the qwest deal
<derek> INSTANT customer doubling on msn part
<derek> also they cut deal with dell to have msn on top so to speak for dell shipments
<chillywilly> someone was saying that AOL + GNU/Linux + Java and web services could kill .NET
<derek> believe me i dont claim to like AOL
<derek> and odnt want to 'defend' them too much
<derek> frankly the red hat deal scares the crap out of me
<derek> BUT
<derek> i ahve been REALLY impressed with management at red hat
<derek> form bob young on down the line
<chillywilly> heh. I wonder if the developers would even stay if AOL bought redhat
<derek> if there is one free software company that has a chance of making AOL UNDERSTAND the philosphy
<derek> i think its red hat
<derek> as they proved to be profitable in hard times with a free software model
<derek> and they are 'rationale' in approach
<derek> of course only time will tell
<derek> chillywilly: i wonder how you feel about SuSE
<derek> i mean you realize thats a COMMERCIAL linux distro
<derek> where you cant download an .iso
<chillywilly> er?
<derek> i.e. they basically try to hide themselves, very much like caldera
<derek> chillywilly: YaST and other suse programs
<chillywilly> I never used SuSE
<derek> dont 'attach' to the kernel
<derek> so they dont have to worry about licensing conflicts
<chillywilly> don't have much interest in commercial distros...especially rpm based ones
<derek> same way redhat can ship oracle w/ their distro for money
<derek> only iirc suse does this with whole distro
<derek> of course on request you get source for all gpl programs in the distro
<derek> chillywilly: im just pointing out suse is extremely prevalent in europe
<chillywilly> yes, I know
<derek> and has non friendly business practices today
<derek> but you seem to be vigilent on aol/redhat deal
<derek> that hasnt happened :)
<chillywilly> uh?
<derek> and if it did doesnt necessarily mean things at red hat would change :)
<chillywilly> was just talking about it
<derek> i know, good discussion too
<derek> just saying there are already 'evils' w/in the community
<derek> and people generally dont talk about them
<chillywilly> sure, there are plenty of them
<chillywilly> excecpt RMS ;)
<chillywilly> he's wuikc to point out all of them
<chillywilly> quick
<chillywilly> like IBM's billion dollar investment
<chillywilly> in "Linux"
<chillywilly> but anyway, yes I am willing to compromise
<chillywilly> I use a mozilla based even though I don't like then rolling it back into a prop. product
<chillywilly> based browser
<derek> get this
<derek> i built new shelving and moving my books
<derek> wife saw access97 bible and Delphi 4 book
Action: derek wants to preface that we had a toil the other night about windows being removed from our home
<chillywilly> ok
<derek> so she says 'you better get rid of those damn windows books, cause you dont do windows'
<chillywilly> haha
Action: derek tends to agree and so they are getting donated to work
<chillywilly> :)
Action: jcater hears a chorus of angels singing in the background

<jcater> no more references for derek to compare
<jcater> Designer to Delphi
<chillywilly> :D
<chillywilly> rofl
<derek> jcater: i havent fired up delphi for about a year
<derek> as last two times i had to change code in existing delphi programs
<derek> i just used emacs
<chillywilly> delphi is what object pascal or something with development tools?
<derek> and command line of delphi to compile
<derek> chillywilly: both
<chillywilly> er
<derek> delphi is borland object pascal
<chillywilly> yes
<derek> then they  created the VCL (visual compent library)
<chillywilly> I didn't mean one or the other
<derek> and then wrote delphi the tool/ide in delphi
<chillywilly> "object pascal or something" is referring to is it object pascal
<derek> its actually done really well
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> but pascal?
Action: chillywilly doesn't even know pascal
<derek> i think the ported all to linux as well (kylix)
<derek> and replaced VCL with CLX
<derek> which is a xplatform VCL
<derek> also looked fairly decent
<derek> but im a gnue'r now :)
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> you are just a freak
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> free software freak too
<jcater> dudes
<jcater> Designer is almost useful now
<chillywilly> kewl
<chillywilly> too bad my wxgtk is b0rked :(
<jcater> our Layout Editor is drag-n-drop + toolbar at top
<jcater> plus we have full schema introspection support
<jcater> plus a real syntax-highlighting code editor
<jcater> plus a data source editor
<chillywilly> hen you say "schema" do you mean how the datanase is layed out?
<chillywilly> database
<jcater> yip'
<chillywilly> tables and theor structure
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> well, it's abstracted out
<jcater> so for relational sources, it's "tables" + "fields"
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> but for object sources, it's "objects" + "attributes"
<jcater> or whatever the driver specifies
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> kewl
<jcater> so whenever GEAS works
<jcater> designer will be ready
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> good :)
<chillywilly> does forms handle relational and object sources?
<jcater> it uses GNUe-Common's driver support
<chillywilly> jcater: btw, good job
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> so it supports whatever that supports
<chillywilly> sounds good
<chillywilly> GRUb 0.91 released
<chillywilly> GRUB
<chillywilly> * JFS and XFS support is added.

<derek> um a few things
<derek> its fairly easy to prevent 'deconnection' for 'idle' time
<derek> however some ISP's now put connection limits anyhow idle or not
<fitzix> IRC will do it all by itself
<jcater> ja
<jcater> (as mdean would say)

<derek> jcater: you willing to go to toledo, OH march 12-13
<ajmitch> when is it?
<derek> if i can get you lined up as a speaker
<jcater> derek: give me a second... need to check my calendar
<fitzix> Well, I'll be speaking at the DotGNU panel at 2:30 on the 30th

Action: jcater runs to mapsonus.com to check mileage

<derek> guy spoke w/ us in SF
<derek> its an 'end user' linux show
<ajmitch> fitzix: when?
<derek> instead of targetting developers its targetting users
<derek> guess its in its third year
<derek> they ahve city of toledo behind them (funding it from what i can tell)
<derek> imagine it will be 'small'
<derek> but probably good market for gnue
<derek> i think the guy said he would gladly give us free booth
<derek> and he was VERY interested in having you present gnue wrt your call center
<derek> since its put on by a lug we coudl probably get you free spot to crash
<derek> but dont know about travel
<derek> its only a 'two day' even
<derek> t
<jcater> 12 hour drive
<jcater> certainly doable
<jcater> but that's 4 days in middle of week
<jcater> so basically a week off work
<jcater> are you positive on dates?
<jcater> as that's a Tue + Wed
<jcater> kinda odd days
<derek> march 12-13 2002 is what flier says
<derek> im sure since city is sponsoring
<derek> its a city run civic center complex they are using
<derek> and those are dates probably that werent 'booked'
<derek> i was hoping it was a thurs fri or even fri sat
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> this is right outside of detroit, apparently
<jcater> I wish it wasn't in the middle of the week
<jcater> as this will be 1/2 my vacation for the year
<jcater> unless I catch a flu starting that monday
<jcater> <cough>
<jcater> do you have the times?
<jcater> is it in the evenings?
<jcater> if so, I might can do a 2.5 - 3 day trip
<chillywilly> you might can do dude
<chillywilly> I might can do a trout slappin;
<jcater> eh?
<derek> man i dont want to kill your vacation time man
<chillywilly> you know a might can do a few things if aI per ner git there
<chillywilly> yea man
<chillywilly> man th would suck man
<chillywilly> man
<jcater> unless I make a vacation out of it
<derek> wonder if you were speaker if they would pay your airfare
<jcater> apparently it overlooks Lake Erie
<ajmitch> chillywilly: you can be a little offensive at time in your jokes :)
<jcater> derek: well, that could tip the balance
<chillywilly> just making fun of their silly speech
<chillywilly> I'm not being "offensive"
<chillywilly> I love those guys
<chillywilly> man...
<jcater> good thing it's at the northern-most part of ohio
<jcater> because Ohio in general is a boring state
<jcater> (no offense, any Ohio-ans)\
<jcater> looks like its a straight shot to Chicago
<jcater> now, dude, If I could get tickets to Emeril Live in Chicago, that'd be worth the trip

<jws> Derek, are you a gnue maintainer?
<chillywilly> derek is da GNUe masta
<jws> I haven't been on irc since 96 so bear with my clumsy fumbling...
<jcater> jws: did you have a question?
<jws> I have been considering rolling my own erp package, then I found out about GNUe. I want to colaborate.
<derek> jws: define collaborate
<derek> if you mean work on gnue we definitely have room
<derek> if you mean you roll own erp package and we interface, we are definitely willing to talk and interested in such a thing
<derek> but it would be of much lower priority for us because of limited resources. :(
<jws> My company switched software due to our previous vendor imploding and the new package is a disappointment.
<jws> I have been banging out the table relations for all the different modules in my head for 6 months. I know how I want it to work pretty much.
<jws> The owner would never go for a totally from-scratch app, but if it had independant development momentum, I could make it happen.
<jws> I figure with the progress you guys are making, in 6 months to a year I could have a package equal to what we have now, just by hanging my table relations on your framework.
chillywilly (danielb@d51.as10.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) left irc: "night"
<derek> the framework is ready and in production right now
<derek> in two tier mode w/ about any imaginable database
<derek> i think if you had table structures ready
<derek> you could have a strong prototype by end of week
<derek> w/ new improvemetns to designer its harder to make your tables than it is the forms that use them
<derek> imho
<jws> well, the data model is always the hardest part to get right...
<jws> We are a small build-to-order manufacturing facility.
<jws> We have bumped up against silly assumptions in the database many,many times. I know what traps not to step into...
<jws> Assuming I have postgres running, is there a way to just load the core tables?
<derek> what do you mean load and which tables?
<derek> your tables or gnue tables?
<jws> the documentation talks about having basic tables, and then industry-specific modification packages which add extra tables and such. how does that work?
<derek> right
<derek> we are workign out the 'templates' constructs currently
<derek> basically all our proposal stuff has been done in n-tier which isnt ready for production
<derek> and there is a program that will load all the tables for that stuff
<derek> but there are not corresponding forms to go with them
<derek> and they wont make sense w/o application server as they are designed to hold object structures
<derek> what we have been doing for clients that need solutions immediately
<derek> is making custom solutions w/ the framework
<derek> in 2 tier mode
<derek> since its client specific stuff we dont have it released 
<jws> Where i'm going with this is rather interesting.
<derek> if you look in gnue/forms/samples/track/
<derek> there is a postgres sample of a contact manager
<derek> that creates the tables and such
<derek> and has the forms bound to them etc etc
alexey (alex@techkran.vladimir.ru) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jws> forms interfaces are good for data entry, but not so good at analysis. all erp software is that way.
<jws> I have some ideas i'm developing with my boss that will be 'killer applications' for our niche.
<derek> well a few things there
<derek> we have a complex report server
<jws> the trouble is, we can't really do them with the package we have now.
<derek> it translates data from sql to xml
<derek> and then has transformation engine
<derek> that can convert it from XML to about anything from html, pdf, ps, latex, you name it
<derek> i ahve been speaking with developers at morgan stanley about a linux OLAP engine as well
<derek> which is KILLER for analysis
ajmitch_ (~me@p33-max2.dun.ihug.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Isomer> OLAP?
<derek> Online Analytical Processing
<jws> reports are more of a daily or weekly view of the manufacturing data. we are optimized to the point that we need real-time understanding of the process to be effective.
<jws> olap is something I am starting to appreciate. I allways understood the concept, but I never knew that's what olap was.
<jws> It just hit me one day. SQL was like that, too.
<derek> i use olap like daily
<jws> The manufacturing module is what really has me motivated to this. If i share code with the work you guys have already done, i'm set.
<derek> in govt setting where we have 13,000+ employees and about 2.6 billion in revenue a year
<jws> the olap stuff i'm interested in for sales trends and things of that nature.
<derek> its not manufacturing but there are lot of numbers to look at and OLAP makes it easy for management :)
<derek> i dimension swapping, list loving, cube building olap fool
<jws> We have a situation where we compete with a small number of other vendors for a few customers. we sometimes don't notice when a customer stops buying a particular type of product from us.
<jws> we want to sopt those kind of trends.
<jws> spot, i said, dammit
<derek> jws: you a linux shop currently?
<jws> for infrastructure only, web, dns, firewall. 
<derek> woudl you use linux as a back end?
ajmitch (me@p21-max7.dun.ihug.co.nz) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<jws> I have unprecedented clout with the owner. As long as I could work out a way to do hot backups of postgres, i'll use that.
<derek> um you arent limited to postgres :)
<derek> if you needed SUPER hot backups of DB
<derek> you could always use SAP-DB
<derek> its free (as in GPL) and its good enough for SAP R/3 im sure its good enough for anything a small company needs to do
<derek> plus i know for a fact it does hot backups
<jws> We currently have an app based on pervasive db and they support a linux version as well. I would probably proto on PGres.
<derek> and will allow writing direct to device (for speed) that postgres wont
<derek> if pervausive has free copies of db somewhere and drivers
<derek> email links to jcater
<jws> I'm not religous abot databasing.
<derek> w/in probably a few days you could have working db drivers for gnue
<derek> for pervasive
<derek> jws: i only mention it because you could make forms for your existing application in minutes if you so desired :)
<jcater> well, if pervasive has odbc drivers, you can already connect :)
<jws> I think you can get a 'workstation' edition and sdk free. local connections only. 
<derek> jcater: doh, forgot about that
<derek> but odbc has weak introspection :)
<jws> odbc, ado, jdbc, linux, netware, winnt, multithreaded for SMP...
<jcater> hmm
Action: jcater needs to finish those ado drivers
<jws> our current app(who will remain anonymous) is a cobol-based windows app. you can imagine...
