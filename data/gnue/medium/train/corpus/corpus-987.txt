<chillywilly> for the record if you hack the klogd config file and do KLOGD="-c 4" it will turn off the crap on the console

<psu> ok, web site has been updated to include brief descriptions 
<psu> of the non-main Forms clients 
<psu> available via http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/forms.php
<psu> Let me know of any omissions or corrections needed 
<jcater> err
<jcater> that's a little confusing to me
<psu> Is there a "freedom-loving" name for Java?
<jcater> but maybe that's because I'm a developer
<jcater> the Curses and GTK are slightly different than the others
<jcater> java, emca, php are separate forms clients
<jcater> curses, gtk, and wx are modes of our main, reference client
<jamest> yeah
<jamest> i think it should be grouped together
Action: psu will re-word accordingly
<jamest> and said that it supports wx, gtk, curses
<jamest> actually
<jamest> the java client is so old i bet it'd be a major overhaul to get it to even remotely function
<jcater> dude
<jcater> have you looked at jforms
<jcater> there's no code in there
<jcater> it's all files w/blank class defs iirc
<jamest> if that's the case then I'd be tempted to drop it
<jcater> we need to look at the whole way we're handling this
<jcater> I'm not sure this is clear
Action: psu will try again
<psu> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/forms.php
<psu> I can see a case for not mentioning the "Other Forms Clients" at all
<psu> but they exist, even if
<Mr_You> JForms is Java no?  who is working on that?
<psu> only as prototypes (jscript)
<psu> Mr_You: No-one. 
<psu> or (like the Java) as failed experiments to be kept around as an awful warning ;-)
<Mr_You> ahh
<jamest> maybe we shouldn't mention them
<Mr_You> Jans javascript code could replace JForms
<jamest> as people will try them out and they ask about them
<jamest> until we have a live one
<Mr_You> yeah but its cvs james, no releases ;-)
<Mr_You> they get what they deserve ;-)
<jamest> i mean not on the main page
<jamest> as no one is working on java one so why mention it
<Mr_You> yeah
<Mr_You> maybe archive it, or create an "old" directory.. for failed attempts ;-)
<psu> well, the other Forms clients are fairly well hidden
<psu> Not on the status page, not on the left toolbar, etc
<psu> Only accessible from /tools/forms.php

<psu> masta may have some ideas
<Mr_You> for a second, I looked around to see if you could "authenticate" groups, but I couldn't find anything in pam.
<jcater> psu: my issue is with "official" vs "other people's implementations"
<jcater> as jsforms != the html mode for gnue-forms
Action: jcater is just worried about confusion
<Mr_You> it would require local machine specific group checking
<Mr_You> what do you mean jsforms != html moe for gnue-forms?
<Mr_You> what is then?
<jcater> I dunno what it is
<Mr_You> so why not jsforms?
<jcater> we have planned all along to have an html mode for gnue-forms
<jcater> that's no secret
<Mr_You> yeah but no one has put anytime or ideas into it cept me and Jan, AFAIK
<Mr_You> and the best thing we came up with was using js.
<jcater> I'm not saying don't do jsforms.. go for it
<jcater> I never said that
<Mr_You> but saying its not going to be included is kinda a time waster
<jcater> included?
<jcater> included in what?
<revDeke> my opinion is that we have 3 distinct things (perhaps 4)
<Mr_You> let me put it this way...you won't create a sufficient HTML client WITHOUT JS
<jcater> Mr_You: maybe so
<Mr_You> inclued as a GNUe Forms client.
<jcater> but the jsforms plans do not hold up to the reference implementation needs
<Mr_You> jcater: maybe you'd prefer active-x?  ;-)
<revDeke> 1. UI Drivers - (python based drop in drivers, curses, pygtk2, wx fit this bill) that are official
<jcater> at least, if they will require appserver
<jcater> as the webpage reads
<jcater> I mean, that's completely useless for me
<Mr_You> well you gotta start somewhere
<jcater> we have
<revDeke> 2. Forms Implemenations - complete rewrites of forms that are not drivers that are official
<jcater> and it's called gnue-common
<jcater> and gnue-forms.uidriver.base
<revDeke> 3. same thing as 1 only non official
<Mr_You> umm
<revDeke> 4. same thing as 2 only non offical
<Mr_You> that would be fine to implement a python-based CGI for "2-tier"-like connectivity
<Mr_You> but its not going to be persistent
<revDeke> i think that 3 and 4 dont belong on the gnue.org website except maybe as links to non official gnue stuff
<jcater> like hell its not
<Mr_You> umm
<psu> official == in our CVS, or likely to be?
<revDeke> 1 and 2 belong there but need to be distinct
<Mr_You> tell me how you will make HTTP persistent using CGI?
<revDeke> as there is a difference between running gnue-forms -u gtk2 someform.gfd
<revDeke> and running
<revDeke> phpforms someform.gfd
<revDeke> if that makes sense
<jcater> Mr_You: you added the CGI part
<Mr_You> jcater: how else would you connect to a DB from an "HTML client"?
<Mr_You> way I see it this.. atleast for the immediate future:
<revDeke> psu: im not sure how to define official
<revDeke> ultimately it should be if its in our cvs its 'official'
<Mr_You> for unencrypted 2-tier LAN service you could use local machine clients..
<revDeke> but i think jcater and jamest mentioned that perhaps the java version shouldnt be in there anymore
<revDeke> as its not maintained
<revDeke> and is nearly worthless now
<Mr_You> for encrypted 3-tier WAN service over the net, you could use appserver and HTML or local machine clients.
<jcater> Mr_You: that's not our vision, though
<jcater> that defeats the mission
<jcater> "All our tools can be used together or independently"
<revDeke> in the future i would say the only kind of java implementation that coudl be official woudl be one that used all free software 
<revDeke> i.e. a free java virtual machine and toolkits
<Mr_You> jcater: but why would you use an HTML client AND local clients in the same "group?
<jcater> huh?
<revDeke> Mr_You: i think you are overseeing the basic principles of gnue
<revDeke> and looking with far too narrow of a scope
<jcater> why would I use curses, win32, and gtk in the same group then?
<jcater> because of different user's needs
<revDeke> certainly one could make an HTML client that did not require apserver
<Mr_You> I'm trying to understand how you would use HTML client independently
<revDeke> er appserver
<revDeke> Mr_You: that wasnt the point
<revDeke> the point is you could use an HTML client w/ or w/o appserver
<revDeke> w/ or w/o reporter
<revDeke> w/ or w/o integrator
<Mr_You> rev: absolutely, but lets talk technical
<revDeke> just like you should be able to use appserver w/o ANY forms implementation
<Mr_You> how is it POSSIBLE to use an HTML client without middleware?
<revDeke> um
<Mr_You> HTML client can't talk to the DB directly
<revDeke> how is it possible to write client server applications w/o middleware?
<revDeke> i.e. i dont see how middleware is 'special'
<revDeke> er html
<revDeke> the UIhtml.py driver for forms
<Mr_You> I don't see what middleware is being used in a 2-tier setup.. its only 2 hehe
<revDeke> would be what the 'middleware' would become
<revDeke> the browser kind of becomes the 'toolkit' (like wx or gtk)
<Mr_You> I'm not refering to "internal middleware"
<revDeke> Mr_You: thats my point
<Mr_You> man this is frustrating
<revDeke> im not seeing WHY you need middleware
<Mr_You> lets get on the same page
<jcater> Mr_You: I'm not discouraging any of y'all from doing the jsforms thing
<revDeke> at one time someone was writing an UIhtml.py (its in cvs if i remember correctly)
<jcater> I never said that
<Mr_You> what is the gripe?  that HTML client requires appserver and it won't run alone in 2-tier setup, correct?
<jcater> I just said we have plans for a UIhtml client
<revDeke> that basically used forms and was just a driver
<revDeke> Mr_You: the gripe is some folks dont want an EXTRA layer called appserver
<Mr_You> rev: ok
<revDeke> by forcing the client to use appserver you are forcing htem to use a layer they feel is unnecessary
<Mr_You> rev: so tell me now, how you would expect to get persistent connections using a webserver and HTML client?
<revDeke> much like the wx client
<revDeke> i woudl expect the html client
<revDeke> to allow use of appserver or allow use of common db system directly
<revDeke> where the forms developer makes that decision
<Mr_You> but you can't have persistent connections with "common db system directly"
Action: revDeke could be wrong, but i think that was the crux of jcaters argument
<Mr_You> and it still requires a web-server, your middleware/extra component
<jcater> Mr_You: I connect to websites everyday
<jcater> that have database backends
<jcater> and my browswer isn't talking to their database
<revDeke> like all crapp^H^H^H^H web applications you often have to 'fake' your persistence
<Mr_You> jcater: it is "persistent-like" it is not truly persistent.
<jcater> well
<jcater> lemme tell you
<revDeke> again i STRONGLY suggest you look at UIhtml.py
<jcater> I'm not opening up a pipe back to my database
<jcater> for a remote web browser to use
<jcater> :)
<revDeke> jcater: chicken
<Mr_You> correct... so what I'm saying is.. you can't create an HTML client WITHOUT extra components, which in this case it would require APPSERVER OR Apache/webserver.. it wouldn't work without one or the other
<jcater> Mr_You: yes it can
<Mr_You> how so?
<ra3vat> psu: "here" link from http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/jsforms.php is broken
<psu> ra3vat: thanks
<Mr_You> persistent-like is a whole other ballgame
<Mr_You> its going to be a PITA to code.. IMO
<jcater> um
<jcater> as opposed to javascript
<jcater> that opens connections back to home office
<jcater> ?
<jcater> :)
<Mr_You> javascript is just implementing xmlrpc
<Mr_You> I'm still waiting for your explaination
<jcater> Mr_You: I've pasted links to my rough outline many times
<jcater> lemme dig it up
<Mr_You> no no
<Mr_You> I'm refering to your response "<jcater> Mr_You: yes it can"
<Mr_You> how is it possible to run an HTML client without a webserver?
<jcater> Mr_You: gnue-forms can stand by itself and communicate back to a webbrowser
<jcater> there's no magic to that
<Mr_You> so gnue-common has a builtin webserver now?
<jcater> ya
<Mr_You> ok, and this isn't news worth mentioning?
<jcater> um
<jcater> it's part of python's library
<Mr_You> ok
<jcater> it formed the basis
<Mr_You> frustrating again
<jcater> of the initial gnurpc implementation
<jcater> how do you think
<Mr_You> its either in gnue-common or is planned to be in gnue-common or what?
<jcater> gnue-common is serving xmlrpc calls?
<Mr_You> ok ok
<jcater> not by magic
<Mr_You> so 
<revDeke> hmmm isnt magic just science unexplained :)
<Mr_You> this is bizare
<jcater> psu: I have one concern/suggestion
<revDeke> so if he didnt know that python had webserver capabilities it could be construed as /magic/ no?
<revDeke> ;)
<jcater> I strongly feel, whatever appoach we take w/the various forms
<jcater> ...user
<Mr_You> so where would this gnue-common webserver code be executed?  on the local machine?
<Mr_You> you would startup the gnue-web-server on the db machine?
<Mr_You> I'm very aware that many programming languages have http libraries.
<jcater> pk, back
<Mr_You> way I look at it is this... create a jsforms client that does xmlrpc then when the "gnue-web-server" begins to work you just integrate it with the javascript client.. cause javascript is going to be required for screen writes.
<jcater> psu: I strongly feel, whatever appoach we take w/the various forms
<jcater> the website layout should be more like
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/forms/.......
<jcater> e.g., 
<jcater> you have 
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/curses
<jcater> this could just as well refer to the curses navigator client
<Mr_You> no one has explained to me how you can run webserver code without a webserver.
<jcater> you would be your own webserver
<Mr_You> you mean gnue would have a webserver
<jcater> gnue has a webserver
<jcater> I don't understand why you're arguing with me
<jcater> I don't even understand what this is about
<Mr_You> why not just build the webserver into appserver?
<jcater> um
<jcater> why?
<Mr_You> I'm trying to figure out the roadmap!
<jcater> then just build forms into appserver while you're at it
<Mr_You> and the argument is still this..
<jcater> if the other tools can use the code, it goes in common
<jcater> we all agree to that so far
<Mr_You> formsclients shouldn't require extra software for 2-tier setup.. I'm ASKING YOU.. HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE with HTML client?  ITS NOT.
<Mr_You> AFAICS
<Mr_You> understand?
<Mr_You> ie. it requires a webserver or appserver.. either way one is required, you said it wasn't, but I haven't heard how.
<Mr_You> you can't build an HTML 2-tier client without something executing and connecting to the DB.. that ain't gonna be the browser, like you mentioned.
<Mr_You> if I'm wrong, correct me already.
<jcater> 2 tier refers to database access
<jcater> I never said "no server of any type"
<jcater> app server != a general purpose server like a webserver
<Mr_You> you said it would work without appserver or webserver.
<jcater> as I said earlier
<Mr_You> "yes it can" was your response to mine.
<revDeke> btw: psu i agree with jason on tools/curses and such
<jcater> ok, maybe I misunderstood you 
<jcater> you said apache/webserver
<jcater> so I thought you meant cgi + apache
<jcater> which is not the case
<jcater> but I also said
<jcater> early on
<jamest> mod_forms :)
<jcater> the gnue-forms client can be its own server
<Mr_You> I said apache/webserver because if a webservr is required it should be able to use apache
<Mr_You> thats good too
<Mr_You> so you see.. I stand by my thoughts that js is required for dynamic screen writes.. you build the layout code into JS then add on xmlrpc and 2-tier connectivity
<jcater> and I said that's great
<jcater> I'm not discouraging jsforms
<Mr_You> the 2-tier connectivity requires backend coding just as the xmlrpc route does also.
<Mr_You> but you just can't have an HTML client with both functionalities until both backends are coded.
<Mr_You> I understand ya'lls point now.
<Mr_You> it comes down to the requirement of configuring and running appserver vs the requirement of configuring and running a webserver.
<Mr_You> and the only answer I see is that one will have to come later at the expensive of the other
<jcater> I wasn't asking for an answer about anything
<jcater> I don't remember asking a question
<Mr_You> and I could be wrong, but appserver+jsforms is further along than webserver+jsforms
<jcater> webserver+jsforms?
<jcater> who said anything about webserver+jsforms
<jcater> ?
<Mr_You> oh man
<jcater> I think that's where we're getting confused
<ajmitch> morning
<Mr_You> s/webserver/gnue-web-server
<Mr_You> that better?
<jcater> s/jsforms/html client
<jcater> that's better
<Mr_You> why not call it jsforms?
Action: revDeke remembers at one time a UIhtml.py floating around
<revDeke> that seemed to acutally kind of work
<Mr_You> and you said webserver was confusing not jsforms wtf?
<revDeke> it required webware or something
<ajmitch> did UIwebware.py ever work?
<Mr_You> uggh
<Mr_You> nm
<revDeke> yeah that one
Action: ajmitch is into webware stuff
Action: revDeke thought it kind of worked
<Mr_You> I don't understand why I keep getting a response that a webserver isn't required for html client hehe
<jcater> what?
Action: revDeke would like to see a python/html implemenation first at it should require LEAST amount of work
<jcater> you aren't
<jcater> you never did
<Mr_You> yer confusing the hell out of me, I'm trying to lay it out as simple as possible
<revDeke> rather than a full forms rewrite in javascript or php
<jcater> you said
<Mr_You> you're not going to have a dynamic client with JS
<jcater> and I could be wrong, but appserver+jsforms is further along than webserver+jsforms
<revDeke> but thats just me, im not writing the the client so its not for me to dictate
<ajmitch> revDeke: well, that was what the webware one was like, no?
<jcater> and I said? webserver+jsforms
<jcater> it should be 
<revDeke> ajmitch: yes
<jcater> .... and I could be wrong, but appserver+jsforms is further along than webserver+html client
<jcater> which I kind of disagree with as well
<jcater> but that's another story
<Mr_You> revDeke: a python/html client would still require javascript for any sort of dynamic on screen functionality.
<ajmitch> tho it'd ideally need js for client-side processing of things like input masks, keystrokes, etc
<ajmitch> as Mr_You said :)
<jcater> and I keep on saying, I'm not discouraging/competing w/jsforms
<jcater> it's a good idea
<jcater> go for it
Action: ajmitch thinks there is a degree of confusion here
<Mr_You> ajmitch: correct, so why not write all of the layout in JS I say.. ;-0
<Mr_You> anyways.. this is pointless.. siesel has a good deal of work done on the jsforms client and its looking good
<jcater> great!
<jcater> I'm glad
<Mr_You> slap on some sort of cgi component and you have eliminated your appserver requirement
<Mr_You> easy as that ;-)
<Mr_You> from what I understand ya'll are talking about having a client that requires a backend cgi component to do most of the forms layout and processing.. and having a "lite weight" javascript functionality to maintain dynamic screen writes and persistent-like capability..
<Mr_You> going the route that has been taken, you can reuse the js code for the 2-tier connectivity.
<jcater> not at all!
<jcater> but I give up
<jcater> y'all do your thing
<Mr_You> well jason, I'm sorry, but no one has explained to me how 2-tier connectivity will be done without the use of some sort of "CGI"
<jcater> why do I have to design the html client right here in IRC?
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/HTMLClient.txt
<jcater> are my plans
<Mr_You> because we've been discussing this everyone keeps their comments to themselves?
<jcater> what?
siesel (jan@dial-194-8-205-204.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> hi all
<Mr_You> hi
<Mr_You> that last comment was wrong, my bad.
<Mr_You> what I meant to say..
<Mr_You> is how do you plan on not using js?
<jcater> sigh
<siesel> cool. seems like web clients are being discussed
Action: Mr_You sighs too.
<revDeke> btw: Mr_You i never said that js couldnt be used in a python client
<revDeke> for html
<revDeke> i.e. i would expect it
<Mr_You> rev and all
<Mr_You> lets not just expect it... it is REQUIRED for dynamic screen writes
<jcater> revDeke: my vision on that is
<jcater> the html client would NOT require JS
<jcater> but if there
<revDeke> i think you could do that
<jcater> it could take advantage of it
<Mr_You> ok
<revDeke> the biggest thing that becomes an issue
<Mr_You> I understand more now.
<revDeke> is client side triggers
<jcater> dudes
<jcater> I never said every detail had been worked out
<Mr_You> I personally don't want to touch a forms client that has to reload the screen every click or key stroke or whatever.. I would use a js client 
<revDeke> but the data stuff and such i see no problems
<jcater> Mr_You: great!
<Mr_You> jason: no problem
<jcater> neither would I
Action: revDeke thinks its an implementation detail not an architectural one
<Mr_You> I'm trying to explain why JS is in our best interest for the enduser
<ajmitch> revDeke: aye
<revDeke> as jcater points out, we dont have to design it here today
<jcater> Mr_You: let me state this
<jcater> I would fully expect y'alls jsforms to be a better experience for the end-user
<jcater> BECAUSE
<jcater> it is a specific, targeted version of forms
<jcater> BUT
<Mr_You> now tell me why you would not want to use JS
<jcater> that doesn't mean we don't want a version using our gnue-forms core
<jcater> Mr_You: because support for JS is very, very lackluster/unstandard
<jcater> I never said we wouldn't use it... just not require it
<Mr_You> bigger issue than all of this is triggers in HTML client..
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I'm ending this discussion right now
<jcater> we are not designing this today
<jcater> I am happy you guys are doing a jsforms client
<jcater> I am
<jcater> another implementation will keep us in check
<Mr_You> well I'm not a coding madman like jan
<jcater> and it will be something very useful
<jcater> that doesn't negate use having a more general purpose one in gnue-forms
<jcater> even if it's not as robust/user friendly
<dsmith> One of the problems of js is that it is different for every browser.  Some don't even support it (like dillo).
<jcater> now, that's all I have to say on the matter
Action: jcater out
<Mr_You> I'll say this... I expect to leave it up to the developer (siesel) as to the point of where incompatibilities become an issue
<Mr_You> between browsers on whether to code that functionality or not.
<jcater> psu: did you catch my comment on the site layout
<jcater> wrt forms/
<jcater> ?
<psu> jcater: I have already fixed to distinguish modes of ref client
<psu> and "other" clients
<psu> Just need to be told which of the "other" clients we regard as unofficial at the moment
<psu> and I'll remove them completely
<jcater> I think it's safe to say Java
<jcater> has jan abandoned phpforms in favor of jsforms?
<jcater> or are those both still being developed?
<jcater> siesel?
<Mr_You> I dunno if I should mention this on the list, but we could begin group and user based access control using the system group file (requiring local system lookup) or internal objects.
<siesel> just one word to the whole stuff: IMHO 1. choices are good 2. there has to be ONE standart implementation (more than one will allways become unmaintainted) 3. 
<jcater> 3. ???
<jcater> is that like
<jcater> 1. Write GNUe
<jcater> 2. ???
<jcater> 3. Profit?
<jcater> ;)
<Mr_You> heh
<Mr_You> 3. ??
<Mr_You> 4. Profit
<siesel> 3. jsforms should be so modular that you can easily implement three different setups: a) standalone jsforms b) jsforms with preloaded data, +...  c) ... d) just take triggers from jsforms the rest will keep on the server side (php or python or perl ....)
<Mr_You> maybe.. lik datasources.. we could also have access list, would be an XML file.. and use internal objects/group file to find out who is a part of which.
<ajmitch> jcater: CSV db driver inherit from _static ?
<siesel> jcater: 3. Profit like in joining Greanpeace.
<jcater> siesel: :)
<revDeke> btw: i dont know if anyone caught my CSV driver comment
<ajmitch> revDeke: i did
<jcater> revDeke: no
<Mr_You> anyone comments about what I mentioned?
<jcater> when was it said?
Action: siesel is listening
<ajmitch> revDeke: you said you didn't want it to be complex
<revDeke> i think good things were discussed, but im curious about making db driver more complex than need be
<ajmitch> revDeke: how owuld it be more complex?
<Mr_You> rev: when is smallbiz gonna be in the cvs?
<revDeke> i.e. some of the things sounded more like 'integrator' issues than db driver issues
Action: ajmitch will probably work on it after work today
<jcater> revDeke: possibly
<revDeke> im not saying anything said shouldnt be in the db driver
<revDeke> im just saying i woudl be cautious
<jcater> which things specifically are you thinking about?
<revDeke> as generally there are two types of things 
<revDeke> csv files in which you wnat to read and write
<revDeke> and csv files which are used to 'move' data
<revDeke> jcater: i think you brought up a VERY good point in the dont assume 1 line
<revDeke> some wierd files dont start data until two or three lines in
<revDeke> and the issue of do you have header rows or not etc
<revDeke> another good point
<revDeke> both of those should be in the driver i htink
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> you don't think field renaming should be?
<revDeke> but one must evaluate how can one reasonably read/write is for some things
<revDeke> i.e. is it only valid for import/export
<siesel> read write files and files to just "move" data could be differenciate by a "mode=RW|R|W|R_seq|W_seq" field
<jcater> well
<jcater> I wouldn't expect to run GNUe Forms off of it
<jcater> I suppose one "could"
<ajmitch> heh
<revDeke> again im picking nits here
<revDeke> im not saying anything discussed doesnt belong in the dbdriver
<revDeke> BUT
<ajmitch> are there any docs (yet) for writing db drivers?
<revDeke> if things are more for import export i think defining them in the conf file sucks :)
<revDeke> i.e. it should be part of integrator imho
<revDeke> i.e. i deal with flatfile passing for mainframe for a living
<ajmitch> yuck
<revDeke> and having to setup connections.conf stuff for it would be ugly
<jcater> ajmitch: source code
Action: jcater ducks
Action: revDeke might be envisioning too far out to what integrator will be like
<jcater> revDeke: true
<jcater> however
<jcater> hear me out for a sec
<siesel> revDeke: I thought of this thing too. In normal case the names of the csv file are changing all the time.
<ajmitch> jcater: ok, so i'm expected to write up docs as i go? :)
Action: jcater faces similar issues you are
<jcater> I'm really thinking, wherever you define it, this really boils down to a <datasource> issue
<jcater> so there's really two options
<revDeke> ajmitch: didnt i send you the GNUe Telepathy Headband in via post?
<jcater> 1. do as I originally suggested
<ajmitch> revDeke: must have missed it
Action: revDeke was envisioning another file format..... for integrator that is XML based
<jcater> and have a <datasource type="fixed"><flatfiledef>.........</flatfiledef></datasource>
<ajmitch> yaff
<revDeke> that could be as simple as holding this kind of data
<revDeke> and as complex as providing mappings and triggers etc
<revDeke> again maybe im thinking too much into integrator here
<revDeke> im not against what has been proposed it will be great to see a csv driver of any type 
<revDeke> as i would expect it to evolve, so i dont want to 'over complicate' things
<Mr_You> what does csv stand for?
<revDeke> just thinking outloud
<jcater> well, IF it's a part of the datasource definition
<jcater> (since we are considering other things now)
<revDeke> comma separated value
<jcater> 1. it can be part of the <datasource> tag (or a subtag)
<jcater> 2. it can be part of the connections.conf file
<jcater> those are basically the 2 options
<jcater> I'm ok with either
<jcater> IF it's 2
<revDeke> is there a way like FORMS where we can override
<jcater> you could still leave out connections.conf (for one-time stuff)
<revDeke> i.e. i can define a connections.conf file
<jcater> and have a <database> tag
<revDeke> OR
<revDeke> i can define a <database> tag
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> :)
<revDeke> if so im totally cool with it
<jcater> now, I'm totally cool with my 1 or 2
<revDeke> as the integrator xml file im thinking of
<jcater> I honestly have no preference
<jcater> well
<revDeke> could then if one time stuff just write out the db tag
<jcater> the advantage for #2
<revDeke> if its reused it could be in a connections.conf
<jcater> is if it IS a cvs file you need to reference very often
<jcater> it could be in connections.conf
<revDeke> yip
Action: Mr_You sighs.
<jcater> maybe I need to shut up
<jcater> and let derek talk
<revDeke> im in 100% agrteement here
<jcater> we are talking in parallel here :)
Action: revDeke hopes im thinking like them and not them thinking like me (or we are all doomed) ;)
<jcater> I'm reasonably sure you're thinking like us
Action: jcater ducks
<jcater> did hell freeze over today?
<jcater> my feet are cold
<ajmitch> nope, still warm here
<Mr_You> I love being ignored.
<Mr_You> way it goes
<revDeke> smallbiz is in cvs now
<Mr_You> what is csv?
<siesel> revDeke: I thought of XML input for Integrator too. But then we need a new directorys "sources","filters","destinations" like report has.
<ajmitch> Mr_You: comma separated values
<revDeke> comma separated value (i answered that earler)
Action: Mr_You feels like an idiot once again.
<Mr_You> I've never refered to it as acronym.
<revDeke> siesel: more ithink like jcater (or something like that)
<ajmitch> i only see it as an acronym :)
<revDeke> i think that integrator is just a different front end to reports
<jcater> siesel: I'm not sure about all of that
<jcater> imho
<jcater> integrator is
<revDeke> i.e. im thinking the reports engine with little work will do most of what integrator needs to
<jcater> <datasource>s  <-----> <datasource>s
<jcater> providing a mapping layer between them
<jcater> to do complex stuff
<revDeke> just that you get a UI that is slightly different
<jcater> (with triggers if need be)
<revDeke> jcater: i agree with that 
<revDeke> maybe its reports with a little more
<jcater> so I'm not sure what "filters" and "destinations" would be for
<jcater> in integrator
<revDeke> at one time i thought completely separate, but i see more and more shared to a degree
<revDeke> i tried to not get lost in the details and just kind of observe
<jcater> revDeke: in my mind.. it's reports with a SINGLE destination... another datasource :)
<revDeke> i like this converstion in that the CSV driver to me is a HUGE first step for integrator
<revDeke> ie. i have needs for integrator but mostly with CSV
<revDeke> as soon as we have CSV driver i can start to torture test integrator with sample usages :)
Action: revDeke notes that i opened a credit like with ye lowly donut shoppe in Memphis
<revDeke> s/like/line
<jcater> ooooo
<ajmitch> bbl, time for me to work :)
<Mr_You> my bank offers Quicken (QIF) and MSMoney (OFX)
<Mr_You> should be easy enough to integrate
<psu> Ok, so I'll remove the Java forms client from the website
<psu> Is someone going to tag it then remove it fromCVS too?
<psu> And should I drop the ECMAScript/Javascript as well?
<psu> At least until siesel and Mr_You get something that is CVS-able?
<siesel> tell me where to put it into cvs then I will commit
<psu> <irony>/jforms?</irony>
<siesel> psu: possibly just commenting (jsClient) out would be good for now.
<siesel> jcater: you asked about phpforms. At the moment I will first make jsforms a bit more complete before combining it with phpforms, moving much code from it into phpforms and make phpforms still work with non ECMAscript capable clients.
<siesel> But now I need a working Integrator (<datasource>s  <-----> <datasource>s)
<jcater> um
<jcater> we need to hash out what a gmd file is gonna look like
<jamest> ack!
<jamest> i leave for 1/2hour and have 25 pages of logs to read
<jcater> jamest: psu will have an executive summary by Sunday :)
<jamest> i can wait then :)
ColeMarcus (~ColeMarcu@p50805C31.dip.t-dialin.net) left irc: 
<siesel> my thoughts about are kind of the following: 1. define source and destination datasources 2. define fields to be directly copied
<psu> heh, it's Thursday
<psu> That makes it next week in KC-land ;-)
<jcater> I didn't specify which sunday :)
<psu> jcater: true
<siesel> 3. source fields split into multiple dest fields 4. source fields merged into single dest. fields 5. source fields being input for triggers only and populate dest fields
<siesel> 6. multiple rows from source which get merged into one row in the dest. datasource 7. "row splits" 8. submappings for detail datasources
<siesel> Jason: what do you think?
reinhard (~reinhard@M693P020.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: "Everything that is worth fighting for, is worthy fighting dirty for"
<jcater> I'd say thats a pretty good use-case listing :)
<psu> forms section on website changed again
<psu> hopefully now definitive 
<psu> www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/forms.php
<jamest> psu: i like that better
<jamest> 1 possible change :)
<jamest> would it be cleaner to have 1 page on the reference client with #section tags for the various drivers
<jamest> as I know that I want to see a native win32 driver and a qt driver 
<jamest> and I'm sure we need an emacs driver too :)
<psu> The main justification for separate pages is 
<psu> that each mode of the ref client may have diff statuses
<psu> and it's confusing to have too many "Status" lines on one page
<psu> IMHO
<siesel> if we have the emacs driver, we possibly won't need anymore. Even unicode would be handled perfectly ;)
<siesel>  /anymore/any other driver/
<jamest> psu: good point
<jamest> wx: flaky
<jamest> curses: unusable
<jamest> gtk2: who knows?
<jamest> hmmmm, maybe we should just leave status off :)
<jamest> j/k
Action: jcater would still rather see
<jcater>  /tools/forms/
<jcater>  /tools/forms/curses
<jcater>  /tools/forms/gtk2
<jcater>  /tools/forms/wx
<jcater> if you want to keep separate pages
<jcater> as I think /tools/curses 
<jcater> is ambiguous
<jcater> considering we have a curses navigator too
<jamest> true dat
<jamest> as reports almost has a curses and wx mode i think
Action: psu will fix that in the pending site overhaul for when we get it into CVS
<psu> as the current site assumes things that make that difficult
<psu> but I intend to "unassume" them once I need to get site working in both locations 
<psu> i.e. www.gnu.orh/software/gnue & www.gnuenterprise.org
Action: psu sometimes whishes we had stuck with Zope
<psu> but I got so blocked with that, I even did the unthinkable
<psu> and RTFM-ed
<psu> and even that didn't work ;-/
<jamest> :)
<psu> documentation == the last step before apt-get remove
<grib> hey any of you gnue-ers have any experience with EDI?  are there any free libraries to deal with it, pref C? 
<jcater> I know derek dealt heavily w/EDI
<jcater> but I don't know if he had any free libraries to play with
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) left irc: ": I'm off to make more toys..."
<grib> jcater: from what I can tell it doesn't seem like rocket science, but I'm just sort of trying to get a handle on the big picture from a dev perspective... looking at source is generally the way I learn best :)
<Mr_You> from what I understand EDI is a broad concept..
<grib> I guess I'm thinking specifically about ANSI X.12 and EDIFACT, which seem to be the most prevalent standards. 
<Mr_You> ok
<grib> but the whole "Value Added Network" concept and how EDI transactions actually take place is sort of eluding me.  Anyway I figured somebody around here might have a clue about it... when's derek generally around? 
<psu> theoretically, EDI is meant to be a dead duck with ebXML and the like about
<psu> but like many legacy technologies
<jcater> like my fax machine?
<jcater> :)
<psu> it's proving much more resistant than the tech consultants expected/hoped
<revDeke> rofl
Action: psu sits opposite a COBOL programmer at work
<revDeke> you poor naive innocent developer
<revDeke> EDI is TECHNICALLY is as simple as it gets
<revDeke> tis the politics of EDI that is a nightmare
<nickr> psu: man, you really have derek disease.
<revDeke> everyone has different EDI standard
<revDeke> i.e. doctype
<revDeke> and uses different VANs (carriers)
<revDeke> the price is LUDICROUS
<psu> nickr: i find that if i wait until the end of the sentance 
<psu> to press return
<psu> someone else has already said what I was going 
<psu> to
<revDeke> i suspect there will be little hope of free EDI stuff until the cost of EDI comes down
<revDeke> as free software develoeprs can afford to test it
<nickr> psu: I have a touch of that myself unless I'm hopped up on caffiene and type like the wind.
Action: revDeke could look into whether LDC would gpl stuff its not likely though
<revDeke> as over time it became cheaper in ways to outsource some of it and deal with it on an outer level
<revDeke> as customizing for each vendor was tedious
Action: revDeke still thinks the best biz model in the world would be FREE EDI
<revDeke> i.e. all libraries and such are completely free
<revDeke> all software free
<revDeke> and the 'HUB' van could be 1/3rd the price of what exists today
Action: jcater thinks the best biz model in the world is FREE DONUTS.... I'm just waiting for someone to try it next door to me
<revDeke> and you would still make serious cash
<nickr> EDI does seem like mostly a service type situation.
<revDeke> anyhow grib you are sick sick sick man if you want to do EDI in C
<revDeke> as much as i hate perl it would make sense because of its good text parsing capabilities
<revDeke> but C is well just not optimal for slicing and dicing text files
<revDeke> imho
<nickr> It can be with the right support libraries.
<jcater> true
<revDeke> python would is fun for edi cause its all about the lists baby :)
<jcater> you could compile in perl support :)
<nickr> haha
<nickr> or pcre
<revDeke> i.e. you just read the file in as dictionaries and go to work
<nickr> yea
<revDeke> but back to grib's original issue, there arent any free ones i know of
<revDeke> i plan on authoring some (they will be in python)
<revDeke> for now its not high priority
<grib> revDeke: you seem, to know what yer talking about :) thanks for the info (still reading scrollback)...
<revDeke> at some time i think might close a contract deal that would involve paying to author an EDI VAN
<revDeke> and corresponding libraries
<revDeke> if you want i can put you contact with the EDI guru
<revDeke> ive been removed from it for a bit and he does all of it now
<grib> revDeke: I know --><--- that much about EDI and I would waste a guru's time at this point.  I'm just trying to figure out which direction is up.  
<revDeke> i owe him a lunch so i can meet with him and get update of what is being done there now
<revDeke> well it kicks ass in sense that if you do volume
<revDeke> it saves you a lot of money
<revDeke> even though its expensive
<jcater> grib: follow the $$$$$$ ... that's the direction it goes
<grib> revDeke: what's expensive?  is it using a VAN, who charges per document?  
<revDeke> VANs generally charge per document (or per byte)
<revDeke> a transaction might be in neighborhood of say 1.00 
<revDeke> well it might take 4 docs to complete a transaction
<revDeke> order
<revDeke> invoice
<revDeke> payment
<revDeke> so 4 for a roudn trip transaction
<revDeke> shipping manifest
<revDeke> if you do say 1000 orders a day
<grib> I take it that EDIFACT is an XML based text format ... is that what really gets used, or is the older X.12 stuff still more common?  
<revDeke> that s4,000 a day with say 20 business days
<revDeke> thats 80,000 a month
<revDeke> er month w/ 20 days not day with 20 days
<revDeke> x.12 is more common (or was last i played)
<revDeke> though many were starting to support XML variations
<revDeke> think of a VAN as a good ole boy network
<revDeke> when i was playing there were like 4
<revDeke> GM owned one
<revDeke> Sears owned one
<revDeke> Walmart owned one
<revDeke> and a bank owned one
<revDeke> most peopel were going through GM's
<revDeke> but say you do business with business X and he uses GM
<revDeke> you have to sign up with GM
<revDeke> to do business with him
<revDeke> then you get an accoutn with business Y and he uses Sears
<revDeke> you ahve to sign up with Sears to do business with him
<revDeke> you can use GM
<revDeke> er cant
<grib> yep, sounds like a typical squeeze play. 
<revDeke> the 'setup fees' are kind of costly 
<revDeke> and everyone does it a little different
<revDeke> then even with the same VAN
<revDeke> you might have walmart use 874 for invoices
<revDeke> but mcdonalds uses 872
<revDeke> the documents are 'similar' but different
<revDeke> anyhow there has been some shake out and there are a lot more than 3 now
<revDeke> and people are starting to belong to more than one or two
jbailey (~jbailey@atlas.fundserv.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> so some ofthose barriers are dropping
<revDeke> but they are still there and frustrating
<revDeke> however EDI rocks when it works
<grib> revDeke: but generally a transaction is just an exchange of text documents following a "knowable" (i.e. purchasable) format?  and the protocol for connecting to and delivering documents to the VAN is knowable too? 
<revDeke> someone sends an order electronically hits the floor and pick ticket is generated, product packed and shipped... the person ordering gets a shipping manifest
<revDeke> whenthey get the shipment the invoice goes out electronically their system auto deposits the payment and sends a receipt
<revDeke> and you just cut out half the human labor process :)
<revDeke> and got paid quicker to boot
<revDeke> grib: yes
<revDeke> its purely shoving around text files
<revDeke> thats why i say 'techinically' its pretty simplistic
<revDeke> gnue will support it REALLY well
<revDeke> with integrator
<revDeke> which we were discussing earlier
<revDeke> in fact once someone makes a 'document' they coudl put under the gpl for others to use
<revDeke> then all they would have to do is map their data into it :)
<grib> revDeke: so it would be moderately reasonable to use XML report formats, process them to generate report output, and then transform that into an EDI doc, at least on the output direction...
pattieja (~pattieja@www.pcxperience.com) left irc: "[x]chat"
<revDeke> absolutely
<revDeke> im more thinking that if you XML-EDI you could have reports actually just output that
<revDeke> but either way you have flexibility
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise.
<jbailey> revDeke: Is designer eventually supposed to let you setup the database too?
<revDeke> yes
<revDeke> i think we want strong database support in our IDE
<revDeke> there is start of schema editor in there
<revDeke> i suspect that will just continue to be built on
<revDeke> because its so plugin oriented it should be easy for people to continue to enhance functionality without know the internals
<revDeke> i would like to see it be able to design queries and create views and many other things (though its not high priority)
<revDeke> i.e.. someone not wanting to touch GNUe
<revDeke> might be interested in GNUe Schema and the Designer portion that manages databases
<revDeke> as a consistent cross platform / cross database mangament tool doesnt really exist

<chillywilly> ok, ok
<chillywilly> I didn't check

<nickr> someone should update the link for that, btw

<nickr> it should be http://nick.industrialmeats.com/proj/etc ...
<nickr> I should rewrite the proposal
<nickr> I've had several good ideas since I wrote it.
<chillywilly> you should write some python too ;)
<nickr> I write python all day at work
<chillywilly> yea, but what abot gnue

<ajmitch> oh dear
<derek> sorry for now gnuebot and chanserv want to bitch fight if over t
<derek> so you will have to wait until i can fix gnuebot :)
<ajmitch> so deop gnuebot
<derek> um he will come back
<derek> he is persistent little bi0tch
<derek> and i dont want to ban him
<derek> i woudl rather fix him, i just cant right now
<ajmitch> i didn't say ban, i said deop
<derek> he will reop himself
<derek> he's not dumb you know
<jbailey> Take away his perms in chanserv. =)
<jbailey> That might just break him, though
<jamest> why do we even have him?
<jamest> we have 2 bots in here
<jbailey> And the everpresent chanserv. =)
<derek> jamest its nice to have a back up
<derek> however
<derek> he shouldnt be an op
<derek> and shouldnt have any rights except to log the channel :)
<ra3vat> why is that so many messages on form's startup DB003: [EventController:57] Unknown Event: updateENTRY
<jamest> events are now defined per object instead of globaly
<jamest> so if you've events on objects we've missed then they won't fire
<jamest> if the form is in sampes i can fix
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> does the form have buttons?
<ra3vat> no
<ra3vat> with what sample form i can try?
<jamest> i was asking if it was a sample form
<ra3vat> no
<jamest> if it's not then we've got issues
<jamest> ok
<jamest> hang on
<jamest> oooo, nevermind
Action: jamest read that as trigger issue not event issue
<jamest> triggers are now defined per object
<jamest> the event system 
<jamest> sigh, were to start :)
<jamest> any object can register to listen to any other object (basically)
<jamest> however that object may only understand what to do with a few of those events
<jamest> example: so if you and i both did something crazy like register to listen to derek
<jamest> and derek says "jump off a bridge"
<jamest> i may know how to jump off a bridge so I go do it
<ra3vat> :)
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-246.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<SachaS> hello everyone
<jamest> you on the other hand don't know how (or are too smart to listen to him) and instead say "Unknown Event: jump off bridge"
<jamest> hi
<derek> jamest.jumpOffBridge(true)
<derek> rofl
<derek> i typed that originally as
<derek> jamest.jumpOffBridget(true)
<jamest> lol
Action: jamest took a while to see the typo
<ra3vat> jamest: ok, i will look into that (fridge?) later
<derek> jamest: what do you guys need testing on?
Action: derek will be ready to rock in a few minutes
<jamest> everything
<jamest> but specifically
<jamest>  try and break query by detail
<jamest>   designer issues
<jamest> any issue you find please let me know
<jamest> any database drivers you can test
<jbailey> On Monday I have to demo Gnue to my boss against a mysql database.
<jbailey> And he'll decide if we'll use it for our purchase order system and network database. =)
<jamest> then you'll want me to commit the fixes
<jamest> :)
<jamest> actually
<jamest> the python-mysql in woody has issues 
<jamest> or we have issues working with it
<jamest> i just built 0.9.2 mysql from source and it works fine
<jbailey> I'm running unstable.
<jamest> yeah
<jbailey> It'll be using the debs I uploaded, so it's all python 2.2
<jamest> oh, your computer
<jbailey> I don't have anyone elses handy.
<jamest> well, i'm happy to do what I can to make demo success
<jbailey> Well - this demo is the whole reason I could spend paid time packaging it.
<jbailey> We might be saving ourselved liek 25 licenses of filemaker.
<jamest> are you getting things working ok?
dsmith (dsmith@oh-strongsvillecadent1-1c-20.clvhoh.adelphia.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> then I'm much much more interested in making things work for you
<jbailey> I haven't tried designer yet against a database source.  I ran out of time, and it turns uot I wasn't logging the conversation where you told me what to put in. =)
<jamest> i'll test tonight
<jbailey> I can read the website and dig it out though.  tommorow maybe.
<jamest> as I have mysql working
<jbailey> Sure - I'm doing another CVS upload this weekend, so let me know if that's a good snapshot.
<jamest> if you have openoffice
<jamest> read jcaters guide in OO format
<jbailey> I've also gotten confirmation from the folks in #python that I can change it from arch: any to arch: all.
<jbailey> That'll speed up the time it takes to get into testing.
<jbailey> Hmm.  I don't know if abiword reads OO format or not.
<jbailey> He hasn't got it in pdf?
<jamest> it teaches form creation from both text editor and designer
<jbailey> Ah, nice.
<jamest> dunno
<jamest> i'll look
<ajmitch> jbailey: what reasons for choosing mysql?
<jbailey> ajmitch: two reasons.
<jbailey> ajmitch: 1) I know how to make it work
<jbailey> ajmitch: 2) phpmyadmin
<ajmitch> heh ok
<ajmitch> phppgadmin is ok, i guess
Action: ajmitch uses both mysql & pgsql
<jbailey> I don't know of a nice equivalent for pgsql.
<ajmitch> phppgadmin does pretty much the same
<jbailey> Ah, really?  I had heard that it sucked.
<jbailey> It's been a while though.
Action: ajmitch hasn't used it enough to say if it sucks or not
<jbailey> Dunno.  I used mSql way back when.  I switched to Mysql when the rest of the world did.
<ajmitch> good to hear that designer is being nice :)
<ajmitch> i wonder if it's worth me printing out the developers guide
<ajmitch> even with all it's TODOs
<jamest> i don't think I would yet
<ajmitch> ok
<jamest> crap
<ajmitch> costs me 15c a page to print at uni
<jbailey> Ouch
<jamest> then dont
<jbailey> Go to kinkos or something.
<ajmitch> kinkos?
<jamest> copyco
<ajmitch> sounds dodgy
<jamest> i can't make the pdf file
<jbailey> No Kinkos in the correct hemisphere?
<jamest> it bombs on my system
<jbailey> jamest: Can you make a .ps?
<jbailey> Like print to file?
<jamest> trying
<jamest> uploading
<jamest> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jamest/
<jamest> ps format
<jbailey> Cool - Do you want the pdf? =)
<ajmitch> excelletn
<jbailey> Ah, cool.  Anjuta supports python syntax highlighting.
<jamest> does mysql support subselects?
<jbailey> I think mysql 4 might.
<jbailey> the current version definetly doesn't.
<jamest> argh
<jbailey> (unless I just have the syntax horribly wrong)
<jamest> what you using to make the pdf files
<jamest> ps2pdf?
<jbailey> ps2pdf
Action: jamest will install on ash and make them
<jamest> seems that mysql doesn't
<jamest> unless we both have the syntax horribly wrong
<jamest> jbailey: what will you demo monday?
<jbailey> I haven't decided.
<jbailey> I might reproduce our network database.
<jbailey> If I do that and can show him it on Linux and windows that would be cool.
<jbailey> If I can figure out how phpforms works, even better. =)
<jamest> all in a weekend ?
<jamest> :)
<jbailey> Hmm..  I was thinking in 2 hours tommorow afternoon. =)
<jamest> well, i know you're feeling the python love right now
<jbailey> Is phpforms supposed to work off of the same gcd files as gnuef?
<jamest> the same gfd files yes
<jbailey> typo, sorry. =)
<jamest> in fact jan had a webpage that you could upload your form
<jamest> it had 0 privacy though
<chillywilly> gnuef sounds a LOT like queef
<jamest> i wouldn't try and sell gnue on phpforms yet though
<jamest> as I'm not sure if it's ready
<jbailey> dict queef doesn't give me anything.
<jamest> jbailey: you don't want to know
<jbailey> jamest: It's not the critical selling features.  The win32 client will be.
<chillywilly> it's slang ;)
Action: jamest whimpers
<jamest> win32 with wx is a complete bitch
<jbailey> *lol* 
<jbailey> Looks bad?
<jamest> functions wierd
<jbailey> Joy. =)
<ajmitch> jamest: found a vic^H^Holunteer to do a python win32 client?
<jamest> i haven't tried cvs on it yet
<jamest> ajmitch: all we need is a UIdriver.py file for win32all
<jamest> and we're golden
<ajmitch> yeah
<jamest> i actually started digging this morning on that 
<ajmitch> i know, but there's not too much docs for the win32 stuff
<jbailey> Would it distress you to know then that part of this proposal is to use it as a purchase order system for millions of dollars a year?
<jamest> jbailey: nope
<jbailey> And that if it works that it would be on almost everyone's desk in a 70 person company? =)
<jamest> i feel good about forms iand common
<jamest> i feel ok about designer
<ajmitch> jbailey: only 70 people?
<jamest> i feel ok about reports
<ajmitch> appserver still a bit iffy
<jbailey> I haven't looked at reports yet.
<jbailey> Only designer and forms.
<jbailey> (and obviously common by extension)
<ajmitch> navigator might need some love, i guess, but it's fairly simple 
<jamest> yeah
<jamest> jbailey: to be completely honest
<jbailey> Well, hey, it's in Debian now - it *must* be stable. =)
<jamest> i'd be more worried about mysql :)
<jamest> but then I'm bias
<jamest> and if it works for you it works for you
<jbailey> *lol*  I've run millions of transactions on mysql before. =)
rdean (~rdean@12-221-229-247.client.insightBB.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<ajmitch> keep good backups :)
<jbailey> It's starts to suck wind when you load 20 million records into it.
<jbailey> But so did pgsql. =)
<ajmitch> i know
<jbailey> ALthough... pgsql would at least still load. =)
<jamest> jbailey: if you have a sec I can give a 90 second demo of designer/forms
<jamest> well, if you have 90secs 
<jamest> and currnet cvs
<ajmitch> cool
<jamest> mysql works no
<jamest> now

<jamest> though without subselects query by detail will fail

<ajmitch> hehe

<ajmitch> yeah, there have been a few more around lately
<jbailey> Especially since the story is so stupid.  RMS was stupid in proposing a release date this year and got caught with his pants down.
<ajmitch> don't know why he thought it'd be ready
<jamest> he had jbailey working on it
<ajmitch> i haven't seen a massive speedup in development lately
<jbailey> jamest: I'm not a core developper. =)
<jbailey> I just provide abuse and have been around longer than all but one person who still commits to the Hurd tree. =)
<ajmitch> jamest: chillywilly perhaps?
<jamest> perhaps
<ajmitch> jbailey: you also provided an autobuilder
<jbailey> And still do.
<chillywilly> hmmm?
<ajmitch> it's alive again?
<jbailey> Although it's spent most of its time recently building toolchains.
ToyMan (~stuq@glvv-dsl1-116.citlink.net) got lost in the net-split.
<jamest> what are we looking at timewize for a hurd based system in production
<ajmitch> depends on what developers focus on - if they focus on L4 porting, then it could be awhile
<jbailey> I can't asnwer that, but here's what I can give you.
<jbailey> We got pthreads about a month ago.
<jbailey> Marcus spent the last two nights hacking on oskit-mach and chasing stability bugs.
<jbailey> Using oskit mach has the neat advantage that it has a serial debugger.
<jbailey> Whcih means that we can get backtraces off of kernel crashes.
<jbailey> This summer we switched to the same "io" core of glibc that linux uses.
<jbailey> Neal claims that he has a solution to the partition limit ready to implement after christmas.
<jamest> so things are moving along
<ajmitch> ah, he does? useful
<jbailey> I've been working with Matthias Klose on getting our toolchain up to date.
<jbailey> Earlier this week we finally got pascal and chill running on our boxes.
<jbailey> and as soon as ajmitch fixed libffi we'll have gcj,.
<jbailey> ;)
<jbailey> s/fixed/fixes/
<jbailey> So you can generally expect apps to run.
Action: derek hasnt read back log
<ajmitch> hmm
<jbailey> XFree works - I've seen it on Marcus' laptop.
<derek> jbailey: if you want purchase order system PLEASE use gnue
<derek> i can promise to help
<derek> as part of gnue-sb
<jbailey> derek: The decision isn't mind.
<derek> i.e. if he is willing to do it as gpl
<jbailey> s/mind/mine/
Action: ajmitch should try & compile that stuff
<derek> he will get additional help
<derek> the network database of course you are on your own :)
<jbailey> jamest: So things are moving along and picking up speed.
<jamest> did gnue-sb get in cvs?
<jbailey> MArcus' console is now in use on a bunch of systems and he's porting it to oskit-mach.  That gives us all the virtual terminal support that Linux has.  Scrollback buffers in each window, *and* unicode support on the console.
<derek> jamest: csi is on after that i can start testing
<jbailey> And we also have multi-attach like screen -x.
<derek> jamest: yes its in cvs
<ajmitch> jamest: the savannah project is up, i think
<derek> though we need it to be gnu.org not nongnu.org
Action: derek doesnt know the issues there
<derek> but its in gnue-sb cvs
<jbailey> jamest: And that's all in the last few months.
<derek> the gsd's are busted unless jcater got around to fixing the schema stuff in cvs
<ajmitch> derek: just a setting on savannah
KeithJagrs (trilluser@63.74.24.9) joined #gnuenterprise.
Action: derek runs back to CSI see you a few
<ajmitch> jbailey: time for me to try & resolve build dependencies for gcc-3.2...
Action: chillywilly has tun X on the Hurd before
<chillywilly> er, run
<ajmitch> this could be a minor nightmare :)
<jbailey> ajmitch: I haven't uploaded the bison and something else, sorry.
<jbailey> All of the build deps build no prob, though.
<ajmitch> doxygen?
<jbailey> dpkg-buildpackage -B
<ajmitch> doing apt-get -b source :)
<ajmitch> generally works better when i don't have the source to play with yet
jbailey (~jbailey@atlas.fundserv.com) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<Maniac> so linux fans, should my next install be debian?
<ajmitch> there can be no other!
<jamest> depends
<jamest> it's the only thing I'd install
<jamest> if at all possible
<derek> there is something other than debian gnu/linux
<derek> hmmmm
<jamest> but it's frustrating to see it trail behind the other distros wrt to package version numbers
<derek> ?
Action: derek found redhat frustrating
<Maniac> i run mandark loonuks now
<jamest> woody ships with kde 2.2
<derek> for that reason
<derek> you all would have new cool toys
<derek> and i couldnt even get the stinking software in a package
<derek> i was compiling so much it was sick
Action: derek thinks
<jamest> that's the love part of debian
<jamest> apt-get
<derek> sid + other sources.list lines
<derek> = pure bliss
<jamest> the bad thing is you either run testing or sid
<jamest> (no way in hell on productoin equipment)
<derek> i.e. you might not be able to get kde3 or gtk2 or such 
<jamest> or stable
<derek> but with a sources.list file addition generally will get it
<jamest> or learn like i finally did how to run a mixed system
<derek> and as jamest says i might not put a SERVER on testing/sid
<ajmitch> nor would i generally have a workstation on sid
<derek> but generally a server shouldnt be running 'brand new' software
<derek> as its likely not fully tested
<ajmitch> except for my home box which i develop on
<derek> i.e. when a new redhat comes out with latest gcc and kde and such
<derek> no way its had proper testing already :)
<derek> anyhow its all opinion, i still say the best thing you can do is run what your friends run
<derek> (or whoever you get support from)
<derek> jamest: you know where jcater is or if he will be back?
Action: derek is curious about schema stuff
<derek> i want to convert our samples over to using gsd's
<derek> as well as get gnue-sb working properly
<jamest> um
<jamest> his cable modem fried
<jamest> so he's off line at night until he gets replacement
<derek> ouch
<derek> thats wrong
<derek> i wouldnt go home
<jamest> he had some work to do at the store
<jamest> but talked about going to work late tonight to work on some things
<jamest> so he may be here later
<derek> cool
<jamest> l8r
<jamest> derek: update cvs again before you test things
<derek> ok
<derek> hey where do you get mailman?
<jamest> and I'm cleaning out the dcl tickets
<derek> the reporst are debian version is very old
<jamest> so submit more
<ajmitch> list.org
<derek> anyone have a sources.list
<jamest> l8r
jamest (~jamest@adsl-64-216-107-182.dsl.tpkaks.swbell.net) left irc: "[x]chat"
<derek> l8r
<ajmitch> not that i know of
<derek> well what do you know ;)
<ajmitch> 2.0.13 is the version in sid, and is the latest stable mailman version
<derek> yeah looks like 2.1 is on beta4
<derek> but still how can debian test it if its not in sid?
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> debian tests software as stable for inclusion in a distro
<ajmitch> they don't track the gnome 2.1.x series, for example
<derek> yeah i know
<derek> but generally on bigger patches there are sources.list of stuff that is close
<derek> i.e. whomever is the maintainer puts in his home dir as he is brewing the packages until they become stable
<ajmitch> ah
<ajmitch> mithrandir is maintainer for mailman
<derek> i thought salve wass
<ajmitch> hmm
<ajmitch> lemme check
<ajmitch> Maintainer: Tollef Fog Heen <tfheen@debian.org>
<ajmitch> which is mithrandir - debian-installer guy
<ajmitch> people.debian.org/~tfheen has no mailman stuff
<derek> yeah i checked too
KeithJagrs (trilluser@63.74.24.9) left irc: "later"
<ajmitch> he's online now, ask him about it :)
<derek> where is he
<derek> and who is him (tfheen or mithrandir)
<ajmitch> uses the nick mithrandir
<derek> what channel?
<ajmitch> he's in #debian-devel, might not be a good idea to ask there ;)
Action: ajmitch points derek in the direction of /whois
<derek> ah why not its fun to be flamed
<derek> by know it all ^H^H^H^H^H^H good guys
<ajmitch> it's your skin that'll get roasted
<chillywilly> mithrandir is a LOTR reference derek ;)
<chillywilly> Gandalf Mithrandir the wizard :)
<chillywilly> in case no one knew but I suspect many did, so I dunno why I bothered to state the obvious
Action: chillywilly is on crack
Action: chillywilly passes it around

<SachaS> dimas: what is that one based on? written from scratch in python???
<dimas> i'm do not know exactly
<SachaS> libxml is licences ad mit licence which is obviously gnu gpl compliant.
<dimas> but licence should be like for others main python libs
<SachaS> everything gnu or what? :)

<grib> hey y'all.  just brainstorming with some folks and thinking about how it all fits in with gnue.  a few thoughts/questions: 
<nickr> kadink
<grib> so the application server.  does Zope fit in there at all?  it has many of the properties of an application server and gives you a lot of freebies. 
<grib> and it's already python.
<grib> for example, the ZPT mechanism and TAL/METAL could be used to process a report definition (in XML) into a filled-out report (in XML)
<grib> essentially for free. 
<grib> since it already talks XML-RPC every which way it seems like it could interoperate with some of the existing gnue stuff, no? 
StyXman (~mdione@ADSL-200-59-86-17.cordoba.sinectis.com.ar) left irc: "ircII EPIC4-1.1.7 -- Are we there yet?"
<grib> anyway.  just thinking.  I don't have enough experience with the state of the art in gnue to really know how the pieces fit together so the above is likely to make no sense.

<revDeke> oh studs de la network
<revDeke> do any of you have experience with duplicate packet transfer?
<revDeke> i.e. whenyou do a ping you get say 3 packets for every 1 requested
<revDeke> with a (DUP!)
<grib> revDeke: are you pinging a broadcast address, x.x.x.255 for example? 
<revDeke> well if its a broadcast its not x.x.x.255
<revDeke> its actually the proxy server
<revDeke> so i dont think it should be 'broadcasting'
Action: revDeke is far from a networkign guru
<revDeke> but i think they have some routing tables messed up here
<revDeke> OR they ahve multiple machines with same mac address or something
Action: revDeke was going to try to use tcpdump but i dont knw what to really look for
<revDeke> i did a traceroute and only 3 machiens between me and this box
<revDeke> if i ping each intermediate machine
<revDeke> i dont get DUP's so the DUP is happening at last box

Action: jcater drools
<Varadhan> jcater: according to the supplied doc, it doesnot have any "runinstall" program to install the Oracle...
<Varadhan> jcater: rather, it asks us to do some pre-installation configuration and some post-installation configuration...
<jcater> ok
<jcater> that sounds familiar
<Varadhan> jcater: and the main installation is just "un-tarring" the dowloaded tar.gz file...
<Varadhan> jcater: we have done as per the document... and we are able to run system queries like "Select sysdate from dual" etc...
<Varadhan> jcater: the actual problem is we are not able to create a database...
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> let me send you my script that I use
<jcater> I've hung on to it for the last 5 years
<jcater> and slightly modified it for each release of oracle
<jcater> maybe you can gleen some information from it
<jcater> where would you like it emailed?

<Varadhan> jcater: even we are going to run gnue on that machine... :) after this successfull installation...
<revDeke> no i caught up watching obidiah on tvU after CSI
<Varadhan> jcater: can you email that script to me???
<revDeke> and fell asleep before i made it back to pc (so sad, im getting old i guess)
<jcater> yeah, but be forewarned, I haven't upgraded to Oracle 8i
<jcater> and I don't use clustering

<Varadhan> jcater: yeah.. i am trying to write a small banking application just to show a demo about gnue features...
<jcater> cool
<Varadhan> jcater: document is nice.. hopefully i will be able to finish my app soon...
<jamest> i know people have said that the roadmap exists only in a few heads of the developers
<jamest> in an effort to do something about that I present
<jamest> http://ash.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/forms.html
<jamest> or www even :)
<jcater> and I present
<jcater> http://ash.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/reports.html
<jamest> it is very much a work in progress
<jamest> all of it is
<jamest> it's based heavily upon kde
<jamest> er
<jamest> kde's release feature list with some tweaks
<jamest> while it's not as strick as a roadmap it does attempt to give people an idea where things are going
<jamest> how we think it'd work
<jamest> as the 0.5.x releases progress things get moved from the red area, to the yellow, then to the green
<Mr_You> Varadhan: you may be interested in the GNUe-SmallBusiness apps which are currently only in cvs
<jamest> 0.6.0 will not appear until either everything in 0.5.0 section is in the green OR something causes us to move items holding us back into a later release section
<jcater> I like KDE's release plans better than the traditional roadmap you see w/projects
<jcater> as it is more fluid
<jcater> and, I think it fits our model of development better
<jamest> so should jason and I  continue to work on these or are we waisting our time?
<jcater> <chirp>
[15:38] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<jamest> <tap><tap><tap>Is this thing on?
Action: jcater waves his hand at jamest
<jcater> "over here!"
<Mr_You> who are you asking?
<jcater> #gnuenterprise
<Mr_You> sounds good to me heh
<jamest> we're asking everyone in the channel
<siesel> how are/will be the feature plans updated?  CVS? ...?
<jamest> right now it's horrible
<jamest> vi and raw html
<jamest> I'm pretty sure I'd like to see someone make some databases and gfd files we can run on ash
Action: ajmitch likes the feature plans
Action: siesel likes the feature plans too. Good Work.
<jamest> then force our webmaster to write some php to create the pages in realtime

<ajmitch> nr neilt
<neilt> hello
<ajmitch> we be discussing feature plans :)
<ajmitch> show him, jamest!
<ajmitch> how are you?
Action: ajmitch has not seen neilt around much lately
<neilt> I am excellent
<neilt> but busy
<ajmitch> http://ash.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/forms.html
<neilt> how about you
<ajmitch> i am fine now that i have finished uni for the year :)
<ajmitch> time for some hackering
<neilt> http://ash.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/appserver.html looks like a lot of work
<neilt> and forms etc
<ajmitch> yup
<jamest> lol, most of it is placeholders
<ajmitch> bbl all, i have to go out in the rain & get very wet now
<jamest> the only ones that have been worked on are common, forms, reports
<jamest> and then only a little
<jamest> i think jason is banging on reports now though
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> trying to
<siesel> jcater: can you execute "/usr/sbin/ssl-certificate --force" on ash to recreate the ssl certificate? 
<jcater> ok
<siesel> thx
<jbailey> Oh weird.  I didn't think gnue actually had a featuer list they were trying for. =)
<jbailey> I thought it was just "do everything for everyone"
btami (~btami@3e70d73e.dialin.enternet.hu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> sorry
<revDeke> work is good on the roadmap stuff
<jcater> no
<jcater> it's a feature plan
<revDeke> over time i hope to get these generated directly from dcl
Action: jcater ducks
<revDeke> jcater: im fine with calling it a featureplan
<revDeke> as thats what i pretty much am defining by saying roadmap
<revDeke> i.e. a list of what features are targeted for what release
<revDeke> i woudl call it release schedule
<revDeke> but that sounds like it has a 'time' connotation
<revDeke> and we all dont want that 
<jcater> I don't care for release schedule at all
<jcater> roadmap is better than that
<revDeke> rofl
<btami> may i suggest layout engine plugins (independent from xslt) for reports 0.3.x feature plan
<revDeke> we can call it foo as long it exists
<revDeke> i like the way its going, will give me idea of what i need to add to dcl
<revDeke> so that someday it can configure them
<jcater> btami: we are independent from xslt now
<Varadhan> Mr_You: sorry had gone for a tea.. can you name some of such apps (small business apps)???
<Varadhan> Mr_You: can i get links to such apps sources???
<btami> jcater: ?
<nickr> FuturePlan(tm)
<revDeke> already i plan to add 'versions' properly into DCL
<jcater> btami: maybe I misunderstood your suggestion
<jcater> revDeke: I thought about using DCL for this
<Mr_You> varadhan: go to the cvs page at www.gnue.org and instead of "gnue" use "gnue-sb" in the cvs command lines.
<revDeke> so that people can file bugs against versions more like bugzilla
<revDeke> but also allow developers to put 'release version'
<revDeke> i.e. what version its slated to be fixed
<jcater> but I'm a little concerned about the flexibility
<btami> jcater:i have to use xslt now to make a html or text or pdf ...
<jcater> but we could try
<revDeke> same could go about its workorders 9features)
<revDeke> jcater: so am i
<revDeke> right now NO WAY it coudl do it
<revDeke> it will take some shifting of DCL
<jcater> btami: that's because "xslt" is the only plugin we've written for those report types
<revDeke> for now i would suspect that DCL be done to track the work (bugs) not so much plan it
<siesel> revDeke, could you add Q&A to DCL too? Like gnue-forms passed test X and failed test Y...
<jcater> btami: actually, that was implied by the 0.2.x section
<revDeke> yes
<jcater> on GNUe:Reports:Standard Documents
<jcater> I'm hungry
<jcater> anyone have any food?
<siesel> hehe 
Action: siesel had orderd piza and lasagne :)
<btami> jcater: i mean no intermediate xml, just layout events
<siesel> delicious :)
<revDeke> siesel : well over time yes to Q&A
<revDeke> i would see new features as being WorkOrders
<revDeke> and then when a work order is filed instead of being 'closed' it goes to Q&A
<revDeke> and Q&A has extra fields yada yada yada
<Varadhan> Mr_You: except DCL, other projects have the status of "Not yet started"...
<revDeke> but thats far down the road
<jcater> btami: ah, I see
<revDeke> im sooo happy to see loose feature lists
<btami> jcater: you talked about before :)
<Varadhan> Mr_You: is there any other smallbusiness apps just to show as a gnue-demo???
<revDeke> i dont want to get out of control
<Mr_You> varadhan: go to the cvs page at www.gnue.org and instead of "gnue" use "gnue-sb" in the cvs command lines.
<jcater> btami: no, I haven't discussed, but I've been personally thinking about that
<Mr_You> its only accessible via cvs
<Varadhan> Mr_You: OH!! lemme try...
<btami> jcater: ok
dsmith (~dsmith@208.40.56.34) left irc: "later.."
<btami> jcater: and maybe some visual reports support in designer 0.6.x ?
<jcater> btami: that would go into the designer feature-plan, which we haven't started on
<jcater> but, definitely
<jcater> that's going to be a biggie
<btami> http://ash.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/designer.html
<btami> :)
<jcater> btami: that was a "cp common.html designer.html"; notice the header...
<jcater> I'm still in the reports.html right now
<siesel> reinhard and I talked about autocreated forms out of database metadata.
pradhap (~pradhap@61.11.56.27) left irc: 
<jcater> you could almost take the Designer wizard examples and use them as is
<jcater> to do that
<jcater> (well, and make them non-interactive)
Action: siesel thought doing that :)
<siesel> can you add it to forms roadmap?
<siesel> (or add me to www-users group :) )
<revDeke> we need our website in cvs pretty badly but thats another discussion
<jamest> what you want on forms?
<jamest> autocreated forms from database metadata?
<jamest> is that it
<jcater> would that go into forms?
<jcater> or appserver?
Action: jcater would think that'd be an appserver thing
<jcater> actually
<jcater> can I ask the usefulness of such a thing?
Action: Mr_You &
<jcater> as designer can easily spit out forms
<revDeke> jcater / jamest when i get a chance one thing i can do on these maps is replace
<Varadhan> Mr_You: i got the code, thanx for your help... though, i could not figure out the starting file, can you help me pls???
<jcater> but I rarely see an autocreated form that doesn't need a "little" tweaking
<revDeke> All outstanding critical bugs in dcl, if any 
<revDeke> with actual bug numbers and desc w/ links
<Mr_You> Varadhan: maybe someone else can I need to run.
<jcater> if appserver plans to serve up forms files
<revDeke> as often we might not actually schedule to close every bug for a release some might be better closed in subsequent releases
<jamest> jcater: i think they want a data browser
<siesel> jcater: we discussed that it would be better if forms would have that functionality
<jcater> oh
<jamest> point forms at a database and it opens a tree
<jcater> hmm
<jamest> click on a table and it opens a grid
<jcater> is that a forms thing
<jcater> ?
<jamest> that I don't know
<jamest> I wanted a grid view 
<revDeke> ????
<Varadhan> can any1 help me to run the gnue-sb application??? i just downloaded from the CVS... i don't know how to start it... pls help me..
<revDeke> a grid view is nice
<jamest> as then I could replace pgaccess here
<jamest> which i dislike stongly
<jcater> jamest: but that gridview would probably be a gridview of an existing form, right?
<jamest> yes
<revDeke> but i dont know if forms should be a table manager like that
<jcater> revDeke: that's my fear
<jcater> I don't think it should either
<jamest> I'm not defending it
<revDeke> i suspect designer is better suited to hav e that functionality
<jcater> I would like to see what jamest wants though
<jcater> revDeke: well, it almost does
<jcater> File | New | From Wizard | Simple Wizard
<jcater> click save
<revDeke> jcater: pretty much
<jcater> clijc Debug | Run
<jcater> :)
<revDeke> but i mean real time
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> but seriously
<jcater> it's amost there anyway
<revDeke> more like pgaccess/such
<jcater> you just add a menu option
<revDeke> but yeah the wizard save is what i use all the time :)
<jcater> that automates a few of those steps
Action: revDeke thinks maybe what people are wanting is dynamic forms
<Varadhan> can any1 help me to run the gnue-sb application??? i just downloaded from the CVS... i don't know how to start it... pls help me..
<revDeke> i know thats what the geas people want
<siesel> the idea was to produce a form on the fly. 
<revDeke> Varadhan: you cant
<revDeke> until the gsd engine is fixed
<jamest> siesel: you have an ash accout right
<revDeke> you wont be able to make valid schema's
<revDeke> from the gsd's
<siesel> yep.
<Varadhan> revDeke: Oh!!!
<siesel> revDeke, gsd is broken???
<revDeke> sorry for the breakage/cruft
<revDeke> siesel: VERY broken
<revDeke> VERY VERY broken
Action: revDeke wasnt pleased but i promised to not get too mad about it
<Varadhan> revDeke: is there anyother sample application available in gnue except DCL and gnue-sb???
<revDeke> the gsd's worked fine with my local setup from a different cvs Varadhan, but as part of fixing gsd engine
<revDeke> we decided to do things differently
<revDeke> i have since changed the gsds in gnue-sb to reflect those decisions so no engine will parse them currently :)
<revDeke> hopefully by monday
<revDeke> Varadhan: gnue/forms/samples/
<revDeke> has plenty simple one's
<revDeke> if you have a database with data
<revDeke> dont bother looking for an app make one
<jcater> siesel: I understand creating forms on the fly... but I question that being a function of forms
<revDeke> in 3 minutes or less you can have a form
<revDeke> jcater: i would say it should not be function of forms 
<revDeke> well let me restate that, as long as i can always have flat file forms im content
<revDeke> not saying i wouldnt use dynamic or database ones, but for now its nice to have flatfile ones
<siesel> The idea was that for some simple tables you don't even have to startup designer.
<Varadhan> revDeke: thanx for your suggestion... i have a question... 
<revDeke> siesel: whats the diff
<revDeke> if you start forms or designer
<siesel> Just point form on it. "gnue-forms gnue:mytest" 
<revDeke> i.e. if we add more dbmanager like functionality to designer (which i think we plan to)
<Varadhan> revDeke: you said that there is some problem in gsd's... is it with the gnue-sb gsd's or any other gsd's that you create using gnue-designer???
<jamest> man
<revDeke> all gsd's at this point (iirc)
<revDeke> unless jcater has modified designer to match the new specification
<jamest> wouldnt this data browser be fairly simple standalone app
<siesel> the diff is that the end-user shouldn't use or install designer
<revDeke> jamest: i think so
<jamest> based on gnue-common
<revDeke> im thinking maybe its a 'plugin' to designer
<jamest> and wx
<revDeke> than could be called indpendently
<revDeke> i see many of things in designer being like that
<revDeke> where you can access them from within designer
<revDeke> or launch on their own
<revDeke> but maybe im crazy
<revDeke> Varadhan: for now if you have tables and data go to designer and choose the wizard
<revDeke> and follow it
<jamest> well, I really don't have strong feelings for or against
<revDeke> and you will get a form that works :)
<jamest> as honestly a small plugin to forms would do it too
<revDeke> assuming your connections.conf is correct
<revDeke> jamest: true
<jamest> just have it build the xml form on the fly
<revDeke> thast something we hadnt really talked about before
<siesel> reinhards idea was NOT to have a data browser, but to use dynamic forms for 80% of all cases.
<revDeke> forms plugins
<jcater> I'm thinking standalone app myself
<revDeke> siesel: thats what i said when 'appserver guys want dynamic forms'
<Varadhan> revDeke: I have just chosen a simple form wizard, it works.. i can browse thru the records of my Oracle table...
<reinhard> yes
<jcater> but wouldn't that be something appserver serves up?
<reinhard> we want dynamic forms
<reinhard> :)
<reinhard> jcater: the problem would be
<reinhard> that forms can "better" do the dynamic form
dimas (~ds@ics.elcom.ru) left irc: "  XChat"
<reinhard> as forms knows things about the UI which appserver doesn't know
<reinhard> like
<reinhard> point sizes of the current font
<reinhard> or
<revDeke> wouldnt this be a component of common
<revDeke> that designer uses?
<reinhard> even
<reinhard> size of the screen
<revDeke> i.e. if designer takes a table def and makes a form via a wizard
<reinhard> (for example to distinguish how many rows a "pseudo grid" has)
<jcater> reinhard: actually, no forms definitions ever mention point sizes
<revDeke> instead it just makes the choices passed the values
<jcater> or anything like that
<revDeke> and isntead of writing a file writes and xmlstream and passes it to forms?
<revDeke> i.e. i would suspect the functionality really already exists
<reinhard> jcater: yes sorry point sizes are a bad example
<revDeke> its jsut a matter of making it accessible to forms or appserver to invoke
<btami> reinhard: why not a standalone app ?
<siesel> revDeke: its more a philophical than a implementation problem :)
<jcater> siesel: yes it os
<revDeke> i think thats a plus of dealing with xml in this case is forms shoudnt care if the definition is coming from a file or directly from a stream
<jcater> it doesn't fit in with any model of forms client we have... the client is always given a definition
chillywilly (danielb@mke-24-167-202-50.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> siesel: my theory is as long as its a choice there is room for it in a sense
<revDeke> jcater: i propose that forms does NOT do this
<jamest> jcater: actaully I wanted more dynamic widgets eventually
<siesel> the reason to put it in forms was that it should work in 2-tier too.
<revDeke> i.e. it always just builds from a definition
<jamest> so tthat triggers could adjust the UI on the fly
<chillywilly> you guys suck
<jcater> jamest: yes
<revDeke> some other application (or common) could prebuild streams and hand it to forms
<chillywilly> who moderates gnue-announce?
<jcater> but I think this is slightly diffferent
<jcater> I think I'm in agreement with derek on this
<siesel> but possibly the best place would be in common. like the GPD creation out if a gear file
Action: jcater washes his mouth out)
<reinhard> jcater: lol
<revDeke> siesel: thats where i was going
<jcater> siesel: I'd agree with that
<revDeke> is if it were in common
<jamest> so who whats to update the appserver.html ?
<revDeke> gpd's or reports or appserver could get at it
<revDeke> in fact forms could in a sick way :)
Action: siesel can't read as fast as he writes :) :)
<revDeke> you coudl have a form that called a trigger to make a dynamic form
<revDeke> rofl that would be funny
<jamest> siesel?
<reinhard> sorry
<jamest> reinhard?
<reinhard> this is a good discussion but i'm dog tired
<reinhard> and i'm not even sure if i can still follow ist
<reinhard> it
<jcater> dog tired?
<reinhard> aehm
<jcater> you've been hanging around us American's so long
<siesel> reinhard: please just say yes to jamest question, ok?
<reinhard> this is how we say it
<jcater> that you've picked up our idioms :)
<jcater> oh, it's Austrian idiom too?
<jcater> cool
<reinhard> ah
Action: jcater learned something new today
<reinhard> jamest: answer to your question is

<jcater> chillywilly: that was me
<jcater> nothing personal
<chillywilly> corse it was
<chillywilly> yea right
<jcater> but we promise that list will be low traffic
<jcater> so a "woot!" response
<jcater> was moderated out :)
<jcater> you could reply to gnue-dev if you'd like
<chillywilly> moderate this
<jcater> but gnue-announce is supposed to be low traffic 
<chillywilly> I don't give a shit
<jcater> yeah, I got your "moderate this" right here!
<chillywilly> bring it on

<jcater> chillywilly: seriously, nothing personal
<revDeke> why when we dont care do we say 'i dont give a shit' (when giving a shit would be the pinnacle of not caring)

<revDeke> yet when we 'give a shit' as in go potty we saywe ('take a shit')
<chillywilly> it fscking is
<chillywilly> only the gnu-elite get to say what goes there

<jcater> that's an announcement
<jcater> not that I would ever want to do that to any threads
<chillywilly> I am sure you have the power to do so
<psu> no-one seems to understand our mailing list structure
<jcater> I understand it
Action: drochaid wonders if he can annouce the updating of drochaid.org on gnue-announce [once drochaid.org has actually been updated of course]
<jcater> gnue-announce --> psu's mail list
<jcater> gnue-discuss --> arguments
<psu> I wonder if we should start treating them as mailman umbrella lists 
<jcater> gnue-dev --> general complaints
<psu> and subscribe gnue-dev to gnue and 
<psu> gnue to gnue-annouce
<psu> and rationalise the membership lists
<psu> "About time for our annual mailing list re-org" ;-)
<jcater> psu: after that
<jcater> should we start planning for the 
<jcater> annual website backend change?
Action: jamest just notices he getting no mail from gnue-announce
<jamest> sigh
<psu> that;s not due for another 6 months
<chillywilly> jamest: yea, gnu.org is cool like that
<chillywilly> jamest: it likes to frelling frop yo ass from the list whenever it feels like it

<Mr_You> X10 rocks
<Mr_You> heh
<drochaid> X10 sucks [sorta, if you're talking about the HA tech]
<Mr_You> HA?  High Availability?
<drochaid> home automation
<Mr_You> ahh yeah..
<Mr_You> why you think it sucks?
<drochaid> interference caused by appliances, constant module failure, large and bulky, limited number of house codes/unit numbers, not all support discreet on/off or set level dim/auto return dimi
<drochaid> should I continue?
<Mr_You> hmm ok
<jcater> drochaid: surely
<drochaid> and I did say sorta up there
<Mr_You> main reason I'm interested is to run/maintain a greenhouse.
<drochaid> have you ever seen a bank of X10 din rail modules, ie, a full house controlling bank?
<Mr_You> nope
<drochaid> it takes up a LOT of space
<drochaid> the one I'm thinking about is a full wall in the guys Node 0
<drochaid> but then, he does have the most cabled home in the UK [cat5e]
<drochaid> all 7kms of it
<drochaid> it's only a little 3 bedroom bungalow
<Mr_You> hehe
<drochaid> Mr_You: you looking at 1-wire kit for monitoring the greenhouse?
<drochaid> and what about the control/decision module?

<drochaid> yep
<drochaid> xcam do them
<drochaid> I *think* if you serach for xcam 2 you should find them
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> searched for xcam
<jcater> exactly what I'm looking for
<jcater> thanks
<drochaid> just watch positioning, like most wirless devices, by default they're wide open to anyone with a lappy and 802.11b card
<jcater> well
<jcater> lemme tell ya what I want to do
<jcater> and it doesn't involve an unsuspecting neighbor :(
<jcater> we have two offices
<jcater> the remote office is 90 miles away
<jcater> and we are their tech support
<jcater> :(
<jcater> (thank gawd for vnc, etc :)
<jcater> today I got so pissed off
<jcater> because they jammed their printer
<jcater> and couldn't tell me what it was saying, what lights were on, etc
<jcater> we have a T1 between the two offices
Action: jcater wants to get a wireless camiera that they can move around
<jcater> and I can view from my desk :)
<jcater> it wouldn't take long at all to pay for the thing
<Mr_You> umm..
<drochaid> ah
<drochaid> LOL
<Mr_You> why on earth could they not read lights?
<jcater> because for mileage expenses, it costs the company $55 each trip
<jcater> that doesn't include the hours they actually pay me while driving (3 - 3 1/2)
<jcater> that's just mileage :)_
<Mr_You> I'd tell them "it ain't getting fixed until someone can read the lights" hehe
<jcater> Mr_You: well, it's not that easy
<jcater> they are our "sales" branch
<jcater> and "sales", well, um, let's just say they like to blame bad days
<jcater> on IT stuff
<ajmitch> haha
<Mr_You> requirment for opening aticket "what are the lights indicating?"  ;-)
<jcater> Mr_You: the brass's response is always "oh, just jump in the car and go... you haven't been up there in a month anyway... you should check everything out"
<jcater> I don't like to give them that excuse :)
<Mr_You> yeah I know what you mean.
Action: jcater can't stand that place
<jcater> normally I wouldn't mind getting a mileage check plus my normal time
<jcater> to just drive
<jcater> but sometimes there's just people that absolutely grate on your nerves
<Mr_You> I actually enjoy getting out of the office when its not mileage on my own vehicle
<jcater> normally I do too
<jcater> it's just this place......
Action: jcater shudders
<Mr_You> sales droids?  ;-)
<jcater> worse
<ajmitch> clueless sales droids?
<jcater> 40 x 18/19 yr old telemarketing chicks
<jcater> who's average turn-over is 6 weeks
<ajmitch> heh
Action: jcater grits his teeth
<jcater> that has to be the worst
<jcater> group to provide tech support to!
<ajmitch> yeah
<Mr_You> man, but they gotta be cute.
<jcater> a few.....
<jcater> but the others offset that advantage
<Mr_You> I worked at a startup that had a bunch of girls like that.. they were not cute..
<jcater> ok, in retrospect, they might be cute
<Mr_You> heh
<jcater> but that whole "cuteness" kinda goes away
<jcater> after so many calls in a day
<jcater> explaining the same thing over and over
<jcater> and over and over
<Mr_You> this is tech support for your GNUe apps that they use?
<ajmitch> makes you want to scream
<jcater> we are still in the process of converting them to GNUe
<jcater> but, yeah
<jcater> a good chunk are still on Oracle Forms
Action: jcater is agressively working on that though
<ajmitch> you usually work on GNUe within work time?
<jcater> shhhhh
<jcater> not in public
<jcater> j/k
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I usually get to put a few hours a day into GNUe
Action: jcater is Vice President/IT... I've saved a few bucks here and there to get quite a bit of freedom :)

<jcater> hmm
<jcater> these xcams look cool
<jcater> I wish I could find one a little bigger
<jcater> just for "user friendliness"
<jcater> I really need a Sony Camcorder w/Viewport
<jcater> that also transmits X10 :)
<jcater> wow
<jcater> these things are < $100
<jcater> I'm surprised
<drochaid> aye, they're cheap
<drochaid> but not as cheap as a 320x200 webcam :)
<jcater> are 320x200 wireless?
<drochaid> no, just shite
<drochaid> I'm trying to recall someone else that was doing wireless ethernet cams
<drochaid> could have been axis, although you'd be able to buy several xcam 2s for the cost of a single axis
<Mr_You> someone came out with a new 802.11a for doing broadcast TV.. but its still new.

<ra3vat> not yet, few web interfaces for forms exist but in very early stages
<ra3vat> Varadhan: if you have test database with your own data and you do few forms and run them via GNUe navigator it would be more helpful

<siesel> you have to extend the trigger name space.
<siesel> switching between pages is done via a event .... (/me looks in the source)
<Varadhan> what '.gpd' extension stands for???
<siesel> sorry, no need to extend the trigger name space.
<Varadhan> siesel: then, how to do it???
<siesel> you can just use the command "setFocus()" in a trigger
<siesel> like fieldX is the first entry of the second page, then you just call setFocus(fieldX)
<siesel> .gpd = GNUe Process Definition ~ the filetype for navigator
<Varadhan> siesel: Oh!!! lemme try... anyway thanx...
<siesel> if you want to try contacts.gpd, you will fail. :(
<Varadhan> siesel: what if i dont have a tabbed interface???
<siesel> add an option tabbed to the <form> attribute I think.
<ra3vat> tabbed="top" for example
<Varadhan> Oh!!! ok...
<Varadhan> Is it possible to disable the toolbar of gnue-forms at runtime???
<siesel> Varadhan: When do you have to show that gnue demo?
<ra3vat> form.setFeature('GUI:MENUBAR:SUPPRESS', 0)
<ra3vat> form.setFeature('GUI:TOOLBAR:SUPPRESS', 0)
<ra3vat> add those to  <trigger type="On-Startup">
<Varadhan> siesel: tomorrow morning!!! IST (indian standard time)
<ra3vat> and change 0 to 1
<Varadhan> ra3vat: On-Exit... 
<ra3vat> Varadhan: On-Exit?
<Varadhan> ra3vat: we have to reset them back to 1 on "On-Exit".. isn't it??? or no need for that!!!
<ra3vat> i'm only today found that feature, not sure what you need and what possible
<ra3vat> found out though that switching off bars brakes status bar somehow
<siesel> Varadhan: you could get gnue-sb running with some small changes.
<siesel> its a pitty. /me hasn't time to do it today.
<siesel> The main problem are the names for datatypes in the GSDs and a missing schema tag on top of all.
<Varadhan> siesel: thats not a problem, siesel... anyway i have to learn using gnue tools if i have to work after this demo.. :)
<Varadhan> Oh!!!
<Varadhan> is it the bug of gnue-designer???
<Varadhan> i have downloaded the CVS version of gnue-sb... but i came to know from jcater that i has broken schema... :(
<Varadhan> siesel: Well, my forms are ready now... only thing left is to fill in the trigger code... how do i do this??
<siesel> no, the "bug" is that gnue-sb uses a very old definition 
<Varadhan> siesel: i mean.. does gnue-designer has got any inbuilt editor to fill-in the trigger code???
<siesel> in designer?
<Varadhan> siesel: Oh!!!
<siesel> yes. There is a trigger editor.
<siesel> Seems like you found it already :)
<Varadhan> siesel: Oh!!! cool... 
<Varadhan> siesel: where???
<Varadhan> siesel: is it the "Event Navigator"???
<siesel> yep.
<siesel> btw. you've tried to move fields from the schema navigtor on the work space?
<Varadhan> no, not yet tried... 
<Varadhan> i mean, my navigational forms are ready.. i just want to verify whether the navigation works properly or not...
<Varadhan> how do i add a button trigger code thru designer???

<Varadhan> derek: do i get some more reasonable document on GNUe???
Action: derek cant do that anymore, im too old
<derek> i think people would feel me a pervert
<jbailey> You *are* a pervert.
<jbailey> But we love you anyway. =)
<derek> Varadhan: its 0.4.0 software i think the documentation is quite good for beta software
<derek> jbailey: true dat
<Varadhan> derek: i have got the Developer's guide.. but as you know.. it contains more *TODOs* than information.. though i started with that only...
<derek> Varadhan: its hard to document things that change daily
<jbailey> derek: Where's the centre of mass for GNUe developpers in North America?
<derek> feel free to ask in this channel
<derek> jbailey: all over
<derek> arizona, kansas, tennesse
<derek> counting mdean i think kansas has the most :)
<Varadhan> derek: okay.. thanx a lot.. till what time will you be online???
<jbailey> Ah, okay.  I had the impression that it seemed generally in the middle and a little east.
<derek> if we were to do a developer conference it would likely be in Branson, MO area
<jbailey> What state is MO, please?
<derek> Missouri
<derek> as its 'central'
<Varadhan> derek: as i have started my own sample *banking* application using GNUe.. i will definitely come accross hurdles.. which you might need to resolve.. :)
<derek> i would like to make LinuxWorld SF our annual conference
<derek> we had one there
<derek> its just hard for everyone to get there
<jbailey> (finding US map)
<derek> Varadhan: i will do best i can
<derek> im in irc generally from about 8:00-24:00 M-F GMT -07:00
<derek> and it varies on the weekend
<derek> like today im here, but have kids so will be spotty
<jbailey> Why is it so hard to find a bloody US map?
Arturas (~arturas@fmgs-03.vtu.lt) left irc: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)
<jbailey> I don't *care* about vegetation or the west nile virus.
<jbailey> What's missoury near?  I only know about a third of the states. =(
<jcater> jbailey: north of arkansas
<jcater> east of kansas
<jcater> west of kentucky
<derek> Kansas -> Missouri <- Kentucky, Tennesse
<Varadhan> derek: using designer, how can i add events??? for example, i have to add the "On-Startup" even to my form.. what should i do??
<derek> hmmm i havent used designer for events
<derek> you should be able to use trigger editor and property inspector to do so
<jcater> man
<jcater> we need to add that to the feature list
<jbailey> North of Arkansaw sound right?
<jcater> I'm soo used to editing triggers in an external editor
<derek> jcater: me too :)
<Varadhan> jcater: yep carter, that would be a nice feature...
<jcater> that I forget designer support is lack-luster
<derek> Remosi: i havent used designer for events :)
<derek> er re not remosi
<derek> jbailey: yes MO is north of our kansas
<Varadhan> but, *newbies* like me have to depend upon the designer.. :(
<derek> yeah i think cater was alluding to that
<derek> i.e. that its a feature that needs to make it in the feature map
<Varadhan> hmm... derek.. ok tell me how to add events to my form???
<jbailey> North?  I have it east on Mapquest. =(
<derek> create your form in designer
<derek> then save it
<derek> open it in your favorite editor (emacs is mine)
<derek> and manually add the tags
<derek> in your case 
<derek> after the first
<derek> <form> tag
<derek> you would do 
<derek> <trigger type="onStartUp">
<jcater> On-Startup
<jcater> btw
Action: jcater ducks back out
<derek> my.lovely.python.code
<derek> more.lovely.python.code
<derek> </trigger>
Action: derek isnt sure onStartUp is a valid type
<derek> but put whatever type you want
<derek> er whatever VALID type you want
<derek> here is a real sample for a trigger on a block
<derek>     <block datasource="dtsitem_category" name="blkItem_category" rows="10">
<derek>       <trigger type="Post-Commit">
<derek> inpParent.resetForeignKey()
<derek>       </trigger>
<derek> you can also iirc actualy make trigger files
<Varadhan> derek: okie.. lemme try... however, thanx... for your info... and the sample... :)
<derek> so that you could do something like
<derek> <trigger type="Post-Commit" src="thatcooltrigger.file">
Action: derek isnt certain on that one its been a wile
<Varadhan> iirc??? may i know what is that???
Action: jcater steps back in....
<derek> i know there is a src tag and i think it can get external files
<jcater> the tag you are thinking of is....
<derek> but i dont recall what is 'state of completeness' is or exact syntax
<Varadhan> yep... actually i am already using it.. :)
<jcater> <import-trigger library="another-file.gfl" name="TriggerNameToImport/>
<jcater> so you could have a trigger called
<jcater> TriggerNameToImport
Action: derek amazingly finds that forms itself does 75% of what i need so i dont need many triggers :)
<jcater> in a file called
<derek> jcater: ah thats right
<jcater> another-file.gf
<jcater> l
<derek> i new in the trigger you used src=""
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> but that's for named triggers
<derek> but didnt recall if you put a file name there or used the import
<jbailey> 14 hours from here to MO.
<jcater> you can define a trigger that needs to be used in several places as a "named" trigger
<jbailey> I've done 12 for a weekend before.
<derek> you in NY?
<derek> or Toronto ?
<jbailey> Toronto
<jcater> ooooo
<jcater> there's a big conference happening in there
<derek> we want to visit you
<jcater> on Linux + Businesses
<jcater> in late Spring
<derek> find a sponsor
<jbailey> I live in a one room appartment.
<jbailey> So I can't really put people up.
<jcater> bah
<derek> yeah april
<jcater> nonsense
<jbailey> You're all welcome to come over for drinks and crash for a night if you need, though.
<jcater> you have a tub, right?
<derek> linux world expo in january in NY as well
<jbailey> There's a conference here in the Spring?
<jbailey> Which one?
<jcater> bah, the name escapes me
<jbailey> I know OLS is in the summer or so.
<derek> jcater: i know the one
<jcater> Varadhan: are you using the CVS version of our tools, or the latest release? (0.4.0)  ??
<derek> Linux Business Symposium or somethingood liek that
<Varadhan> jcater: release 0.4.0...
<Varadhan> jcater, derek: form.setFeature('GUI:MENUBAR:SUPPRESS', 1) is giving error "Attribute error: setFeature"... 
<jcater> that was not in 0.4.0
jbailey (~jbailey@65.48.140.35) left irc: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)
<jcater> you might want to grab latest cvs
<jcater> or a snapshot
<Varadhan> ah!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Varadhan> is there anything equivalent for this in 0.4.0???
<jcater> no
<jcater> that's new
<Varadhan> Oh!!!!!
jbailey (~jbailey@65.48.140.35) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Varadhan> is CVS version stable??? since it was mentioned as *buggy* in the site.. :)
<jcater> eh?
<jcater> well
<jcater> it has its good days and bad days
<jcater> I think it's probably more stable than 0.4.0 at this point, though
<jcater> we are cleaning up for a release
<jbailey> CVS from the 5th seems good enough so far.
<jcater> Varadhan: you can always install the two side-by-side
<jcater> and if cvs causes you problems, you haven't really lost anything
<derek> Varadhan: install the two side by side
<Varadhan> jcater: how???
<derek> and use snapshots
<Varadhan> derek: how???
<jcater> Varadhan: did you install using setup.py ?
<Varadhan> jcater: yes...
<derek> so when i find a cvs sversion that has featuures i need and is stable
<jcater> ok, then you are in good shape :)
<derek> generally i get its tarball
<derek> unload it and install as toolname-date
<derek> but it can be a pain
<derek> seriously i think we are moving to more 'official' releasing
<jcater> Varadhan: we can do one of two things....
<jbailey> Incidentally, folks, I just got my first bug on gnuef.
<derek> where older releases will be back maintained a little bit
<Varadhan> jcater: tell me...
<jbailey> It's a packaging bug, but still - That means people are installing it.
<Varadhan> derek: that seems a good idea...
<derek> jbailey: i think its time for you to leave then ;)
<derek> oh
<jcater> 1. You can grab thge tarball from http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/snapshots.php
<derek> someone submitted it
<jbailey> derek: Nope.  Gnue bugs get handled on weekdays.
<jcater> or
<derek> not you foudn it, you can stay :)
<jcater> 2. If you have "cvs" installed, you can check it out anonymously
<jcater> If you *can* do #2
<jcater> I recommend that
<jcater> as if you hit some bug
<jcater> I can commit a fix for you
<Varadhan> yes i have CVS installed on my machine...
<jcater> and you only have to do a "cvs update"
<jcater> ok
<jbailey> Varadhan: The folks here have been known to commit fixes within a few minutes of the bug being reported.
<jcater> Varadhan: http://www.gnuenterprise.org/community/cvs.php
<Varadhan> jbailey: :)
<jcater> that wiwll explain it better than I can
<jcater> wiwll = will
<Varadhan> jcater: okay...
<jcater> Varadhan: once you have the repository, change into the gnue directory
<jcater> and run ./setup-cvs.py
<jcater> err
<jcater> sorry
<jcater> run ./setup-devel.py
<jcater> oops
<jcater> I was right the first time
<jcater> anyway
<jcater> that will set up a local copy of the tools (local == for your user)
<jbailey> derek: Is it still the case that there's been no useful updates to DCL since July?
<jcater> that won't interfere with the "official" version
<Varadhan> jcater: i take leave of you all for some time as i have to go for my dinner... will be back in about 30 mins...
<Varadhan> jcater: Oh!!! cool....
<jcater> ok
<jcater> it's sad
<jcater> our cvs installation tool
<jcater> is much more powerful
<jcater> than the "official" version :)
<jbailey> Very sad.
<jbailey> One day you'll see the light and use autoconf. =)
<jcater> no
<jcater> because then we'll have the same issue
<jcater> that prevents us from using setup-cvs.py as the "official"
<Varadhan> jcater: or else lemme do onething... lemme install the cvs-version in some other machine and work from there... will it do???
<jcater> :(
<derek> jbailey: dcl has LOTS of new goodies
<jcater> ya
<jbailey> Shouldn't - just set ./configure --prefix=~/bin
<derek> i just havent tested them all
<jcater> jbailey: last I checked
<jbailey> derek: Well, remember to ping me when it's time to update the package.
<jcater> that failed on Win32
<derek> i hope mdean is around as it might be this weekend
<derek> i had my side pretty much done
<derek> he was fixing new nested product stuff
<jbailey> Cool - What's your integration plan with DCL and the rest of GNUe?
<derek> i know he was close but work might have given him some feature creep
<jbailey> derek: Incidentally, I've been talking with dyfet about some telephony hacking I need to do in the new year.
<derek> jbailey: for right now, my goals are to get it doing some stuff to help with managing consulting operations and gnue
<derek> then start migrating it to gnue
<derek> it already uses GNUe Schema Definitions
<jbailey> Ah, does it?  Cool.
<jbailey> IT would be nice to see an example application in GNUe.
<derek> my production implementation uses GNUe Reports
<derek> i will likely author some reports for it with GNUe Reports and put themin the DCL distro
<derek> there are several gfd's for it
<derek> gnue-sb is the sample application
<jbailey> Cool.
<derek> its coming to a Debian Distro near you soon
<jbailey> *lol*
<derek> jcater is hacking on gsd stuff today which will position me to haul butt on implementation
<jbailey> Cool.
<jbailey> Like I said, lemme know when you want a DCL update done.
<jbailey> (Or any of the GNUe suite)
<derek> cool
<derek> hey how do you read encrypted mail?
<jbailey> unencrypt it.
<jbailey> Silly.
<derek> someone sent me gpg signed and encrypted mail
<derek> but i get error
<jbailey> Are you sure it was encrypted with your key?
<derek> gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
<jbailey> That shouldn't fail it.

<derek> brb
<jbailey> You'd notice if it were the property. =)
<derek> hmm the girls have locked their little brother in their play house

ariel_ (~ariel@ppp-217-133-243-31.dialup.tiscali.it) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> ra3vat: master/detail is parent/child
<derek> i.e. key relationships
<derek> table
<derek> invoice
<derek> --------------
<derek> id
<derek> number
<derek> date
<derek> payee
<derek> blah
<derek> table
<derek> invoice_item
<derek> --------------
<derek> id
<derek> invoice_id
<derek> item
<derek> qty
<derek> amount
<derek> blah
<derek> the parent is invoice, the child is invoice_item
<derek> the key is
<derek> invoice.id <-> invoice_item.invoice_id
<derek> if you select in the 'parent' data source
<derek> invoice 13232
<derek> then the child datasource will auto query invoice_item to only give you invoice_items with the invoice_id of 13232
<derek> i hope that makes sense
<ra3vat> shouls i put child block inside parent?
<ra3vat> <block name="parent"><block name="child"></block></block>  
<derek> um i dont
<ra3vat> for this to work?
Action: derek isnt sure result you would get
<derek> you need only to have the widgets you want to use the block in the block you need not nest the blocks
<derek> iirc
Action: derek has never tried to nest them
<derek> jcater could answer whether that woudl work
<derek> generally i do
<jcater> blocks aren't meant to be nested
<jcater> I really don't know what would happen
<derek> <block name="parent">
<derek>   <entry>
<jcater> but I wouldn't recommend trying :)
<derek>   <entry>
<derek> </block>
<derek> <block name="child">
<derek>   <entry>
[11:19] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<derek> </block>
<ra3vat> how blocks will know they related? by datasources assigned to them?
<derek> the fields need not be in sequence
<derek> yeah
<ra3vat> how to assign that relationship in datasources?  i only did it for dropdown box
<derek>    <block name="blckAddress" datasource="dtsrcaddress">
<derek> is a block
<derek>   <datasource prequery="" master="dtsrcPerson" database="gnue"
<derek>               name="dtsrcAddress" table="address" masterlink="id" detaillink="personid"/>
<derek> is its corresponding datasource
<derek> as you can see address is a chiled of person
<derek> the key is id and personid
<derek> so
<derek> person.id <-> address.personid
<derek> btw this is straight from gnue/forms/sample/track/forms/contact_manager.gfd
<derek> that form likely wont work with newest cvs (i will fix it up soon)
<ra3vat> thanks, will try that now
<derek> but the datasource stuff shsould still be pretty valid
Action: derek thinks you can define parent child stuff in the blocks as well, but i havent done it that way
<jcater> no, not since 0.0.x series
<ra3vat> i was trying to do that via trigger modifying code a little, may be it is possible to achieve via master/detail but i have a questions anyway
<jcater> you don't really have to use many triggers to get functionality out of forms
<jcater> triggers will usually be for special validation
<jcater> or such similar polish
<ra3vat> code in block.initQuery() block.processQuery() and many other methods walk through ... for block in self._form._blockList:
<jcater> gack
<ra3vat> is it OKay or should be moved to form object or other
<jcater> I guess if it works, it works
<jcater> I don't know what you're doing
<ra3vat> i'm looking into code :)
<ra3vat> process through list of blocks is not a business of block object (remember that damn business thing?)
<derek> ra3vat: i have found jcater is accurate
<derek> forms internals does most DATA work
<derek> usually you only need triggers to validate data
<derek> or do spiffy polish type things
<ra3vat> <ra3vat> is it possible to have several blocks on one page and perform query on that blocks separately?
<ra3vat> <ra3vat> so i can get resultset in one of them, walk through and via on-Switch trigger update related info in other block
<ra3vat> <ra3vat> for now query (initQuery?) in any block clears all page
<ra3vat> <jamest> not in the current code base
<ra3vat> i was going from that

<jcater> but I'm only here for a sec and can'
<jcater> t work up a demo of the latter
<jcater> ra3vat: what was your ??
<jcater> "when will the dev guide be finished?"
<jcater> :)
<ra3vat> jcater: for your desert if i put order_by="date desc" it constart sql like "select date desc,<all other fields> from table ..." and fail
<Varadhan> jcater: ok...
<jcater> ah, bugger
<Varadhan> jcater: how do i access the result of the query???
<ra3vat> result = Datasource.sql("select max(field1) from table1")?
<Varadhan> ok...
Action: chillywilly was going to suggest that but did not want to chance being wrong and looking stupid ;)
Action: ajmitch thinks '?' keyboard repeat should be turned off :)
<chillywilly> ??????????????????????
<chillywilly> yea, I guess it is kinda annoying ;)
<Varadhan> what should i need to do to create a field with a sequence attached to it???
<jcater> ra3vat: can you update CVS and try again?
<jcater> Varadhan: what do you mean "Sequence attached to it"
<jcater> you mean you want it autopopulated with a sequence before an insert or such?
<Varadhan> jcater: yes...
<Varadhan> something like autogeneration of values...
<jcater> you'll want to put a Pre-Insert trigger on that field
<jcater> and have the text of the trigger be:
<jcater> if self.isEmpty(): 
<jcater>   self.autofillBySequence('your_seq_name')
<jcater> iirc at least
<Varadhan> Ok
<Varadhan> what do you mean by "iirc"?
<jcater> if I recall correctly
<Varadhan> Oh!
<Varadhan> ;)
<ra3vat> updating
<lupo_> bye ppl
lupo_ (~lupo@pD9E6875F.dip.t-dialin.net) left #gnuenterprise.
<Varadhan> jcater: in the SimpleQuery method, the argument is given as "dictionary".  What does a "dictionary" mean?
<ra3vat> Varadhan: http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?String=exact&Acronym=iirc&Find=Find
<Varadhan> ok
<chillywilly> Varadhan: a python dictionary type?
<Varadhan> chillywilly: yes...
<jcater> SimpleQuery?
Action: chillywilly throws the python tutorial at Varadhan
<ra3vat> jcater:   File "/usr/local/src/cvs/gnue/gnue/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/common/GDataSource.py", line 103
<ra3vat>     if field[-5:].lower() = 'desc':

<ra3vat> SyntaxError: invalid syntax
<jcater> ah, bugger
<jcater> again
<ra3vat> :)
<jcater> ra3vat: I will fix in cvs
<jcater> but all that needs is an extra =
<jcater> :)
<jcater> ok, committed
Action: jcater hopes that was the only typo
<jcater> Varadhan: where are you seeing "SimpleQuery" ?
<ra3vat> what is my preferred editor? cvs up :)
<chillywilly> the bane of interpreted languages?
<chillywilly> typos?
<jcater> ra3vat: lol
<Varadhan> jcater: dev guid...
<Varadhan> jcater: dev guide...
<jcater> oh, ok
<jcater> I imagine it's expecting some field keys for the query
<jcater> e.g.
<jcater> simpleQuery(  {'id': 123} )
<chillywilly> jcater: you could fix those types of errors with syntax highlighting ;)
<jcater> would translate into select .... from .... where id = 123;
<chillywilly> er, avoid
<jcater> chillywilly: actually, I currently have syntax highlighting turned on
<jcater> didn't help
<chillywilly> use emacs ;)
<chillywilly> j/k
<chillywilly> oh ell
<chillywilly> well
<Varadhan> jcater: ok
<Varadhan> jcater: is it possible to use a field without defining it in the block tag???
<jcater> yes
Action: jcater is looking
<Varadhan> jcater: how?
<jcater> <datasource name="mydatasource" explicitfields="otherfield1,otherfield2">
<jcater> would pull in otherfield1 and otherfield2 even if not referenced as an entry
<Varadhan> Oh!!.. then, can i use them directly, i mean, without prefixing page_name.block_name etc to it???
<jcater> I'm not sure about that
<Varadhan> ok...
<ra3vat> Varadhan: block_name.otherfield or self.otherfield (i have trigger defined inside block) might work
<Varadhan> ok..
<ra3vat> jcater: now i'm getting initial error 
<ra3vat> Error: Error while communicating with datasource.
<ra3vat>        ERROR:  parser: parse error at or near "desc"
<ra3vat> SELECT num desc,num,origdate,sernum,issue,model,vendor_id,org_id,id FROM reclaims WHERE ((1 = 0)) ORDER BY num desc
<jcater> gack
<jcater> why didn't that work?
<jcater> bugger
<jcater> I see what I did
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> it's committed
<jcater> you know the drill
Action: jcater hopes it works this time
<ra3vat> jcater: now it works, thanks
<Varadhan> is it possible to put a pre-insert trigger on an entry field? if so, what is the syntax?
<chillywilly> there is a pre-insert trigger, iirc
<jcater> Varadhan: you should be able to
<chillywilly> dunno about the syntax, but I bet that nifty guide says smething about it ;)
<jcater> it should be no different than the block-level syntax
<Varadhan> jcater: but the <entry> tag doesn't have any "trigger" attribute.. :(
<jcater> ah
<jcater> it works like this
<jcater> <entry ....?
<jcater> err
<jcater> <entry ....>
<jcater>   <trigger type="Pre-Insert">
<jcater>     Your Code Here
<jcater>   </trigger>
<jcater> </entry>
<Varadhan> Oh!!! thanx...
<jcater> that's how it works with everything, except buttons
<Varadhan> so, this trigger is only for that particular entry....
Action: jcater needs to ask jamest why buttons don't work that way
<jcater> Varadhan: yes
<Varadhan> jcater: i got it...
<ra3vat> jcater: moving to first-last record described in menu as Shft+Up Shft+Down but actually Ctrl+Up Ctrl+Down works
<jcater> ok
<ra3vat> is it correct or may be my mistake with translations?
<jcater> I think it was incorrect on the menu
<jcater> I fixed it
Action: ra3vat arms his editor again
<ra3vat> should be corrected via i18n procedure also
Action: derek is back (gone 02:55:06)
<Varadhan> jcater: just received an exception when trying to insert some records... can i paste the exception message here???
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> what does your trigger look like?
<jcater> can you paste the <entry> .... </entry> 
<jcater> ?
<Varadhan> sure...
<Varadhan>           <trigger type="PRE-INSERT"><![CDATA[
<Varadhan>                 if self.isEmpty():
<Varadhan>                         self.autofillBySequence('accno_acc_holder')
<Varadhan>           ]]></trigger>
<Varadhan> oops...
<derek> um was going to say somethign clever but i forgot
Action: derek is away: more soccer fun
<ra3vat> jcater: one more from backlog
<ra3vat> <ra3vat> my problem with changes in the detail block is gone but there is interesting thing i would like anyone to confirm
<ra3vat> <ra3vat> if i paste something in entry by mouse it is only looks like it is pasted but i was unable to edit even commit that info
<ra3vat> <ra3vat> any testers?
<jcater> ra3vat: yeah, known bug
<jcater> for some reason, when you use the mouse to paste
<jcater> wx never generates an event
<jcater> so we never know it happened
<jcater> :(
<jcater> we're still chasing that one down
<jcater> Varadhan: what was that oops for?
<jcater> did you figure it out?
<Varadhan> yeah.. i thought i resolved it.. but i was resulted with...
<Varadhan> DB000:     object = self.xmlElements[name]['BaseClass']()
<Varadhan> DB000:   File "/usr/local/gnue/lib/python/gnue/forms/GFForm.py", line 53, in __init__
<Varadhan> DB000:     GRootObj.__init__(self)
<Varadhan> DB000: TypeError: __init__() takes exactly 4 arguments (1 given)
<Varadhan> where am i going wrong???
<ra3vat> jcater: is it the same cause that i hit one entry by mouse and it looks selected but edit goes into previos?
<jcater> ra3vat: I think so
<ra3vat> ok
<jcater> Varadhan: eek
<jcater> you do have the trigger as a child of <entry> right?
<jcater> it;s within that set of tags
<jcater> it appears that it's outside of your <form> tag even
<Varadhan> jcater: yeah... i got it corrected.. it is working now...
<Varadhan> tell me onething... if i keep the designer open when i run the gnue-forms, will it pose any problem??
<jcater> it shouldn't
<Varadhan> Ok..
<Varadhan> jcater: will the following trigger insert records properly???
<Varadhan>   <trigger name="signup_trg" type="NAMED"><![CDATA[
<Varadhan>         form.New_account.blk_acc_holder.newRecord()
<Varadhan> 	form.New_account.blk_bank_accounts.newRecord()

<Varadhan>   ]]></trigger>
<jcater> I'm not sure what you're doing there?
<Varadhan> actually, i have to insert records to two different tables...
<Varadhan> but, only to the first table (acc_holder) the records are getting added... 
<Varadhan> the abovesaid trigger will be fired when you press a button to create the records...

<Varadhan> siesel: actually, i have to insert records to two different tables...
<Varadhan> siesel: but, only to the first block (acc_holder) the records are getting added...
<siesel> no problem, just use the simpleQuery trigger

<siesel> with a dts.insertRecord?
<Varadhan> siesel: no... with block.newRecord()...

<siesel> hmm.
<siesel> there is no master detail relationship between both records right?
<Varadhan> you are right... no master/detail relationship between them...

<Varadhan> no, lemme try now...
<siesel> btw. you shoud add some print lines, to see if anything is breaking. like 'print "first newrecord"' print 'finished' ...

<IsoosI> G'evenin' aj :)
<ajmitch> hey IsoosI
<ajmitch> what's up?
Nick change: IsoosI -> Isomer
<Isomer> oh, shrug
<Isomer> I was reading the KC last night
<ajmitch> heh
<Isomer> someone was saying that LDAP was insecure and ActiveDirectory is a much better solution
<ajmitch> very very very silly
<ajmitch> seems like i've been quoted in about the last 30 KC's ;)
<Isomer> well, they're obviously missing the point that ActiveDirectory is an implementation LDAP :)
<Isomer> er
<Isomer> of LDAP
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> decided to use GNUe anywhere yet? :)
<Isomer> Not yet
<Isomer> but I'm watching the Small Business stuff closely
<Varadhan>  if i call form.runForm(), it is saying "Attribute Error: runForm".. i am using the latest CVS version... can any1 help me???
<ajmitch> we saw your question before, noone that knows anything seems to be awake
<ajmitch> the lazy beggars are all probably in bed
<Varadhan> ufff....
<Varadhan> do you use gnue tools???
<Isomer> ajmitch: they appear to have some fascination with this whole sleeping thing :)
<ajmitch> yes
<ajmitch> i use GNUe stuff
<ajmitch> 'form' might not be a GFClient instance or derivative thereof
<Varadhan> yes.. but in D-G.pdf, it has been mentioned that if i want to invoke another form within a form, i can use form.runForm...
<ajmitch> try runForm("form-file-name", params) without the 'form.' prefix
<ajmitch> i haven't done much with forms lately
<ajmitch> Isomer: what small biz stuff are you interested in?
<ajmitch> i think most NZ businesses are small :)
<Varadhan> yeah... thanks ajmitch... its working...
<Varadhan> thanx a lot...
<ajmitch> cool
<Varadhan> btw, how can i trap the selection change event of a drop-down box????
<ajmitch> hmm
Action: ajmitch doesn't know
<Isomer> ajmitch: Customer contact, stock management are both kinda important I think
<ajmitch> Isomer: small biz accounting is what i want to work on this summer :)
<Isomer> Neat!
<ajmitch> yeah, in past KCs you might have seen FTBA mentioned
<Isomer> yeah a li'l :)
Action: ajmitch has been quoted in KC 1,2,4,10,13-16,23-30,32-34,36-54 ;)
<ajmitch> i must spend far too much time here
<Isomer> heh
<ra3vat> hi all
<ajmitch> hi ra3vat
<ra3vat> Varadhan: why do you need to trap it? is not master/detail do the work?
<ra3vat> hi ajmitch
<ajmitch> ra3vat: depends, you might want to do extra stuff on selection
<ajmitch> i think esands was asking about opening forms from a combo box selection
<ajmitch> oh beautiful, someone fixed the property dialog bug :)
Action: ajmitch is reading the KC
<ra3vat> ajmitch: that's why i asking. i was taught yesterday not to be that trigger nazi and master/detail solved most of the thing for me :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<Varadhan> ra3vat: i need to fetch other values of the record on selecting the drop-down value..
<Varadhan> ra3vat: something like, i have a list of "ids"... on-selection of a 'id' i have to fetch values for other columns...
<Varadhan> ra3vat: can you give me an example for Datasource.simpleQuery???
<ra3vat> i did not use it yet
<Varadhan> ra3vat: is that "sql" stuff working???
<Varadhan> ra3vat: can i get some time of yours to look into my problem???
<ra3vat> i did not use it. my demo has a few related tables that use master/detail and it work well 
<Varadhan> by defining foreign keys in table definitions???
<ra3vat> Varadhan: miost probably not now as i'll be out of computer, i'm in a hurry already
<Varadhan> ra3vat: can you do me a favour???
<Varadhan> ra3vat: can you mail me your demo source, so that i can use it as a sample program to code my demo program????
<ra3vat> Varadhan: it is enough that it has unique value and logic relationship
<Varadhan> i have got a primary_key in my table.. and has 3 tables for my demo purpose...
<Varadhan> how do i define logic relationship between them ( i have a common key field in all the three tables...)...
<ra3vat> i can post it but it'd better be cleaned up first for your sake
<ajmitch> for your sanity ;)
<ajmitch> sigh, one problem with the KCs is that my volunteering to write code is on public record '_

<Varadhan> ra3vat: ok.. anyway.. the existing datasource.extensions.gettimestamp() should work... isn't it???
<Varadhan> ra3vat: even that is not working... :(
<Varadhan> ra3vat: anyway... can you pls explain about static data sources???
<ra3vat> your demo is too complicated for me, i do not use that functions. 
<ra3vat> you can fetch that data you need and get/change any values in the entries and that save, why each time you need to address datasource directly?
<Varadhan> ra3vat:  yeah.. you are right, actually i need to fetch *one particular record* based upon a condition... how to do this??
<Varadhan> ra3vat: i have suppressed the *MENUBAR* and *TOOLBAR*.. :)
Action: drochaid is back (gone 10:28:42)
<ra3vat> Varadhan: are you able to fetch all data? 
<ra3vat> forms done for user interaction, will it be user who decide what should be fetched?
<Varadhan> ra3vat: if i put "pre-query"="y", i am able to fetch all the data...
<Varadhan> ra3vat: yes.. user decides what to fetch...
<Varadhan> ra3vat: do you have time... if so, i will mail you the tar of my demo... just help out.. pls..
<ra3vat> if so unsuppress menubar :) and you will find that hit f8 let you start query, then you input what you want to find, then hit f9
<ra3vat> and all is done
<Varadhan> ra3vat: hmmm...
<ra3vat> Varadhan: i'll be out for about 2 hours your first mail did not even come
<Varadhan> ra3vat: yeah.. it returned back to me saying "unable to deliver"... :(
<Varadhan> ra3vat: could you tell me how "f8" and "f9" are working???
<Varadhan> ra3vat: is it possible to simulate "f8" and "f9" programatically, without actually asking the user to do so!!!

<Varadhan> can any one explain this???
<ra3vat> Varadhan: this select returns 0 rows and only needed to initialize datasource with empty record, jamest explained me that yesterday, you can use backlog to find exact wording
<Varadhan> from where i get the backlog???

<reinhard> culture club has issued another single
<jbailey> You're kidding?
<reinhard> actually a remake of an old hit of them
<reinhard> "GNU you really want to Hurd me?"

<jbailey> I had to listen to over an hour of "Do you really want to hurt me?" last night.
<jbailey> oh dear.
<reinhard> jbailey: j/k
<jbailey> That's what we need...  A hurd tribute album. =)
<jbailey> But it was frightnening.  I was eating dinner on a patio, and the restaurant next door has a CD on culture club on that was skipping.

<lupo> siesel: i'm very sorry that i missed you on oct 31st
<siesel> yes, its echt schade.
<siesel> you've looked at the Halloween documents?
<lupo> yep
<lupo> something specific to free erp software?
<lupo> btw, eric raymond has smashed the FSF in that paper
<siesel> lupo: sorry I meant the Halloween "MAIL"s on the gnue-dev list
<lupo> ah
<lupo> :)
<lupo> yep
<lupo> i like number 5
Action: siesel hasn't decided yet, which one is the best :)
<siesel> btw. do you have any ideas about stuff missing?
<lupo> nope
<lupo> i'm quite overworked with the load of information
<siesel> hehe
<lupo> do you see a chance for an easy-to-use editor for mappings?
<siesel> ra3vat: static datasource fixed.
<siesel> you mean integrator file format?
<siesel> if you speak of integrator, yes
<lupo> siesel: this is integrator stuff?
<siesel> which mappings are you refering to?
<lupo> http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue-dev/2002-November/000322.html
<siesel> Varadhan: the date time format send to the database is defined in: common/src/dbdrivers/_dbsig/DBdriver.py L 238
<siesel> Varadhan: it would be the best if you add a line " self._dateTimeFormat="'%c'"   to the file common/src/dbdrivers/oracle/DBdriver.py for your early testing.
<siesel> Varadhan: the next step would be to add an option for that in a configfile 
<siesel> lupo: thats integrator stuff. mapping 1+ datasource/s into 1+ datasource/s
<siesel> I thought of an editor with a view on a gsd file (or a real database schema) on the left side, and the same for the right side, and then you can draw lines between them

<ajmitch> howsit going?
<nickr> Excelently!
<nickr> well pretty good
<nickr> hee
<ajmitch> great
<nickr> et toi?
<ajmitch> i myself am doing quite well
<nickr> excellent
<ajmitch> now that i have returned from work, it is about time i do GNUe hackering

<nickr> Yes, gnue hackering
<SachaS> hi ajmitch, still not coming to Perth for the Australian Linux Conference in January 2003?
<ajmitch> nope
<ajmitch> costs to much to go to perth
<SachaS> free accomodation in my house!
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> would be nice, especially as rhys from dotgnu is talking
<wayneg> dont virgin fly from nz ??? should get one pretty cheap if you book it now 
<ajmitch> the problem is that i can't afford to have the time off work
<wayneg> arrr
Action: ajmitch is approximately broke at the moment :)
<SachaS> what a shame
Action: jcater is exactly broke at the moment
Action: wayneg is a student ... so i know how that feels ... i'm in a permanent state of broke
Action: ajmitch is also a student
<jcater> hmm
<ajmitch> i'm approximately broke, in that i have available money, but that's just credit card ;)
Action: jcater misses such simple excuses for being broke
<wayneg> haha
<jcater> now, with a family, several mortgages, etc
<jcater> my reason is much more complicated
<jcater> just the outcome is the same
<ajmitch> hehe yeah
<ajmitch> how's the bookstore going?
<jcater> oh, just another part of the complication
<ajmitch> that's the wife's, right?
<jcater> it's cool
<jcater> it's taking a while to get "in" with the area
<jcater> each week is better than the previous
<jcater> but still not covering expenses
<ajmitch> was thinking today about a simple form - a timesheet form, that can be linked in with payroll & invoicing
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> simple timesheets just have hours worked, and on what jobs - should be simple enough to link these with invoices & payroll
<ajmitch> for gnue-sb
<jcater> cool
<jcater> that's derek's area
<jcater> or I would offer advice, praise, etc :)
<jcater> anyone have a win32 machine handy?
<jcater> with python
<jcater> ?
<ajmitch> nope
<ajmitch> got a win32 forms driver to test or something? :)
<jcater> actually
<jcater> I'd like someone to open a console session
<jcater> startup python
<jcater> and do an "import curses"
Action: jcater is curious if that'll work
<ajmitch> on win32?
<jcater> yeah
Action: ajmitch doesn't have his sole win32 box running
<jcater> I assumed it wouldn't
<jcater> but the more I think about it
<jcater> maybe I shouldn't assume
<ajmitch> besides, it's a 486 with win95 ;)
<jcater> as it's not listed under "Posix-related modules"
<jcater> on the python doc page
<jcater> and I do fondly remember the ansi.sys stuff in DOS :)
<jcater> so you never know :)
<jcater> ouch
<jcater> 486 w/win95
<ajmitch> 8mb ram
<jcater> S&M freak, eh?
<ajmitch> i was given it
<ajmitch> and never use it
<jcater> grrrr
<jcater> I'm glad we're one of the top python projects
<jcater> but it gets SOOO frustrating
<ajmitch> how so?
<jcater> when I'm googling for help
<jcater> and links to our discussions come up
<ajmitch> hehe
<jcater> it almost always happens w/wx-related stuff
<jcater> and now it's happening with python + curses
<ajmitch> yep

<ajmitch> looks like some interesting stuff going into cvs for forms & designer?
<ajmitch> hmm, more stuff being put in common, actually :)
<jcater> stuff for gnue-sb
<jcater> err
<jcater> stuff missing for gnue-sb :)
Action: jcater is back in curses mode for the rest of the night though
<jcater> unless derek comes back in
<nickr> curses!
<jcater> if so, I never said that
<jcater> mdean!
<ajmitch> anything been put into gnue-sb cvs yet?
<jcater> you kick ass!
<ajmitch> huh?
<jbailey> jcater: I was at work and wanting to know if I should do a new CVS pull for Gnue packages.
<jbailey> I'll fix them on Thursday or so when I'm thinking about it again.
<jcater> he fixed an annoyance I had w/DCL :)
<ajmitch> ah :)
<jcater> jbailey: hmmm
<jcater> the funny thing about being deep in programming wrt gnue
Action: ajmitch pulls up the KC to see what people wanted from CSV
<jcater> is I'm not sure what's happened with it since your last package
<ajmitch> hehe
<jbailey> You guys don't seem to maintain ChangeLogs =)
<jcater> we run cvs2cl prior to a release
<ajmitch> cvs2cl ;)
<jbailey> Does sdist do that automatically?
<jcater> no
<jcater> but that's not a bad idea
<jcater> we could add it
<jbailey> That and the man page generation. =)
<jcater> that is a little tougher
<jcater> but needs to be done too :)
<jbailey> But I think jamest promised me that one. =)
Nick change: jcater -> jamest
<jamest> I'll handle that cvs2cl thing too

<ajmitch> jbailey: that's one thing i don't like about the KCs
<ajmitch> psu records when i volunteer for something & publishs it for the world to see :)
<jcater> ajmitch: how do you think I feel!
<ajmitch> heh
<jcater> sometimes I feel like I need to change my nick
<ajmitch> has anyone thought of producing a visual class hierachy for gnue?
Nick change: jcater -> OffTheRecord
<OffTheRecord> like this
<ajmitch> to see how classes are related?
Nick change: OffTheRecord -> jcater
<jbailey> The next kc will be code named "you can run but you cannot hide"
<jcater> I think ra3vat has to get the headquote this week
<jcater> with his
<jcater> "cvs update is my favorite editor"
<jcater> or something like that
<ajmitch> :)
<jcater> although the KCs aren't done in a democratic process
<jcater> those darn brits
<ajmitch> hmm, there is a lot of useless cruft that i don't need in a csv driver
<ajmitch>   def _beginTransaction(self):
<ajmitch>     try:
<ajmitch>       self._dataConnection.begin()
<jcater> lol
<ajmitch> that's pretty useless when self._dataConnection is just a simple object
<jcater> I'd expect to see
<jbailey> Hmm.  That reminds me that I'm supposed to demo forms tommorow. 
<jcater> $ grep -c pass  csv/DBdriver.py 
<jcater> 55
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> how'd you guess i was doing that? ;)
<ajmitch>   def getSchemaTypes(self):
<ajmitch>     return [('view','View',1), ('table','Table',1)]
<ajmitch> what types should i have?
<ajmitch> present a single table?
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> that'd be best I imagine
<ajmitch> k
<ajmitch> in connections.conf, i have dbname, for the filename, and directory
<ajmitch> might as well just let dbname be filename, and drop the directory part
<jcater> probably
<jcater> oooo
<ajmitch> ooo?
<jcater> be sure to use common's FileUtils.openResource()
<jcater> well
<ajmitch> ah that'd be good
<jcater> shiit
<jcater> err
<jcater> shoot
<jcater> that won't work if you plan to have writable csv files
<ajmitch> ok
Action: ajmitch doesn't know the limitations of common's stuff
<ajmitch> does common have decent docstrings in each class?
<jcater> define decent
<jcater> nevermind
<jcater> doesn't matter how you define it
<jcater> the answer is "probably not"
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> i imagine that GNUe's docs are lacking in some areas for people like me
<ajmitch> your developers guide is good, but i want to know about what common offers :)
<ajmitch> how to write db drivers, etc
<jcater> we have a few technotes
<jcater> now
<jcater> I'm not sure if any are relevant to that or not
<jcater> but those are in doc/technotes/
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> technotes are good, i might look at writing up some other stuff if i get time & motivation :)
Action: ajmitch looks at importing webware's doc mess :)

<ariel_> reinhard: are you still working on proposal or can i add more stuff?
<btami> jamest: i'v tried before 
<jamest> btami: really?  did it work or bomb?
<btami> work
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> did it work better than the wx driver?
<jamest> the wx driver on windows sucks
<jamest> read (our code not the wx code :)
<btami> gtk2 driver isn't full featured IIRC
<btami> but hasn't got that ugly bugs like
<btami> "focus nightmare" and "tabbed pages" problems
<jamest> btami: how hard is it to get the gtk2 driver running on any platform?
<jamest> i thought it required custom patches to gtk or something
<jamest> so avoided it for now
<btami> i'v tried it only on winXP
<jamest> what was involved?
<btami> just downloaded the necessary stuff from sourceforge
<reinhard> ariel_: i would like to talk a few points to you
<btami> and it worked
<jamest> oooooo, does it require cygwin?
<btami> no
<jamest> do you have a url
<jamest> the only thing I'm finding is gtk 2.0.6 source for windows
<jamest> and talk of using cygwin
<btami> i'm trying to find...
<btami> wait
<btami> sorry, i can't find here, but
<btami> i have all stuff at home

<StyXman> so, geas, jforms and forms.test dissapeared from cvs?
<StyXman> (hi all)_
<btami> jamest: btw. i have a problem with pages and blocks

<btami> StyXman: hi
<btami> i have 1 table with many fields, and
<btami> want use tabbed pages, but with only one datasource and one block
<reinhard> ariel_: sorry my telephone has decided to trout slap me today
<btami> but i failed
<StyXman> can someone confirm that?
<StyXman> btami: I have no similar problems
<btami> wait, i try it again...
<jamest> btami: I don't think it can run with a block spread across pages
<jamest> i can think of at least one point in the code where this would puke (unless someone altered the way navigation worked in my absence)
<btami> huh, i'v tried it now and failed :(
<jamest> StyXman: lemme look
Action: ariel_ is away: busy
<jamest> there was talk about moving projects not being worked on into an archive
<jamest> maybe someone did that over the weekend
<btami> jamest: so what pages are for ?
<jamest> pages are just that pages
<jamest> however they were designed with a block setting inside a page
<jamest> not spread across them
<btami> why ?
drochaid (~drochaid@pc2-kirk1-3-cust16.renf.cable.ntl.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jamest> when I set them up i was following what I remembered about Oracles SQL*Forms
<jamest> this is the way it worked
<jamest> we're talking about doing away with that restriction
<jamest> in fact
<btami> i think pages are to split info , not for "blocks"
<jamest> back
<jamest> have fields display across pages is in the forms TODO
<jamest> the blocks nested inside pages have been around since the start
<jamest> I'm not saying were tied to that idea only that is was the 1st implementation and we've never adjusted it :)
<jamest> what we want to provide is a way to say
<jamest> this field belongs on all pages, or on pages 1, 3 and 5, or on page 1
<jamest> however I wouldn't expect this feature until after 0.5.x series is complete
<jamest> btami: have you seen the feature plans?
<btami> i think we talking diffrerent things
<btami> my problem is:
<btami> jamest: yes
<btami> what to do if i have 1 table with 100 fields
<btami> and want tu use 1 form
<jamest> right now you're going to suffer
<jamest> :)
<jamest> i see the problem
<jamest> honestly
<btami> ok
<btami> :)
<jamest> however i never thought about that size table when I did the page inside block thing
<jamest> a very nasty workaround
<jamest> make a master/detail/detail/detail setup
<jamest> all using the same table
<jamest> it would be ugly to setup, editing would be a major pita
<jamest> is this page limitation going to be a showstopper for you?
<jamest> StyXman: they are definately missing

<derek> and have suggestions or know where a 'compatiability list' is
<nickr> yep
<nickr> any camera with removable media would be preferred
<derek> ooo ooo where where
<nickr> most cameras have remavble media
<derek> yeah i think i want removable media
<nickr> otherwise, you can look at the usb compat list
<nickr> http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/
<derek> well how do i know the removable media is supported?
<nickr> you look at the specs
<nickr> if it supports SmartMedia, SD, MMC, Memory Stick or Compact Flash you're good

<derek> i have 10% off at best buy and they have 12mos no interest on any 299.99 or more
<derek> i know i want something 2mega pixel or more
<derek> 3 megapixel preferred
<derek> the one that seems to fit that bill in the add

<derek> does it work under linux ?
<derek> that is most important to me :)
<nickr> I don't think its a huge issue, but yea, you just need a usb memorystick reader
<derek> the olympus looks sweet but its a bit more than i want to spend
<derek> i would like to be under 400.00

<nickr> $299
<nickr> http://www.bestbuy.com/detail.asp?e=11177736&m=82&cat=83&scat=0
<nickr> hmm, it takes xD Picture Card..
<nickr> I'm not sure what that is
<derek> would you recommend it over the olympus and sony?
<nickr> its cheaper
<jamest> or
<jamest> grab a halfway nice  SRL
<jamest> regular camera and a scanner
<nickr> jamest: traitor
<derek> jamest: scanners under linux suck and its too much work for wife
<derek> jamest: i planned on getting both SRL and Digital
<jamest> you'll save money and the digital images are probably as good
<jbailey> derek: My scanner's been fine and Angies coping with it well.
<jbailey> It integrated very nicely into the Gimp.
<derek> but found that walmart has upload digital to them and they print on paper for .28 a print
<derek> our friend does it and they come out as nice as SRL
<nickr> http://www.bestbuy.com/detail.asp?e=11075241&m=82&cat=83&scat=84 this is the one I have
<derek> so we are going digital only
<derek> as it will be cheaper than buying film and only printing shots we really need in print will save a fortune in processing

<derek> nickr: at that works under linux right. ;)
<nickr> derek: yep!
<jcater> derek: never ask a hacker if something works under linux! 
<jcater> :)
<nickr> either directly with a slight kernel modification or with a CF reader
<nickr> I like CF a lot.
<nickr> slight = adding 1 line to a file and recompiling
<derek> jcater you have a digital
<derek> nickr: i woudl go CF i think
<derek> i assume thats a card reader of sorts
<nickr> CF or SmartMedia are good
<nickr> they are formats
<nickr> readers exist for them
<derek> think looks sweet BUT about twice what i want to spend
<derek> well not want to, can :)
<nickr> hehe
<nickr> its pretty good
<nickr> I have some gripes about image quality in certain conditions
<nickr> I'd rather have a Nikon D100 or Fuji S2
<nickr> someday. :Q)
<derek> http://www.bestbuy.com/detail.asp?e=11102083&m=82&cat=83&scat=84
<nickr> Yea
<nickr> like
<nickr> it probably takes godo pictures and all
<derek> is SD Secure Digital
<nickr> but the UI on the kodak's I've used is TEH SUCH
<nickr> yea
<nickr> * 16MB removable CompactFlash memory card included
<derek> you said xD isnt supported or is questionable
<nickr> I think its somewhat questionable
<derek> ok now to clarify jcaters point
<derek> how hard is it to get SmartMedia/SD/MMC/MemoryStick/CompactFlash to work?
<derek> i.e. i buy the reader 
<derek> and under debian what must i 'really' do
<nickr> modprobe usb-storage
<nickr> plug it in
<nickr> er
<nickr> modprobe scsi-mod and other things.I think in recent installations its already installed
<nickr> plug it in
<nickr> mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
<nickr> wow, hard!
<nickr> pretty much the same for the camera
<nickr> except some require kernel tweaking
<derek> well i might be bugging you later :)
<derek> i have like 2 or 3 scsi devices already in CD's
<derek> what program do you use to download?
<derek> gphoto?
<nickr> they'll just be enumerated higher
<nickr> No
<nickr> because its just a storage device I use cp
<derek> ok so nautilus
<nickr> yea
Action: derek has to get this workign for my wife
<derek> so cp isnt an option :)
<derek> i will use cp :)
<jbailey> derek: I tell you that scanners under linux are fine for non-techies now.
<jbailey> As long as they don't have to set them up at first.
<nickr> scanners are no problem
<nickr> digital photography is easier faster at the cost of quality
<derek> well great i will ask you guys later to help me get my scanner working :)
<derek> but i still will be getting a digital camera
<jbailey> nickr: Concur, but a scanner's nice for other things too.
Action: derek has other uses for scanner
<jbailey> derek: Sure.

<ajmitch> it has unplanned features
<jbailey> "No database drive found for provider type 'psycopg' - It should probably actually give an error message to the screen instead of silently spewing crap to the console.
<jbailey> Is that sort of like unplanned pregnancies?
<ajmitch> nah :)
<jbailey> So now that I'm sitting in designer...
<jbailey> How do I make it work? =)  I've logged into the database this time, but when I right click on the textbox to do a new datasource, nothing happens.
<jamest> easiest way
<jamest> file->new->from wizard
<ajmitch> or emacs file.gfd ;)
<ajmitch> is right-click on form widgets meant to work?
<jamest> i don't think we have right click menus
<jamest> you can dbl click on a widget
<jamest> to get properties box
<jbailey> Hmm.  Can you recommend which wizard for a simple one page form? =)
<jamest> how many tables?
<jbailey> Two, unless postgres supports infinitely long varchars, in which case one. =)
<jamest> it does
<jamest> well
<jamest> type text is limited to 2gb
<jamest> er
<jamest> 2tb
<jbailey> That's fine. =)
<jbailey> Even better!
<jamest> if it's 1 then do simple wizard
<jamest> as it does 1 table
<jbailey> Then one page should be fine.  The database shows no sign of normalization in its source form, so I'm trying to make the conversion easy.
Action: ajmitch thinks designer is looking sexy
<jamest> the simpleDetail will do a single master/detail
<jamest> the formBuilder will do as many tables and pages as you like
<jbailey> Woohoo!  Backtrace!
<jamest> now, you are working from an existing table structure right?
<ajmitch> jamest: think there'd be any chance of a multi-column dropdown?
<jcater> ajmitch: already there
<jbailey> I just created it a few minutes ago in phppgadmin

<jbailey> I got this when I clicked "continue" after giving my form title and picking my connection.
<jamest> it's saying that a query resulting in nothing returned
<jamest> which is wacked in the wizard as it uses pgsql system tables
<jbailey> Lemme exit and start again in case I did something earlier that screwed it up.
<jamest> ok
<jbailey> Into gnue-designer we go. =)
<jbailey> file, new from wizard
<jbailey> simple form.
<jcater> jbailey: oooooo
<jcater> check your psycopg version
<jbailey> Oh, this time it popped up the login box for the database.
<jcater> if it's 1.0.13
<jcater> we have an issue
<jamest> s/we/you

<jcater> yeah
<jbailey> 1.0.13-1
<jcater> boing!
<jbailey> Too old, too new?
<jcater> too new
<jbailey> Joy.
<jcater> either they changed the API
<jcater> or have a serious bug
<jamest> one thing that rocks about having 4 different pgsql drivers
<jcater> given the 1.0.12 -> 1.0.13 change
<jamest> is you have 4 different interpretations of the python db api
<jcater> I couldn't imagine them doing a major API chang
<jbailey> (rocks like good rock and roll, or rocks like sucks rocks soaked in cow piss?)
<jcater> jamest: yeah, but now 5 :)
<jcater> as apparently they changed their interpretation
<jcater> jbailey: I have the 1.0.12-1 debs at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/debian/
<jcater> this sucks though
<jcater> it sucks the rocks socked in cow piss
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> this is newer than woody
<jbailey> Try three, coming up.
<nickr> piss
<jamest> you using testing/sid in production?
<jbailey> this is my workstation.
<jamest> ah
<jbailey> The database is on another computer.
<jbailey> Be and the other guy running Linux here use sid on our desks, though.
<jbailey> EVeryone else will use win32 client or phpforms.
<jbailey> Hot damn this does work better.
<jbailey> And the whole apps isn't as painfully slow, too.
<jbailey> "Incubator import failed" on the desktop window.
<jbailey> The rest of the app appears to be hung.
<jamest> sigh
<jbailey> Oh, it came back.
<jbailey> Is there a good way to make the input boxes more than 0 pixels wide?
Action: derek is back (gone 02:01:18)
<derek> nickr: i went with the kodak.... 
<nickr> derek: GAH
<nickr> derek: after my dire warnings?
<derek> the olympus had sucky interface and felt 'cheap' (with kids thats important issue)
<derek> the sony was very nice
<derek> nice interface
<derek> wife liked it better than kodak interface (though she didnt mind kodak ui)
<derek> kodak was 50 more
<derek> BUT
<derek> it was 4.0 instead of 3.0 megapixels
<nickr> ja
<derek> and it took compact flash insetead of memorystick
<nickr> yea
<derek> and the compact flash was WAY cheaper
<nickr> not really much diff
<nickr> really depends on where you buy it
<derek> i.e. i got the reader and 256mb of flash for cheaper than a 128mb stick
<derek> nickr: yes long term i agree
<derek> but again no interest was a factor
<nickr> they have 128mb sticks for $60 at costco here
<derek> all in all it was up to wife
<ajmitch> hey derek
<derek> she liked both the kodak and the sony
<derek> oh other factor
<ajmitch> jbailey: they're 0 wide in forms or designer, or both? :)
<derek> kodak had builtin batteries (with charger)
<jbailey> DEsigner.
<ajmitch> jbailey: object navigator
<jbailey> But I can't imagine how I am supposed to grab them and drag them around like this. =)
Action: derek also didnt hear your dire warnings
<derek> you said something about good quality but not great interface
<ajmitch> jbailey: object nav is in the tools window
Action: derek hopes that was only yuck
<jbailey> The default width is -5 for these?
<jbailey> woo.
<ajmitch> jbailey: uhh, shouldn't be :)
<ajmitch> you acn right click on things in tree & edit properties
<nickr> derek: it uses AAs no?
<derek> nope CRV3 lithium
<nickr> GAH
<nickr> suck
<derek> gah?
<derek> suck?
<jbailey> There's no 'save' button on the property inspector.
<jbailey> Is that expected?
<derek> jbailey: why woudl there be?
<derek> if you save the form the property selection you have made will be saved
<nickr> getting something that runs on NiMH AAs is great. You get a gew sets on the cheap
<nickr> and a couple chargers
<jbailey> derek: Because when I change the length from -5 to 10 and close the window it doesn't change.
<jbailey> So I can only assume there's a missing 'apply' or 'save' button or something.
<jbailey> Oh, I see.  I had to change 'lenght' & maximum length from -5.
<ajmitch> jcater: i thought that bug where property navigator didn't work with scrollbars on screen was fixed? :)
<jcater> is it not?
<jcater> worked for me
<jcater> (tm)
<ajmitch> jcater: doesn't seem to work here (ran setup-cvs.py a few min ago)
<ajmitch> what is appropriate input mask for date entry? :)
<jbailey> Which element contains the gray box width in the background.
<jcater> BUGGER
<jbailey> It doesn't seem to support a right-click option.
<jbailey> In fact right clicking on the background hangs designer for 10 to 15 seconds.
Action: jcater runs screaming into the street!
Action: ajmitch feels sorry for bringing up that bug
<ajmitch> jcater: when did you commit the fix?
<jcater> it's been a few weeks
<jamest> 0 wide?
<jamest> wtf?
<jbailey> Hmm, at this speed It hink it will take me 2 hours to correct all of the -5 entries to being a reasoable length.  I'll have to do this another time.  Oh well.
<jcater> how did you get -5 sizes?
<jbailey> That's what the wizard did by default.
<jamest> jbailey: the default size is based upon the size reported by the database
<jcater> how fscking bizarre
<jamest> I'm running the 1.0.8 pyscopg from debian
<jamest> woody
<jcater> I use 1.0.12
<jamest> and it's fine
<jamest> hang on
<jamest> jbailey: you have a working mysql setup too?
<ajmitch> so sid's psycopg could be more broken than you think :)
<jamest> as this is not a positive note to end on 
<jbailey> jamest: No, I was concerned that someone said that some queries would silently break without subselects being available.
<jamest> no, query by detail would break
<jamest> that feature is < 1 week old :)
<jbailey> Ah, nice. =)
<jamest> std forms should work fine
<jbailey> Perhaps I'll try it with mysql then in a bit.
<jbailey> I need to do some paperwork and take lunch soon, though.
<jamest> you can also try other postgresql drivers
<jamest> popy, pgsql (postgresql in our connections.conf)

<Chipaca> loveley
<Chipaca> derek: what's supposed to be there?
<derek> um
<derek> a compactflash card on usb
Action: derek is thinking nickr left out some magic step to make usb-storage actually use scsi
<Chipaca> derek: cfdisk /dev/sda
<Chipaca> derek: see if there are partitions there

<Chipaca> derek: unplug and replug the thing, see the logs to check it's not still 'unclaimed'
<derek> plug and replug still says unused
<Chipaca> jamest, jcater: similar to sum() thing, but I don't want to bring in the whole thing from the db, I'd really like the dbdriver to be smart enough to pass the sum on to the db :)

<Chipaca> derek: what did the logs say?
<jcater> Chipaca: pass the sum TO the db?
<Chipaca> derek: is that all of usb? you're missing usb-uci

<Chipaca> derek: uhci
<derek> i didnt see that as an option

<derek> can you provide the logic?
lupo (~lupo@pD95423A1.dip.t-dialin.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<lupo> hi
<derek> so i can understand as i will need to do this on more than one box
<Chipaca> derek: hold on, let me get the names straight
<lupo> anyone of you who also has submitted projects to savannah and got them rejected despite correct copyrights?
<jcater> lupo: yes
<derek> i have rejected projects on savannah despice correct copyrights
<lupo> i ask myself whether this is new savannah policy
<derek> as its more than copyright, license
<lupo> "reject everything"
<ajmitch> heh
<Chipaca> derek: question, are these debian machines?
<lupo> derek: let's assume correct license
<derek> well let me rephrase that, i have rejected 'gnu project applications' even with propery copyright
<ajmitch> complain to savannah-hackers@gnu.org if you feel it's not right :)
<derek> Chipaca: yes
<Chipaca> derek: maybe just installing hotplug will get you rolling
<lupo> savannah-hackers@gnu.org seems to be the problem
<ajmitch> lupo: yes, the volunteers that do the project approval might be overly strict
<derek> Chipaca: removed all usb
<Chipaca> derek: anyhow, you need USB support (usbcore), support for your host controller (usb-uhci, uhci, or usb-ohci), the device type driver (scsi-whatever), the driver for the usb-to-device-type (usb-storage), and possibly the driver for the particular usb device you have if it's not "standard"
<derek> now give me step by step
<Chipaca> derek: apt-get install hotplug
<Chipaca> derek: uninstall the thing before hotplug gets up and running
<Chipaca> derek: plug it back in once it is
<derek> ok so load all modules
<derek> then unplug
<lupo> i have recently submitted an XML-to-Videotext converter and got it rejected despite correct copyright notices
<lupo> and COPYRIGHT file
<derek> then install hotplug
<derek> then plug it back in
Action: ajmitch cries
<Chipaca> derek: no, hotplug should take care of the modules part on its own :)
Action: ajmitch reminds himself not to learn without wizards in the future ;)
Action: Chipaca consoles ajmitch
<derek> oh crap i installed them and am apt-getting hotplu
<derek> will that be a problem
Action: ajmitch swears profusely
<Chipaca> derek: heh, probably not, but you could remove them again just in case :)
Action: Chipaca hands ajmitch a 6-pack
<ajmitch> this probably would have taken 2 minutes with the wizard ;)
<ajmitch> at least i'm learning...
<ajmitch> hah! it worked
<derek> Chipaca: now things are terminally fscked

<lupo> jcater: AAARRRRGGGHHHHLLLLSSSS!
<jcater> um
<jcater> ok
<ajmitch> impressive
<ajmitch> so that resizes the dialog to match?
<jcater> it resized the grid to match the notebook control
<jcater> only we were grabbing the outer dimensions of the notebook
<ajmitch> ok
<jcater> not the inner
<ajmitch> hmm
<derek> jcater: my 3 year old was with her aunt last night
<derek> they were going to in and out burger (a burger joint) at like 11pm
<derek> uncle asked her what she wanted from there
<derek> her response
<derek> "a donut"
<derek> when told they didnt have donuts she said
<derek> "well if they dont have donuts I GUESS i will just have a hamburger and french fries"
<ajmitch> haha
<jcater> rofl
<jamest> how long has jcater been w/ us now?
<jcater> 2 yrs come the new year
<jamest> ok, i'd be worried if it was over 3 years
<Chipaca> derek: that's the problem
<jcater> what?
<jcater> the 3 year old daughter?
<Chipaca> jcater: sorry, that was private :)
<Chipaca> jcater: /me is trying to get derek's usb thing working
<jcater> ah
Action: Chipaca considers the futility
<jcater> well "that's the problem"
<jcater> after the daughter comment
<jcater> made me wonder if you'd traced it
<jcater> to peanut butter in the USB port
<Chipaca> jcater: ROTFL
<lupo> lol
<Chipaca> jcater: peanut butter is nothing
<Chipaca> jcater: you should see dulce de leche in usb slots
<Chipaca> jcater: imagine a runny peanut butter
<derek> its that darn tit shaped bread that is clogging the usb port
<Chipaca> umm
<lupo> jamest: reg testing framework, what are your requirements? how should something look like?
<lupo> is it possible that debian 3 has ruled out python2.1 wxgtk libs?
<lupo> do current gnue tools now work with python2.2 from woody?
<lupo> (or do they still mess with unicode?)

<btami> hi all
<lupo> Chipaca: NY?
Nick change: laurie -> dneighbo
<Chipaca> lupo: or ba, for that matter
<lupo> well
<lupo> that's one of the risks you take
<btami> huhuuu, finally i can stick attachments into DCL tickets (you can see in #159 and #162)
<dsmith> dneighbo: What are you trying to do with usb? (over in #debian)
<dneighbo> kick its fscking teeth in
<dneighbo> thats what im wanting to do with usb :0
<dneighbo> dsmith: basically i have new digital camera
<dneighbo> i was told if i got compact flash i should be pretty good with a reader regardless of camera
<dneighbo> unfortunately the 'reader' isnt working AT ALL
<dneighbo> im game to getting camera or reader to work
<dneighbo> at this point it seems to find the device just istn making it scsi
<dsmith> Hmm. I receently plugged in a usb cdrom burner into my laptop.
<nickr> dneighbo: what device is it?
<nickr> what camera too
<dneighbo> camera Kodak EasyShare DX4900 
<dsmith> dneighbo: You do need scsi enabled in your kernel, and some other stuff too. Not needed are any scsi contollers
<dneighbo> reader: PNY CompactFlash USB card reader
<nickr> ah
<nickr> CF Meudia Shuttle?
<nickr> or Compactflash Reader
<nickr> http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/showdev.php?id=576 
<nickr> hm
<dsmith> dneighbo: You will need CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_* and CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS
<dneighbo> dsmith: with debian?
<dsmith> dneighbo: Yep.
<nickr> dsmith: quiet you
<nickr> http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/showdev.php?id=1318
<nickr> weird
<dneighbo> nickr: so you telling me this reader wont work?
<nickr> dneighbo: Looks that way.
<dneighbo> what about camera
<dsmith> dneighbo: Sorry.
<nickr> dneighbo: see second link
<nickr> says 'supported by gphoto2'
<nickr> which is odd
<dneighbo> why is that odd?
<nickr> gphoto2 IS in unstable though
Action: dneighbo suspects (100 dollar bet) that its supported under gphoto2 only ifyou have the 80 base i refused to buy
<dneighbo> sucky thing is that the reader i got was free
<dneighbo> and part of why i went with this camera over one that took memorystick memory
<dneighbo> i will try gphoto2 directly with camera
<nickr> what the fuck
<nickr> dneighbo: yea, some readers are good (eg usb-storage devices) and some just suck
<dneighbo> OUCH
<Chipaca> this one is an usb-storage, shows up in /proc/scsi/usb-storage, but not in /proc/scsi/scsi
<dneighbo> word to the wise
<dneighbo> if you have a LONG goatee do not get it near the exhuast fan of a pc
<Chipaca> "never plug an usb device into the mains"?
<dneighbo> getting it caught hurts
<Chipaca> oh, THAT
<Chipaca> :)
<dsmith> Ouch!
<nickr> dneighbo: so you don't have a usb cable for the camera itself?
<dneighbo> yeah
<dneighbo> im downloading gphoto2 now
<nickr> yea you don't or yes you do?
<nickr> you need gtkam also
jamest (~jamest@leibniz.math.ksu.edu) left #gnuenterprise.
<nickr> gphoto2 doesn't have a graphical interface
<dneighbo> yeah i do
<dneighbo> no gui, ouchie
<dneighbo> gtkam
<dneighbo> ok getting that too
Action: dneighbo REALLY hopes i can get something easy for wife to use
<dneighbo> or im having to install windows :(
<jcater> rofl
Action: jcater thinks its funny
<dneighbo> i dont
<jcater> you think it'll work under windows
<dneighbo> jcater: thats the problem
Action: jcater HATES setting up digital cameras for friends
<dneighbo> its an illusion
<nickr> gtkam has a gimp plugin too
<dneighbo> it will install and work
<jcater> on their win32 machines
<dneighbo> but then will stop in 2 days
<jcater> dude
<dneighbo> and be irrevocably fixable
<jcater> you'll smack me for this
<jcater> but you need to get your wife a mac
<jcater> and be done with it
Action: jcater hides
Action: Chipaca smacks jcater
<lupo> ?
<dsmith> os X mac
<dsmith> good
<dneighbo> libgtk2.0-0 l
<dneighbo> jcater: if i had money i would consider it
<dneighbo> she has habits of a mac user
<dneighbo> i.e. artsy stuff
<Chipaca> jcater: would the mac be for when you push her out in the rain due to her ridiculous demands wrt computers?
<dneighbo> wants to print cards and photos and stuff
<dsmith> mac, definitly
<dneighbo> guess im getting gtk2 :)
<jcater> I can see the switch commercial now
<dsmith> It's all FreeBSD now
<jcater> "My husband used to make me us Linux"
<dsmith> Sort of.
<jcater> "But now I just plug my digital camera in"
<jcater> "And it just works"
<jcater> "Sort of"
<nickr> hah I was wondering why gtkam was running so slow
<jcater> "Well, 90% of the time"
<jcater> "But it's much cooler"
<nickr> and It turns out that I'm running it remoteely over the cable modem
<nickr> from my home machine
<nickr> the wonders of remote desktop.
<jcater> "I'm Laurie.... and I switched"
<jcater> then there's derek's switch
<jcater> "My name is Derek"
<nickr> and I broke it.
<jcater> "I used to put my wife on a linux computer"
<jcater> "But the couch got too uncomfortable at night"
<jcater> "Now my back doesn't hurt in the morning"
<jcater> "And I get nookie again"
<dneighbo> ok gtkam and gphoto2 installed
<dneighbo> any tips
<jcater> "That's why I switched"
<nickr> dneighbo: gtkam, add camera
<nickr> dneighbo: select camera model from list
<nickr> er, you should probably make sure its plugged into the usb
<nickr> before
<dneighbo> hmm its plugged in but its not finding it
<dneighbo> is there way to view usb devices
<Chipaca> dneighbo: mount usbdevfs /proc/bus/usb -t usbdevfs
<dneighbo> hot damn it shows in usbview!
<dneighbo> snot
<nickr> dneighbo: detect in add camera doesn't find it?
<dneighbo> it autodected it
<dneighbo> nickr: it does now
<dneighbo> i started hotplug
<nickr> sweet
<dneighbo> unplugged and replugged
<dneighbo> and it seems to be working
<dneighbo> now to try to get images :)
<dneighbo> ok 
<dneighbo> this is EASIER than windows
<dneighbo> gtkam + hotplug
<nickr> yea
<dneighbo> is a 30 second setup
<nickr> incredible.
Action: dneighbo kicks all small children and dogs in sight
<Chipaca> dneighbo: usbdevfs mounted? or without that?
<nickr> hotplug automatically mounts that I think.
<dneighbo> Chipaca: not mounted
<ajmitch> lol
<Chipaca> nickr: not for dneighbo, it doesn't :)
<dneighbo> well at least not manually
<ajmitch> so now it's working? :)
<dneighbo> yip
<dneighbo> direct from camera
<nickr> sweet
<dsmith> When I plugged in that usb cdrom burner, it just worked.  cdrecord found it with no problems whatever.
<dneighbo> the kodak dx4900 is supported on debian :)
Action: ajmitch only has one usb device he relies on absolutely
<dneighbo> nickr: you mentioned a gimp something
<dsmith> But it took hours and hours to get it to work under windows.
<ajmitch> i _have_ to have usb for my internet connection :)
<nickr> dneighbo: gtkam-gimp
<ajmitch> so the free reader thing is no good? :)
<nickr> I'll sell you my extar one, all you have to do is bend the little pins back into place
<nickr> :O
<dneighbo> must one be root?
<nickr> you can adjust something or other and not have to be
<nickr> or you can make a launcher that uses sudo with no password
<nickr> teehee
<dneighbo> hmm second option sounds good
<dneighbo> i need to look into sudo
<nickr> its probably better to fix the perms
<nickr> because then the gimp plugin will work right
<nickr> and you won't have random files owned by root

<jcater> (the last article on that page)
<dneighbo> how do you get the gimp plugin to work?
<Chipaca> what's a generic name for IOU-type documents?
<Chipaca> dneighbo: apt-get install task-universe
<ajmitch> an excuse to visit people & demand money?
<Chipaca> in spanish they'd probably be 'obligations'
<ajmitch> be sure to take along a baseball bat :)
<nickr> dneighbo: dunno.
<Chipaca> I mean the legal IOUs that you sign and are upholdable in court
<nickr> dneighbo: ah, its only for gimp1.3
Action: ajmitch does not know
<nickr> dneighbo: so it'll be in gimp if you run gimp1.3
<nickr> gimp1.3 has certain ... instabilities though.
<jcater> Chipaca: contract? loan?
<Chipaca> jcater: it's less than those
<dneighbo> well i have 1.3
<dneighbo> how do i use it :)
<nickr> are you running gimp-1.3
<dneighbo> head in ass
<dneighbo> no
<dneighbo> i installed it
<dneighbo> but gimp runs 1.2 not 1.3
<nickr> yea, run gimp-1.3
<ajmitch> gimp-1.3
<dneighbo> yah starting now
<nickr> wow, this is slow over a remote connection
<dneighbo> btw: battery TYPE 
<dneighbo> 1.2 AA Ni-MH batteries 
<dneighbo> isnt that what you suggested?
<nickr> yea
<dneighbo> cool
<dneighbo> it can use that or CRV3
<dneighbo> ok gimp 1.3 up but not seeing readily how to get to gtkam
<nickr> you'd think it'd be under Acquire
<dneighbo> thats what i thought
<dneighbo> but dont see it tere
<nickr> I don't see it anywhere, hmm
<nickr> maybe you neude to run gtkam first and save the settings under the user that runs gimp also
lupo (~lupo@pD95423A1.dip.t-dialin.net) left irc: "using sirc version 2.211+KSIRC/1.1"
<dneighbo> hmmmm
<dneighbo> i ran gtkam and gimp both as root
<dneighbo> its ok gtkam should be enough
<nickr> hmm
<nickr> okay
<dneighbo> although my camera saves images at like 2644x something huge
<dneighbo> almost crashed X viewing them
<nickr> yea, they are big
<nickr> unless you're doing something exquisitly silly, it shouldn't crash X though.
<nickr> but look who I'm talking to
<ajmitch> heh
<Chipaca> "obligation" it is! (webster 1913, # 5)
<nickr> In Other News, I want to make a list of requirements for my revised docustore design. Any help?
<dneighbo> yeha
<Chipaca> dneighbo: apt-get install feh
<nickr> dneighbo: hm?
<nickr> I prefer gqview
<Chipaca> nickr: feh blew me away with it's speed
<Chipaca> nickr: especially when compared with imagemagick :)
<dsmith> Well, yeah.
<nickr> everything is fast compared to imagemagick
<dsmith> The onlything slower than imagemagick is staroffice.
<dsmith> ;^)
<Chipaca> but actually feh is fast on its own right
<Chipaca> as in I look at a 14000x14800 pic in under 10 secs
<nickr> thats a big picture
<Chipaca> http://200.59.86.175/~john/map.png
<Chipaca> or .jpg for a smaller one (only 4MB)
<nickr> this one of those pictures that'll crash galeon
<nickr> I ask as the galeon error dialog pops up
<dsmith> How does feh compare to xv ?
<ajmitch> mmmm, openoffice.org running on an old pentium, with 16MB of ram ;)
Action: dsmith weeps for ajmitch
<ajmitch> Chipaca: how much ram do you have, too?
<Chipaca> ajmitch: 640MB
<Chipaca> dsmith: feh is free
<dsmith> Chipaca: True
<dneighbo> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/ximian_barbie.jpg to prove its true there is a ximian ken doll
<nickr> sick
<dneighbo> and twisted
<dneighbo> might i add
<dneighbo> btw: my children did this
<dneighbo> they took a rupert doll (ximian monkey)
<dneighbo> and a few days later i went in and ken was wearing ruperts shirt
<Chipaca> dneighbo: the "sick and twisted" fits in just fine
<dneighbo> ok enough playing time for real work
<nickr> so ken and rupert were ... uhh
<nickr> y'know
<ajmitch> that scares me
<dsmith> Chipaca: http://200.59.86.175/~john/map.png crashed dillo
<nickr> crashes galeon too
Action: nickr wgetting
<Chipaca> dsmith: I think your kernel crashed dillo (as in OOM: kill the sucker)
<ajmitch> wouldn't surprise me
<ajmitch> i have a 9.3Kx9.3K image here that uses a lot of ram to open
<nickr> might crash galeon because of my display situation
<ajmitch> remote?
<Chipaca> nickr: galeon is very sucky wrt images, that's a mozilla thing
<nickr> yea
<nickr> true
<Chipaca> nickr: even the jpg will crash galeon
<ajmitch> gqview up to 570MB...
<dsmith> What the heck is that thing?
<ajmitch> > 700MB...
<Chipaca> dsmith: a map
<Chipaca> dsmith: of america
<Chipaca> dsmith: compelte with sea monsters and land giants
<Chipaca> dsmith: circa 1500
<ajmitch> lol
<dsmith> It wouldn't have Ohio on it then. :(
<ajmitch> gqview has peaked at 710MB for this image i have :)
<Chipaca> dsmith: probably not, as the names of the places are still mostly spanish
Action: ajmitch ctrl-c's it :)
<Chipaca> ajmitch: now try feh
<ajmitch> pity i only have 512MB of RAM at the moment
<ajmitch> not bad, feh only uses 336MB for the same image
<dsmith> What kind of connection is 200.59.86.175 ?
<ajmitch> better at scrolling too
<nickr> the jpeg loaded instantly for me in gqview
<dsmith> feh is just a thin wrapper around imlib, iirc.
<nickr> zoom and scroll instantly
<nickr> tha map is way cool
<Chipaca> dsmith: 256/128 ADSL
<dsmith> I'm only getting it at 6 kB a sec. and I'm on dual ds3's.
derek (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<Chipaca> dsmith: makes sense, as there's probably 4 people pulling stuff right now (all in this channel :)
<dsmith> Chipaca: Not me anymore.
<Chipaca> dsmith: :)
<Chipaca> dsmith: imlib2
<ajmitch> the .png is a little big to download ;)
<Chipaca> ajmitch: you can get it from the library of congress, but only in chunks
<ajmitch> bbl
<dsmith> Chipaca: Did you glue it together with imagemagick ?
<Chipaca> dsmith: yes
<dsmith> It might be slow, but it sure can do a *lot* of stuff.
<Chipaca> dsmith: slow and memory hungry, but it's the kind of project I'd pitch in to. Does lots of stuff, reads and writs nearly anything, etc etc
<Chipaca> dsmith: I needed 2GB of swap to build that image :)
<Chipaca> dsmith: it was    s  l  o  w
<dsmith> Chipaca: yep.  I used it to cut out the images in wmMoonClock to make the images in gkrellmoon. Very scriptable.
<Chipaca> dsmith: so we agree it sucks in a cool way :)
<dsmith> Yes.

<nickr> gah!
<nickr> good lesson not to use try's unless you're catching a specific exception
<nickr> I just spent 40 minutes debugging variable name typos
<nickr> it took using pdb to actually find the orrors because I had forgotton that I wrapped the call in a try further up the object chain
<nickr> DOH
<jamest> nickr: you can also have an open try always dump the err mesg too
<nickr> that would've been helpful
<nickr> the

<jamest> oooo c++
<jamest> that's like a header file right?
<chillywilly> uh, no
<chillywilly> slap yourself
<jamest> <slap>
<jamest> my bad....that's the start of the autoconf setup 
<chillywilly> you're going to rip on autoconf? what do you have that is better disutils?
<jamest> lol, no
<jamest> i can't even claim autoconf sucks less
<jamest> as it doesn't
dsmith (~dsmith@p165.n-chpop06.stsn.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> autoconf is easy, all it consists of is a macro langauge and shell scripts
<jamest> which changes at random during it's development
<jamest> oh AM_FOOBATE_DA_BAR?  That's a version #.#.1 setting
<chillywilly> I don't think so
<dsmith> autoconf is a maze of twisty little config files, all different
<jamest> you need AC_FOOBATE_DA_BAR?  Introdced in #.#.2
<jamest> dude, those changes were eating my lunch when I used C exclusively
<jamest> maybe I just got unluck but it was one of my #1 gripes about it
<jamest> that and it's is a maze of twisty little config files, all different
<jamest> thanks dsmith :)

<jamest> but distutils is no better
<jamest> it's my fault they changed the config files?
<chillywilly> no they libs you depended on the autoconf macros don't change much between releases
<jamest> ah, ok
<chillywilly> and when they do it is a pretty major revision
<jamest> all I know is it was driving me nuts
<jamest> but now that's distutils job
<chillywilly> I had to change once when I started sing commoncpp from cvs
<chillywilly> using
<dsmith> jamest: What's distutils?
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> it's the python building shtuff
<ajmitch> it's beautiful
<chillywilly> ./setup.py build
<chillywilly> ./setup.py install
<dsmith> Oh, ok.
<chillywilly> uh, it's not that great
<jamest> distutils is bad
<jamest> it's original goal was to provide an equiv to autoconf
Nick change: drochaid_ -> drochaid
<jamest> but lurking on the lists it was very aparent that  that was no longer a goal
<jamest> they made something ok for installing python modules
<jamest> but not apps
<dsmith> the IDEA's are great, but auto* is an ugly wart that keeps getting ulier.
<chillywilly> all build systems suck
<jamest> and even python modules are iffy
<chillywilly> dsmith: I find it rather easy to write my own macros when I need to
<chillywilly> cause there are plenty out there to look at fr inspriation ;)
<chillywilly> mwahaha
<dsmith> They plan to re-write all the auto* tools in Guile Scheme.  Then life will be happy.
Action: dsmith ducks
<chillywilly> that would be col
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> they should write it all in elisp and require emacs to be installed ;)
<dsmith> chillywilly: Actually, I agree with you.  Copyying and tweaking isn;t so bad, but starting from scratch is nasty.
<chillywilly> muuuuwaahahahahaa
<chillywilly> dsmith: it's just shell scripting for the most part
<chillywilly> if you can't shell script you should shoot yourself ;)
<dsmith> What's whacky, is you use configure to generate the Makefile from Makefile.in, but it's too diffucult to write that, so you write Makefile.am and use automake to make Makefile.in.
<chillywilly> no, it's that Makefiles all are pretty generic
<jamest> then you put on the goat head, sacrafice a squirel to the build tool gods, run the autotools and prey the moons are in proper alignment
<dsmith> chillywilly: Yes, shell is pretty easy, and m4 is too once you understand it.
<chillywilly> with similar targets that you don't feel like rewriting every time
<jamest> distutils required you use the head of a yak
<chillywilly> eeek
<chillywilly> no goat?
<chillywilly> real men use goats, imho ;)
<jamest> no, but in NZ i think you can use a sheep for any or all of the above animals

<dneighbo> hey in xvncviewer is there a way to send 'shift' clicks across the net?
<dneighbo> no xvncviewer users?
<jcater> ya
Action: dneighbo is thinking this is a MAJOR bug if you cant do this
<jcater> but I didn;t know it didn't send shift+clicks
<dneighbo> as it screws everything i do at work :(
<jcater> ah
<dneighbo> well how would you say send ctrl-alt-del
<jcater> the pr0n viewer maps shift+rclick?
<jcater> that I don't know
<jamest> the break tracker too?
Action: dneighbo unfortunately moves alot of objects via highlight object
<dneighbo> then select libraries to copy it to (shift-click/ctrl-click) press button (as there is no Keyboard way to do this
<dneighbo> smokey no way
<dneighbo> you cna run vnc on an ipaq
<dneighbo> how sweet
<chillywilly> way
<dneighbo> anyone have vnc tips on this?
<dneighbo> i found something on keymaps
<dneighbo> but it left me more confused than anything
<dneighbo> this sucks
<jcater> dneighbo: what window manager are you using
Action: jcater guesses it's the window manager capturing that, not vnc
<jcater> as vnc will pass anything it actually receives
<jcater> e.g., I can't use Alt-Tab or Alt-F4 in KDE
<dneighbo> fluxbox
<jcater> because KDE interprets those
<dneighbo> but wont about any window manager grab a ctrl
<dneighbo> there must be some way to force it to client
<jcater> for the purpose of testing, why don't you start up a raw X session on another terminal with only an xterm
<dneighbo> i can hit F8 and get a popupp to send ctrl-alt-del
<jcater> thus no window manager
<jcater> and see if it works
<dneighbo> jcater: if i knew how to do that i would be glad :)
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> kdm gives that as an option :)
<dneighbo> gdm might too
<dneighbo> but im a bit afraid to drpo my connection
Action: jcater is thinking
<dneighbo> as getting back on can be a bitch
<dneighbo> i have found way to do keymaps and such but its horridly ugly
<dneighbo> http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/xvncviewer.html
<dneighbo> i guess at this point i dont have much choice as to do work i have to have this
<jcater> dneighbo: 
<jcater> Ctrl+alt+F1 to a console login
<jcater> then login
<jcater> then
<jcater> xinit -- :1
<jcater> should bring up a window-managerless session
<jcater> then try xvncviewer
<jcater> btw, if this works, then this tells us the problem
<jbailey> That's a frightening amount of work. =)
<jcater> and we can find a cleaner solution :)
<jcater> jbailey: I'm just trying to verify the problem
<jcater> feel free to correct me if you already know the answer :)
<jbailey> At no time did I suggest it was the wrong way to troubleshoot it.
<jbailey> It's just frightening. =)

<jcater> ouch
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> I wonder if I should've told him how to close this window-managerless session?
<dneighbo> no xterem in PATH
<jcater> bah
<dneighbo> speicfy a program on the command line or make sure that /usr/X11R6/bin is in your path
<jcater> try xinit gterm -- :1
<jcater> is that right?

<jcater> not gterm

<chillywilly> lol
<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> fsck
<dneighbo> sorry cant do that
<jcater> ah, I thought this machine wasn't connected to net
<dneighbo> no net when dialed up
<dneighbo> and passing gnome-terminal yells at me still no xterm installed :)
<jcater> bugger
<jcater> not net at all
<dneighbo> im going to disconnect and install xterm i guess
<jcater> or just no internet?
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> if you tell me how to 'route' i can get net
<dneighbo> as it looks as though i have internal network

<jcater> maybe the .deb will fit on a floppy
<dneighbo> figures this box has xterm already :)
<jcater> I don't have the energy to route for you
<dneighbo> crap cleaned cache here

<jcater> I guess I've just gotten used to the slowness
<jcater> what do you use?
<dneighbo> 6 months ago i would have kicked someone that suggested using evolution
<dneighbo> but it actually is pretty responsive
<dneighbo> and solid
Action: jcater may try it
<dneighbo> noting liek the pre 1.0 stuff
<jcater> as my users are bitching about "generic" software now
<jcater> s/now/again
<jcater> with the next release of OpenOffice
<dneighbo> jcater: definitely try it
<dneighbo> my wife hated everything
<jcater> prior to installing
<dneighbo> email wise
<dneighbo> and wanted outlook
<jcater> I'm going to grab sources for openoffice
<dneighbo> thats what made me install evolution
<jcater> and change the window title and the splash
<dneighbo> and she never called for support
<jcater> to read :OpenOffice Professional/Corporate Edition"
<dneighbo> so i figured it was worth me trying again :)
<dneighbo> jcater: silly rabbit
<jcater> I'm dead serious
<jcater> I couldn't get them to use OpenOffice
<jcater> until I changed the icon names
<dneighbo> :Microsoft Windows Longlorn/Special Corporate Beta 4
<jcater> to "Word" and "Excel"
<jcater> then they started using it
<jcater> but complained that it was the generic version
<jcater> and "kmail" is the generic version of outlook express
Action: jcater has never before heard software described as "generic"
<jcater> what kind of resources does evolution pull?
<jcater> as we're talking more than one user :)
Action: jcater wishes the kompany was still working on aethera
<chillywilly> evolution is a fat pig
<jcater> as it has the same interface as evolution
<jcater> but with the KDE widget set
<chillywilly> jcater: the kompany is evil
<jcater> maybe
<jcater> I suppose they are KDE's version of Ximian
<chillywilly> hmm, wrose I would say
<jcater> although I like the kompany better than ximian
<jcater> I don't think so
<chillywilly> cause they develop a LOT of prop. stuff
<jcater> at least they are always honest about what they're doing
<chillywilly> I dunno evil is evil ;)
<chillywilly> anyway, even the KDE developers can't stand the kompanyt
<dneighbo> jcater: im with chilly on this onnly because to me KDE is like Caldera
<dneighbo> its not that they are doing prop development its the attitude
Action: dneighbo speaks only CEO to CEO
<dneighbo> not the developers working for Kompany
<chillywilly> you mean the Kompany is like Caldera ;)
Action: dneighbo isnt thrilled always with Ximian and what it does, but the leaders there arent quiet as nose up turned to the community
<dneighbo> it sucks as they actually do some cool stuff
<chillywilly> agreed
<dneighbo> if the attitude were better they would likely do better (even with prop stuff)
<chillywilly> Ransom Love and Shawn Gordon could be best buddies ;)
<dneighbo> maybe they are same person?

<dneighbo> fsck csi miami
<dneighbo> thanks chilly
<chillywilly> for what?
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> I may put my users on evolution
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> ugh
<jcater> but I've gotten so used to the slimmed down sylpheed
<jcater> I don't know if I can deal with evolution myself
<chillywilly> you can't
<chillywilly> it SUCKS
<chillywilly> it is almost as bad as outlook
<jcater> that's a good reason to put my users on it
<chillywilly> in fact i think they were trying to emulate outlook's bloatedness
<jcater> as I've had them cry over losing outlook
<jcater> and that's not an exageration
<chillywilly> how does anyone tolerate it?
<chillywilly> hell I've seen my buddy have it lock up a thousand times ona  1GHz laptop
<dneighbo> i kind of like it
<jcater> I had withdrawal when dropping Outlook
<jcater> but I've grown to like slimmed down email
<jcater> (btw, this is Outlook, not Express)
Action: chillywilly uses mutt
<jcater> does evolution support LDAP?
<jcater> if so, that's probably the selling point
<chillywilly> dunno
<chillywilly> I tried using evolution for a while about a few weeks ago
<chillywilly> I hate it
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> dneighbo: you use the calendar stuff?
<dneighbo> i looked into it
<dneighbo> im about to try at home i think

<chillywilly> you guys missed it
<chillywilly> I send in my moo and they played it on WOPN

<jcater> moo
<chillywilly> and for next week
<chillywilly> http://www.libertyetech.com/chicken.ogg ;P
<dneighbo> webmail is painful
<chillywilly> dneighbo: you listen to my moo?
Action: dneighbo still is amazed that web applications are so in demand
<chillywilly> freak
<dneighbo> chillywilly: no moo yet

<chillywilly> eh, whatever
<dneighbo> mainly weeding through mail mountain to respond to mdean :)
<ra3vat> hello all
<ra3vat> how to add % to all my search input?
--- Tue Nov 12 2002
<dneighbo> %
<dneighbo> if you have field name
<dneighbo> do f8
<dneighbo> in the name entry
<dneighbo> do 
<dneighbo> ra%
<dneighbo> hit f9
<dneighbo> it should return all results starting with ra
<dneighbo> if you do f8
<dneighbo> %ra%
<dneighbo> f9
<dneighbo> it should get you any name containing ra
jcater (~jcater@cpe-066-061-083-220.midsouth.rr.com) left irc: "nite"
<chillywilly> anyone know if gettimeofday(&now, NULL); and then now.tv_usec would give me the current time in milliseconds?
<chillywilly> anyone? anyone?
<chillywilly> bueler? bueler?
<ra3vat> for now i would like % to be added from beginning of non empty search entry
<ra3vat> do f8
<ra3vat> do 
<ra3vat> ra
<chillywilly> hmmm that gives microseconds
<ra3vat> it expands to %ra 
<chillywilly> gess you need to divide by 1000
<chillywilly> grooovy
<ra3vat> dneighbo: any hints?
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> there is something called 'sloppyquery'
rdean (~rdean@12-221-229-247.client.insightBB.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<dneighbo> or there was
Action: dneighbo thinks what you are describing might have been what that was for, but have never used it
<dneighbo> can you try sloppyquery
<ra3vat> i saw some sloppy related part commented out in the code, will try it anyway
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> ra3vat: if you put sloppyquery=""
<dneighbo> in a block
<dneighbo> i "think"
<dneighbo> what will happen is everytime you execute a query
<dneighbo> it will append a % to the end
<dneighbo> actually it looks like it will have effect of doing the following
<dneighbo> you enter ra it converts to
<dneighbo> %r%a%
<dneighbo> and you might have to do it as sloppyQuery
<dneighbo> and you might have to do it as sloppyQuery=""
<dneighbo> you can look in forms/src/GFObjects/GFBlock.py to see exactly what its doing 
<dneighbo> or if you need to patch it
<dneighbo> please let me know if this works
<dneighbo> as right this second i can not readily test
<ra3vat> dneighbo: D-G.pdf defines sloopyQuery only among entry attributes
<dneighbo> doh you are right
<dneighbo> try entry
<dneighbo> i was thinking block as its in block code
<dneighbo> but thasts cause it fires onProcessQuery
<dneighbo> but it checks entry.xxx
<ra3vat> form works but search fails

<btami> yes

<dneighbo> grr anyone have sources.list for player stuff?

<btami> i havn't
Nick change: SachaS_uni -> SachaS
<Arturas> btami: how did you build GNUe.exe's for Windows? did you have any problems with gettext?
<dneighbo> found one
<btami> Arturas: McMillan+Inno
<btami> what problems do you think?
<Arturas> yesterday i finished setup-cvs.py for Windows
<Arturas> but when trying to run form
<Arturas> it gives traceback on gettext (some string is NULL or something like that)
<Arturas> i thought i maybe you have met with this problem while building exe's
<btami> no, i havn't met any problems with gettext
<btami> can you send me your script to try
<Arturas> setup-cvs for win?
<btami> yes
<Arturas> it's in the CVS as setup-cvs2.py
<btami> ooo
<Arturas> (at least it should be there)
<Arturas> but it's now finally finished - still some bugs exist
<btami> i see
<Arturas> now => not
<btami> i will try
<Arturas> i warned you :)
<btami> ok :)
<dneighbo> probably a little late but why setup-cvs2.py
<dneighbo> instead of setup-cvs-win.py or somethign?
<Arturas> it's not ready to replace current setup-cvs.py and it's working (=> should be working) both on Linux and Windows
Action: Arturas is away: meeting (10 min.)
Action: Arturas is back (gone 00:10:52)
<btami> Arturas: why do you put fsutil.exe and linkd.exe into CVS, they aren't free software
<btami> maybe there are free alternetives on the net
fixe (~adam@dsl081-147-022.chi1.dsl.speakeasy.net) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<Arturas> if you're using Windows (legally of course), you may use these tools
<Arturas> and as far as i heard, there are no alternatives yet
fixe (~adam@dsl081-147-022.chi1.dsl.speakeasy.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> i included them because although these tools are included by default with WindowsXP, they are not included with Windows2000
<Arturas> (it's possible to download them somewhere from Microsoft web site)
<Arturas> do you think we should refuse from using them?
<btami> no, just not from our CVS
<ajmitch> non-free software is a bad thing to have in GNU CVS :)
<btami> maybe a README about where to find/download these would be better
<Arturas> i don't like this idea too, but can we say to the user "if you want to install GNUe, make sure you have ...exe and ...exe or download them and put into specified folder and only then you can install GNUe"? :/
<btami> hey, setup-cvs.py is for developers
<btami> not for end users
<Arturas> hm, sorry :)
<btami> :)
<btami> Arturas: can i bugreport for you?
<btami> about setup-cvs2.py
<Arturas> btami: ??
<btami> i got: cannot create a link at: c:\python22\lib\gnue
<btami> oh, wait 
<btami> i was wrong
<btami> tried it on VFAT volume
<Arturas> :)
<btami> trying again :)
<Arturas> the error is correct :)
<ajmitch> Arturas: derek will shoot you if you leave those files in there ;)
<ra3vat> could anyone interested in web forms driver comment on http://openthought.net/cgi-bin/demo_app/demo.pl
<Arturas> Derek will shoot me for putting these files there :) ok, i'll remove them in about 10 mins
<btami> Arturas: i got the same error
<btami> i have c: VFAT
<btami> e: NTFS
<btami> the win2k is in e:
<btami> i wanted to install into e:\gnue\bin, e:\gnue\conf
<btami> but the script forces c:\python22\lib\gnue
<btami> becouse my python resides there
<btami> hmm
<Arturas> that's one of the problems i had - how do i enter gnue into python's modules search path
<Arturas> somewhere in the middle of setup-cvs2.py is the call
<ajmitch> PYTHONPATH, or sys.path :)
<Arturas> under Windows
<Arturas> i solved it by creating a link in python..\lib\gnue pointing to gnue folder
<Arturas> but this is wrong solution
<Arturas> removed ...exes, added readme (-> win-links.txt)

<reinhard> good morning ariel_
<reinhard> sorry that i was so unresponsive yesterday
<reinhard> just a few remarks to the object repository document you sent me
<reinhard> first (and most important) thanks for your work :)
<reinhard> on the general design
<reinhard> i'm not sure if we want to include inheritance at all
<reinhard> and if we want to include versioning and compounds in the very first version
<reinhard> when i looked at your document i got the feeling that XML is not a perfect way of explaining something to a human
<ra3vat> anyone can drop me a test message on ds at ics.elcom.ru, please
<reinhard> ra3vat: ok
<reinhard> sent
<ra3vat> reinhard: thanks, got it
<reinhard> ariel_: i like the tablular explaination you did much better
<reinhard> i thought i might try to change it into an object oriented explaination
<reinhard> (like the old (current) api definition of appserver)
<reinhard> thanks also for the diagram of appserver structure
<reinhard> it seems like my installation of dia is hosed
<reinhard> if i open the diagram i get errors about missing fonts :(
<reinhard> is it possible for dia to export .eps and .png ?
<ariel_> reinhard: 
<reinhard> if yes i could easily include into the whitepaper
<reinhard> -o
<ariel_> don't care about fonts warning, i also have, just click OK 
<ariel_> to export right-click on open diagram
<ariel_> choose file then export
<reinhard> when i click ok for the warning
<reinhard> the diagram doesn't look right
<reinhard> the text is outside the boxes
<ariel_> uhmm
<ariel_> i dunno it changes mine from Hevetica boldOblique  to adobe courier medium-r-normal that fits well
<reinhard> it changes everything to "fixed" for me
<reinhard> however i have about zero idea how fonts work in X
<reinhard> i have this problem with other diagrams too
<reinhard> so it's certainly my own fault
<ariel_> if there aren't changes i can send png btw the first picture in the note is png export of the dia
<reinhard> ariel_: thanks
<reinhard> ariel_: btw i am talking about appserver architecture diagram
<reinhard> not about the class diagram
<ariel_> i can send png just tell me if you prefer the classical package shape (rectangle with label) instead of the component shape (rectangle with side ellipses and smaller rectangles)
<reinhard> um
<reinhard> i don't care that much i think
<reinhard> what you like better :)
<ariel_> ok

<hjibds2> hi
<hjibds2> Is GNUe ready for production use
<Arturas> hi
<Arturas> it's pretty hard to say
<Arturas> it depends :/
<Arturas> practically it almost ready
<Arturas> but it depends on what you want from GNUe
<hjibds2> we are a small business and need some kind of ERP system - my knowledge is very limited in this area
<jamest> we have no prebuilt packages for you to use
<jamest> we're (slowly) getting the tools in place to make building such packages easy
<hjibds2> u mean install from source?
<jamest> no, i mean we have no Inventory Control package, or general ledger package
<hjibds2> what kind of time scale is there for these packages?
<jamest> we have tools that let you easily create data entry screens (what we call forms) and reports
<jamest> dneighbo is working on a small biz package right now that is strickly client/server
<jamest> i _think_ he was getting it checked into gnu's cvs server but I'm not sure where that is at
<hjibds2> sounds intresting
<jamest> I'm also not sure what stage it's at
<jamest> jcater has also submitted a package called RentFree (or something like that) to gnu's cvs that manages rental property
<jamest> again, I'm also not sure what stage it's at
<jamest> so the tools work in 2 tier mode (client/server)
<jamest> and work on appserver is progressing but it is not ready yet to build systems around it
Action: drochaid is away: it's pissing down and I'm in full gore-tex :)
<btami> jamest: have you any success with GTK2 on win32 ?
<jamest> btami: i've had 0 time to try it out
<jamest> i've got a few deathlines at home that all fall on the 1st of dec
<jamest> which is sucking up all my free time
<hjibds2> Are there any systems of a similar nature I can look at?
<jamest> hjibds2: i don't know
<jamest> i know there are other projects but I'm not sure the state of any of them
<jamest> hjibds2: do you have an existing system in place?
<hjibds2> head office are looking at implementing a larger version of the system that we need based on asp and M$ SQL server - i don't want to go down that route
<jamest> btami: i plan to take a few days off to get ahead so I can GNUe again
<btami> ok :)
<hjibds2> jamest - not yet - we are looking at getting some form of system in place in the next 6 months
<jamest> hjibds2: is middlewear important to you?  or are you happy w/ a 2-tier system?
<hjibds2> we would be happy with a 2-tier system
<jamest> what platforms are the clients ?
<hjibds2> win32
<jamest> well, dneighbo's small biz thing might give you what you need
<jamest> and I'd hope to have most the issues w/ win32 worked out in 6 months
<jamest> (the UI driver for windows isn't native win32api so we have to create one)
<jamest> but I can't say for sure
<jamest> the salesman would say "You bet we can."

<psu> shows that RMS was right to insist on "free s/w" rather than "open source" as a label
<psu> as it's harder for people to twist that 
<ra3vat> siesel: i usually remember complains about web interface when any new data require to reload a page and fighting about not to let jave in. is that link demostrate one possible solution? 
<siesel> yes, it is one possible solution, and it is the solution choosen by the jsforms client (alpha stage at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jan/jsclient/gnue-forms.html
<revDeke> psu good point you should make that a comment :)
<nickr> its easy to twist free software
<siesel> I also looked at a quite similar but (IMHO) more powerful project than openthought, 
<ra3vat> siesel: thanks for clarifying :)
<siesel> which was quite good, but had one bad point: at the moment it just worked with netscape 4.x
<siesel> ra3vat: it's allways good to know other projects which do quite similar stuff. If the webclient is once working, it could f.e. use openthought plugins for authetification etc. 
<psu> revDeke: I'm desperately trying to catch up on KC at the moment
<psu> the distraction of my new internet account isn't helping either

<marioct> hello people, good night !
<jamest> hello
<marioct> Hello james.
<marioct> I've just downloaded gnue via CVS, and I'll read docs... but I have one question...
<jamest> ok
<marioct> how can I run gnue-forms with curses ? 
<jamest> for any optons you can run
<jamest> gnue-forms --help
<jamest> gnue-forms --interface curses
<jamest> should do it
<jamest> well
[16:59] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<jamest> gnue-forms --interface curses form.gfd
<marioct> ok, but I got this : Error: Unable to load any valid UI drivers.  Aborting.
<jamest> oooooo
<jamest> jcater: do we need to install nstti from our cvs seperately?
<jcater> no
<jcater> but I'm not 100% sure setup.py has been updated to install curses
<jcater> for common
<marioct> can I install ?
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> it should be installing
<jcater> err, wait
<jcater> are you using our CVS code
<jcater> or the last 0.4.0 release?
<marioct> the 0.4.0 release
<jcater> ok, curses wasn't present then
<jcater> a preview will be in the 0.4.1 that we hope to release this week
<jcater> (it's also in cvs)
<jcater> but it's not fully usable yet
<marioct> where in CVS ?
<revDeke> savannah.gnu.org
<jcater> it should be fully supported by 0.5.0
<revDeke> sorry read that as where is not where in
<jcater> I don't have the link handy
<jcater> but if you open www.gnue.org
<jcater> towards the bottom of the left column
<jcater> you'll see "CVS"
<jcater> that has instructions
<jcater> I think it's something like http://www.gnuenterprise.org/community/cvs.php
<jcater> oh, yay
<jcater> I got it right
<marioct> ok... thanks. Do you know about some good book that teaches python ?
<nickr> book!?
<marioct> yes... or tutorials ?!....I must learn python to help build gnue !!!
<nickr> there is a good tutorial in the documentation section of python.org
<nickr> http://www.python.org/doc/current/tut/tut.html
<marioct> ok. thanks.. bye !

<jcater> ===========
<jcater> After the next point release, we are moving away from
<jcater> cvs numbers being '?.?.?a' and instead are doing:
<jcater>   0.1.0 (cvs) ==> 0.0.99
<jcater>   0.1.1 (cvs) ==> 0.1.0.99
<jcater>   1.0.2 (cvs) ==> 1.0.1.99
<jcater>   1.0.0 (cvs) ==> 0.99.0
<jcater>   1.1.0 (cvs) ==> 1.0.99
<jcater> So, whereas the current post-0.4.0 code is called 0.4.1a
<jcater> until the 0.4.1 release, it would, under this new system, 
<jcater> be 0.4.0.99.

<revDeke> yummy please email jbailey@gnu.org and have him deb them up
<revDeke> and i will test debs too :)

<jcater> not ready for debs yet
<jcater> siesel_: no, unintended
<jcater> we have some big restucturing for both forms and the forms module in designer scheduled for 0.5.0
<revDeke> ok will test prelease when get home
<jcater> to eliminate crap like that
<revDeke> are changelogs updated?
<revDeke> and the feature maps?
<jcater> no, I can't do that for here
<revDeke> i.e. so i have some idea of some things to test for
<jcater> with this first thing, just test a few forms you have that were working
<jcater> by tonight
Action: revDeke will do some general torture testing, but would like to beat on new features and buglets s well
<jcater> we'll have news and changelog and a few install things worked out
<revDeke> ok

<siesel_> revDeke: some of the new features have test forms  in samples/testcases
Action: revDeke wonders if i shouldnt pay more attention to the release
<revDeke> as i should be doing the 0.4.1 release so you guys can continue on with 0.5.0
<revDeke> i will try to keep things updated for teh 0.4.2 release (if necessary)
Action: revDeke will play wiht feature maps too
<revDeke> or at least study them enough to ask questions :)
<revDeke> siesel_: i think if we are making testing stuff it shouldnt fall in samples perhaps?
<revDeke> unless we just want to make our samples our test bed
<siesel_> you're free to move it to a more apropriate place
Action: siesel_ thinks that every feature needs an implementation by an form/report etc. 
<siesel_> which can be used for testing as for learning

mdean (~mdean@mkc-65-28-72-76.kc.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel_> revDeke: I think we need to discuss again, how we handle samples and what do we want to provide samples
<jcater> I want to rm -rf samples
<jcater> and start all over
<jcater> I want one interesting schema
<jcater> with sample data and all
<jcater> and all forms / reports / etc
<jcater> use this schema/ theme
<jcater> and I want to use the same schema/theme in the developers guides
<jcater> much like Access' Northwind (or whatever) test database
<jcater> and I don't find zipcodes interesting :)
<siesel_> I thought of something similar.
<siesel_> But what schema/thema should we use?
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> I brought it up a few weeks ago wrt the developer's guide
<revDeke> i have no problem with that
<revDeke> sounds like gnue-sb :)
<jcater> but neither I nor anyone else could come up with one
<jcater> revDeke: maybe a simple version of that only 2-3 tables
<revDeke> yeah
<revDeke> thats what i meant
<revDeke> literal sb now :)
<jcater> anywho
<jcater> that's not going to happen this release
<revDeke> actually i have something
<jcater> but I would like to see it in 0.5.0
<revDeke> that i use for demos
<jcater> 0.5.0 is going to be big
<revDeke> its a video catalog database
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> something like that would be nice
<jcater> it's simple
<revDeke> its really simple
<siesel_> 0.5.0 will have a 0.1.0 webclient
<jcater> most people can relate to it
<revDeke> one main table and a few foreign key tables
<revDeke> for type = vhs, dvd etc
<revDeke> and rating = R, PG, PG-13
<jcater> 0.5.0 will have a lot more than a web client
<siesel_> yes and we can add simple reports
<revDeke> could probably put directors or actors or something for child parent
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> maybe we do need something slightly more complicated
<jcater> well, no
<revDeke> well ideal for me would be a music database
<revDeke> CDs parent
<revDeke> Songs Child
<jcater> that seems even better
<jcater> as that opens the door for more interesting/complicated forms and reports
<revDeke> lots of lookup tables for year put out, label etc
<revDeke> i.e. i WANT to manage my music with gnue
<revDeke> as kmusicdb is only somewhat sane thing out there but it relies on whacked versions of kde
<revDeke> its all postgres 
<revDeke> so as soon as gsd is ready in designer
<revDeke> i will suck out the schema (its gpl) ;)
<revDeke> and viola whip up some forms
<siesel_> complicated database schemas are not so important as complicated forms / reports IMHO
<revDeke> you can evaluate if you want to use it as a 'sample' or not
<revDeke> siesel_: this schema should be REALLY straight forward
<revDeke> i suspect some cool triggers as i want to tie it into CDDB :)
riandouglas (~riand@031.mel0605.mel.iprimus.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> I think I like this schema
Action: siesel_ thinks that a sample application for gnue should have connections with business, like a very simplistic app for a shop who lends music
<jcater> I'm not sure I agree
<jcater> sorry, phone....
<jcater> I'm not sure I agree because a 
<jcater> sample with a pure business theme
<jcater> will tend to try to outgrow itself
<jcater> and try to become an actual app
<siesel_> that's a point
<siesel_> ok, so lets use a music database as standart sample
<jcater> revDeke: you think you can whip up us a GSD schema?
<jcater> sometime in the next few weeks?
<revDeke> yeah i can likely do that
<revDeke> that said i plan on making it a real app likely at some point :)
<revDeke> but i can certainly do that outside the sample
<revDeke> for now i have a spreadsheet with my music and i need that to go away 
<revDeke> so i am driven by simple replacement
<revDeke> :)
<revDeke> how about tonight
<revDeke> actually i MUST work on gnue-sb tonight
<jcater> yes
<jcater> you must
<jamest> yes
<jamest> please
<jamest> we're preping prereleases so working on forms/designer/etc will be good testing
<revDeke> both jamest and jcater are begging for me to break things
Action: revDeke looks for alan funk or some other prank video camera crew
<revDeke> must run
revDeke (www-data@alt1.libertydistribution.com) left #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> fyi, anyone who looked at the prereleases
<jcater> I did a Python 2.2 -only thing
<jcater> that's being fixed
<jcater> but if you are on python 2.1, please wait for round two :(
<jcater> jan: what is scale?
<siesel_> the second parameter for a decimal: POSTGRES SQL: "CREATE TABLE ... myval DECIMAL(precision,scale), ..
<jcater> no
<jcater> postgres uses a funky definition for precision
<jcater> using our parameters, that's DECIMAL(length, precision)
<siesel_> ok, then the XSLT file are wrong.
<jcater> we are working on the schema system
<jcater> trying to get it back together
<jcater> it has been totally trashed
<jcater> so yeah it's out of whack right now
<siesel_> the last time I worked on it was quite ok.
<jcater> it was way out of spec
<siesel_> ok, that means that the XSLT files etc. has to be updated

<Varadhan> ra3vat: yes tell me...
<pradhap> ajmitch: there ??
<jamest> Varadhan: what are you talking about at Oracle world?
<jamest> is this something you're doing right now or in the future
<Varadhan> actually, a sample banking application is written using gnue+oracle 9i and has been setup there for the show...
<jamest> do you have a demo setup and if so what gnue tools are demo'd
<derek> Varadhan: was that for me? to contect MP Anad Babu?
<derek> if so can you give me more information :)
<Varadhan> jamest: no.. its a live one...
<jamest> banking == on the teller side of the counter, personal side at home, other?
<Varadhan> jamest: it is currently running there to show the demo of gnue as well...
<Varadhan> derek: for the entire gnue community.. :)
<Varadhan> derek: what further details you want???
<Varadhan> jamest: it is a very very small banking application with which you can put in some amt and take out something from it...
<Varadhan> jamest: actually, it allows creation of an account, modification of account info, closing of accounts, depositting into an account, withdrawal from accounts,
<Varadhan> querying of account balance etc..
<derek> Varadhan: i dont get it
<derek> you said contact anand babu, but i dont know what to contact him for, i.e. why does he want to talk to me :)
<Varadhan> derek: pardon me with what you don't get from my messages???
<Varadhan> derek: we have setup a stall in the Oracle world to show demo of gnue with oracle9i on a IA64 debian box...
<Varadhan> derek: we have written a small application in gnue to show the connectivity of oracle with gnue... and the power of gnue based application...
<derek> Varadhan: i understand that
<derek> what i dont understand is why i need to contact anad babu :)
<derek> does he have questions?
<Varadhan> derek: so we thought of informing this to the entire gnue community so that they can have a look at the stall...
Action: derek must run to work i have meetings
<jamest> Varadhan: are these demo files private or could we get them to put into a sample pack for gnue?
<Varadhan> derek, if you want to jave a look at the stall.. you can contact Anand babu... 
<derek> ok
<Varadhan> jamest: we are much obliged to put them in the gnue sample pack...
<Varadhan> actually, we are working towards making it more redable for the future gnue users...
<jamest> cool
<Varadhan> and moreover, we hope to receive gnue community in our stall to make it more success!!!

<btami> hi all
<btami> i find an interesting issue with forms
<btami> 'v tested connection.gfd
<btami> saved it with designer
<btami> and then it failed with forms
<btami> Error: The connections.conf doesn't contain a definition for 'connection'
<btami> whe designer saves a gfd
<btami> it puts a <database> tag at the bottom of file
<btami> and forms doesn't likes this
<btami> if i put <database> tag befor <datasource> tag in gfd
<btami> it's OK again
<btami> forms depends on order of tags ?
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> it shouldn't
<jcater> let me look at something
<ra3vat> btami: hi, are you using reports with i18n data?
jan (jan@131.220.92.144) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<btami> hi ra3vat
<btami> trying, why
<btami> ?
<btami> ra3vat: ?
<ra3vat> for now can't get local message readable in html reports
<btami> i'm trying text report mainly
<btami> it seems something puts charset=UTF-8 into html header
<ra3vat> btami: it is not only header, encoding for text looks like UTF-8 too
<jcater> if someone can whip me up a simple report that fails with i18n, I can debug
<ra3vat> jcater:  it not fails but genetated in UTF-8 encoding. how to change encoding?
<btami> jcater: it doesn't fails, just wrong :)
<ra3vat> generated
Action: jcater would call that "failing"  :)
<ra3vat> jcater: it may be any report that pulls db data not in ascii, i suppose
<btami> jcater: you use dest.write ('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>\n') in GRReport.py
<jcater> I think there's more to it than just changing that header, though
<jcater> I think I have to open a codec
<jcater> which I learned to do this past weekend by accident
<btami> jcater: i'v sended patches into DCL #159-#160
<btami> those contains some i18n corrections too
<jcater> ok
<btami> and finally i put attachments into DCL too 
<btami> jcater: you don't have to deal with codecs, if sitecustomize.py looks like something this:
<btami> import sys, locale
<btami> loc = locale.getdefaultlocale()
<btami> if loc[1]:
<btami>   sys.setdefaultencoding(loc[1])
<btami> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, '')
<btami> print 'Default encoding: %s' %sys.getdefaultencoding()
<btami> print 'Locale conventions: %s' %locale.localeconv()
<jcater> ah
<pradhap> jcater: hi
<jcater> pradhap: hi
<jcater> congrats on the demo
<pradhap> jcater: thankx a lot..
<ra3vat> btami: Arturas solved it somehow that there is no need to change sitecustomize
<pradhap> jcater: you helped a lot for setting up GNUe + Oracle 9i + Debain on Itanium-64 ...
<ra3vat> even if ascii mentioned there
<btami> ra3vat: please let me know how
<btami> one thing i'm worry, where UTF-8 comes from

<ra3vat> btami: common/src/GParser.py
<ra3vat> revision 1.41
<ra3vat> date: 2002/07/31 11:01:25;  author: arturas;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2
<ra3vat> Corrected problem of i18n characters in .gfd file - in case of not
<ra3vat> only ascii characters, sax returned unicode string, which caused further
<ra3vat> errors in python. Earlier this was solved by changing system-wide
<ra3vat> site.py file option defaultencoding from 'ascii' to other value. Now
<ra3vat> encoding is read from gnue.conf file option formFontEncoding and is used
<ra3vat> to enforce sax returned unicode string recode to given encoding.
<ra3vat> ----------------------------
<btami> yes, it solves the gfd's problem, but what about data (from DBMS) ?
<ra3vat> btami: i'm not sure i follow
<ra3vat> the problem was that xml processing enforces internal representation in unicode
<ra3vat> it is not with db data
<ra3vat> you now db encoding and can convert to other encoding if you wish 
<ra3vat> you know
<btami> ra3vat: sorry for waiting, i'm thinking about reports
<btami> it makes an intermadiate xml file with dest.write() calls
<btami> and then a sablotron process comes
<btami> i don't know/when how UTF-8 comes
<ra3vat> btami: changing encoding in dest.write ('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>\n') in GRReport.py solved my problem with html report

<ajmitch> hi
<ajmitch> jcater: yes i started on the driver
<jcater> just out of curiosity, how are you processing the lines in the file?
<ajmitch> i looked at that one, but it's not wonderful - requires you to compile a python extension
<jcater> hmm
<ajmitch> at the moment, i'm doing it simply - i know it's not great :)
<jcater> ok

<lupo> hi
<ajmitch> hi
<lupo> i'm currently trying to install gnue tools on my laptop
<lupo> i hope that python2.2
<lupo> works
<revDeke> yeah it works
<revDeke> wha tis your laptop running
Action: revDeke hopes not suse or some other hard to play with distro :)
<lupo> debian, what else? is there anything else at all?
<revDeke> whew
<revDeke> it should be easy then
<revDeke> you installing cvs?
<jcater> oooooo
<revDeke> or 0.4.0?
<jcater> lupo: debian unstable?
<lupo> cvs rulez
<revDeke> if 0.4.0 i would just use the debs
<lupo> jcater: debian stable
<jcater> ok
<jcater> didn't know python2.2 was in stable now
<lupo> jcater: there is no 2.1 in stable anymore
<revDeke> jcater: why woudnt it be 2.3 is in unstable ;)
<jcater> no 2.1 in woody?
<lupo> wasn't there some bug with 2.2 in gnue?
<lupo> no 2.1 in woody, unbelievably
<jcater> lupo: 2.2.0
<revDeke> lupo: long time ago
<jcater> but 2.2.1 fixed it
<lupo> okay
<jcater> they are on 2.2.2 now, I think
<jcater> lupo: against postgresql?
<revDeke> jcater: come one you know you can get 2.3 in sid, why say they are on 2.2.2 ;)
Action: jcater thwaps revDeke
Action: revDeke still think thats hilarious
<lupo> yep, just configuring postgresql
<jcater> lupo: make sure stable doesn't have python-psycopg 1.0.13-1
<jcater> it's broken
<jcater> I think stable has an older version of psycopg
<jcater> which is good
<lupo> i have 1.0.8
<jcater> ok, good
<lupo> setup-cvs.py or setup-cvs2.py
<jcater> what is setup-cvs2.py ??
<jcater> when did that get in there?
<lupo> dunno, it's here :)
<jcater> well, use setup-cvs.py

Action: jcater would have named that setup-cvs-win32.py, then :)
<lupo> ImportError: No module named wxPython.wx
<revDeke> jcater i told them to rename setup-cvs-win.py
Action: revDeke assumes they never did it?
<revDeke> apt-get libwxgtk or something liek that
<lupo> i have
<revDeke> for the proper python?
<revDeke> do
<revDeke> python2.2
<revDeke> then type
<revDeke> import wxPython.wx
<revDeke> and if you get that error
<revDeke> then you dont have wxPython installed quite right
<revDeke> for python2.2
<lupo> i did a find
<lupo> this bitch has installed wxPy to /usr/lib/python2.1
<revDeke> Varadhan: are you around?
<lupo> argh
<lupo> dependency hell
<lupo> i can't remove 2.1 and install 2.2 exclusively, because some blockheads made a dependency on python2.1 and not python
<lupo> argh
<lupo> libwxgtk2.2-python is wx version 2.2 for python 2.1

<jcater> um
<jcater> wish btami or ra3vat were here
<jcater> I think they know how to get around this
<jcater> or Art
<lupo> what is the precise problem?
<lupo> l10n?
<jcater> i18n
<jcater> your locale setting
<jcater> something to do with site_customize
<jcater> or something
<lupo> because we use "," to seperate floating points and "." to mark thousands and you do it the other way round?
<jcater> I'm not 100% sure
<lupo> what is field type "serial" in postgres?
<jcater> I think that's an automatic sequence field
<lupo> great, thats what i suspected
<lupo> i'll use that for the id :)
<lupo> okay

<revDeke> cool
<revDeke> how are you making the postscript?

<ajmitch> hello people
<jamest> hi
<jamest> what's the native language of NZ?
<ajmitch> english is the main language used
<jamest> damn
<ajmitch> maori is apparantly also an official language, but a large part of the country doesn't speak it
<jamest> i swore you guys had a language other than english
<ajmitch> not as a primary language
<ajmitch> just cos i speak funny doesn't mean i speak english as a second language ;)
<jamest> don't worry, that's not why I thing you speak funny
<ajmitch> why'd you think we had another language?
<ra3vat> what version of wx would you recommend for fresh gnue install under w98?
<jamest> the most bleeding edge you can get
<ajmitch> ra3vat: the latest should work, i think
<jamest> even then good luck
<ajmitch> i used 2.3.2.1 on w98, but not with GNUe :)
<ra3vat> oh, thanks :)
<jamest> if you look at the feature plan you'll see the cleanup got pushed back a rev
<jamest> so that a native win32 driver can move up
<ajmitch> i still prefer gtk2 on GNU/Linux :)
rdean (~rdean@12-221-229-247.client.insightBB.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> hah, bug squashed
<ajmitch> 1-line change
<jamest> in our code i hope
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> in gtk2 driver
<ajmitch> i just compared it with the wx driver :)
<ajmitch> not sure what do do about the formAlert() method tho
<jamest> implement it
<jamest> :)
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> the wx driver produces a beep
<ajmitch> i don't see how to do that with gtk2, so i dropped it out
jcater (~jcater@cpe-066-061-083-220.midsouth.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> as long as a UI driver does things consistantly it does not have to do the same thing as wx driver
<jamest> instead of a beep you could flash the screen once then have the status bar blink 3 times 
<ajmitch> it works
<jamest> or something
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> hi jcater
<jcater> jamest: the curses driver does that
<jcater> it flashes the screen instead of a beep :)
<jamest> ok, i was just explaining that a UI driver only has to be consistant with itself
<jamest> as it defines the behaviour on that interface 
<jamest> jcater: the nz'rs speak english
<jamest> not kiwi
<jamest> so I can't use them in the tutorial
<jcater> hehe
<jcater> kiwi was a joke
<ajmitch> you could use maori :)
<jamest> i know :)
<jamest> maori it is then
<jamest> how to say "welcome" in it
<ajmitch> haere mai
<jamest> are those capitalized?
<ajmitch> iirc :)
<ajmitch> umm
<ajmitch> yeah, i guess

<jbailey> jamest: I'm hoping to have some time tommorow, but it's unlikely.
<jbailey> ajmitch: Heya.
<jamest> we've done a prerelease
<nickr> jive locale
<jbailey> Of which version?
<jamest> 0.4.1
<ajmitch> jamest: think you could sneak in some patches to forms before the release?
<jamest> absolutely
<ajmitch> cool
<jamest> no one actually runs the pre-releases
<jamest> and test them
<jbailey> Hmmm..  Weren't you skipping 0.4.1 because of the confusion with 0.4.1a?
<jamest> we just do it cause it makes us fell like we trie
<jamest> d
<jamest> we talked about it
<nickr> http://kel.otago.ac.nz/translator/
<ajmitch> hmm, an otago.ac.nz address... :)
<jcater> hehe
<jcater> kupu!
<jbailey> jamest: I can't make debs of 0.4.1. =(
<jbailey> Well, I keep mark an epoch, but I'd rather not.
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> well 0.4.2 or 0.4.1b
<jamest> both are confusing :)
<jamest> fwiw: we've switched to 0.4.0.99 for cvs
<jbailey> 0.4.1.1? =)
<nickr> whats with these crazy moon versionings?
<jamest> :)
<jamest> this is a 1 time issues isn't it?
<jamest> after this .debs will be based upon releases?
<ajmitch> the problem with gtk2 is the overabundance of API docs
<jbailey> jamest: Hopefully.  Unless you guys take a silly long time between releases and I need to pull from CVS to fix bugs.
<jamest> us
<jamest> take a long time?
<jcater> long time?
<jcater> no way
<jbailey> Having only recently successfully installed GNUe, I have no idea what your release cycles are. =)
<jcater> we always keep it under a year
<jbailey> *lol*
<jbailey> "We release more often than the Hurd"
<jamest> or debian!
<nickr> ajmitch: the problem with gtk is the overabundance of API
<ajmitch> yup
<jamest> we're so with the "in" crowd
<jcater> jbailey: y'all got a lot of bad press on that slashdot story
<jcater> wrt partition limits of 2 GB or whatever
<ajmitch> jcater: for sure
<jcater> :(
<ajmitch> don't worry
<jbailey> jcater: Well, rms promised something, and put no effort into making it happen.
<ajmitch> i've seen people come in here thinking GNUe was just a VB clone ;)
<nickr> jcater: Well, at least this time there were posters that actually knew what they were talking about re the limitations
<jbailey> He also failed to *ask* any of us first.
<jcater> ajmitch: true dat
<jbailey> So I think we should have a "fuck rms" release.  Call it 1.0 without the features. =)
<ajmitch> hehe
<jamest> lol
Action: jcater will stay out of that debate :)
<jbailey> =)
<nickr> you mean it isn't a VB replacement?
<jcater> nickr: no!!!
<jcater> its an Access replacement
<jbailey> nickr: You're looking for GNU Mono.
<nickr> =O
<jbailey> =)
<jcater> silly nickr
<ajmitch> hehe
<jbailey> With the motto: "Use C#, and you'll get Mono!"
<nickr> It replaces Access but isn't an access replacement, I think is what you meant to say
<jbailey> "You'll wish you had Mono"?
<ajmitch> it isn't limited to replacing access
<jcater> nickr: I was being sarcastic... that's a common association too... ppl think we are just an access replacement
<jamest> no, wp is an access replacement
<jcater> lol
<jcater> at least in your office, eh?
<jamest> wp = word perfect for those not in the know
Action: jcater still thinks we need a wp dbdriver
<jamest> dude
<ajmitch> jcater: so GNUe's not an access replacement? dang :)
<jamest> i need reports to output wp merge file format (AKA WP Database format)
<jcater> I need reports to print money
<ajmitch> wp is still fairly popular, isn't it?
<ajmitch> lol
<jcater> ajmitch: ask him the versions he's having to support
<jbailey> If he's lucky it's 5.1 for dos. =)
<nickr> it must've been crazy to have to write stuff back then for dos
<jamest> jbailey: it is
<nickr> Write your own everything driver.
<nickr> sheesh.
<ajmitch> fun!
<jamest> per machine: wp 5.1 for DOS, 6.0 for Win 3.1, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0
<jcater> ya, they needed GNUe-Common / DOS Edition
<jcater> :)
<ajmitch> was there an emacs for DOS? :)
<jamest> 5 friggen licenses per machine
<jamest> our office has everything in wp "databases"
<ajmitch> ouch!
<jamest> and the "programs" are wp 5.1 for dos macros
<jamest> I'm trying to get forms doing more and more but there is major resistance
<ajmitch> ultraconservative office staff?
<jamest> wp doesn't do input validation so forms is more limited
<jcater> ajmitch: worse
<jcater> tenured staff
Action: ajmitch shudders
<jamest> as they can't slap an 15 email addresses into the zipcode field
Action: jamest is NOT going to get started
<jamest> he is not

<jamest> ajmitch: I love my job

<jamest> er,

<ajmitch> thought it would have to be an institution like that :)
<jcater> jamest: you're supposed to remind yourself that you love your job, not ajmitch
<ajmitch> jamest: yes, you _don't_ love me
<ajmitch> you love your job
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> what to break next
<ajmitch> i'm still searching for how to flash the screen, or do something....
<ajmitch> i don't feel like grabbing the gdk layer, inverting it, blitting it, then restoring
<jamest> jcater: you need a list?
<jcater> um
<jamest> i have 1 thing that would be very very nice
<jcater> err
Action: jcater is afraid to ask
<jcater> um
<ajmitch> uh oh
<jcater> I don't do hired assassinations
<jamest> for the tutorial
<jcater> sorry, dude
<jamest> I'm repeating the lines

<jamest> for each sample
<jamest> it would be nice if we had some way for apps to discover this at runtime
<jamest> maybe a small module installed the in default search path of python
<jcater> I can do this
Action: jcater darts off to, um, do this

<ariel_> do i need to do a setup-cvs root installation?
<btami> i don't think so
<btami> do you use latest CVS ?
<ariel_> the same within a python session:

<hjibds2> hi
<btami> hi
<hjibds2> I was told the last time that I was on someone was writing a kinda small business version of GNUe - do you know anything about it?
<btami> not too much
<btami> it's gnue-sb on savannah
<btami> and Varadhan has wrote some demo app for oracle-show IIRC
<hjibds2> do you know what the current status of the project is
<btami> what project, gnue or gnue-sb ?
<btami> i know nothing more about gnue-sb
<btami> it comes :)
<btami> ask derek
<hjibds2> what kind of status is gnue at then? i.e. how long before it is ready for production use
<btami> a: 0.4.1 coming soon
<btami> b: don't know
<hjibds2> hmmm - anything else similar at a further stage - had a dig about the net but this was the only project that i could find
<btami> yes, this IS the best project :)
<ra3vat> hjibds2: the tools is very useful already
<btami> hi ra3vat
<ra3vat> hello btami
<hjibds2> ready for use as an ERP system?
<ra3vat> hjibds2: forms, reports are tools to build your own application
<btami> ra3vat:i have i18n problems remaining in reports
<hjibds2> how hard is it to build your own apps? - I have very little programming knowledge
<hjibds2> downloaded the software yesturady but never had time to install it last night to have a look at it myself
<ra3vat> hjibds2: it may depends on application you need but mostly you do not need programming knowledge
<hjibds2> excellent
<hjibds2> It says it works with PostgreSQL so I assume it will work with RHDB2 ?
<ra3vat> hjibds2: you design form and create db and then iyt works
<hjibds2> hmmm didn't realise that it was at that stage - hopefully I'll get a chance to install it tonight
<btami> ra3vat: 1. there is only formFontEncoding in forms section
<btami> and reports read only reports section
<btami> so reportFontEncoding is needed
<btami> is gnue.conf
<btami> s/is/in
<btami> 2. dest.write fails with _content_ type data
<ra3vat> btami: i just changed encoding where header for dest.write is defined
<btami> so .encode(encoding) needed to in some place in GRLayout.py
<ra3vat> it helped to see right data, but source is still wrong with references of UTF-8
<btami> try a <out:ReportTitle> with non ascii title
<ra3vat> btami: it worked 
<ra3vat> have no time right now, sorry

<Varadhan> btami: thanx a lot for referring this small app too... :)
<Varadhan> actually we didn't do any sort of validations in it... because of the lack of time to put it in the show... ;)
<btami> Varadhan: nothing :)
<Varadhan> anyway.. we will soon be able to post the application to the gnue samples directory...
<Varadhan> btw... i need some help regarding "schema"s...
<Varadhan> what is a schema?  How it is used?
<Varadhan> ra3vat: hi.. 
<btami> its an XML markup for database definition
<Varadhan> is it compulsory for an application to define schema?
roblimo (~roblimo@pcp281688pcs.elkrdg01.md.comcast.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Varadhan> How will it be useful for an application?
<btami> no, it's not neessary for an app
<btami> it is useful for transferring data from one database to another
<btami> or filling a database with tables/data
<Varadhan> could you pls explain this more?
<grib> Varadhan: if you define the database structure with XML, you can translate it into idiomatic SQL for a specific database variety.  don't know if that's how gnue schemas are used but it's a pretty standard technique. 
Action: drochaid is back (gone 10:29:17)
<btami> you can find a good example in zipcode sample
<btami> in samples/tutorials/forms/zipcode.gsd
<btami> and there is an ooO doc around, but i can't recall where :)
<grib> infrastructure question: are there any plans to provide a gnue transaction processing server, or queueing system?  or are most gnue apps tied to synchronous database semantics (i.e. client actions block until complete)
<ariel__> grib: there are plans for this in the appserver
<ariel__> see the hallowen mail in gnue-dev mailing list
<grib> ariel__: cool, thanks.
<ra3vat> btami: i'm looking into last patches
<btami> some imports are missing jet

<btami> hi jamest
<jamest> hello
<btami> jamest: have you a little time to fix SimpleReport
<jamest> what's wrong?
<btami> 2 import lines are missing from designer.report.TemplateSupport.py
<btami> from gnue.common import GParserHelpers
<btami> from gnue.reports import GRLayout
<jamest> ah, designer not reports itself
<jamest> lemme look
<Varadhan> btami: i will check that.. thanx for your info....
Action: jamest didn't even know designer had reports templates yet :)
imoz (~jmozelesk@user216-178-90-228.netcarrier.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<imoz> Hi, I can't seem to get to the mailing list links on the gnue.org site.  Did they move?
<jamest> btami: how do you trigger the bug?
<jamest> imoz: our lists are on gnu.org now....i'll find you url to them
<imoz> thanks
<grib> jamest: for some reason the gnu ML pages aren't accessible atm
<imoz> hmm..
<jamest> yip, same here, they be down
<jamest> btami: I can't trigger the bug
<imoz> Gnue is entirely written in Python, right?
<btami> jamest: SimpleReport wizard in designer doesn't creates a good SimpleTabulation report
<jamest> yip
<imoz> so conceivably one could compile it to run on .NET?
<jamest> i know nothing about .net so I don't know
<jamest> almost everything  should run anywhere a python interpreter is avaliable
<imoz> I had this idea to create a GPL'd clone of Great Plains Dynamics on .NET in C#...and then I found Gnue.org :-)
<btami> jamest: you have to save the report (created by wizard) in designer
<btami> jamest: label-specs.dat isn't in reports setup.py too
<jamest> lol, 1 at a time please :)
<btami> but i have to go home right now :)
<imoz> It looks like Gnue's reporting tool generates reports as HTML output...  Does this work effectively for printing say an invoice on a pre-printed form?
<jamest> btami: is there more to the reports fix?
<jamest> as that file never references those libs
<jamest> imoz: gnues reporting tool outputs an XML markup 
<jamest> that can be converted to text, html, ps, pdf, whatever
<imoz> ok
<jamest> I've had people write letters in word processor of their choice
<jamest> same as PS file via windows apple laserwriter 
<jamest> then reports can merge data in 
<btami> jamest: some i18n issues i'm fighting with
<jamest> sent out about 600 faxes this way a few months back
<imoz> sweet
<jamest> btami: those imports don't fix it
<btami> jamest: please read backlog
<jamest> ok
<btami> ?
<jamest> i put them in templatesupport but they are never referenced in the code
<jamest> hang on
<jamest> btami: I'll read the logs and get to reports a bit later
<jamest> I'll fix setup.py
<jamest> what's up with i18n
<btami> huh
Action: jamest was suppossed to be doing work for client on his "day off" but prefers to GNUe :)
<btami> l8r, i have to go really now
<btami> bye
<jamest> <btami> jamest: some i18n issues i'm fighting with
btami (~tamas@ip102-205.ktv.tiszanet.hu) left irc: 
Action: jamest needs more caffine as he's lagging in that conversation 
<imoz> I just downloaded the Win32 binaries and I'm playing with the Designer... this reminds me a lot of the Great Plains "Modifier"
<jamest> imoz: a huge word of warning
<imoz> ?
<jamest> our win32 support in GNUe Forms via wxPython has issues, we're writting a win32 API ui driver during the next release cycle because we can't get what we need from wx
<jamest> it works, but it's a bit odd
<jamest> i just don't want you running a form and saying WTF!?!?!? 
<grib> jamest: so is wx not quite the x-platform miracle it was thought to be? 
<jamest> well, you can still say it but know we're working on it :)
<imoz> hehehe
<imoz> well its a lot further along than other projects so :-)
<jamest> grib: i think it's the underlying widget set for the platform
Action: grib hates thinking about windows but has to
<jamest> on X we can get ahold of certain events, in windows those events never make it to the wx level
<grib> jamest: is gtk on win32 too far from usability? 
<imoz> how did Gnue get started?  I mean, what kind of background did the core developers come from?
<jamest> imoz: http://www.gnuenterprise.org/faq.html#GNUe-FAQ-1.14
<jamest> grib: I haven't tried it yet, client of mine was nice enough to promise customer online system by 1st week of Dec
<jamest> I got the specs for that system this week and told to implement it
<jamest> but my understanding is that the gtk2 client is missing some features but is moving along nicely
<imoz> so the core mentioned in that document came from a JBOPS background?
<jamest> a what?
<imoz> JD Edwards/Baan/Oracle/Peoplesoft/SAP
<imoz> high end ERP background
<jamest> a little of everything, my experiece is with a home grown erp at a mfg plant
<jamest> using oracle and their old sql*tools
<imoz> I come from the middle-market... I used to work for a Great Plains VAR writing custom enhancements for clients, and I was working for a company called BusinessVision until they closed our office in the US.
<jamest> GNUe Forms is somewhat based upon the way Oracle SQL*Forms worked
<jamest> as both myself and jcater like that tool, however we've altered things we hated about it
<imoz> so I think an open source mid-market solution comparable to Accpac/Solomon/Dynamics would be interesting, but after finding Gnue I'm thinking instead of creating something from scratch I could use your toolset to do this?  Except I would have to learn Python :-)
<jamest> sorta
<jamest> our trigger system currently only supports python 
<jamest> but quite a bit can be done via designer w/o writting any triggers
<jamest> even learning python you'd only have to learn a small part of it
<jamest> we have a doc in cvs that give a little tutorial on it too
<jamest> should be in the next release due out any day now
<imoz> Great Plains works virtually identical to this.  They have a custom scripting language called Dexterity and a similar forms designer, etc.  Same concept of triggers, etc.
<jamest> i didn't know that 
<imoz> of course then they got bought by M$ and are now porting to .NET...
<imoz> yeah it works very similarly.  Of course you have to buy a very expensive site license to use the modified code and only dealers get access to the Dexterity tools.
<ra3vat> jamest: i did rerun setup-cvs.py and now have issue
<jamest> grib: we're getting lots of win32 patches it seems and gtk2 patches so it may work better than I think
<jamest> ra3vat?
<ra3vat> .cvsdevelbase/gnue/__init__.py is a broken link and reference gnue/common/gnue/__init__.py
<grib> jamest: good to know
<jamest> pwd
<jamest> ra3vat: could you blow away your .cvsdevelbase dir and rerun
<jamest> the setup-cvs.py
<ra3vat> did that already, the same thing
<jamest> i had jcater working on some stuff for me last nite (the fool asked what needed done.)
<jamest> i didn't think he'd chack it in though :)
<jamest> ra3vat: hang on, i'll look at it in a sec
<jamest> gotta commit btami's designer fix
<ra3vat>  /.cvsdevelbase/gnue/gnue empty dir
<jamest> alrighty then, lets see wazzup
<jamest> that's not a good thing
<ra3vat> the link points to  gnue/common/gnue/__init__.py instead of  gnue/common/src/__init__.py
<imoz> Ok, I just did File-->New-->from Wizard, picked multi-block, page form; and then put in a title "CUSTOMER MASTER",  I click next and its asking me to log in to the development database.
<jamest> yip
<imoz> Can I install the "AppServer" on Win32?
<jamest> imoz: the appserver isn't ready for real use yet
<imoz> but then, how do I access the "development database"?  I have MySQL running, but it didn't create a new database when I installed the Gnue-Tools
<jamest> those database optoins are setup in your connections.conf file
<jamest> you can put as many as you like and connect to various databases, appserver, etc
<jamest> then they are available in that dropdown you're looking at
<imoz> will it create the database for me?
<jamest> no
<jamest> well maybe
<jamest> last release == no
<imoz> ok, I looked at the sample config file in program files\gnue\etc
<imoz> if I create a blank developer database
<jamest> cvs has the start of gsd files (gnue schema definition)
<imoz> it should work?
<jamest> the wizards all build from existing table structures
<jamest> so you'd have to have the database and tables already there
<imoz> oh
<jamest> the table creation options are starting to appear in designer
<jamest> you'l l find a create schema from form option on one of the menus now
<jamest> but I have no clue how well it works
<jamest> or if it works
<imoz> trying now...
<jamest> ra3vat: than's odd
<jamest> that's
<jamest> it's actually not changed 
<jamest> something else has
<ra3vat> jamest: do you see the problem or it is only on my side?
<jamest> i see it on todays cvs
<jamest> but my install from  a few days ago has same structure and works fine
<jamest> right down to the empty gnue dir :)
<ra3vat> jamest: and after i correct the link - simple forms work, mine no
<ra3vat> DB000:   File "/usr/local/src/cvs/gnue/gnue/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/forms/GFDisplayHandler.py", line 690,
<ra3vat> in _buildDisplayHelper
<ra3vat> DB000:     return self.entry._allowedValues[str(value)]
<ra3vat> DB000: TypeError: unsubscriptable object
<jamest> sigh
<ra3vat> seems the same i had in w98 yesterday but had no time to look closer
<jamest> i assume that self.entry._allowedValues is set to None
dsmith (dsmith@oh-strongsvillecadent1-1aa-105.clvhoh.adelphia.net) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<jamest> wow, i just don't see where that changed
<imoz> well I didn't have any tables in developer, so I hooked it to my postnuke database :-)  this is pretty powerful
Action: derek is back (gone 07:35:36)
<imoz> I can't complete the wizard for a 'multipage' form but the simple form wizard works
<imoz> when i do Debug->Run it tells me there is no attribute "runFormFromTrigger"
<jamest> imoz: what fails the the multipage?
<jamest> debug->run i think is toast
<imoz> yeah the multipage
<jamest> i can try and fix it a bit
<jamest> ooo, wait
<jamest> you mean you can't run the multipage form after it completes, or that it never completes?
<imoz> I am able to put in the title of the form, specify the table I want to use, then it asks me if I want to add another table and if I want it on a new page
dimas (~ds@ics.elcom.ru) joined #gnuenterprise.
<imoz> clicking Continue generates an error in the console window
<jamest> can you give me error?
<jamest> imoz: you are running cvs right?
<imoz> I am running "GNUe-Tools-0.4.0a-setup-debug-on.exe"
<imoz> :-)
<imoz> I downloaded it this morning to have a look
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> damn
<jamest> um, wizards in 0.4.0 IIRC had issues that slipped by us
<jamest> lemme scrounge up some 0.4.1prereleases for you
<jamest> or make some :)
<dimas> how one can paste from damn dos window?
<jamest> dimas: from inside windows?
<imoz> can I just download the latest scripts from CVS and then copy them to the appropriate folders?
<jamest> dimas: there is a toolbar with a dottted box on it.....jamest can't recall if XP is the same
<jamest> imoz: no, our tools typically undergo major internal changes between 0.0.1 releases :)
<imoz> oh... :-)
<jamest> i'll have to build some as only source are availabe
<jamest> which means I need to install the windows tools here
<imoz> hmm
<jamest> it'll take me a bit
<imoz> I have ActivePython installed
<imoz> can I build it myself?
<derek> jamest: i think wx is pretty good xplatform if you have limited resources (i.e. better than anything else)
<derek> however its not perfect
<jamest> you might not even need to build it, someone added a run from cvs tree for windows a few days back
<derek> i think it has done us well... i.e. quick xplatform to get people interested and get us supported with little effort
<jamest> but, yes, you can build yourself
<derek> now that we have a bigger base i think it will be nice to see naitve, win32, gtk, qt 
<jamest> if you do that then I suggest you grab cvs copy 
<jamest> derek: the forms feature plan page has changed
<derek> yeah i noticed :)
<jamest> you'll find win32api next
<derek> i think its a good change
<imoz> ok I am looking at the 0.4.0.99-pre2 tarballs on the CVS browser on the website right now
<imoz> should that work?
<jamest> imoz: yes
<derek> i think you are sick for being eager to write one, but its a good thing(tm) ;)
<jamest> derek: i wanted to rework the gfd format to seperate layout from logic 
<jamest> btami asked for a feature that would be easy once seperated
<jamest> so i spoke w/ jcater about it
<jamest> we decided that the forms documentation wouldn't be that good if we changed the file format right after we release the docs
<jamest> :)
<jamest> btw - I'm writting a GNUe Common usage guide that shows you how to write non-gnue apps with common
<derek> grib: do you or linas still maintain gnucash or have you given it over to derek atkins?
<jamest> should make it into 0.4.1
<derek> jamest: yummy gcvs script is nice for such things
<jamest> imoz: if you can run cvs however I can (attempt) to fix issues for you in real time
<jamest> derek: yeah, but that'll probably  go away too 
<jamest> the code exists to make gnue self aware of it's install 
<jamest> however we're having issues with distutils
<jamest> ra3vat: you here?
<dimas> yes
<jamest> try replaceing that sym link to __init__.py
<derek> dimas: multi personality like moi now a days :)
<jamest> with just an empty __init__.py via touch
<dimas> jamest: can't find how to paste into xchat now
<grib> derek: linas still has nominal control (and is sentimentally attached to it :) but derek is really the main guy these days.  honestly I don't even have gnucash installed on my machines -- wife wants to use quicken/mac :/
<jamest> middle mouse button on the line you type on
jcater (~jason@w202.z065105010.mem-tn.dsl.cnc.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> derek: you get around
<jamest> dimas: I'm pretty sure you want that .cvsdevelbase/gnue/__init__.py to not link into the src dir
<jamest> as it's just a placeholder
<jamest> i have no idea when we lost common/gnue/__init__.py as my copy is ancient
<jcater> last night
<jamest> but it's just an empty file
Action: jcater will fix
<jamest> jcater: i already did
<jamest> replaced with a touch 
<grib> derek: my developers made lots and lots of contributions a while back, but we are in the process of starting over for our stuff -- too much cruft in gnucash
<jcater> oh
<grib> derek: which is why i've been hanging around here more lately :)
<jamest> jcater: that OK?
<jcater> if it works, I guess so :)
<dimas> jamest: middle button work that way under w98?
<derek> why start over, use gnue ;)
<jamest> dimas: depends on the x server
<jamest> try both buttons to simulate middle click
<imoz> ok, I am confused.  I downloaded GNUe-Designer-0.4.0.99-pre2.zip, then from a console window ran setup.py install.  It put everything in C:\Python22
<derek> jamest have you had psu integrate your feature maps into the website?
<jamest> no, as I don't think they're ready
<imoz> I guess I need to do this for all of the source packages for this to work?
<imoz> :-)
<jamest> imoz: if you run the cvs copy there is a script
<jamest> i think that fakes the install on windows
<grib> derek: it's possible.  there's a lot of overlap, and some of the stuff you guys have done looks really nice.  
grib (~grib@grib.customer.jump.net) left irc: Remote closed the connection
grib (~grib@grib.customer.jump.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> ra3vat: any luck?
<derek> grib: we have a ways to go, but i think we have some solid stuff 
<imoz> I don't have a CVS client for windows
<ra3vat> jamest: and what about  _allowedValues? how is that my form require something to define?
<jamest> ra3vat: i'm looking now
<imoz> ok, using the web access I see a script in the root of the cvs, setup-cvs-win.py
<imoz> is that the script?
<jamest> yeah
<jamest> but you have to have the whole cvs tree
<derek> imoz: be warned that is VERY new
<derek> and likely could have buglets :)
<jamest> jcater: you happen to have your windows setup there to do exe's?
<derek> but several people have used it successfully
<jcater> jamest: not really
<derek> jamest: i can create a setup farm for windows at work
<derek> if someone tells me the stuff i need
<jamest> derek: don't touch it
<jamest> derek: don't you dare
<jamest> derek: as we both know what will happen
<imoz> ok, how can I easily download the entire CVS tree from Windows? :-)
<jcater> imoz: one of two things
<jamest> <derek>: um, is the thing supposed to blow the monitor, set off the burger alarm, and cause my cat to get zits?
<jcater> grab wincvs or something similar and download
<jcater> or you can grab a snapshot of last night's cvs at
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/snapshots.php
<jcater> (there are .ZIP files there)
<imoz> well I just downloaded all the -0.4.0.99pre2 .ZIP files, will this script work with those?
<jcater> I don't know much about the setup-cvs-win script
<jamest> ra3vat: you have a dropdown on your form?
<ra3vat> jamest: many of the sample forms work mine complains about allowedValues (see above) but it worked yesterday. what inside a form may cause this?
<ra3vat> yes i have
<jamest> that's where things are going bad
<jamest> as dropdowns do define the _allowedValues
<imoz> ok much easier, I am downloading gnue-cvs-current.zip
<jamest> is your dropdown values being puleed from a query or a static datasource?
<ra3vat> i have both
<jamest> ra3vat: have you tried replacing that __init__.py yet?
Action: jamest doesn't think having the common __init__.py would effect the install in any way but wants to make sure
<ra3vat> yes, without that form did not start at all
<jamest> i mean with a blank file not a link into common/src
<ra3vat> i did blank
<jamest> can you confirm that the tables you're pulling dropdowns from contain data?
<jamest> better yet
<jamest> let me find a sample dropdown form here and see if I can reproduce
<ra3vat> i have simple form with one entry. i get the same error as only add style="dropdown" to it
<jamest> ra3vat: you need to have on that entry the attributes
<jamest> fk_description , fk_key, fk_source
<ra3vat> what attibutes?
<jamest> without them it won't populate the allowedValues IIRC
<jamest> try this form
<jamest> gnue/common/utils/connection.gfd
<ra3vat> ok, but i have all this in main form and it worked, checking now
<imoz> ugg, PythonDotNet won't build on the v1 framework sdk.  I suppose there won't be a way to compile Gnue for .NET unless wxWindows is ported anyway
<jamest> well, until we get the win32 ui driver up
<jamest> but i doubt we'll see designer redone in win32 api :(
<ra3vat> jamest: sorry, it was my fault, i've added one more entry wanting it to be dropdown but without needed attibutes
<jamest> ra3vat: I will add check for this
ariel__ (~ariel@ppp-217-133-242-73.dialup.tiscali.it) left irc: "Uscita dal client"
<imoz> does the Reports designer work in the latest cvs snapshot?
<derek> no
grib (~grib@grib.customer.jump.net) left irc: Connection reset by peer
grib (~grib@grib.customer.jump.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> it does in cvs
<jamest> but that's as of like 8:15AM today
<imoz> I am downloading the latest "hourly" snapshot
<jcater> jamest???
<jcater> we don't have a reports designer yet
<jcater> unless someone was a coding machine last night :)
<jamest> not graphically
<jcater> we have a report wizard
<jcater> but no visual designer
<jamest> but the wizard will spit out a basic report
<jamest> sorry, i was mis-stating our support
<derek> jcater: you have to watch him, i think im rubbing off on him :)
<jcater> no shit
<jamest> not intentionally
<imoz> well here's what I was thinking of doing to try this out
Action: jcater was about to ask if there were two dereks here today :)
Action: jamest is multitasking
<imoz> on my desktop I was going to load up my demo version of Great Plains Dynamics Release 6, dump out the customer master tables from MS SQL Server
<imoz> load them into MySQL
<imoz> and try and duplicate the customer maintenance screen
<derek> bahhhh bhahhhh
Action: derek is plugging his ears
<jamest> imoz: the odbc driver may allow a direct connection to ms sql
<jamest> i'm not using it but I believe it still works
<derek> imoz: certainly you can do this, please please make sure none of it makes it upstream into gnue packages
<jcater> yes, that will kill us
<derek> as surely we would be in trouble
<imoz> hehehe
<derek> if you want to 'study' great plains
<derek> and learn from it great
<derek> if you want to rip and gut and use for personal stuff great
<imoz> this is just a test for myself :-)
<derek> just dont submit back as proposals to gnue (as we dont want to slapped later) ;)
<derek> imoz: cool
<derek> i think its a good idea
<derek> just making it publicly known we keep the code clean :)
<imoz> I am totally new to gnue as of like 4 am this morning so... I just want to try it out and see how far I can get with it at this point
<imoz> I also have a demo version of Visual AccountMate
<imoz> but that's FoxPro based.
<imoz> My initial idea before I even discovered new was to write an open source middle-market accounting package in .NET using C#, and hope it will run on Mono when that is further along.
<imoz> err new=gnue
<jamest> but if you write an open source middle-market accounting package in gnue then you can just hope it'll run
<jamest> :)
<imoz> hehehe
<imoz> What I would like to see is an open source QuickBooks like app that imports a QBB file and interoperates with the qbXML API so all the 3rd party add-ons for QB would work
<imoz> then a seamless upgrade path to something on the level of ACCPAC/SBT/etc.
<nickr_> gah, great plains
Nick change: nickr_ -> nickr
<imoz> Quickbooks-like-app + Goldmine-like-app + OpenOffice + Evolution + seamless website content manager/e-commerce = could be a powerful motivator for small businesses to use Linux
<derek> hmmm
<imoz> I have a DLL that I bought a year ago with a sample app, it opens a QBB file and dumps the entire database structure + data into MS Access
<derek> gnue-sb = quickbooks + manufacturing + goldmine + ecommerce
<imoz> :-)
<derek> w/ open office integration
<nickr> SB?
<imoz> I just searched gnue-sb on google and the only thing that comes up is the irc logs :-)  and a "kernel buddy" guide with some esoteric discussion about licensing issues
<jamest> it's something derek's been working on 
<jamest> i don't know details as I was playing hookie from gnue when it was started
<ra3vat> may i add ConnectString to connections.conf definition?
<jamest> what's it do?
<imoz> Will you be able to add images etc. to a Gnue or Gnue-sb form to make the forms look pretty for idiot users?  Kind of how quickbooks is dumbed down for the lowest common denominator user?
<jamest> eventually we plan to support image boxes
<jamest> however we're not going to be a full widget set
<derek> http://www.nongnu.org/gnue-sb/
<jamest> you'll never create quickbooks or quicken in a gnue form
<jamest> er, create that look
<jamest> my personal outlook on this is that widget sets are too complex for most issues
<jamest> and that I'm always amazed at the number of windows "registers" that basically has a telnet box open to an app running in text mode
<jamest> at the bank, the hardware store, the county office, etc, etc
<imoz> hehehe yeah
<imoz> Compiere apparently has a POS system, but it's Java and...I dunno there's something about it that I can't put my finger on
<jcater> imoz: perhaps that it requires jdk and Oracle licenses?
<jcater> :)
<imoz> so at this stage, no work has been done on the actual 'modules' of Gnue, just the tools?
<imoz> i.e. Gnue Financials etc.
<ra3vat> jamest: i'm looking into code that checks encoding from gnue.conf for additional connection command
<jamest> and this command would do what?
Action: jamest isn't sure what you're trying to achieve
<dimas> it's a local crap
<nickr> ahh, small buisness
<nickr> BIDNESS
<dimas> sometimes i need to pass "SET CLIENT ENCODING TO WIN" for postgres
<nickr> gnue has sqlite support no?
<jamest> gnue has sqlite support yes
<nickr> hmm
<nickr> no debian package for python-psqlite
<jamest> dimas: i don't have a prblem with it
<derek> nickr: mush mush boy, get it done ;)
<jamest> jcater: do you?
<jcater> um
<dimas> jamest: w98, prerelease-1 tabbed form started, i hit f8, f9 and data from all pages comes upon each other
<jcater> I thought that was settable in connections.conf
<jcater> you could add an 
<jcater> encoding = win
<jcater> to your connections.conf entry
<jcater> is that no longer there?
<dimas> yes, it works
<dimas> i forgot it should be win not cp1251
<dimas> jamest: then i clicks on tabs and all looks great but first time it all mixed
<nickr> I have have a local connections.conf right?
<nickr> *can* have.
<jamest> i believe so
<nickr> hrm, how do I specifiy a sqlite database?
<jamest> provider = sqlite
<nickr> right
<nickr> tehn?
<jamest> ah, hang on
<nickr> dbname = file ?
<jamest> i think so
<jamest> I'm looking
<nickr> hmm, it doesn't seem to find it
<nickr> er, it doesn't appear in the connections menu item in designer at l/east
<jamest> nickr what's the entry look like?
<nickr> [sps]
<nickr> comment = SPSnet Database
<nickr> provider = sqlite
<nickr> dbname = /home/nick/spsnetdata.sqlite
<nickr> thats in ~/.gnue/connections.conf
<nickr> I can import sqlite in python, also. Just as an aside. So I'm pretty sure its working.
<jamest> let me verify the connections.ocnf thing
<jamest> as I think it uses same conf as gnue.conf which means you can have local 
<nickr> it'd be cool if gnue had some sort of integration with glabels
<jcater> glabels?
<jamest> nickr try running designer like
<jamest> gfdes ----connections ~/.gnue/connections.conf
<nickr> jcater: its this ultra slick little label generator, with barcodes and data merging. If you could give it a gnue connection to merge from.. it'd be sweet :)
<jamest> we do not currently seem to support more than one connectoins.conf file merged together
<nickr> DB000: gnue.common.GDataObjects.ProviderNotSupportedError: No database driver found for provider type 'sqlite'
<jamest> however I think this could be added and modeled about the gnue.conf loading code
<nickr> doh.
<jcater> nickr: we're already there :)
<nickr> jcater: ?
<dimas> how to cleanly updates to prerelease2 under win32? should i remote pre-1 first?
<jamest> i would
<imoz> Where can I download this linkd.exe file that is needed by setup-cvs-win.py?  I am on Windows XP Home Edition and have fsutils.exe but not linkd.exe.
<derek> ok time to run to work
<derek> at least i got something done this morning
<derek> dcl is dangerous, you can find stuff to do you never planned on doing :)
<ra3vat> imoz: /common/utils/win-links.txt
<ra3vat> imoz: soory there are no links there
<imoz> my search on google says it is in the Win2k resource kit, which I don't own
Action: derek is away: work
<nickr> so what do I do about the no database driver found?
<jamest> nickr: that's a sign that something in that driver is broken
<jamest> our try except there sucks
<jamest> any error loading == no provider found :(
<jamest> give me a bit
<nickr> okee
<nickr> thanks
<imoz> when I search for linkd.exe on google the first thing that comes up is the IRC logs for this channel on nov 12th
<imoz> where it says it was in CVS but was removed because it is 'nonfree'
<imoz> i find it odd GNU makes all this fuss about stuff like that, yet there site Savannah is running sourceforge and gives no credit to them
<nickr> jamest: btw, I only needed two dashes in --connection, not four
<jamest> imoz: it was closed code that we were not allowed to distribute
<dimas> imoz: it is known feature for many other things :)
<nickr> --connections rather.
<jamest> imoz: it's on the developers page.....talks about being a fork of sourceforge
<jamest> imoz: as for the code, i'm not sure MS would have liked finding pieces of XP in our cvs
<jamest> nickr: sorry
<imoz> uggh
<imoz> is there another version of the script that doesn't require linkd?
<nickr> not a problem. :)
<jamest> that reminds me
<jamest> if they were just cvs deleted then they'd still be available via the cvs web site
<jamest> deleted files get moved from the dir they were in into a dir called attic in the same directory
<jamest> that way any previous image of cvs can be checked out at in time in the future
<jamest> I'd better go manually remove those files from the repository before someone finds them
<derek> imoz: if you have seen their code, its barely sourceforge at all
<derek> it might 'look' like sourceforge but it aint sourceforge
<jamest> derek: I'm going to fix the gateway
<derek> also nothing in the gpl states you need give credit to anyone other than via copyright
<derek> jamest: sucker :)
<derek> its ticket 150
<jamest> but I'll need you to test as I have no clue how things are submitted
<derek> ok let me know when its fixed
<jamest> but first I have to remove those exes from cvs
<derek> i have to run to work
<jamest> as anyone that visits http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/gnue/common/utils/Attic/ could grab a copy
<derek> might not be able to test until tonight
<jamest> imoz: you here?
<imoz> hehehe
<imoz> :-)
<jamest> any luck finding a workaround yet?
<derek> gack its 10:30
Action: derek RUNS to work ;)
<imoz> worked great :-)
<jamest> i'm glad you found a workaround
<jamest> those files are now gone, hope nobody got them
<imoz> hmm.  the script tells me that it cannot find db2html
<jamest> does it fail?
<jamest> as that's docbook 2 html
<jamest> which isn't really needed to run the thing
<imoz> it tells me "Cannot generate documentation, could not find db2html in path"  then 'C:\Documents' is not recognized as an internal command...blah blah
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> i wish ra3vat was here
<jamest> i think he wrote that, or was it art
<imoz> I think its because I am trying to install it from My Documents\gnue-cvs-current\
<imoz> the path has a space in it
<ra3vat> no it is Arturas thing
<imoz> I'm trying to install it to simply C:\GNUe
<imoz> yeah that was it
<imoz> I moved it to C:\gnue-cvs-current
<imoz> however the script says "Installation finished successfully" however just above it I see the output as if linkd were run with no arguments/parameters
<jamest> this is really out of my league, i don't have XP at the house and haven't used linkd before
<jamest> so I don't know what's normal
<jamest> imoz: I'm really sorry you're having these issues
<imoz> well it seems to have installed correctly
<jamest> by next week we'll have a 0.4.x release (we hope) 
<jamest> with exes
<imoz> :-)
<imoz> i could probably make this a lot easier on myself if I reboot my desktop into Linux but... ahh..then I can't watch TV on my desktop :-)
<jamest> anyone here no dcl?
<jamest> s/no/know
<imoz> ok, so if I cd into \gnue-cvs-current\.cvsdevelbase\gnue\designer and run Designer.py
<imoz> I get an error line 61 no module named wxPython.wx
<jamest> you have to install the wx package
<jamest> www.wxpython.org
<jamest> our exes bundle everything together
Action: jamest really, really, REALLY hopes that after all this, the cvs wizard works from imoz
<jamest> s/from/for
<imoz> :-)
<jamest> i have to go pick up the wife for lunch...we're a 1 car family
<jamest> bbia1h
<imoz> ok

<jcater> you obviously haven't been looking at my code
<jcater> :)
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> jcater: what should getSchemaByName return? :)
<jcater> um
<ajmitch> for csv driver
<jcater> oh
<jcater> it should probably just call the other getSchema function
<ajmitch> right
<jcater> as one returns all tables, the other one table
<ajmitch> k
<jcater> but i *think* getSchemaByName doesn't return a list
<jcater> just one object
<jcater> I'm not 100
<jcater> 100% sure about that last part
<ajmitch> it returns a GDataObjects.Schema
<ajmitch> of which i guess i just set the parameters to whatever i feel suits :)
<ra3vat> i've got a screenshot of screwed form on w98. anyone want to look at?

<jcater> yeah
<psu> I call it a "Xanadu moment" 
<jcater> reminds me of Designer 0.0.1
<psu> as per Samuel Taylor Coleridge
<psu> & the man from Porlock
<dneighbo> ajmitch i suppose there should be 3 ways (at least to do schema introspection on csv)
<nickr> psu: a stately pleasure dome decree'd?
<dneighbo> one is the header row(s) define the 'table'
<dneighbo> two is a separate flat file defines the 'table'
<dneighbo> three is an separate xml flat file defines teh 'table'
<psu> nickr: if the caverns really were measureless to man, that would be a practical use for infitine precision maths module
<nickr> Indeed
<jcater> four is it could be part of the datasource definition
<ajmitch> dneighbo: i thought you didn't want this to be complex :)
<jcater> ajmitch: he just says that to get someone to volunteer
Action: jcater ducks
<ajmitch> actually i did comment my code
<dneighbo> roflmao
<ajmitch> and i even understand how it works this morning
<dneighbo> i dont want it complex
<dneighbo> im cool with simple
<dneighbo> and growing it
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> spread 'fertiliser' on it & watch it grow :)
<psu> how is ash mail fwd done?
<psu> is it simple .forward?

siesel (jan@dial-213-168-72-7.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> evening :)
<ratmice> er um it has 2 points of entry
<ratmice> like <staticset> </staticset> and guessing <form></form>
<ratmice> it would be much easier if they were seperated
<ajmitch> hi siesel
<ratmice> so that a single form could work with multiple static sets
<ratmice> hey siesel
<ratmice> i want to talk to you, have to leave soon
<jcater> ratmice: I'm sorry, but I don't follow
<ratmice> it's like a .c file with 2 mains
<siesel> hi ajmitch, hi ratmice
<ratmice> so in order to write a staticset file I *think* i'd have to write out he form which generated it
<jcater> a staticset is just that, static
Action: siesel don't think that we need to write to a staticset, but could be wrong
<jcater> it isn't updated by a form
Action: ratmice is actually working on a dynamicset
<jcater> ratmice: for?
<siesel> you can use sqllite for that.
<ratmice> offline 
<jcater> or, if you really wanted something even simpler than sqlite
<jcater> you could use csv files
Action: jcater shudders at the thought of doing that with forms
<jcater> but you could
Action: psu is away: I'm busy
<ajmitch> jcater: so i'm wrong to be using STATIC_DataObject? :)
<jcater> ajmitch: as your base?
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> class CSV_DataObject(STATIC_DataObject):
<jcater> probably not
<jcater> at least for now
<ajmitch> ok
<jcater> when I was thinking about it
<jcater> that was my plans too :)
<ajmitch> it seemed more suitable than the DBSIG driver :)
Action: jcater has happy ajmitch is doing it instead, though
<jcater> definitely
<ajmitch> i been lurking around here long enough
Action: ajmitch wonders why file.readline() didn't throw an exception at EOF
<jcater> returns None iirc
<ajmitch> right
<dneighbo> well cause python is smart
<dneighbo> if its the end your done 
<dneighbo> why give you back an exception :)
<siesel> dneighbo, jcater: short question about GSD: Should all strings be a varchar (in case of postgres)?
<siesel> or a char? 
<ajmitch> varchar
<ajmitch> imho :)
<dneighbo> no char
<dneighbo> varchar
<dneighbo> or text
<dneighbo> string(length) should be varchar(length)
<dneighbo> text should be text
<dneighbo> binary should be blob
Action: dneighbo doesnt have cvs or doc near by
<dneighbo> can i ask what you are doing in gsd?
<dneighbo> we are EXTREMELY overhauling it
<dneighbo> so its probably better to stay out until its reasonably done
<dneighbo> or work very closely with us on it
<dneighbo> as if its broke mid stream i will get really ticked :)
<dneighbo> i have deadlines depending on its current course
Action: siesel tried to do the later
<dneighbo> plus i dont want you doing work that will be overwritten if its not going same direction :)
<siesel> that's the reason why I want to talk about it.
<dneighbo> cool, just clarifying
<dneighbo> we are moving away from xslt to a large degree (as you probably gathered)
<ajmitch> whereas i can play with stuff that nobody else wants to touch :)
<dneighbo> certainly it will be supported if someone wants to maintain it
Action: siesel thought that xslt was just the option for all the guys who want to have GSD but don't want to use python
<jcater> GSD is still a standard markup
<jcater> no more no less
<jcater> and we didn't want gnue-common as a requirement, not necessarily python
<jcater> even though, to get it working quickly, I am using gnue-common
<jcater> but that can be removed later on
<siesel> the only thing I'm not shure about is: why did you decided to make GSD using less datatypes.
<jcater> it was never intended to support those
<jcater> somewhere along the line
<jcater> it got goat-raped
<jcater> and all those things added
<dneighbo> um it didnt support a bunch to begin with
<dneighbo> the original dcl spec had one or two more than we have now
<dneighbo> but what wsa in cvs got trashed
<dneighbo> i.e. lots of datatypes added and support in designer broke
<dneighbo> i was in a pinch so discussed with jcater and we documented and revamped back to original vision
<dneighbo> i went to make new style sheets for XSLT and decided they were more cumbersome to maintain than a program
<dneighbo> so we are making a program
<dneighbo> certainly any XSLT stud could come and modify the XSL to make it a viable alternative
<dneighbo> not only do we encourage it, we hope it happens
<dneighbo> GNUe is about choice after all
<dneighbo> as for tying to common, im not wholly against that as with XSLT one can break that dependency
<siesel> so, if I understand it right, then the scripter thing is the replacement for the xslt scripts.
<jcater> for our internal use, at least
<siesel> I just try to look to the future behind that deadline :)
<dneighbo> yes
<jcater> our first priority has to be our tools
<dneighbo> but dont forget that doesnt mean someone cant or shouldnt fix the XSLT stuff (or that we wont down the road)
<dneighbo> we are not _closing_ that door
<dneighbo> we just choose to not walk through it
<jcater> I want to design stuff that other projects can use
<jcater> e.g., formats, etc
<jamest> w/o common?
<jcater> but that doesn't mean I can put that objective ahead of it being usable for GNUe
<jcater> that's just mho
<siesel> no, thats right.
<siesel> I don't really like the xslt's 
<psu> it's like the appserver for dotGNU issue
<ajmitch> hmm?
<jcater> psu: exactly!
<psu> we won;t discourage it
<psu> but 
<psu> we won;t compromise making AppServer the best possible business application server
<psu> for our purposes
<ajmitch> but we won't go out of our way to do stuff for those lazy dotgnu beggars
<ajmitch> right?
<jamest> ajmitch: the only person we won't go out of our way for is dneighbo
<ajmitch> http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/021114/161/2oheh.html
<ajmitch> SCARY
<jamest> in fact i think we go out of our way to get in his way
<siesel> I just have two concerns: 1. how abstract will GSD be? I.e. will it still be usable for appserver? 2. what about gsd->sql generation in dbdriver and gsd->sql driver in scripter.
<jcater> we wanted GSD to be abstract
<jcater> not to be an XML version of postgres sql
<jcater> with some translators for other dbs
<jcater> well, scripter is in common
btami (~btami@3e70d730.dialin.enternet.hu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> so the dbdrivers can certainly use it
<ajmitch> how would dbdrivers use it?
<jcater> ajmitch: are you asking me or siesel?
<ajmitch> either
<ajmitch> whoever can answer my question in a lucid manner
<jcater> eventually, a dbdriver can take a schema def and actually create the underlying tables
<jcater> schema scripter (the scripts in debate here)
<jcater> create SQL statements
<jcater> so the dbdrivers could just call scripter to get the SQL statements to run
<ajmitch> ooh fancy
<jcater> once again, though, in the scheme of things, is not a huge priority
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> jcater: If I understand you right, it means to remove the schema writing code which is allready in dbdriver, and replace it with a link to scripter. 
<jcater> I see no schema writing code in dbdriver
<jcater> where's that at?
<siesel> there is some in pgsql
<jcater> I see a dict
<siesel> the code could be in dbsig too.
Action: siesel has a look
<dneighbo> i will be first to pipe up
<dneighbo> i still have issues with appserver being all about objects
Action: dneighbo still thinks appserver should be remote data/logic 
<dneighbo> not necessarily relational2object
Action: dneighbo realizes this is an entirely different discussion that likely will erupt wars
<siesel> its in common/src/dbdriver/_dbsig/DBdriver.py: _buildTableDefinition etc.
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> imho this is putting a lot of stuff in dataobjects
<jcater> I was hoping they wouldn;t get too much more complex
<dneighbo> is there a reason we have that in the drivers?
Action: dneighbo can see some advantages but worries about bloat
Action: siesel sees raping goat running over him
<dneighbo> raping goats dont run over, they well....make good salesmen for lube...
Action: ajmitch wonders if DotGNU should have it's own appserver compatible with GNUe? :)
<dneighbo> well im not against object2relational and vice versa
<dneighbo> but i would rather see us start small and work way up
<dneighbo> i see very valuable use of remote db and trigger access
<dneighbo> w/o ever dealing with an object
<btami> may i ask you (python mastas) something about i18n in general ?
<btami> i have a dilemma
<btami> 1. use sitecuspomize.py for setdefaultencoding()
<btami> 2. use uncoding in every place where it needed
<ajmitch> jcater / dneighbo: as an idea, specify a directory in connections.conf & have *.csv be a set of tables? (extension configurable, i guess)
<ajmitch> for CSV
<btami> s/uncoding/encoding
<btami> i myself used 1. before ,and i was happy
gilbertbsd (~gilbertbs@67.97.122.14) joined #gnuenterprise.
<btami> but today i remowed my sitecustomize.py
<gilbertbsd> so how is GNUe?
<btami> to test for release
<ajmitch> GNUe is GNUe :)
<btami> and got errors from several places
<ajmitch> it is lurching along as usual (another release soon)
<btami> jamest/jcater ?
<btami> the problem with 1. there is only one place (sitecustomize.py) where setdefaultencoding() is callable
<gilbertbsd> so has GNUe been tried anywhere yet?
<gilbertbsd> ie deployed?
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> afaik it's being used quite a bit by the main developers in production
<ajmitch> at least forms, designer, and reports
psu (psu@81.98.44.42) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> wb psu
<psu> thnx
<ajmitch> np
<jamest> btami: 
<jamest> btami: are you saying we need a way to modify sitecustomize.py during setup?
<btami> i don't know, arturas doesn't liked that
<btami> becouse it's not a place only for GNUe
<jcater> well
<jcater> imho
<jcater> in production environments, we will probably have a "custom" python install
<jcater> in which it wouldn't make a difference
<jcater> I don't know what else to do though
<jcater> without changing all file open() commands to a codec.open(file, encoding='unicode')
<jcater> which will suck
<jamest> i don't think a small alteration to the file (prompted for of course) is that big an issue
roblimo (~roblimo@pcp281688pcs.elkrdg01.md.comcast.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<btami> if we can use our sitecustomize.py with setdefaultencoding()
<btami> then no need for many *.encode(encoding)
<btami> and python do the rest
<btami> the remaining problem, how an install process gets the correct encoding
<btami> maybe a popup like in a debian install
<jamest> i think it'd have to be
<jamest> as this is different from the locale setting isn't it?
<btami> yes
<btami> LC_ALL=hu_HU
<btami> encoding in python is ISO8859-2
<btami> or cp1250
<btami> for me
<btami> s/ISO/iso
pattieja (~pattieja@www.pcxperience.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<btami> python can grab encoding from XP/2000 and from LC_ALL in *nix
<jcater> btami: can, or does by default?
Action: jcater is curious
<btami> my sitecustomize.py in XP/2000:
<btami> import sys, locale
<btami> loc = locale.getdefaultlocale()
<btami> if loc[1]:
<btami>   sys.setdefaultencoding(loc[1])
<btami> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, '')
<btami> print 'Default encoding: %s' %sys.getdefaultencoding()
<btami> print 'Locale conventions: %s' %locale.localeconv()
<btami> it does
<btami> i don't know how about win9x
<jcater> is that your custom sitecustomize.py, or the one installed by default?
<btami> it's my custom
<jcater> I really hate that you can't change encoding in your app
<btami> there no sitecustomize.py exist per default
<jcater> that is a really bizarre design decision for python to make
<jcater> :(
<btami> s/there/there is
<dneighbo> upgrade tiem bbl
dneighbo (www-data@alt1.libertydistribution.com) left #gnuenterprise.
<btami> so i don't no what is the best way to go
<btami> sitesustomize.py or use of .encode(encoding)

<lupo> what's up in argentina?
<StyXman> rains
<btami> StyXman: sorry for question, but what is your sys.getdefaultencoding() ?
<StyXman> floods from the sky
<StyXman> btami: _my_ ... ah!
<StyXman> btami: just a sec
<StyXman> our server reports ISO-8859-1, but it could (should) be ISO-8859-15, I guess
<ajmitch> hi StyXman, lupo
<StyXman> jcater: so?
<jamest> btami: i'd hate to see it everywhere
<jamest> vs in one location
<jcater> StyXman: I had to go with your solution
<jcater> mine didn't work liek I thought
<StyXman> but it didn't went into cvs?
<jcater> no?
Action: jcater looks
<StyXman> btami: no, I missed it. ISO-8859-1 is the right one
<btami> :(
<lupo> hi ajmitch, jcater
<StyXman> why?
<StyXman> I mean, why that face?
<lupo> StyXman: because it rains at his location too? :)
<btami> i want to see someone with non ascii and non iso8859-1

<btami> and not utf :)
<StyXman> ah
<StyXman> any russioan here? no european?
Action: siesel , lupo, reinhard, johannes are european
<lupo> StyXman: here, i have iso-8859-1 or -15 (locale is de_DE@euro)

<jcater> it appears to be in cvs
<siesel> lupo: did you tried de_DE@utf8
<lupo> hi siesel
<siesel> hi Christian
<lupo> siesel: nope. what's special about that / what's the difference?
<StyXman> jcater: in GFForm?
<btami> i want someone testing forms/reports/designer(vizards) with other than ascii/iso8859-1
<siesel> it seems to work only in uxterm, /me hasn't tried it with forms yer.
<siesel>  /yer/yet/
<btami> jamest: are you voteing for sitecustomize ?
<StyXman> jcater: no, forget it. I remembered it.
<StyXman> jcater: zanxs
<lupo> jcater: i see you fixed the setup-cvs2.py to setup-cvs-win.py
<btami> sorry, but west-europeans arn't good candidates for testing i18n :)

<nickr> is there like a standard XML database dump format? Like if Iwere to export all the contents of a database into an XML file ...
<jbailey> I can't see there being.
<jbailey> I would just imagine that you'd give each field name to an element and dump.
<jbailey> XML is really bad for representing databases, though.
<jbailey> You'd have to dump a Schema at the same time to give you characteristics of each field.
<jbailey> And XML implies that order is important.
<nickr> hmm, a normal overly-complicated xml solution.
<jbailey> Hardly.
<jbailey> It's exactly the right level of complexity.
<jbailey> The problem with tab or CSV is that it's lossy.
<jbailey> You lose the details that you've asked for about structural requirements in the cell.
<jbailey> If you didn't care about that, then tab delimited is probably a better choice anyway.  It's easier to parse.
<nickr> Uh huh.
<jbailey> The other two cases where using XML is worthwhile is:
<jbailey> 1) Occasional Binary data, or data that uses the intended separators.
<jbailey> 2) Where you want to remove the relationships and build up complete records.

<jcater> why would I need anything else?
<derek> roflmao
<derek> mdean: i do 
<derek> actually im pretty good at that
<derek> my pasting was of things that were broken
<derek> i.e. those were real failed tickets
<mdean> did you paste the msg directly into psql?
<derek> no
<derek> i did minor clean up first
<mdean> do you have a copy of the original you could forward to me?
<derek> yeah 
<derek> grr i cant email well from here
<mdean> you have an im client?
<mdean> or /msg me
<derek> grr yeah to both
<derek> ok msged you
<derek> hey is website in cvs for dcl
<derek> i.e. i was going to modify roadmap some so we can get on same page and get .9 out door
<mdean> old version was locally, but not now
<mdean> templates/default/roadmap.tpl is the file to modify iirc
<mdean> derek: paste buffer overrun?
<derek> ?
<derek> doing more than one thing
<mdean> the last line I got was
<mdean>  Proprietary ERP vendors are unusual amongst proprietary software vendors, in that they often allow you some access to some
<derek> mdean thats all there is
<mdean> just making sure :)
<derek> that is multiple email
<derek> the mail to the gateway is within that
<derek> and it had an attachment
<mdean> DBD::Pg::st execute failed: ERROR:  Unicode >= 0x10000 is not

<mdean> yup - that's it
<mdean> his sig

<mdean> special char
<mdean> I removed that and it went in
<derek> can we support unicode?
<derek> as we have LOTS of non us folks submitting tickets

<mdean> hehe

<derek> even if we could 'find' them and remove them
<derek> or such
<derek> mdean: if you are bored want to fix attachments too :)
<mdean> I told you what was wrong when we talked about it last, but you didn't respond
<mdean> it still broke?
<derek> attachments work for normal system but not gateway
<derek> i dont recall what you suggested or if i did it
Action: derek thinks it was in a bad place
<mdean> ah - yes, it was a dcl configuration config
<derek> and needed to be moved
<derek> or something
<derek> i think anything we find needs to be addressed by jbailey in the debian install
<derek> as by default it should setup correct directories for attachments when installing the deb
<mdean> what's the server addy again?
<derek> gnuenterprise.org
<mdean> now I remember - you need to set the Path For Files to the absolute path under System Configuration
<mdean> it's currently a . iirc
<mdean> which won't fly well when the script is running
<derek> ah
<derek> ok
<derek> shoudl it be
<derek> http://domain/path/to/place
<derek> or susch
<derek> or /path/to/place
<mdean> according to your filesystem
<mdean> ja
<derek> i put
<derek>  /usr/share/dcl/www/attachments/
<derek> for (path to files)
<derek> and still tickets dont show up
<mdean> just to the www 
<derek> ah
<mdean> it automatically adds attachments
<derek> with / or w/o /
<mdean> cause there are other types of files, like project templates
<mdean> without
<derek> at least we are positioning dcl to get ready for the beating 0.4.1 and 0.5.0 will produce ;)
<mdean> ja
<mdean> as soon as you get it upgraded, I'm going to make a 1.0 dcl project
<derek> hmmm still doesnt seem to work
<mdean> does your delivery agent user have write access to that directory?
<derek>  /usr/share/dcl/www

<derek> cool
<derek> sorry at lug meeting
<derek> getting ready to leave
Action: derek wanted to test more but getting to talk about gnue some
<derek> reports are that 0.4.0 windows version on win2000 is very broked (i experienced same)
<derek> so if we can get some prelease of 0.4.1 for windows it would be great
Action: derek realizes we are doing native win32 for 0.5.0
<derek> but still we need an interim
<jcater> bug btami when you see him
<jcater> he's completely set up to do it
<jcater> fairly quickly
<jcater> it'd take me a while to get back set up
<derek> ok cool

<KeithJagrs> hello
<KeithJagrs> jamest: you there?
<jamest> yes
<KeithJagrs> I believe i saw in the IRC logs you are'nt quite happy with wx under win32
<KeithJagrs> what are the plans to circinvent this?
<KeithJagrs> circunvent or workaround
<jamest> well
<jamest> i know works being done on gtk2 driver which works under windows.....however what I believe you will see in the next major upgrade is a UIdriver based upon win32all
<jamest> my understanding it that is exposes the win32 api directly which will make for a painfull coding experience but should result in us getting exactly what we require
<jamest> i have not looked into this really closely yet though (my last copy of the win api book covers the "new" api in win 3.1)
<jamest> :)
<jamest> do you have any suggestions for a different approach to the problem?
Yurik (~yrashk@as5300.kharkov.ukrtel.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<KeithJagrs> hmmmm. well not really
<KeithJagrs> does this mean you will drop wx in favour of gtk2?
<jamest> i doubt it
<jamest> I'm not sure if you've looked at the code
<KeithJagrs> not so close i must say
jcater (~jason@w202.z065105010.mem-tn.dsl.cnc.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> there is a dir forms/src/uidrivers/
<jamest> in there you find
<jamest> curses, gtk2, wx directories
<jamest> adding a ui driver means swithing to that dir and doing mkdir newdrivername
<jamest> mkdir win32
<jamest> cd win32
<jamest> vi UIdriver.py
<jamest> <code like mad goat>
<jamest> from command line
<jamest> gfcvs -u win32
<KeithJagrs> gonna check that
<jamest> as a sample
<jamest> bash-2.05a$ cd ~/cvs/gnue/forms/src/uidrivers/
<jamest> bash-2.05a$ mkdir foo
<jamest> bash-2.05a$ cp wx/* foo
<jamest> cp: omitting directory `wx/CVS'
<jamest> bash-2.05a$ gfcvs -u foo ~/cvs/gnue/forms/samples/intro/intro.gfd
<jamest> forms now supports the foo interface which just happens to behave just like our wx one :)
<jamest> the idea is we don't want coders to have to learn the internals of forms to add a driver
<jamest> well, not all the internals
<jamest> they just have to provide code to deal with the events that are passed into a driver
<KeithJagrs> I see
<KeithJagrs> I still dont have something clear. about curses
<jamest> actually, you'll find this style of coding throughout gnue
<jamest> our database drivers work the same way
<KeithJagrs> can curses worl on DOS ?

johannes (~johannes@M701P023.adsl.highway.telekom.at) joined #gnuenterprise.
<KeithJagrs> btw: is this included in docs?
<jamest> designer also has plug-in system to extend it's capabilities 
<jamest> what?  how to add drivers and such?
<jamest> no
<KeithJagrs> yes
<KeithJagrs> Ii see
<KeithJagrs> I see
<jamest> i commited the start of a Developing with GNUe Common last nite but it has a long way to go
<jamest> the forms doc is on hold as we're about to make radical changes to the gfd format
<jamest> so writing a doc to make it obsolete didn't make much sense :)
<jamest> KeithJagrs: what platform you interested in running this on?
<jcater> KeithJagrs: I looked at curses + DOS
<jcater> went into "python" on a win32 machine
<jcater> and did "import curses"
<KeithJagrs> win32 
<jcater> and it didn't work
Yurik (~yrashk@as5300.kharkov.ukrtel.net) left irc: Read error: 54 (Connection reset by peer)
<jamest> i don't think we're too worried about text on windows though
<KeithJagrs> well, it might be better than the current wx in win32
<jamest> personally, i saw the curses thing as usefull for someone running text terminals
<KeithJagrs> for the moment
<jamest> KeithJagrs: the win32 api is to be started right after we get 0.4.1 out the door
<KeithJagrs> also there are some companies working with accounting software that runs on DOS
<jamest> jcater: you agree?
<jcater> but, of course
<jamest> KeithJagrs: yeah, i know text apps are used alot in the real world
<jamest> i myself don't think gui == good by default
<jamest> however i think a dos text client would be a huge investment in time
<jamest> now if a person could find a python module for manipulating text then it would be possible
<jamest> but doing from scratch would be painful
<KeithJagrs> yes , your right on that one
<jcater> well
<jcater> the approach I would take
<jamest> what I do see alot on the street is windows apps running tn3270 or telnet to a unix box in the background
<jcater> is my understanding is that you can get curses libraries for win32/dos machines
<KeithJagrs> well my only interest for the moment  is  to see gnue running smoothly in win32
<jamest> I'm amazed at how often i see that
<jcater> so you'd probabl;y be able to custom compile a python binary
<jcater> I don't have the time to invest in that route
<jcater> but I imagine it's doable
<KeithJagrs> that would be good 
<jamest> ooooo, if we can get a python binary that does that
<jamest> then our existing packaging will just work
<jamest> KeithJagrs: we know that win32 support is a big issue
reinhard (~reinhard@M693P020.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: "No problem is so interesting that you can't just walk away from it"
<KeithJagrs> yes
<jamest> that combined with the desire to work on layout caused us to adjust our feature plans
<KeithJagrs> I have spent a considerable amount of time trying to convince a prospect to migrate to linux
<jamest> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/forms.html
<KeithJagrs> but he already boutgh MS windows and Office licenses this year
<KeithJagrs> so he discarded that option
<jcater> I think a win32 client will come along very quickly once its started
<KeithJagrs> they have 12 workstations there, its a car dealer
<jamest> 2 options 
<KeithJagrs> 2?
<jamest>   1) give us a little time - 0.4.1 should be out in next few days.  Then we'll start efforts on win32api
<jamest>   2) setup a cheap arse "server" running the curses client w/ putty on the win boxes
<jamest> it may sound sick but when I go places I spend time looking at their computer interfaces (at stores, companies, etc)
<jamest> i always ask myself "can forms do that?"
<KeithJagrs> heh
<jamest> i see option 2 happen alot
<jamest> which always strikes me as funny
<KeithJagrs> I been hoping myself that Forms run on those Ms OSes
<jamest> to spend XX dollars on a windows license to run as a glorified vt320
<KeithJagrs> yes, you bet
<KeithJagrs> me too
<jcater> I think we are *really* close to releasing
<KeithJagrs> Im reading http://www.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/forms.html
<KeithJagrs> interesting
<KeithJagrs> when did you publish that
<jcater> this past week
<jcater> it's a work in progress
<jcater> that's a preview
<jcater> (but basically our plans)
<KeithJagrs> great work!
<KeithJagrs> why dont you put a link to those in the news section of Home page?
<jamest> they are very new
<jamest> several need filled out 
<KeithJagrs> ok
<jamest> fwiw - these are based upon kde's feature plan pages
<jcater> mixed with two guys twisted minds
<jamest> we didn't come up with the format (credit where credit is due :)
<jamest> yeah, we tweaked them a bit
<jamest> so i know jcater and I are ready to release
<jamest> so 0.4.1 may be today
<KeithJagrs> today?!
<KeithJagrs> great!
<KeithJagrs> jcater and jamest: you both wrote those plans? great work anyway
<KeithJagrs> It was badly need it
<jamest> yeah, beats real work
<KeithJagrs> hehe
<jamest> i think jan did the appserver one
<jcater> does it beat users?
<jcater> if so, I need a feature plan here at work
<KeithJagrs> I mean, it could not mean a lot of work to do but it's a milestone. Roadmaps are good

<jamest> revDeke: did you test those prereleases?  we want to release today
<KeithJagrs> where is the changelog, if its already written?
<jcater> each of the tools has a ChangeLog
<jcater> and a NEWS file with an executive summary of changes
<KeithJagrs> ok
<revDeke> jamest: gack
<revDeke> can you give me tonight?
<revDeke> wife has a party to go to 
<revDeke> i will put kids down and 7 and have from like 7 to 10 to test
<revDeke> we need windows prereleases
<jamest> revDeke: i don't think it's needed
<jamest> you testing
Action: revDeke is waiting to pounce on btami
<jamest> i've ran all my work forms thru it
<jamest> and I'm implementing something today pretty big using just designer and forms
<jamest> i think we'll be ok
jwalls (~jwalls@146.145.164.54) left irc: "using sirc version 2.211+KSIRC/1.2.4"
<jamest> plus I think we've time today
<jamest> my weekend is iffy at best
<revDeke> roflmao: i have heard that one before ;)
<revDeke> certainly release if you feel ready
Action: revDeke gets to maintain the 0.4.2 release
<jamest> i feel pretty good about this release
<revDeke> so if i find stuff and it gets fixed i can always release 0.4.2 :)
Action: revDeke suspects we will get to 0.4.4 or so
dneighbo (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<revDeke> as it appears 0.5.0 will be pretty major so likely will be a while
Action: revDeke notes 'a while' is a relative term not a deragatory one
<jamest> most of 0.5.0 shouldn't be major, we've been looking into it
<revDeke> cool, i havent reviewed the feature plans just yet (in detail)
<revDeke> i have been toying some with DCL
<jamest> it'll be major on the user visible side of things, but internals shouldn't kill us
<revDeke> so that we can get the feature plan items actually in DCL as work orders
<jamest> i think hiding all the new derek flags will take longer
Action: revDeke is thinking the win32 driver and curses drivers will be the biggies
<revDeke> not necessarily in 'dev' time
<revDeke> but in testing time
<revDeke> assuming basic curses support didnt make it into 0.4.1
<jamest> i'm pretty sure it will be _almost_ feature complete for 0.4.1
<jamest> but I haven't tested in a few days
<revDeke> cool
<revDeke> i dont think it needs to be 'complete' for 0.4.1 just like i dont think win32 would need to be complete for 0.5.0
<revDeke> but more 'reasonably' complete 'first preview' give us lots of feedback :)
<jamest> i imagine 0.5.0 will have the new gfd format and maybe the start of win32
<jamest> the new gfd format will be a HUGE gain for forms
<jamest> as you'll be able to do l33t things in it
<revDeke> what is the major change in the gfd format?
<KeithJagrs> do you think  0.5.0 could be ready in the first quarter of '03?
<jamest> complete seperation of layout from logic
<jamest> you'll be able to mirror fields on multiple pages
<jamest> mix things about any way you like
<jamest> i think 0.5.0 is this year
<jamest> it's become an itch we've got to scratch
<jamest> you should get a layout manager system as well
<KeithJagrs> this year? there's only one month and a half left to new year's eve
<jamest> hmmmm, maybe that is pushing it
<jcater> KeithJagrs: our history is to release either right before or on a major holiday
<jamest> damn, is it really mid november alread
<jcater> so we have christmas to look forward too :)
<jamest> i still think we can come close
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I really want to push the gfd layout changes out into the public
<KeithJagrs> hehe
<jcater> of course, I'd really like some donuts right now too
<jamest> we'll have to switch from code like mad goat mode into the ultr4-3x3tr3m3 code like mad jcater mode
Action: jcater plans on hitting this hard immediately after a release
<jamest> some of us may lose finger joints in the process though
<KeithJagrs> heh
<KeithJagrs> i have a question on appserv
<KeithJagrs> is it intended to have its own web server?
<KeithJagrs> like many python web frameworks?
<jamest> i don't know
<jcater> it reuses the socket server in Python's libraries
<jamest> it shouldn't be hard
<jcater> to serve anything needing such
<jcater> (e.g., xml-rpc, etc)
<jcater> but I'm not sure I'd call that a built-in web server
<jamest> as it uses common GServerApp IIRC
<jamest> which I believe still had the goal of providing those types of services
<jcater> yes
<jcater> it does
<jcater> (not just have the goals :)
<jamest> did medusa support make it in?
<jcater> it will
<KeithJagrs> medusa?
<jcater> snake-haired mythological chick
<jcater> causing terror
Action: jcater thinks that's in common
<jamest> turned people to stone
<revDeke> well 0.5.0 before end of Q4 02 would be great
<KeithJagrs> I know that part
<revDeke> while there are lots of holidays generally that means time off work
<revDeke> which means to a degree gnue time :)
<jamest> i get petrified looking at common
<revDeke> i think it would be good to have it by end of january
<jamest> KeithJagrs: search google for python medusa
<KeithJagrs> will do
Action: revDeke is worried about this gfd switch
<jamest> i'm trying
<revDeke> will we have conversion tools?
<jcater> revDeke: of course
<jamest> yes, for most cases
<revDeke> or open in design and save
<jamest> of course
Action: revDeke is only worried as im getting ready to do a boat load of forms
<jamest> I think we're pretty good about changing things and hiding it
<revDeke> yes i agree
<jamest> i wouldn't expect this to be much different
<jamest> http://oedipus.sourceforge.net/medusa/
<revDeke> jamest: if not, lube is cheap, right?
<jamest> it's worth it in any case
<jcater> yes
<jamest> this is something I wanted from day 1
<jcater> yes, me too
<KeithJagrs> jamest: thanks. I also found http://www.nightmare.com/medusa/
<jamest> it's how sql*forms from oracle did it
<jcater> jamest and I were discussing and decided we really couldn't wait any longer
<jamest> actually, ours will be better
<jcater> as the closer to 1.0 we get, the more stable the gfd format must be
<jcater> so if we are going to do a "correction" in our format
<jcater> we better get it on!
<revDeke> well i think major changes to gfd are better now than 1.0 ;)
<jamest> and the doc needed a final gfd format
Action: revDeke is excited about the change
<KeithJagrs> jamest: what you wanted to do since day 1?
<jamest> a cleanup/doc release then major change would have been a "bad thing"
<jamest> seperate the logic from the layout in gfd
<jamest> when I started I wanted something out the door fast
<KeithJagrs> good idea, indeed
<jamest> so I blended them which was a bad, bad thing
<jamest> but it was quick, i was just learning python while coding, i was young and needed the money
<KeithJagrs> heh
<KeithJagrs> what a novel
<nickr> aw jamest, we've all been domn that route
<jamest> Oracle's SQL*forms was the inspiratoin for forms
<jamest> to take a similar approach and improve upon their design
<jcater> dude!
<nickr> but you end up just spending all your money on gold chains and skintight pants.
<jcater> you realize with this separation
<jcater> I will quite literally be able to do a converter
<KeithJagrs> hahahaha
<jcater> that was my big hangup
<jamest> yes
<jcater> well one of the 2
<jcater> the other one is pl/sql triggers
<nickr> huzzah
<jcater> of course I could do a SWIG against PL/SQL C libraries
Action: jcater considers the tasks involved
<jamest> oracle forms kicked arse but cost big $$$$
<jcater> or maybe I won't
<nickr> don't things like postgres have native python trigger support?
<revDeke> well i think ultimately we will be better than sql*forms for many reasons 
<jcater> will be?
<jamest> we are better now in many respects
<jamest> very many
<jcater> yes
<jamest> in almost every way to be honest
<jamest> maybe that's too stong a statement
<jamest> jcater...sanity check please
Action: jcater slaps jamest
<jamest> thanks
<jamest> but was i right or wrong
<jcater> I think so
<jamest> layout they have us
<jcater> but I'm biased
<jamest> stability of the painter they had us 
<jamest> abilities of the painter we kill them
<jamest> painter = deisigner
<revDeke> well they do beat us on price
<jamest> forms is more powerfull than their client
<jamest> IMHO
<jcater> yes
<jamest> however they have a pretty slick pop-up selector we need
<jcater> we have python triggers :)
<revDeke> pop up selector
Action: jcater never could get that pop-up selector to work right
<jcater> we don't use it
Action: revDeke thinks this might be what i have been begging for
<jamest> i used it alot
<jamest> revDeke: it is
<jcater> revDeke: we *do* take patches
<jcater> I know talking to other people you might think we won't apply them
<jcater> but that's just not true
<jamest> we even apply a few of them
<revDeke> jcater: careful you might get some one day ;)
<jamest> as long as they don't break other stuff
<revDeke> i wanted a toolbar a long while back and added one that was so ugly someone took and made it right ;)
<revDeke> same thing with some datasource triggers
Action: revDeke knows i just hve to get something working so minimal that you guys panic and write what i really need just to keep my butt out of the code ;)
<jcater> not your butt
<jcater> your butt-ugly code
Action: jcater hides
<revDeke> i.e. 'oh crap, he is determined enough to actually be committing code, jamest quick get on implementing that and get him the hell out of here' ;)
<nickr> revDeke: thats a good strategy
<revDeke> nickr: seriously it has worked in the past ;)
<jamest> yeah, it works
<nickr> ruling the codebase by FEAR
<revDeke> as the thought of me adding stupid features i want is far worse than them adding the stupid features i want ;)
<nickr> a sort of cvs terrorism
<jamest> actually, you'll find that common/forms/reports/etc we try and make it easy for others to add
Nick change: revDeke -> dekeBinLaden
<jamest> we say it's to prevent people from needing to learn internals
<jamest> the truth is we don't want derek in there
<jamest> he adds a little trigger and goes away - we're happy
<jamest> he recodes datasources - we quit
<nickr> so why doesn't designer support sqlite anyway?
Nick change: dekeBinLaden -> revDeke
<jamest> actually, derek maintaining datasources sounds kind of appealing
<revDeke> no need to recode datasources its blocks that are a problem ;)
Action: revDeke runs away ;)
Action: jamest thwaps revDeke
<jamest> nickr: you mean the wizards?
<nickr> No, common doesn't talk to sqlite
<jamest> grrrrr
<nickr> hrm, I suppose I could use sqlrelay
<jamest> does it give error?
<nickr> yea, no driver
<nickr> and there isn't a drive for it
<nickr> at least not in my install
<nickr> maybe its jbailey's fault.
<nickr> driver
<jamest> you running debs?
<nickr> yep
<nickr> It seems like the driver should exist (if it existsZ) regardless of wether pysqlite is avalible as a package or not.
<jamest> nickr: i'll install sqlite and test
<nickr> the driver isn't in common
<nickr> in my install of common
<nickr> there is no sqlite/ directory
<KeithJagrs> jcater: are there any messages in the Small Business mail list archives? I get a 404 error
<jcater> jamest / nickr:
<jcater> that's because gnue.common.dbdrivers.sqlite isn't listed in common/setup.py
Action: jcater just looked
<nickr> fun fun
psu (psu@81.98.44.42) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<nickr> for now Ican use sqlrelay
<nickr> I think
<jcater> ok, updated in cvs

<KeithJagrs> gotta run. c ya!

<jamest> fwiw: in reference to our discussoins this morning about win32 curses mode
<jamest> http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/wconio.html
<jamest> it's not curses but at quick glance it looks like it would provide enough features to make such a driver possible
Arturas (~arturas@gsk.vtu.lt) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> Hello
<jamest> hi
Action: revDeke shudders at wincurses
<revDeke> jamest: i think your idea of vt100 putty connections
<revDeke> to GNUe Server would be more effective :)
xetrex (~chatzilla@195.148.248.83) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> jamest: that looks so close to the underlying curses driver
<jcater> that I bet it could be grafted in
<jcater> so the "widget set" we have created to go over curses
<jcater> could also be used over wcon
<Arturas> bye
Arturas (~arturas@gsk.vtu.lt) left #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> jamest: but I wonder what the advantage is?
<jcater> as I don't think this is really "DOS" screen io
<jcater> but Win32 console IO
<jcater> I can't tell if that'll work under "DOS" or not
xetrex (~chatzilla@195.148.248.83) left irc: "ChatZilla 0.8.7 in Beonex Communicator"
<jamest> i figured that most dos windows are really nothing more than win32 consoles
<jamest> the issues keith had was client picked windows/office for the clients
<jamest> and last I checked office is GUI
<jamest> :)
<jamest> anyone running pure dos solution would probably be more open to other setups
<jamest> unless legacy app forced them into it 
StyXman (~mdione@ADSL-200-59-86-17.cordoba.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> if they are in a dos setup
<jcater> we talk them into putting in an ltsp server
<jcater> and make the dos machines LTSP "telnet" clients :)
<StyXman> so, I'm finishing the merge. but I want to be sure we didn't berak anything. should I use the samples to tes, and that would be enought, or are better test somewhere else?
<jamest> hey, i haven't got into the curses driver enough
<jamest> but I swore it used panel
<jcater> I want to make it use panel
<StyXman> s/berak/break/
<jcater> but haven't gotten around to it
<jamest> so we'd have to form for winconsole
<StyXman> s/tes/test/
<jcater> StyXman: that's a good start, I guess
<jamest> StyXman: i think the samples are fine 
<StyXman> s/enought/enogh/
<jamest> StyXman: once you've merged can you get us a list of differences between your code and outs
<jamest> ours
<StyXman> ok, no more typos/brainos :)
<StyXman> yes! that's what life spins around these weeks :)
<StyXman> stay tuned.

<StyXman> question?
<jcater> answer!
<derek> no
<derek> thats a question and an answer
<StyXman> I see that almos all the DBdirver.py's have the same $driver_DataObject_Object._buildQuery method
<StyXman> they're all the same (ok, just the first few ones)
<derek> StyXman: good eyesight you have young jedi
<StyXman> I mean, is the *same* code.
<StyXman> why not move it to DBSIG_DataObject_Object or above?
<jcater> but they aren't same in all cases :(
<StyXman> 6 and counting...
<StyXman> cxoracle, db2, informix...
<StyXman> interbase..
<StyXman> mxodbc..
<jcater> if you look closer, they can't be moved up
<jcater> this is forcing the DO to not run the parent's DO, but a second parent's one
Action: jcater remembers this now
<jcater> e.g., 
<StyXman> ah, I see.
<jcater> class Interbase_DataObject_SQL(Interbase_DataObject, \
<jcater>       DBSIG_DataObject_SQL):
<jcater> without the _buildQuery override
<jcater> it'd run Interbase_DataObject._buildQuery
<jcater> not DBSIG_DataObject_SQL._buildQuery(self, conditions)
Action: jcater remembers hating to do that, but it was necessary
<StyXman> and only DBSIG subclasses has these new params 'sql' and 'forDetail', right?
<ajmitch> morning
<StyXman> hi ajmitch 
<jcater> something like that, yes
<StyXman> better, less work
jwalls (~jwalls@146.145.164.54) left #gnuenterprise.
<StyXman> they're 16!
<StyXman> done anyways.
<derek> ?
<derek> who is 16?
<jamest> db drivers
<jamest> StyXman: sucks doesn't it
<jamest> i did them on our side the first time :)
psu__ (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> what do you mean "done anyways?"
<ajmitch> another psu!!
<jcater> psu_/ psu__
<jcater> what a nice tail you have
<jamest> jcater: he modified his tree to match ours
<jamest> i imagine
<nickr> should go by _psu .. compiler reserved symbol!
<StyXman> jamest: you're right. I'm synced till yesterday
<StyXman> took me 16 hours
<ajmitch> jcater/ jamest: sounds like the forms internals rewrite will be fun
<jcater> StyXman: darn! and we gutted everything this morning.
<jcater> just kidding!
<StyXman> and 16 dbdrivers had the 'feature' I stated above :)
<jcater> ajmitch: nah, not too bad
<jcater> StyXman: but you didn't change that, right?
<ajmitch> does forms support optional parameters, such as panel background colours?
<StyXman> jcater: I know, I hear cvs :)
<jamest> yeah, i think we left setup-cvs.py alone
<StyXman> jcater: just added our code... which touched all the DBSIG dbrivers
<StyXman> no, now that I think about it... I just broke it
<ajmitch> ooh, grid view mode for 0.7.x

<derek> ?
<ajmitch> looking at feature plan
<jcater> StyXman: um
<jcater> dare I ask
<derek> do we have feature plans on website?
<jcater> why you were in all the dbdrivers?
<derek> i.e. linked from website
<ajmitch> derek: afaik, no
<derek> if not we should have under each tool package
<derek> where status is
<StyXman> now it's fine!
<derek> ajmitch: can you give me url
<derek> i have lost mine
<ajmitch> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/forms.html
<StyXman> for the multple ables support. we need (eventually) to pass a hint about which table are we talking about...
<derek> for forms what happened to 0.4.1 release?
<StyXman> (that is the answer to your question, jcater)
<derek> we should leave them on there as complete
<derek> no?
<derek> i.e.
<derek> todo
<derek> progress
<derek> finished
<StyXman> the new parameter is called qTable and is the last one 'defaulted' to None.
<derek> i think it makes for a nice history as well
<derek> or did you guys just start with 0.5.0
<StyXman> if None is get in that parameter, we fallback to the default.
<StyXman> I mena, we fallback to what 'you' were doing.
<StyXman> s/mena/mean/
<jamest> we start w/ 0.5.0
<derek> jamest: i might do some clean up of these as some stuff is duplicated or not consistent
<derek> are they in cvs?
<jamest> no
<derek> also there are features that are missing (i assume these are possibly not comprehensive)
<jamest> they are not complete
<derek> in which case i will throw out the feature and you all can determine where it best fits
<jamest> and don't go thinking that if you add it then we'll do it :)
<jcater> at least let us finish what we're doing with them
<derek> things like popup dialog box
<derek> or such
<jamest> 0.5.1 full support of everything derek wants
<derek> sigh
<derek> i said i would tell you features i see missing and you decided
<jamest> we'd have to visit AZ then :)
Action: derek never said would dictate where things are done
<derek> i.e. you could say we will never support that
<derek> we will support it after 1.0 sometime
<derek> or yeah we need that lets decide where it goes
Action: derek isnt sure what ...let us finish what we're doing with them... means
<jamest> derek: you have time now?
<ajmitch> derek: it means: "keep your hands off"! :)
<jamest> as we want them done for the release
<derek> i dont have access to change them now
<jamest> so if you do later we'll probably already have them tweaked
<derek> i have time to comment on them
<jamest> comment away
<jamest> but we know about the duplicatoin
<jamest> you may be best off telling us what you see missing
<derek> Switch to GNUe Common menu system after it's completion(*) 
<derek> is listed in 0.5.0 and 0.6.0
<derek> so is Complete Curses UI driver 
<jcater> we are well aware of the duplications
<derek> i would put in one or the other
<jcater> that's what we were saying
<jcater> :)
<derek> and denote that its subject to move
<derek> i.e. its planned for 0.5.0 but if it comes down to it, it can bail to 0.6.0 at which point it would move (unless the duplication is just an accident)
<StyXman> jcater: anyways, you'll se in the patches :)
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> joy
<derek> what is grid view mode?
<derek> there was talk of moving win32 native to 0.5.0 currently its in 0.7.0
<jamest> converts a std form to look like pgaccess
<derek> ok then one thing i think missing (maybe its a post 1.0 thing) is real grids
<jamest> it's a shut up users that keep asking for pgaccess on my systems even though pgaccess is slow and buggy
<jamest> feature
<derek> i know its an aethsetics thing but lots of people want it
<ajmitch> derek: see 0.7.0?
<derek> and if we dont add someone else will someday and likely not in the way we want it
<derek> ajmitch: 0.7.0 has grid view
<derek> which is not 'real grid'
<derek> at least not based on what jamest said
<ajmitch> how do you define 'real grid' ?
<ajmitch> i guess grid view is like access' datasheet view
<ajmitch> and 'real grid' is a grid widget in forms?
<derek> yeah but thats mroe a custom form (best i can tell)
<derek> im talking a native grid widget
<ajmitch> right
<derek> again this is high priority it could be post 1.0
<derek> but thats what im asking ... should it be pre 1.0 and if so, how pre 1.0
<derek> im thinking the blocks/fields things might make it easier to implement
<ajmitch> either 0.7.x or 0.8.x?
<derek> i question the need for a qt driver pre 1.0
<derek> but i understand scratching itches
<ajmitch> why?
<nickr> what!?
<nickr> you don't want total kde integration?
<ajmitch> wasn't one mostly written?
Action: derek wishes we could find some sucker to write though
<derek> like happened with gtk2 one
<derek> i.e. i would like to see a qt driver
<derek> just hate to see critical resources on it, again i understand the scratch an itch so its comment not a complaint
<ajmitch> Qt or KDE? if you use KDE then you can get fancier widgets :)
<jamest> thats all?
<nickr> should add a 'suckers welcome' sign to the channel
Action: derek thought you stopped listening as no comment
<derek> so i stopped
<derek> i can go on :)
<jamest> go ahead...I'm kinda busy
<jamest> but I'm reading
<jamest> plus it's easier to say "I don't see anything above worth adding"
<jamest> than saying "no" lots and lots of times
<jamest> j/k
<derek> oh most of my other stuff was questions for designer, but looks like its plan isnt produced yet
<derek> the three things i have there 
<derek> - good mask editor
<derek> - starting of schema editor
<derek> - trigger editor capabilities
<derek> - cvs integration
<derek> - project capabilities
<derek> - gpd editor
<derek> schema and gpd editor are becoming a big weakness i see as i am starting to write applications
<ajmitch> project capabilities has been started
<ajmitch> gpd?
<derek> project capabilities and trigger editor would be nice but i can hobble ok w/o 
<derek> mask editor and cvs integration would be gravy :)
<derek> oh yeah
<nickr> mmm delicious gravy
<derek> reports design capability
<ajmitch> for a trigger editor, would you reuse an existing editor or editor code?
<derek> these are items to think about when making the designer feature plan
<ajmitch> a good mask editor could have a set of preset masks to use
<derek> well i would like to eventually see cheesy editor so to speak as part of designer
<jcater> ajmitch: it does
<derek> or ability to include your favorite 
<ajmitch> jcater: ok, wish i knew that :)
<derek> ajmitch: correct, btw the mask stuff might exist, i saw something simliar when there
<jcater> ajmitch: you do now
<derek> but i never got it to work quite right
<ajmitch> i'd better check it out then
<jcater> oooo
<derek> good mask editor might just mean 'more polish'
<jcater> I never said it works
<jcater> I just said it does have predefined formats
<ajmitch> hehe
<derek> :)
<jcater> seriously
<jcater> in yor gnue.conf
<derek> oh other items for forms
<jcater> you can have DateFormat_MontAndDay = %m/%d
Action: derek gets ready to duck
<jcater> then in your gfd file
<derek> calendar picker
<jcater> the format mask can be "&MonthAndDay"
<ajmitch> cute
<ajmitch> derek: i think it could be useful - if someone is willing to code it
<ajmitch> not too hard for the wx driver
<derek> im serious
<derek> i think about every platform can support as well
<derek> i see it as nothing mroe than attribute of entry of some kind
<jcater> derek: would you like fries with that?
<derek> supersized baby ;)
<ajmitch> jcater: demanding, isn't he?
Action: jamest blinks
<jcater>  /msg jamest you go for the kneecaps, I'll grab the bat and go for the head
<jamest> it's easier to pull up a calendar/ click left or right to find the month/year you require, then click on the day ?
<jamest> that to type 15-nov-2002
<jamest> s/that/than
<derek> jamest: yes
<ajmitch> unfortunately it is
<derek> example... im planning airline travel
<derek> i want to travel week of christmas
<jamest> overseas i hope
<derek> i want ot leave monday before christmas
<jcater> rofl
<derek> and return friday after christmas
<jamest> :P
<derek> do you know those dates w/o looking at a calendar?
<derek> unfortunately i dont
<jamest> derek: i see the point now, thanks
<derek> its much easier for the application to show me a calendar than to hunt one down :(
<nickr> derek: what? you don't have an autistic savant who is an expert in the calendar system sitting next to you?
<derek> i was going to make a crude comment but thats not nice
<ajmitch> hmm, when was wxCalendarCtrl added to wxpython? is it in 2.2.x ? :)
<derek> re: calendar thing its not high priority thing
<derek> it was one of those ithink we need, could be post 1.0 pre 1.0 thats your call
<jamest> i think i'd rather see a plugin system
<derek> ?
<jamest> that would allow people to add such a feature
<derek> that woudl be fine
<derek> but i think its something pretty core
<jamest> as i'm sure we'll get lots of examples like this for various things
<derek> i would think it should ship with gnue
<jamest> i think i'm ok with it going in 
<ajmitch> right, so long is it's just an entry widget subclass thing, and doesn't require .gfd changes
<derek> not be a 'third' party thing
<jamest> as it does have a use
<jamest> i imagine that'll be 1.0+
<derek> im not opposed to abstracting it so that other things can be done as well
<derek> i.e. i realize there will be lots of similar requests some we agree with some we dont
Action: ajmitch dons flameproof suit
<ajmitch> what sort of timeframe are we estimating for these releases? :)
<derek> jcater: other thing on common/forms roadmap i didnt see (maybe its done in 0.4.1) was that stuff papo had on multi table datasources or such
<derek> ajmitch: there was talk about trying to have 0.5.0 by end of december early january if real life (tm) treats everyone well
<derek> i think predicating anything beyond that for other releases makes little sense
<ajmitch> right
<ajmitch> it also invites having large rotten fruit thrown at you
<jamest> the multitable write patch was causing some issues
<jamest> i can't recall the details
<derek> yes i know, but that is why i said i didnt see
<jamest> multitable read works fine w/o the patch
<derek> didnt know if it was resolved
<jcater> yes, multitable read works well
<derek> or if it was deemed undoable
<derek> or if it needed to be discussed what release it might be seen

<psu_> for the moment, I went to /forms.html rather than leave an ugly dir listing
<derek> Spot an error in documentation? E-mail patches to info@gnue.org.
<derek> dont we ahve a docs-support@gnuenteprise.org ?
<jcater> psu_: very well organized page
<derek> if not we need soemthing like that
<derek> i know there is a DCL product for it
<psu_> yes, we do have a docs-support - my bad
<psu_> I'll change that

<StyXman> -head is cvs from yesterday
<StyXman> that was closing the window
<StyXman> with the wm's 'X' button
<ajmitch> wb mr psu_
<derek> other thing we need 
<derek> if it doesnt exist is either a 'license page' or better yet right on the home page
<derek> add somethign that says gnue tools/packages are GPL
<derek> as i know my pet peeve in getting new software is hunting down what license its under before downloading
<jamest> ls
<derek> we make lots of reference to freesoftware and even fsf, but i dont see clarification where we state we are GPL
<psu_> yep - most people should hopefully be able to guess that GNU* == GPL, but why not tell 'em outright?
<derek> it is in the mini faq item #7
<psu_> needs to be on the front page IMHO
<derek> im thinking make it part of items 1 and 2 on the front page
<derek> GNUe supports multi-language interfaces and non-ASCII character sets. The GNUe Tools are licensed under the GNU GPL <-- link
<derek> A set of packages, licensed under the GNU GPL and written using the tools, to implement a full Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. 
<derek> or such
<derek> i.e. you are a better word smith than I
<derek> so please take liberty of making it sound intelligent :)
<ajmitch> but you may want to reassure people that using GNUe doesn't make their stuff GPL
<derek> well for a few donuts we overlook any violations right jcater?
<ajmitch> as i've heard people worry about that before (interesting problem there)
<derek> true... maybe point to gpl faq as well
<psu_> well, the way to look at it is, if you did a spreadsheet in GNUmeric, would that be GPL?
<psu_> Is it true that one of the Powerpoint licenses bans you from saying rude things about M$
<psu_> or was that just a slashdot rumour/FUD?
<ajmitch> wouldn't surprise me
<ajmitch> but possibly /. FUD
<ajmitch> applications that hook into GNUe common, what license would they fall under?
<psu_> along lines of "free software declared enemy in war on terrorism; to be banned in all lower 48"
<nickr> I don't think its possible for a license to do crazy things like that.
<nickr> they can say anything they want
<nickr> but I don't think things like that are binding
<nickr> in a software license.
<psu_> maybe if they never sort out getting jcater's RentFree as part of GNU
<psu_> he can make it "donutware"
<ajmitch> nickr: the problem is that MS licenses fall under contract law more than copyright
<psu_> ajmitch: I would guess that anything that called GNUe Common but did not modify the internals
<ajmitch> essentially agreeing to an NDA :)
<psu_> and was distrib seperately with it, they would not *have* to be GPL 
<psu_> but IANAL
<nickr> I think that its gray, anyway. Lots of nonbinding clauses.
<psu_> obviously, we would prefer it to be
<ajmitch> for that, i'd imagine you'd need the license to be GPL+linking exception
<psu_> however, if I'm right, I'm not sure what the LGPL is for 
<psu_> so just /ignore me
<ajmitch> GPL+LE & LGPL differ in some important aspects, iirc
<ajmitch> i just can't recall what they are ;)
KeithJagrs (trilluser@63.74.24.9) joined #gnuenterprise.
<KeithJagrs> hello
<ajmitch> hi
<KeithJagrs> question: if I use a hosting service, and have acces to the shell via telnet or ssh, can I install python on my own?
<psu_> Anyone got any hints on my Enlightenment problem, then?
<ajmitch> KeithJagrs: i guess you could
<nickr> KeithJagrs: "probably"
<KeithJagrs> hmmm
<psu_> KeithJagrs: depends on your user's permissions on the remote server
<nickr> well if you have enough space you could probably install it to your local directory
<KeithJagrs> thats the idea nickr
<nickr> directory layout is essentially arbitrary anyway. :)
<psu_> involve.php now has the doc-support address instead
<KeithJagrs> what kind of permissions do you think I'd need
<nickr> KeithJagrs: nothing but ability to write to your local directory
<nickr> and compile stuff
<nickr> and set your path and other env variables
<KeithJagrs> compile?
<KeithJagrs> hmmm
<KeithJagrs> not sure about that
<nickr> type gcc
<nickr> and see if it works :)
<KeithJagrs> ok
<psu_> and what.php now clearly states we are GPL & links to the FSF's FAQ
<ajmitch> ok
<KeithJagrs> hello psu, you still on 28.8 kbps?
<psu_> KeithJagrs: upstairs, yes
<KeithJagrs> ;)
<psu_> downstairs, 600k cable modem
<KeithJagrs> upstairs?
<ajmitch> heheh
<ajmitch> why?
<derek> if you used common via 'import type statements and such' i think your resulting application would need to be GPL
<derek> if you used it via RPC it could be anything you like
<psu_> ajmitch: I'm not getting rid of the dial-up until I'm happy with the cable
<ajmitch> derek: right, that's what i thought
<psu_> & got all my e-mail addresses changed over, etc.
<KeithJagrs> nickr: ok. i type gcc and get : no imput files
<KeithJagrs> forgive my ignorance. does this mean its ok?
<nickr> Yea
<KeithJagrs> ok
<KeithJagrs> should I untar python on a directory above htdocs?
<nickr> into !
<nickr> er

Action: derek thinks its like a jedi mind trick
Action: derek there is an error
<derek> jedi_cater: no error to see here move along

<derek> its interesting though you know you are screwed if jamest or jcater says
<derek> 'can you send me a sample'
<derek> or
<derek> 'can you file a bug on that'
<derek> as that means we arent sure how the hell you are breaking it and it doesnt sound like fun we want to play right now ;)
Action: jcater thinks derek hears that a lot
<derek> nah you guys are too familiar with me
<derek> i get the "wtf are you doing"
<jcater> oh, yeah
<derek> or "how the hell are you making it do that:"
<ajmitch> umm...

<derek> you releasing tonight or doing another pre-release
<derek> and will there be a windows release for 0.4.1
<jamest> DefaultUI ok for the optoin name?
<ajmitch> sure
<derek> or will we be saying windows support is gone until 0.5.0
<jcater> I am doing the birthday thing tonight
<jcater> so I can't help w/release tonight
<jcater> and I think jamest is tied up
<ajmitch> is btami the windows release lord?
<jcater> so it looks like it's later this weekend
<jcater> though I might stop in and do -pre4's
<derek> ajmitch: my fear is no one has pre-release tested any windows
<jamest> commited the forms chnage
<jamest> now looking at designer
<jcater> I think some were testing under windows
<derek> well before you guys run off if you can create pre4's
<ajmitch> most people here seem to use GNU/Linux
<derek> i will test tonight in my gnue-sb work
<jamest> ajmitch: i assume you were adding to an existing form?
<ajmitch> derek: how's gnue-sb going?
<ajmitch> jamest: yup
<derek> ajmitch: good but slow
Action: ajmitch has to look at gnue-sb, the description looks like interesting stuff
<derek> jcater pounded out schema fixes YEAH
<derek> so for now we have the gsd's fixed and working !
<ajmitch> SB is what i mainly care about
<derek> i will be fixing the forms to match

<ajmitch> it's been in sid for a loooong time :)
<derek> as i got gphoto2 and gtkam and they upgraded me to libgtk2

<ajmitch> wxColour is only referenced in the splash screen stuff, and getLogin

<ajmitch> oh
<derek> apt-get install gnue-forms-wx
<derek> apt-get install gnue-forms-curses

<ajmitch> hey jbailey
<nickr> ah HAH
<jbailey> Heya Andrew.
<jbailey> So I'm now committed to try and show gnue to my boss for late next week.
<jbailey> It's pretty much not going in as the PO system, but probably will be our networking database. =)
<ajmitch> excellent
<ajmitch> so you've got to learn the system in the next week, enough for a demo? :)
<jbailey> Ayup.
<ajmitch> no worries ;)
<chillywilly> Isomer: :)
<chillywilly> SUBJ: Engineers, Scientists, and Mathematicians, Take One
<chillywilly> Engineers think that equations approximate the real world.
<chillywilly> Physicists think that the real world approximates equations.
<chillywilly> Mathematicians are unable to make the connection ...
<chillywilly> ---
<chillywilly> SUBJ: Engineers, Scientists, and Mathematicians, Take Two
<chillywilly> An engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician are shown a pasture
<chillywilly> with a herd of sheep, and told to put them inside the smallest
<chillywilly> possible amount of fence.
<chillywilly> The engineer is first. He herds the sheep into a circle and then
<chillywilly> puts the fence around them, declaring, "A circle will use the least
<chillywilly> fence for a given area, so this is the best solution."
<chillywilly> The physicist is next. He creates a circular fence of infinite
<chillywilly> radius around the sheep, and then draws the fence tight around the
<chillywilly> herd, declaring, "This will give the smallest circular fence around
<chillywilly> the herd."
<chillywilly> The mathematician is last. After giving the problem a little
<chillywilly> thought, he puts a small fence around himself and then declares, "I
<chillywilly> define myself to be on the outside."
<chillywilly> hehe
<Isomer> heh

<ajmitch> hehe
<dneighbo> to start tearing into gnue-sb
<dneighbo> how was birthday?
<jcater> good
Action: jcater feels like an old man
<ajmitch> your birthday?
<jcater> ya
<ajmitch> happy b'day :)
<jcater> thanks
<dneighbo> ooooo
<dneighbo> someone has redhat packages for 0.4.0
<dneighbo> grrr my connectino is fouling up again
<dneighbo> sisgh
<jcater> ajmitch: do you know if jamest was able to fix that Add Datasource issue?
<jcater> I know he was on his way out'
<ajmitch> jcater: he said he'd have to leave it
<jcater> grrrrr
<jcater> my damn toilet is leaking
<ajmitch> :)
<jcater> sometimes I hate owning a house
<chillywilly> sweating a lot?
<chillywilly> the tank that is
<chillywilly> ;)
<dneighbo> he fixed it by assigning it to jcater :)
<dneighbo> early birthday present and all
<dneighbo> jcater: hey my toilet is too
<dneighbo> i tried to fix it last weekend
<chillywilly> toilet tank
<dneighbo> spent an hour 'modifying' parts
<dneighbo> but looks like i will have to break down and go buy a few new pieces
Action: dneighbo was impressed with his toilet mods too
<jcater> chillywilly: no, it's the supply line
<chillywilly> oh
<jcater> it's one of those vinyl kind
<jcater> I've had really bad luck w/those going out
<jcater> I had two vinyl ones wearing out at the rental house
<chillywilly> I was gonna say if it sweats too mch you can insulate the tank to stop that
<jcater> chillywilly: nah, I live in the south... not a issue down here
<dneighbo> get the braided hose
<jcater> dneighbo: yeah
<jcater> that's all I'll buy from now on
<ajmitch> jcater: the problem was in the add dropdown wizard, where i got the wonderful opportunity to select a datasource
<jcater> that's 3 vinyl ones I will have replaced in the last 6 weeks
<dneighbo> my problem isnt a 'leak' its that the toilet runs
<dneighbo> was faulty diapraghm 
<jcater> ajmitch: yeah, I see the issue
<jcater> will try to patch shortly
<dneighbo> fixed that with some 'spare' parts
<ajmitch> cool
Action: ajmitch just added the entry manually
<dneighbo> but they dont quite fit the toilet so had to mod the 'float' a bit to get things operational
<dneighbo> worked for about 3 months but the strain on the new return is too much so its progressively failing
<dneighbo> :(
Action: dneighbo just cant cut it as a toilet engineer ;)
<jcater> yeah I had that issue recently
<jcater> as simple as they are
<jcater> I hate dealing w/toilet floats
<dneighbo> my net connection SUCKS
<jcater> birds getting in the way?
<ajmitch> lovely, a toilet discussion
<dneighbo> hey i have a new camera i think its time to get some toilet mod shots ;)
<jcater> rofl
<jcater> ajmitch: could be worse
<jcater> we could be talking underground septic system repair
<ajmitch> could be talking about what goes into the toilets?
Action: chillywilly would love to have a toilet problem with *his* house ;)...er, or have a house at all for that matter
<dneighbo> hey when people say gnue is sh*t
<dneighbo> we can say thats ok we are toilet pros
<dneighbo> mdean: where oh where is mdean
<dneighbo> jcater: i have actually modded a sump pump before
<jcater> chillywilly: see, this is more a relational problem than an object-oriented one
<jcater> see, you can define the house as an object and you as an object
<jcater> but you're gonna have to create some relationship with a really good job
<dneighbo> pre emgering it in the septic system though :)
Action: dneighbo is SO grateful we dont have septic systems like that out here (at least not in the city)
<jcater> dneighbo: I can relate
<dneighbo> jcater: yeah the toilet.flush() method doesnt seem to be completing its callback
<jcater> it's friggin discusting
<chillywilly> jcater: gee thanks that helps tremendously
<chillywilly> NOT
<jcater> dneighbo: well, I tried the message-passing paradigm
<jcater> but it just didn't respond to my cursing
<jcater> so then I tried the reference-by-handle methodology
<jcater> but hitting it with a bat hurt me more than it
<jcater> and it still didn't work
Action: jcater could try virtual methods
<jcater> but taking a shit on the couch probably isn't a good idea
<jcater> especially considering wife would make me sleep on the couch afterwards
<jcater> which quickly turns into a pseudo-object-relational nightmare
<ajmitch> sigh, geek jokes :)
<chillywilly> relationship Job lackee inverse Job::masta;
<jcater> ajmitch: oh, it gets worse... but I'll stop here :)
<chillywilly> praise the Lord :)
<jcater> sometimes I get the feeling chillywilly doesn't like me :-/
<chillywilly> it's all in your head
<jcater> but then I consider what I'm missing out on
<dneighbo> wow kde3 is kind of nice
Action: dneighbo ducks
<jcater> and I don't feel so bad
<jcater> kind of?
<jcater> it's the choice of a gnu generation
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<chillywilly> uh, hell no
<ajmitch> kde rocks
<dneighbo> wife broke computer today and startx over gdm got her in kde3
<jcater> I love kde
<jcater> it's made my life so much easier
Action: jcater was so glad to get the callcenter off of gnome
<dneighbo> its very 'crisp'
<dneighbo> nice fonts
<dneighbo> i still think their widgets and icons are ugly as sin
Action: dneighbo likes it all
<dneighbo> i.e. i like gnome, kde is nice, i live in fluxbox
<dneighbo> hey chillywilly did you see my ximian barbie?
<chillywilly> no
Action: chillywilly is feeling a bit depressed right now
<jcater> cheer up, little buddy
<chillywilly> eh...
<jcater> it could be worse
<dneighbo> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/ximian_barbie.jpg
<dneighbo> that should cheer you up
<dneighbo> doh!
<dneighbo> i just realized he aint got no pants on
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/toilet_mod.png
<dneighbo> gnue the first irc channel featuring toilet mods
<chillywilly> lol, where'd you get ximian barbie clothes?
<dneighbo> i think a little plexiglass and tube lighting and tis complete
<dneighbo> chillywilly: i have a bunch of rupert monkeys
<dneighbo> i gave some to the girls
<jcater> dneighbo: y'all must not have very high water pressure in AZ
<dneighbo> one day i stepped on something, cussed and picked it up
<dneighbo> it was ken w/ a helixcode shirt
<dneighbo> and i was like WHOA where did they get that
Action: chillywilly has never seen a rupert monkey
<dneighbo> and just before i was really ready to freak
<dneighbo> i saw a naked rupert on the floor
<jcater> you don't have a clippy thingy securing the white tubing in place
<chillywilly> heheh
<jcater> those would fly out here in Memphis
<dneighbo> and was like ahhh they stole it from rupert
Action: dneighbo thinks that was pretty clever
<jcater> argh!
<dneighbo> they wanted daddy ken doll
<jcater> what am I saying!
<dneighbo> rofl
<chillywilly> I need caffiene
<dneighbo> ok nickr you here
<dneighbo> you know of a good tool that will 'scale' all the images in a directory
<jcater> imagemagick
<jcater> oh, that was a nickr question... sorry
Action: dneighbo think igal might do this
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> i only asked nickr as he is camera guru
Action: dneighbo is debating if i want to keep photos at the super size image
<dneighbo> image management yet another problem w/o time to fix
<jcater> EXAMPLES
<jcater>        To make a thumbnail of a JPEG image, use:
<jcater>            convert -size 120x120 cockatoo.jpg -resize 120x120
<jcater>                    +profile '*' thumbnail.jpg
<jcater>        In this example, "-size 120x120" gives a hint to the JPEG decoder that the image is  going
<jcater>        to  be downscaled to 120x120, allowing it to run faster by avoiding returning a full-reso
<jcater>        lution image.  The "-resize 120x120" specifies the desired dimensions of the output image.
<jcater>        It  will be scaled so its largest dimension is 120 pixels.  The "+profile '*'" removes any
<jcater>        ICM, EXIF, IPTC, or other profiles that might be present in the input and aren't needed in
<jcater>        the thumbnail.
<jcater> that could be as simple as:  convert myimage.jpg -resize 120x120 thumbnail.jpg
<jcater> but their example has a few optimizations (which I've never used, btw)
<dneighbo> yeah but thats not my problem persay
<dneighbo> the issue is i have a huge file from the camera
<dneighbo> i want to smoosh it for web display (igal) does that just fine
<dneighbo> i was thinking of trashing the big file
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> really this is our camera now
<dneighbo> and wife might choose to make prints etc
<dneighbo> ultimately i will be archiving off on to CD-R regularly
Action: ajmitch looks for a nice easy way to generate a class hierarchy & docs :)
<dneighbo> so its more a liguistical thign
<dneighbo> of download to where
<dneighbo> rename in what way
<dneighbo> move to where to burn etc
Action: jcater has a cron job set up for marketing at work
<dneighbo> and move to web
<dneighbo> etc etc
<jcater> they save pdf copies of all our supplies/materials when they are done to a directory
<jcater> I then have a cronjob that regularly looks for files here
<jcater> creates .png images for web use
<jcater> of the supplies from the pdf
<jcater> creates another pdf that's not at the 1200x1200 resolution
<jcater> that's more suitable for emailing someone to just glance at
<jcater> uploads framed png version to our
<jcater> salesrep's online account center
<jcater> as well as another scaled down pdf that they can preview
<jcater> might want to consider something like that
<jcater> you just save images to a certain directory
<jcater> and periodically, web-ready viersions, archive-ready versions, etc are created 
Action: jcater is just thinking how your wife likes things... "it just works"

<dneighbo> yeah
<dneighbo> im thinking of having wife just always dump them in a photos directory
<dneighbo> then nightly cronjob
<dneighbo> and move to a 'burnme' directory
<dneighbo> and move a smaller copy to the pre-web directory
<dneighbo> then periodically i can rename and categorize the ones for webpublishing
<dneighbo> and burn the big guys to cd and delete or something

<ra3vat> is it committed?
<dneighbo> yeah but not the main maint screen
Action: dneighbo forgot that one
<dneighbo> duh...
<ra3vat> what gcvs is for?
<dneighbo> it wraps common
<dneighbo> so say you write a script myfoo.py
<dneighbo> that usues common
<dneighbo> instead of having to set python paths you can just do

<ra3vat> oh, good thing

<ra3vat> when will we get that [common] in gnue.conf?
<jbailey> Heya siesel.
<siesel> jbailey: one question: should the /etc/gnue/sample.connection.conf and /etc/gnue/sample.gnue.conf be configuration files?
<siesel> ra3vat: its just a bit hacking needed, i.e. changing all calls in form from gConfig to gformConfig and using gConfig only to access [common] values
<ra3vat> gConfigForms?
<jbailey> siesel: I don't think so - Because they're intended to be samples, there should be no good reason to change them.
<jbailey> But debhelper will mark them as such automatically.
<jbailey> I so I will probably move them into /usr/share/doc/PACKAGE/examples
<siesel> that would be great, thanks.
<jbailey> Is it causing you grief?
<jbailey> (Assessing urgency)
<siesel> ra3vat: you can set global configuration commands in GConfig.py

<chillywilly> my son is harassing me to take him to McDonalds ;)
<jbailey> Tell him that animals get slaughtered for food there and he should be a vegan.
<jbailey> On the down side, you won't be able to cook your usual meals for him.
<jbailey> On the upside, he'll never ask for Macdo's again.

<dneighbo> jbailey: my daughter is going through the vegan stage i think
<dneighbo> she still likes meat so its it
<dneighbo> but really struggles with it.... at her slumber party they had hotdogs or something
<dneighbo> and my daughter was like.. you know that the ground up insides of a pig
<dneighbo> and like 9 out of 10 of the girls wouldnt believe her (which amazed me)
<dneighbo> and then she was like yeah and a hamburger is a ground up cow and 7 of 10 didnt believe that
Action: dneighbo is back (gone 06:38:19)
<dneighbo> jcater: you around?
<dneighbo> jamest: you around?
Action: jcater waits to see if jamest responds before answering.....
<jcater> damn, guess not
<jcater> dneighbo: yeah
<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> i didnt get prereleases tested (me got busy and used cvs forgetting)
<dneighbo> stuff looks very good
<dneighbo> much more solid that 0.4.0
<dneighbo> i have questions on formatmasks
<dneighbo> actually i worked around it so the question lies in feature map
<dneighbo> we need to add number/currency format/input masks
<dneighbo> and documentation of masks :)
<dneighbo> i ahve to take kids swimming
<dneighbo> but when i get back i have a nice 5gallon drum of lube
<dneighbo> and i plan to sit down with navigator
<dneighbo> so expect the feature map to fall out ;)
<jcater> input masks are a BIG todo
<jcater> we are very close
<jcater> but no cigar quite yet
<jcater> (that should be in 0.5.0 plans, if not, I'll add)
<dneighbo> again im not dictating which release :)
<jcater> it's a biggie
<jcater> as in, needs
<jcater> well, and programming too I guess
<jcater> although most of the backend is in there
<dneighbo> it could be i didnt look
<dneighbo> i know we talked about it in designer the other day
<dneighbo> looks like date stuff is there and documented some

<dneighbo> ie the import 'name' must match the table 'name'
<dneighbo> or the .sql doesnt get created, but no errors are generated
<dneighbo> im not sure if you meant it to force a name match or not
<dneighbo> if not its a bug
<jcater> um
<dneighbo> if so, we need an error message saying the .sql isnt created
<jcater> yes, it has to have a name to import against
<jcater> that's the purpose of that field
<jcater> but it is definitely a bug
<jcater> that parser doesn't bomb off with an error

<dneighbo> actually after the rude intro this guy is pretty good
<dneighbo> hasnt asked me to go into microsoft networking yet
<chillywilly> hehe
<jbailey> neigbours is easy. =)
<jbailey> bah.  neighbours.
<chillywilly> did yo tell him you are running GNU/Linux?
<chillywilly> you
Action: jcater can see it now with the new training
<jcater> "Is GNU/Linux like Linux?"
<dneighbo> and ran network tests instead of assuming i was an idito
<dneighbo> idiot
<dneighbo> and ran same tests i have and confirms there is about 20% packet loss happening
<dneighbo> and will be sending someone out to replace the hardware
<dneighbo> chillywilly: no i learned the hardway to never do that :)
<dneighbo> i told him i was running M$ Advanced Linux Pro
<dneighbo> he said he hadnt tried that one yet...

<dneighbo> tech coming on monday to bring me new modem

<dneighbo> roflmao
<dneighbo> um jamest now they have guitars that support ethernet connections
<dneighbo> why splice ;)
<jcater> gives new meaning to pinging a guitar
<jbailey> Think of the hack value.
<jbailey> 'cause next will be 802.11b
<jcater> I'd just hate to see the DoS on that thing
<jcater> what would happen?
<jcater> strings break?
<jbailey> And just *wait* until some major rock star in some major concert forgets to turn on encryption or uses an insecure password.
<jcater> hehe
<jcater> "Daddy, why does the guitar sound like it says, "I ownz ju"???
<jbailey> Headline: Geek arrested today at Metallica concert for incitement to riot.  "I thought it would be a good prank", said the man who simply gave his name as "Hax0r".  Earlier today, metalica began to play, when the sound cut out and began playing a backstreet boys song.  "It was hard to find the culprit with all the blood and corpses around", said Officer Kruptpky, "but the laptop was a dead give away."
<chillywilly> you guys are just taking this too far

<chillywilly> hmmm, most ppl still dig analog music though
<chillywilly> that's why we still prefer tube amps
<dneighbo> http://magic.gibson.com/
<dneighbo> of course its patent stuff
<dneighbo> so it needs a free equivalent :)
<chillywilly> thought they said it was going to be royalty free?
<chillywilly> so the patent is a bit moot isn't it?
<jcater> not hardly
<jcater> I'll let you use my foobulation library royalty free, chilly
<dneighbo> i saw the license
<dneighbo> just now
<dneighbo> its not even royalty free
<jcater> what happens when you piss me off, chilly?
<dneighbo> its royalty free for 10 years
<dneighbo> i.e. they want people to adopt over next 10 years
<chillywilly> jcater: yea, I know patents are still crappy
<dneighbo> and then when they ahve everyone by the balls the royalty wears off
<jbailey> Negotiate for royalty-free for 25 years. =)
<jcater> funny thing though
<psu> yeah, but with a Mickey Mouse Copyright Act, 10 years could become 100...
<jcater> I thought patents had a 14 year shelf life?
<dneighbo> Is there a license fee for developers?
<dneighbo> No. We are providing a ten year royalty free license on MaGIC. 
<psu> or 1...
<chillywilly> This is the same BS that Henry J's been trying to force down the throats of the rest of the industry for the past two years. It's why Gibson bought and killed Opcode. It's not a patch on the ass of Yamaha's MLan standard that's based on the much faster IEEE-1394 (aka Firewire). It's another worthless ego-trip for Gibson's delusional owner.
<chillywilly> Back to "Gibson Makes Music 'Magic'"
<chillywilly>

<chillywilly> ?
<chillywilly> oh, nm
<chillywilly> hehe
Action: chillywilly didn't even see the typo right away
<chillywilly> so don't feel bad
Action: psu will probably be looking to hook some people into helping on KCs
<psu> i.e. a group-authored approach
<psu> but I'm thinking how to do it first 
<psu> then will look for some volunteers
<jcater> I'll be happy to volunteer some people for you
<psu> no volunteers == carry on solo, but not cover everything
<psu> s/everything/as much
<jbailey> jcater: A prerelease is like preboarding an airplane.
<psu> since it doesn't cover *everything* even now
<jcater> jbailey: ?
<jbailey> jcater: It's a fiction created by marketing people to make others think something cool is happening and that they're not part of it. =)
Action: psu would not have been able to keep up this week if he hadn't been on vacation

<psu> ooo
<psu> jcater: agreed
<jcater> agreed?
<jcater> you've been talking to my wife?

<jcater> don't tell my girlfriend
<chillywilly> do you have a desth wish?

<jcater> I'm married to GNUe
<jcater> the wife is my mistress I escape to occasionally
<psu> chillywilly: you'll understand after 7th June 2003

<psu> well, apart from my Feb dentist appointment
<chillywilly> that date is "tentative" ;)
<psu> ok
Action: jcater hates programming in curses
<chillywilly> jamest's analogy of the even system is funny

<jcater> no!

<jcater> feature plans, dammit

<jcater> anyone here have a good crockpot chili recipe?
<jbailey> I do.
<jcater> bah
<jbailey> But it's all vegan, is that okay? 
<jcater> that uses ground beef?
<jcater> actually that might be good
<jcater> what's in it?
<jbailey> I always wonder when I see people put meat into crockpots.  I didn't think those things stayed warm enough to keep away bacteria.
<jcater> I'm pretty sure they do
<jbailey> I also have the same fear when I see those rotating slabs of meat at greek take out places.
<psu> kebabs
<chillywilly> a spit?
Action: psu likes the way they call them "doner kebabs" to imply the animals were volunteers
Action: psu guesses that "Donner kebabs" has a diff implication in USA
<nickr>  hehe
<nickr> said entirely differently than doner though
<jcater> yummy

<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I haven't rewired my new house
Action: psu is away: kc-ing
<jcater> so I don't have cat5 in the kitchen for my recipe station :(
<chillywilly> dragon ball z rocks
<jcater> jbailey: what's in your vegan chili?
<jbailey> a couple types of beans, fried onions, lots of tomatoe sauce.
<jbailey> (or crushed tomatos)
<jbailey> Carrots, spices.
<jbailey> Trying to tihnk what else I throw in there.
<chillywilly> sounds pretty good
<jbailey> I like using black beans and black-eyed peas.
<jbailey> I tried chickpeas once (garbonzo beans for the UKer), and that was a mistake. =)
<jcater> mmmm
<jbailey> If you're using a crockpot with chilli and you want to throw in corn or something like that, don't throw it in until near the end or it turns into mush.
<jbailey> I'm torn between wanting to turn up the heat and wanting icecream.
<jbailey> I probably shouldn't do both. =)

<btami> well, they are OK
<ra3vat> no, thay are flaky
<btami> except the event issues
<btami> look collected win32 bugs in DCL :)
<jamest> ok
<ra3vat> btami: with test you asked i've only got an error when running form from within a designer
<jamest> i put a patch into designer yesterday
<btami> no
<jamest> so it'll work now but error out at the end
<ra3vat> ok, will check again
<jamest> part of designer outside of src/forms is still forms specific :(
<jamest> it'll get fixed after release
<btami> i'v failed with making forms/reports with simple wizard if i used non ascii title
<btami> when i want to save them
<jamest> ah, i thought he was talking about running form insdie designer via debug-run    my bad
<ra3vat> btami: what happens when you save?
<btami> btw. i can't run forms from designer via debug :)
<jamest> from today's cvs?
<btami> wait i try all my things again :)
<jcater> wait
<jcater> re the formFontEncoding
<jcater> what outside of forms will use it?
<jamest> wasn't designer going to support all languages in its menus/dialgos?

<jcater> jason@jcater:~$
<jcater> gotcha
<btami> my bad patch in GParser.py now uses formFontEncoding
<btami> that is wrong
<jcater> formFontEncoding in GParser?
<jcater> why?
<btami> sorry, that is not my patch, its from art
<btami> my is in GRReport
<btami> but as jamest said, a simple fontEncoding in [common] is a solution
<jcater> but, but, but
<jcater> what fonts are in GRReport?
<jcater> this is where I'm getting lost
<jcater> should that be
<jcater> fileEncoding?
<jcater> or textEncoding
<btami> yes
<jcater> it's the "font" part that's losing me
<jcater> ok
<jcater> we are on the same page now
<btami> maybe font is needed for wx
<jcater> which is the better name?
<jcater> textEncoding?
<btami> ok for me
<btami> formFontEncoding is needed for  wx UI driver
<jcater> but are they the same thing always?
<btami> and this new one is for parsers
<jcater> ok
<jcater> so this does not replace formFontEncoding?
<jcater> this is a new parameter?

<ra3vat> > how to reach what GNU gettext bind_textdomain_codeset function is for

<ra3vat> Dmitry,
<ra3vat> I recommend to use ugettext instead, or wrap it
<ra3vat> appropriately. ugettext will always return Unicode objects (assuming
<ra3vat> that the codeset of the .mo file was properly declared in the .mo
<ra3vat> header).
<ra3vat> > I'd like to use translation catalog which is in koi8-r encoding with gui
<ra3vat> > that expects either koi8-r or cp1251.
<ra3vat> Then I recommend to do something like this
<ra3vat> catalog = gettext.translation("domainname")
<ra3vat> runtime_charset = "cp1251"
<ra3vat> def _(msg):
<ra3vat>   return catalog.ugettext(msg).encode(runtime_charset)
<ra3vat> Changing runtime_charset will then arrange for _ to return
<ra3vat> differently-encoded messages.
<ra3vat> > The problem is that we are trying to leave encoding = "ascii" in
<ra3vat> > site.py as it is by default and assign needed encoding at run time.
<ra3vat> That is a good idea.
<ra3vat> > Without bind_textdomain_codeset we need to put something like
<ra3vat> > _('Text String').encode(neededencoding) in too many places
<ra3vat> Not necessarily. Even without ugettext, you could always do
<ra3vat> def _(msg):
<ra3vat>   gettext.dgettext(domain).decode("koi8-r").encode("cp1251")
<ra3vat> That, of course, requires you to hard-code the codeset of the catalog,
<ra3vat> which is undesirable - ugettext finds out the codeset of the catalog
<ra3vat> dynamically.
<ra3vat> Remember: _ is just a function. This function can do any computation
<ra3vat> you want.
<ra3vat> > Sorry for not asking in newsgroup but personally.
<ra3vat> That is ok (in this specific case :-).
<ra3vat> If you think bind_textdomain_codeset is a better interface than
<ra3vat> ugettext, I encourage you to enhance gettext.py in this respect.  I
<ra3vat> would add another dictionary, next to _localedirs; say,
<ra3vat> _localecodesets. Then, add a gettext_codeset method to GNUTranslation,
<ra3vat> which does recoding if necessary, and use that in dgettext if a
<ra3vat> _localecodeset has been set for the domain.
<ra3vat> You might also consider adding a codeset argument to install, which
<ra3vat> would (if recoding is needed) install a lambda function like
<ra3vat>    def install(self, unicode=0, codeset = None):
<ra3vat>         import _
<ra3vat> looks very bad
<ra3vat> better to forward to maillist

<dneighbo> cool
<jamest> one step further down the path to being a dneighbo
<dneighbo> i remember sosmething similar in the 0.0.1 days ;)
<dneighbo> with forms
<jamest> how goes the testing with gnue-sb forms?
<dneighbo> i have them all working
<dneighbo> i told jcater things look WAY more solid than 0.4.0

<dneighbo> jamest: i might have some need for sloppy query
<dneighbo> designer still has really _old_ bug of not properly updating forms in designer when dealing with entry w/ rows
<dneighbo> i.e. you add an entry
<dneighbo> then change its 'row' property to 10
<dneighbo> it wont show on the screen until you shut the form down and reopen it
Action: dneighbo remembers vaguely this being a wx issue
<jamest> i can reimplement sloppy query
<jamest> no, it's our issue
<jamest> but it's not worth fixing at this time 
<jamest> as that's going to change anyway
<ra3vat> jamest: yes
<dneighbo> jamest: 3 more forms down for testing
<dneighbo> using designer a bit on them

<btami> hi all
<ra3vat> encoding options in header is not defined
<ra3vat> postgresql
<jamest> is this only in i18n forms?
<jamest> hi btami
<btami> hi
<jamest> how goes the win32 stuff
<ra3vat> btami: i've got that bug with non-ascii page and title
<btami> so i'm not a paranoid
<ra3vat> but in my case it was that encoding missed in xml header
<btami> jamest: win32 setup is ok, just about 10Mb, not for slow modem :)
<ra3vat> jamest: will try again now on w98 and ascii form
<jamest> 10MB!!!!!!
<jamest> wow
<btami> it grabs tcl/tk/tkinter too
<btami> i don't know which modul
<btami> but i have another bugs :)
<btami> 1. please put gnue.common.external into commons setup.py
<btami> 2. i don't know how to save trigger code (written in event editor) with designer
<btami> it doesn't saves for me
<jamest> 1.   working on it

<jamest> 2. how are you using it?
<jamest> do you add the trigger then edit it
<jamest> edit existing trigger
<jamest> or other
<btami> added a new button with wizard

<jamest> ra3vat: :(  I've see something like this once or twice
<jamest> with <block> tags
<btami> i'm waiting to say my 3. :)
<jamest> acsii-only?
<jamest> ra3vat?
<jamest> oooo wizards have issues
<jamest> !@#!$!@#
<ra3vat> i did not put any non-ascii
<ra3vat> values
<jamest> it's a simple table?
<jamest> using the simple wizard?
<jamest> ooooooo
<jamest> what distro you running?
<jamest> and what db driver?
<ra3vat> simple form wizard
<jamest> there is a known issue with one of the postgresql drivers in debian sid
<jamest> that IIRC does exactly this
<ra3vat> distro is w98 :)
<jamest> what db driver?
<ra3vat> db drive is pypgsql
<jamest> btami: I'm going to need time on #2 as I see a problem in there
<jamest> what's #3
<jamest> ra3vat: can you send me the schema of the table?
<jamest> so I can test 
<btami> reports without any non ascii
<btami> with sablotron filter
Action: jamest cringes
Action: jamest ph34rs reports code
<btami> jcater put encoding="iso8859-1" into xml header
<btami> but sablotron doesn't knoes that
<btami> it knows iso-8859-1
<btami> so sablotron fails
<jamest> so if I thange to the latter we'll be ok
<jamest> and the current iso8859-1 isn't used elsewhere?
<ra3vat> CREATE TABLE "reclaims" (
<ra3vat>         "id" integer DEFAULT nextval('reclaims_id_seq'::text) NOT NULL,
<ra3vat>         "num" text,
<ra3vat>         "origdate" date,
<ra3vat>         "org_id" integer,
<ra3vat>         "vendor_id" integer,
<ra3vat>         "model" character varying(20),
<ra3vat> is what pg_dump gives and i only choose num and model fields
<btami> jamest:iso8859-2 is used elsewhere, but they are correct, its only a sblotron issue i think
<jamest> in our sablotron setup or the program in general?
Action: jamest knows nothing about sablotron
fixe (~adam@dsl093-081-253.chi2.dsl.speakeasy.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<btami> in sablotron general
<jamest> :(
<ra3vat> btami: then blame sablotron guys :)
<btami> :)
<jamest> ra3vat: are you using pypgsql 2.3beta or 2.2 stable?
<jamest> btami: if it's in sablotron then do you have any suggestions for a workaround we can put in our code?
<jamest> among the numerious things in the world that I have no clue about i18n/encodings are pretty high on the list 
<ra3vat> it is 2.0.win32
<btami> jamest: in GRReport.py line#134 
<btami> encoding = 'iso-8859-1' 
<btami> will fix it
<jamest> but break it for other things later I assume
<ra3vat> jamest: updating to 2.2

<_btami> jamest: what about changing formFontEncoding [forms] -> fontEncoding [common] i gnue.conf ?
lupo (~lupo@pD9542DB5.dip.t-dialin.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> jason looked into that yesterday and had some concern, but I have no clue what it was
<ra3vat> jamest: have you seen another issue i tried to explain yesterday?
<jamest> ?
<ra3vat> it is in backlog
<jamest> ok, i'll look in a bit
Action: jamest is on a mission
<jamest> forms was scrapped by a local company for a custom java app partially due to fact that python isn't as well know (i guess)
<jamest> that app has taking them the better part of this year to implement
<lupo> how ignorant
<jamest> and certain feautres are missing 
<lupo> lemme guess, you did it in 5 minutes with forms and python :)
<jamest> so I was working on their hardware one weekend and they mentioned they couldn't do lookups on anything but id number and phone number
<jamest> then only pull 1 record at a time
<jamest> so via designer I whipped up a query form in like 90 seconds
<lupo> brb
<jamest> they liked it
<jamest> now I'm making one for them to query anything that the java app builds
<jamest> and it didn't take 5 minutes
<jamest> I've probably got a few hours in it
<jamest> but i'm finding forms bugs as I go
<jamest> and it won't do what the java app does
<jamest> i'd need a few more hours to get all the triggers in place :)
<jamest> but I desperately want to get this in there
<jamest> as they are using forms and reports in production now
<jamest> but want to rewrite all in java or something else
<lupo> great
<lupo> so you get paid for working on gnue tools, at least from that customer?
<jamest> i get money for the time working on the form
<jamest> i don't get paid time for gnue coding time
<lupo> paid for fixing forms bugs?
<jamest> which makes it hard to explain to wife sometimes
<jamest> as I worked like 4 hours yesterday 
<lupo> what's so difficult to understand?
<jamest> the fact that I don't charge for finding gnue bugs
<lupo> i see
<jamest> as 4 hours on their stuff != 4 hours of money
<jamest> and I work at an extremely low rate
<jamest> the original contract stated that anything I did for them that wasn't private was mine to integrate into gnue
<jamest> if it wasn't like that then the old hourly wage would have shot up alot
<lupo> what a pity
<jamest> what? that they scrapped it?
<jamest> or that I don't get paid to work on gnue code?
Action: jamest wouldn't want to get paid for that as then it'd be "work" 
<lupo> ah
<lupo> programming for fun :)

<jamest> oh yeah
<jamest> i don't need this side job
<jamest> but the owner is a great guy
<jamest> and I love maintaining their hardware
<lupo> ?
<jamest> when I started they had 1 dos box (8088 machine) and a win95 box
<lupo> and now?
btami (~btami@3e70d727.dialin.enternet.hu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> they now are 100% linux based (except for fedex computer, their scanner pc, and a copy of dreamweaver)
<jamest> running like 18 ltsp workstations
<jamest> all from a couple of custom servers I built
<lupo> great
<ra3vat> btami: you get that Martin's message with comment from gnue-dev list?
<jamest> it's fun
<btami> ra3vat: yes
<jamest> anyway, i must finish this form up
<jamest> as their java coder is overloaded with work
<lupo> 18 ltsp workstations is fun, right :)
<jamest> and this takes the pressure off him and makes a good case for keeping forms/reports instead of replacing
<ra3vat> btami: am i the only one who has different encoding on different platform?
<btami> no, i have iso8859-2 on linux, and cp1250 on win32

<ajmitch> hello all
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-245.wasp.net.au) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<jcater> ajmitch: werd
<ajmitch> hey
<ajmitch> now i can get back to making my form work :)
<ajmitch> like automagically inserting sequence numbers for master/detail
<jamest> that should be in the docs as a recipe 
<jamest> IIRC
<ajmitch> mysql's auto_increment doesn't work for master/detail, nor is it friendly :)
<ajmitch> yeah, i know, mysql sucks
<ajmitch> so who has a recipe for me? ;)
<chillywilly> take on mysql
<chillywilly> er, one
<chillywilly> broil it
<chillywilly> cut it up into little pieces
<chillywilly> works wonders as a substitude for cat litter
<chillywilly> cna even help yo soak up oil spills on your driveway
<jcater> chillywilly: yeah, and it can soak up that cat piss 10 times faster than postgresql
<jcater> just don't ask it to save the stuff reliably and it's all good
<jamest> ajmitch: i think if you implenet 
<jamest> sequenceNumber in the mysql driver 
<ajmitch> jcater: i got a couple of bugs for the gtk2 driver, shall i put them in dcl & fix them sometime?
<jamest> then you'd have them
<jamest> i _think_
<ajmitch> hmm
<jcater> ajmitch: works for me
<jcater> ajmitch: we never mind when someone wants to open a ticket that they plan to fix someday
<ajmitch> ok
<jcater> :)
<ajmitch> they _should_ be fairly simple to fix
<ajmitch> but can't promise that :)
<jamest> ajmitch: yes
<jamest> you fix that one driver functoin and it should just work
<jamest> what's the issue w/ mysql and sequences
<jamest> lemme guess....it doesn't have them
<ajmitch> jamest: ok, i just don't understand the issue :)
<ajmitch> jamest: all i want is for the primary key (id) to be set for each record :)
<jamest> in the detail?
<jamest> s
<ajmitch> and the value being set to be visible to the detail portion
<jamest> that's automatic on a commit in common
<ajmitch> right
<jamest> however getting the initial value from the db isn't IIRC
<ajmitch> hmm
<jamest> if you do the assignment on the database side then you have issues IIRC
<jamest> a db side trigger
<ajmitch> yup
<jamest> or a default value set to a function
<ajmitch> triggers? what's that? this is mysql i'm using :)
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> well, then that can't be the issue then :)
<jamest> does it have sequences?
<ajmitch> umm
<jamest> and is that where you are getting the primary key value?
<ajmitch> i'm not getting it yet
<jamest> where is it stored?
<ajmitch> at the moment, i have the primary key field set to auto_increment in the db
<ajmitch> which sucks
<jamest> hey! auto_increement == db side trigger!
<jamest> see, it's more advance than i give it credit
<jcater> um
<ajmitch> hah
<jcater> do you know the name of the sequence it created?
<ajmitch> name?
<jamest> this is mysql...naming things slows it down
Action: ajmitch doesn't think mysql does this sequence thing
<ajmitch> it's simple
<jcater> yeah it does
<jcater> it just hides it from you
<ajmitch> great
Action: jcater is googling for the answer
<jamest> showing user things slows it down
<ajmitch> i'd like to switch to postgresql :)
<chillywilly> the lesson here kiddies
<chillywilly> mysql sucks ass
<ajmitch> the lesson here, is that sometimes we don't have that much choice 
<chillywilly> that is all
<chillywilly> ajmitch: why would you HAVE to use mysql?
Action: jamest is just giving ajmitch a hard time
<jamest> with the gazillon installs for mysql it must be doing something right
<ajmitch> say if you're developing something for systems already with mysql
<chillywilly> use gsd and you get them all right? ;)
<ajmitch> or if you want to make something based on a db even simpler than mysql (like gadfly)
<ajmitch> would probably be easier for me to get the current id value, increment it, and save it back
<jamest> you using inno ?
<jamest> ajmitch?
<ajmitch> nope
<jamest> what's your backend then?
<ajmitch> huh?
<ajmitch> i'm currently using mysql
<jamest> mysql supports multiple backends
<ajmitch> will probably do forms for non-mysql stuff at some point
<ajmitch> hmm ok
<ajmitch> i'm just using boring old standard mysql from debian sid
<jamest> http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/SEC468.html
<jcater> ajmitch: will other programs be accessing this table?
<jcater> accessing == inserting records
<jamest> http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/ODBC_and_last_insert_id.html
<jamest> this should work for us I think
<jcater> dude
<jcater> there's no way
<jamest> ah, crap I misread that
<jamest> that's AFTER the insert isn't it
<jcater> yeah
<jamest> ajmitch: here's what you do
<jcater> but that's what I keep coming back to 
<jamest> create a table gnue_seed
<jcater> that, or  select max(id)+1 from table;
<ajmitch> jcater: nah, only this one for now
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> then let's create a real sequence :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<jamest> then make the getSequence in the db driver read the seed via a select for update, update it, 
Action: ajmitch gets confused
<jamest> then have it print to the debug log
<ajmitch> only got 3 hours sleep last night ;)
<jamest> "compensating for the lack of a sane database"
<ajmitch> i have no problems with dropping the tables & starting again
<jcater> ajmitch: great!!!!!
<jcater> do that
<jcater> then do apt-get install postgresql
<ajmitch> haha
<ajmitch> i already have postgresql running here
<jcater> dudes
<ajmitch> i want to know how to do this for any mysql form :)
<jcater> there has to be some way to get at that autoincremenet
<jamest> oooooo
<jamest> nevermind
<ajmitch> this is just a test form for now
<ajmitch> because i was bored ;)
Action: ajmitch would have thought this would be a 2-minute thing with mysql, at most
<chillywilly> buuurp
<jcater> ajmitch: so did I
<dneighbo> jcater / jamest did you see my back log the other day
<dneighbo> closing designer/forms crashed my X instance completely
<dneighbo> same as happened to jamest
<jamest> no, it locks mine
Action: dneighbo notes this was after about 1.5 hours of using forms/designer
Action: dneighbo isnt saying gnue is the cause, but it smells fishy
<jamest> i've used it all day with crash issues
<jamest> had 1 lockup issue that is non reproducable 
<dneighbo> jamest: so you confirming that gnue is crashing X
<jamest> no, x is fine
<jcater> using gnue for 1.5 hrs?!?!?!
<jcater> what, are you nuts!
<jamest> it's locking keyboard focus onto itself
<jcater> that could cause blindness, you know
<jamest> and not letter go
<jamest> x is fine
<jamest> :)
<ajmitch> jamest: i had one lockup
<dneighbo> jcater: well when it works i can uses it all day :)
Action: dneighbo has a slew of gnue-sb commits
<dneighbo> like i think almost every form is fully functional now :)
Action: ajmitch tries again to see if he locks it
<jamest> we're in the middle of a release 
<dneighbo> i just was finishing the last form when it died
<jamest> as in tying up the text files
<ajmitch> hmm no
<jamest> so it'll have to wait 
<dneighbo> and then i had to run
<dneighbo> jamest: thats fine
<jamest> btw - checkboxes work again 
<jamest> thank you jcater
<dneighbo> i have no problem releasing with known bugs
<ajmitch> tag it for next release if we have another 0.4.x
Action: dneighbo just wanted to make sure i voiced my 'experience'
<dneighbo> i.e. wanting to give you all feedback
<jamest> thank yo
Action: jcater wasn't paying attention
<jcater> but: 
<jamest> we needed the testing
<jcater> if feedback == positive: 
<jcater>   print "um, thanks"
<jcater> else:
<jcater>   print "We didn't ask"
<jcater> I think that covers it
Action: jcater ducks
<jamest>   print "must be on your end"
<jcater> hehe
<jcater> yeah, that's better
Action: ajmitch files a couple of bugs :)
<chillywilly> print "dneighbo did it"
<chillywilly> print "run with --disable-masta-hooks"
<ajmitch> hehe, i love how it says jcater is responsible for the forms bugs when submitted :)
<dneighbo> jcater: actually almsot all my feedback was very positive
<jcater> cool
<jcater> then:
<jcater> "um, thanks"
<dneighbo> stating stuff that hasnt worked in a year is now working
<dneighbo> and that stuff was very solid
<dneighbo> and i was able to be HIGHLY productive with it
<ajmitch> sounds like this release might be worth using then
<jamest> about time you updated your forms, you know we try and break the gfd at every release
<dneighbo> the only real thing i ran into was the crashing X
<dneighbo> and that was after almost 2 hours of productive
<dneighbo> time
<jamest> and if you didn't update your forms then we musta come full circle
<jamest> pwd

<chillywilly> lol
<jcater> ok, everyone
<jcater> for the immediate future
<jcater> docs are at:
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/docs/
<jcater> psu: if you read this
<chillywilly> w00t
<jcater> psu: where do you want them
<dneighbo> jcater: did you submit fix to pyscopg folks?
<dneighbo> or file a bug to them?
<jcater> oops, I forgot the html versions... they are uploaded now
<jcater> dneighbo: I'm going to have to spend some time on that
<jcater> and do a simple script that can repeat the issue
<ajmitch> jcater: oh btw: http://ajmitch.dhis.org/devel/classdocs/
<ajmitch> just a simple class hierarchy for now
<jcater> gack
<jcater> that's scary looking
<ajmitch> yup
<jcater> :)
<jcater> alrighty everyone
<jcater> time's up
<jcater> cvs is being tagged
<ajmitch> excellent
Action: dneighbo loves gsd
<dneighbo> jcater: is it working in designer again?
<dneighbo> i.e. the wizard to create them from db's?
<jcater> I think so
<jcater> that's gonna get a hefty overhaul shortly
<dneighbo> otay
<jamest> bash-2.05a$ history | grep tag
<jamest>   750  cvs tag common-0-4-1
<jamest>   755  cvs tag designer-0-4-1

<jamest> missed on
<jamest>   764  cvs tag reports-0-1-0
<dneighbo> mmm mmm goodness
<dneighbo> jcater: im seeing that very quickly we will need to address gsd 'diffs'
<dneighbo> i.e. schema mods
<dneighbo> as currently its easy for me as i know what im changing so i just drop the thing i modified and rerun script
<jcater> dneighbo: already in the works
<dneighbo> otay
Action: dneighbo likes irc tonight
<dneighbo> favorable responses, minimal 'hang the bloody bastard' and a release to boot
<dneighbo> does it get any better?
<chillywilly> we could have pizza and donuts
<jcater> ok, everyone do the dance with me:  http://www.gnuenterprise.org/var/www/downloads/prereleases/
<jcater> err
<jcater> s,var/www,
<dneighbo> SO KICK ASS
<jcater> http://www.gnuenteprise.org/downloads/prereleases/
<dneighbo> my contact_manager.gfd now saves in gnue_sb!!!
<dneighbo> i think that was last non functional form in there
<jcater> fsck
<jcater> nickserv isn't letting me log in
<jcater> if that dependent on my hostname?
<jcater> s/if/is
<chillywilly> I dun think so
<chillywilly> does it complain?
<jcater> tells me bad password
<jcater> which I don't buy
<jcater> I just don't forget passwords, dammit
<chillywilly> yes you do
<chillywilly> ;)
#gnuenterprise: mode change '+o jcater' by ChanServ!ChanServ@services.
Topic changed on #gnuenterprise by jcater!~jcater@cpe-066-061-083-220.midsouth.rr.com: One last dance: http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/prereleases.php ... do your part.
<dneighbo> cool even the nested/custom block navigation functions
<jcater> it, um, remembered my password
<jcater> dumb thing
<jcater> ;)
<dneighbo> ok new gnue-sb committed
<dneighbo> item management and contact management forms should 'function'
<dneighbo> they could be improved a bit
<dneighbo> and could have more features
<dneighbo> but the basic schema's and forms are there and do work!
<dneighbo> basically the two custom pieces i had hodgepodged at one time are now functioning
<dneighbo> i will look at 'feature maps' now for gnuesb
<jcater> cool
<dneighbo> and will build on these blocks as i begin to fold in stuff from NOLA
<dneighbo> btw: jcater/jamest MAJOR kudos to this release
<dneighbo> it is by far the best gnue we have seen to date
<jcater> so, what is this release's name?
<dneighbo> hardly seems fair to consider it a x.x.X release
<jcater> is it the "dneighbo is ecstatic" release?
<jcater> dneighbo: actually, it was mostly cleanup
<dneighbo> sure we can nick name it DIE
<dneighbo> hmmm RFID interesting concept
<jcater> ?
<dneighbo> wireless barcodes basically
<dneighbo> instead of a 'barcode' product has a an RF transmitable tag
<dneighbo> the trick is alien technologies just bumped the technology forward by lightyears
<dneighbo> coming up with sub .10 RFID tags
<dneighbo> of which someone just bought 500 million
<dneighbo> almost half of what is on the market currently
<dneighbo> all starwars toys ship with them
<dneighbo> http://www.rfidjournal.com/FAQs.html
<dneighbo> two immediately striking things are 
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I've read about these
<dneighbo> they can carry tihngs like 'expiration dates'
<chillywilly> next toe gov't embeds a chip into everyone's skull in order to keep track of them
<dneighbo> but i think places really using them are by 'pallets'
<dneighbo> you can skrink a whole pallet
<dneighbo> and scan the items w/o unbundling the pallet
<dneighbo> or so it would seem
<dneighbo> since they are not based on line of sight
<jcater> dneighbo: we traditionally have a "In other news, ...." paragraph at the end of our release announcements
<jcater> do you want gnue-sb mentioned there?
<dneighbo> yes please
<chillywilly> why does this stuff make me think they are gonna se RFIDs to track ppl?
<dneighbo> it needs people starting to beat on it
<chillywilly> am I paranoid?
<jcater> chillywilly: the range on those RFIDs are really small
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> i.e. they are great for warehousing
<dneighbo> chillywilly: if you stuff starwars figures up your ass, you deserve to be tracked ;)
<jcater> but you are talking a few feet, iirc
<jcater> dneighbo: rofl
<dneighbo> jcater: when i was ops manager at macy's
<chillywilly> dneighbo: I know where you are
<dneighbo> we were all RF based to inventory system
<dneighbo> and we had 3 story building
<dneighbo> probably 20,000 sqft per floor
<dneighbo> and we were running about 4 repeaters per floor
<dneighbo> one in each corner
<dneighbo> and at times we had 'blank' spots where it would cut out
<dneighbo> i would think its similar to wifi in range
<dneighbo> i.e. about that of a large home
<dneighbo> 3,000sqft or so
<jcater> but I think these RFIDs are so low power, they are even smaller range than that

<ajmitch> hey jeff
<jamest> jbailey: we released/are releasing today
<jamest> any chance we can get new debs marked same version # but 0.4.1b instead of a
<jbailey> Nice.  Are you using a version number that I can use? =)
<jamest> we used 0.4.1
<jamest> for forms
<jbailey> *cry*
<ajmitch> jbailey: be glad he didn't use a negative number :)
<jbailey> Mmm..  I can probably hack around it.
<jcater> that should be a simple change to your GNUE_VERSION_SUFFIX
<jcater> you currently have
<jcater> GNUE_VERSION_SUFFIX=-`date ....`
<jcater> couldn't that just be
<jcater> GNUE_VERSION_SUFFIX=b-`date ....`
<jbailey> It could be, but normally I would pull the tarball from a released directory.
<jbailey> Y'know - wanting man pages and all that. =)
<dneighbo> why cant we use 0.4.1
<dneighbo> ?
<jcater> jbailey: I can do tarballs with that if you'd like
<jbailey> dneighbo: 0.4.1 is lexically a lower version that 0.4.1a
<dneighbo> ah
<jamest> jbailey: are they hard to make?
<jamest> or get in sid?
<jbailey> jamest: Which 'they' in this case?
<jamest> the debs
<jbailey> No, not at all.
<jamest> i can test them tonight as I'm getting ready to update some production equipemnt
<jbailey> Once I have a tarball, I just overwrite the one that's there, change the version number in two places and upload.
<ajmitch> people dump all sorts of crap in sid
Action: jcater can do a tarball marked as "b" if you need it
<ajmitch> 0.4.1release :)
<jamest> 0.4.1damnMaintainersDidntListen
<jamest> or is it damnDevelopers
Action: jcater votes on damnChillywilly
<jcater> not sure why though
<jcater> :)
<jbailey> =)
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<jamest> oooo, good one
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> or
<jcater> 0.4.1derekLikesThisOne
<jcater> ;)
<ajmitch> 0.4.1sillyDebianNumbering
<chillywilly> i hope you all get leprosy and your male appendage falls off
Action: dneighbo is away: family
<jcater> chillywilly: even the women here?
<jcater> oh, wait.....
Action: chillywilly looks around
Action: chillywilly hands his glasses to jcater
<jbailey> What's your perscription?
Action: dneighbo is back (gone 00:04:17)
<dneighbo> guess wife wont be ready for movie for another 40 minutes
<chillywilly> heheh
<dneighbo> jcater: my connection is still knind of sluggishs can you verify if there is a createon/by date/time 'recipe' in the guide
<dneighbo> before i download it
Action: dneighbo is thinking its  straightforward on-commit trigger
<jcater> well
<jcater> um
<dneighbo> but am not sure syntax to get 'userid'
<jcater> if you'd downloaded these final tarballs to help out
<jcater> like a good team player
<jcater> then you'd have them
<dneighbo> are they uploaded?
Action: jcater goes into hiding
<dneighbo> if so i will grab right now
<jamest> yeah, they're uploaded
<jcater> see the topic
<dneighbo> as i really want to be running a stable release
<dneighbo> that says prerelease
<jamest> yeah
Action: dneighbo thought you guys just mention you bundled the final release
<jcater> those are final unless they don't install for someone
<jamest> they are finals 
<dneighbo> ok
Action: dneighbo gets it now
<jamest> when okd it a mv * ../current
<jcater> I'll just do a mv if they are ok
<dneighbo> downloading
<jcater> dneighbo: we have a createdon recipe
<jcater> but createdby
<jcater> who is 
<jcater> "
<jcater> "by"
<jcater> ?
<dneighbo> ?
<jamest> i think he wants the username of the logged in user
<dneighbo> yes
Action: dneighbo wasnt sure how to get that info via trigger
<jcater> username == username as logged into the database
<jamest> i almost understand jcater communicatoin
<jamest> like I almost understand jcater code
<jamest> somebody help me
<chillywilly> lol
<jcater> dneighbo: I know we can do that via triggers
<dneighbo> jcater: well what if you are using a custom 'authenicator'
<jcater> but we probably need to add a convenience method
Action: dneighbo had to make all my 'transactional' stuff like that nullable for now in gnue-sb
<dneighbo> until i get good trigger way to do it (or a convenience method)
<dneighbo> then i will add it back in
Action: dneighbo thinks the date part is taken care of
<dneighbo> if the db is setup properly
<dneighbo> as on should use function that posts timestamp if null else nothing if there
<dneighbo> and the modified should use function that posts timestamp no matter what
<dneighbo> though it would be better to amke it in application i think
Action: dneighbo is just so happy that its looking so good
<dneighbo> jamest: tool made front page of phoenix entertainment section here
<dneighbo> you interested in a copy
Action: dneighbo thinks he remembers you are a tool fan
<jamest> yeah
<jcater> what?
<jcater> no backstreet boys?
<jbailey> "I want it that way"
<jcater> be forewarned folks
<jcater> make sure you are somewhat happy with this release
<jcater> as cvs will break for a little while
<jcater> (not too long, but it will break)
<dneighbo> actually they made front page with a reference to a&e section
<dneighbo> article: "A thinking fan's band: metal master tool revises its thought-provoking show"
<dneighbo> guess they will be in concert here tuesday
<dneighbo> rock they had gilbert high marching band drum corps in their last concert here
<dneighbo> as the nephew of Adam Jones goes to school there :)
<dneighbo> jamest: i can likely get you lots of high quality Tool live concerts
<dneighbo> if you are interested as well
<jcater> wife must've gotten ahold of him
<dneighbo> they are a good live band as they do things on the fly
Action: dneighbo thought it was my lag time
<jamest> maybe
Action: dneighbo was going to cut and mail you the article but its online
<dneighbo> http://www.arizonarepublic.com/ae/articles/1117tool17.html
<dneighbo> just no photo of the band (which is pretty funny)
<dneighbo> they are in a group holding hands like a circle
<dneighbo> but chancellor (on left) has his hand making a hole by cupping index finger and thumb
<dneighbo> and maynard (on right) has index finger outstretched inserting it the 'hole'
<dneighbo> complete the circle
<dneighbo> sexual inneundo implied :)
<jbailey> That's like the little dutch boy with the finger in the dyke? =)
Action: dneighbo wonders about #debian
<dneighbo> a guy asks about getting apm support and someone tells him
<dneighbo> recompile your kernel
<dneighbo> its like WTF thats stock as a module in every debian kernel
<jcater> anyone having any luck (good or ill) with those tarballs?
<dneighbo> finally someone else gave wild syntax to just add the module (already provided by debian)
<dneighbo> i suggested using modconf
<dneighbo> and people screamed that wont work...
Action: dneighbo hasnt had modconf fail yet inserting modules (but im no debian guru)
Action: dneighbo thinks its no wonder most people hate debian they get support from wrong places ;)
<jbailey> What's modconf? =)
Action: dneighbo gratiously thanks nickr, ajmitch, jbailey, jamest, jcater for the stellar debian support they provide here
<jbailey> Do most people hate Debian?
<dneighbo> yes
<dneighbo> in our LUG
<jbailey> My experience is that most people hate installing Debian.
<dneighbo> when i started there only 1 out 60 folks ran debian
<jbailey> I certainly do. =)
<dneighbo> after helping install debian and over a year or so showing them power of debina
<ajmitch> debian users are by far the most vocal in out LUG
<dneighbo> i woudl say about half are running debian
<dneighbo> nearly everyone tried it
<dneighbo> but failed at install and gave up
<dneighbo> i have yet to find someone who had help installing and were shown how to get audio and such working
<dneighbo> that didnt stick with it
<dneighbo> sadly this is one of debians main weak points
<dneighbo> i think a xandros or good debian distro could change that
<dneighbo> or better yet if HP would just sell Debian PC's ;)
<jbailey> The new debian installer is reported to be amazing.
<dneighbo> then the install could be avoided altogether
<jbailey> But there's some chance that sarge won't ship with it.  The other ports aren't diving in quickly enough to get it running.
<ajmitch> jbailey: any chance of the hurd port releasing with sarge+1? ;)
<jbailey> If I were a stats major, I might inform you that the probability was non-zero.
<jbailey> As a gratutious developper, I'd say that we're on a firm 'maybe'.
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> would depend a lot on the criteria for release
<ajmitch> hopefully decent GNUe packages can find their way into sarge :)
<ajmitch> would probably want a stable set by then :)
Action: dneighbo is away: movie
<jbailey> gnue-common will be in sarge in two weeks.

<jcater> dude!
<jcater> where'd chillywilly go?
<chillywilly> who cares?
<jcater> what was that?
<jcater> did someone say something?
<chillywilly> it was nothing
<chillywilly> a fart in the wind
Action: jcater wondered what the smell was
<jcater> and here I thought it was the donut box from 2 weeks ago I haven't trashed
<jbailey> invisible?
<jbailey> That's the state you reach after 4 tequilas, yes?
Action: chillywilly wouldn't know
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I guess that makes me opulent
<jcater> or translucent?
<chillywilly> ppl who drink are we and cannot deal with reality ;)
<chillywilly> weak
<jcater> are you kidding
<jcater> I deal w/reality pretty darn well after a few drinks
<jbailey> I can be weak.
<jbailey> Who the hell wants to be strong all the time? =)
Action: drochaid showered just last month ....
<chillywilly> jbailey: yo mamma does
<jbailey> showers?
<drochaid> not with me!!!
<drochaid> I'd have noticed
<jcater> shower?
<jcater> what's that?
<jbailey> drochaid: I'd hope not.  She's been dead for 2 years. =)
<jcater> is that one of those newfangled things like an outhouse?
<chillywilly> not sure...
Action: drochaid shivers
<chillywilly> I read about them once
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> my bddy has this as part of his sig
<chillywilly> I predict Microsoft will be in dire strates by the winter of 2004 due to
<chillywilly> the loss of enterprise computing clients.  These customers will migrate
<chillywilly> to Open Source alternatives which offer freedom.  I am a part of this
<chillywilly> software revolution.
<drochaid> OI
<jcater> hmmm
<drochaid> don't use Dire Straits name like that :P
<jcater> that's better than my "Please send donuts" sig, I guess
Action: jcater thought about changing to "Your mom uses GNUe... shouldn't you?"
<jbailey> drochaid: Which part of the is a dire straights name?
<drochaid> just change the spelling a little ;)
<chillywilly> it's a band dewd
<chillywilly> old skewl
<drochaid> :)
<jbailey> Money for nothing and your chicks for free..  'veryone knows them.
<jbailey> I used to have the vinal for brothers in arms. =)
<chillywilly> sorry, how am I supposed to know what ppl in canadia listen to? ;)
<drochaid> thought it was all celine dion?
Action: drochaid ducks and runs
<chillywilly> jcater: I see you're still using sylpheed
<jcater> yeah
<chillywilly> didn't make the switch to evilution yet? ;)
<jcater> evolution still's a little more heavy weight than I want
<chillywilly> a *little*?
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> just
<chillywilly> mutt forever
<jcater> >                                                                           <
<jcater> this much
<chillywilly> gotcha
<jbailey> I like evolution
<chillywilly> it's bloated
<jcater> I do think I'm giving it to my callcenter though
<chillywilly> well it's a nice M$ alternative
<chillywilly> I just couldn't stand it anymore :P
<chillywilly> I don't need html email
<chillywilly> or calendaring
<jbailey> I have severla people who send me html mail. =(
<jbailey> Also, I like how easy it is to auto-file into folders.
<jcater> first thing I do w/all my users
<drochaid> jbailey: shun them!!!
<jcater> go thru and change their "html email" setting
<jcater> to off
<chillywilly> jbailey: procmail ;)
<chillywilly> jcater: :)
Action: jcater is serious
<chillywilly> I believe you
<jcater> no html mail leaves my mail servers
<jbailey> jcater: That is too much work for *me*.
<chillywilly> a smile doesn't mean I think you are joking
<jbailey> chillywilly: I haven't found anything that lets me do three clicks to setup procmail filters.
<chillywilly> who uses a mouse?
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> those are for lusers ;)
<jcater> gah
<jcater> something does not compute
<jbailey> ACtually, you're right.
<jcater> jbailey maintains glibc
<jbailey> Most of the time I don't use the mouse.
<jbailey> I use my pen.
<jcater> and works on hurd
<jbailey> =)
<jcater> but doesn't use procmail vilters
<jcater> filters
<jcater> because they're not 3 clicks?
Action: jcater falls out of his chair

<jcater> roflmao
<jcater> I sent out the gnue-announce notice
<jcater> text only, of course
<jcater> got an email response from postmaster@iximd.com
<jcater> The Mail Server at IXIMD.COM has rejected and discarded an e-mail that APPEARS
<jcater> to have originated from:  Jason Cater <jcater@gnue.org>
<jcater> ....
<jcater> Due to the ever increasing proliferation of e-mail borne viruses, attachments
<jcater> of this type are no longer being accepted or delivered by the servers at IXI.
<jcater> .....
<jcater> so, um, text-only messages are virus-prone now
<jcater> ?

<dneighbo> jcater: did you gpg sign the message?
<jcater> no
<jcater> I don't have that set up at home
<dneighbo> if so dumb ass windows often thinks it an attachment and does well 'odd' things to it
<dneighbo> like assume its a virus
<dneighbo> which i find hilarious
<jcater> that is funny
<dneighbo> you sign a mail to ensure someone knows its from you and windows cans it as a virus
<dneighbo> jcater: you do freshmeat releases or you want me to?
<jcater> you can
<jcater> all I did was gnue-* lists
<jcater> psu usually picks that up and does gnuenterprise.org announce
<dneighbo> cool
Action: dneighbo REALLY wishes gnu.org/software/gnue-sb was in place instead of nongnu.org/gnue-sb
<dneighbo> so i could possibly do some more pr
<dneighbo> maybe tomorrow we can resolve
Action: dneighbo is resolved i think to just checkin to the other cvs
<dneighbo> and see if shows up
<jbailey> What's gnue-sb?
<nickr> small business
<ajmitch> hmmmmm
<Isomer> how is gnue-sb going?
<dneighbo> good
<dneighbo> its commit list is limping
<dneighbo> but it got some serious action today :)
<ajmitch> good :)
<ajmitch> hi Isomer, fancy seeing you here
<jbailey> Why don't you just have gnue-sb under gnuenterprise.org ?
<Isomer> ajmitch: amazing that :)
<ajmitch> jbailey: anoncvs access
<ajmitch> and stuff like that :)
<ajmitch> it was more fun to hassle the savannah people, too
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> jbailey: because we dont want people to think we have abandoned appserver and more robust SAP R/3 type implementation
<dneighbo> we needed something QUICK
<dneighbo> that was two tier and ready to ship within a quarter or two
<dneighbo> i.e. read not something perfect with ultimate planning and documentation
<dneighbo> but something worked and could be extended
<dneighbo> plus its fun to annoy the savannah admins
<jcater> hey
<jcater> it got me root!
<jcater> that was worth it
Action: jcater hides
<jbailey> You got root on subversions?
<jbailey> Wow.
Action: jcater smacks jbailey around
<jcater> I'm not exactly an admin newbie
<dneighbo> yeah, why do you think they gave you access
Action: dneighbo runs from savannah team and jcater ;0
<jbailey> Yeah, but considering the policy is "Why the hell do you think you need a shell account"
<jbailey> The idea of them giving someone root access is phenominal!
<jcater> jbailey: I think I know why
<jbailey> I think the rest of the gnu servers are down to a half dozen or a dozen folks with root.
<jcater> I think they were tired of dneighbo pestering them
<ajmitch> ugh

<ajmitch> afaict it's not going for GNU

<ajmitch> they sort of sound like they know what they're doing

<ajmitch> "AccWhizz is based on CK-Ledger code written by Chiu Kay Wu.
<ajmitch> Without His great job and inspiration I would not be able to write AccWhizz.
<ajmitch> CK-Ledger is, in turn, based on SQL-Ledger (by Dieter Simader) functionality.

<dneighbo> jcater: i just moved gnue-sb from nongnu to gnu for website
<dneighbo> i.e. checked out gnu version
<dneighbo> cp files localy on my machine
<dneighbo> commited to gnu gnue-sb
<dneighbo> so likely they should show up
<dneighbo> if they do you can kill old repository
<ajmitch> lol
<ajmitch> i don't think you'd need to do that
Action: ajmitch cringes as jcater rm -rf's the whole web tree ;)
<dneighbo> hey why not others have fun too ;)
<dneighbo> ok freshmeat updated with all releases
<dneighbo> i had to add navigator i guess i never released it at 0.0.1
<dneighbo> ah piss they are approving them already
<dneighbo> shouldnt they be in bed
<dneighbo> grrr
<dneighbo> i had hoped they would post at like 4am my time
<Isomer> er, why? :)
<ajmitch> err, why not? :)
<dneighbo> um biggest audience is US
<dneighbo> 4am my time is 6am EST
<dneighbo> with a little luck they would stick on the front page till about 12 my time
<dneighbo> i.e. most of the US audience would see them during morning or lunch break
<dneighbo> its sad but freshmeat is a HUGE imprint
<dneighbo> on days we run releases at freshmeat our web traffic jumps WAY up
<ajmitch> that's when jamest turns the AC on for the webserver :)
<dneighbo> it never needed AC it was in KS

<btami> good morning
<btami> psu: may i e-mail a new setup.exe to you if i'm ready ?
<psu> btami: please can you do so in half an hour (i.e. after 9 am your time)
<psu> I can then get it uploaded tonight
<btami> ok, i will try
<psu> are we doing both debug-on and debug-off versions again?
<btami> i think debug-on for pre enough
<btami> then 0.4.1 will be -on and -off
<psu> btami: note that the 0.4.1 are officially released now
<btami> oh
<psu> you might like to get the new zips
<psu> and work off those
<btami> ok
<psu> jcater put them out last night 
<psu> while we were sleeping
<psu> "gnue - your 24/7 project"
<psu> I have just (as of 2 minutes ago) updated website news
<btami> so i can send debug-on and debug-off versions
<psu> yes
<btami> is it ok after 10 too ?
<psu> no problem 
<psu> I won't be able to do anything with them this morning anyway
<psu> as I'm off to work in 15 mins
<psu> and on dial-up, they'll take more than 15 mins to download your mail ;-)
<psu> The official announcement says "Windows .exes later this week" so tonight will be fine
<psu> s/will be/will have to be
<btami> do you know another way to upload somewhere, some public place ?
<btami> it will be 2x10 Mb
<psu> actually, if you e-mail jcater/jamest
<psu> rather than me
<psu> a) they should be on a better connection than me
<psu> b) they can probably upload before I am back from work anyway
Action: psu isn;t trying to avoid work, just take himself as a barrier out of the loop
<btami> which is the best, jcater or jamest ?
<psu> jamest seems to wake up first ;-)
<psu> and jcater had a late night getting the releases out 
<psu> so I guess jamest
<psu> cc to me as a back-up
<btami> ok, i will sent to jamest@gnue.org

ColeMarcus (~klebermas@p5080499B.dip.t-dialin.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<DoctorHook> Sorry, that was a question.  I have built custom apps in Access/VBA that I would like to move to a Linux environment.  Would this be a similar tool?
<jcater> DoctorHook: we are not an access replacement, per se
<jcater> but could definitely be a substitute
<jcater> we are comparable to the Forms and Reports parts of access
<jcater> (only with a lot more power, imho)
<jcater> we don't have a database, so you'd use PostgreSQL, for example, as the database backend
<jcater> (or SAP-DB, ....)
<DoctorHook> I see!  What about the programming part?  I'm NOT a programmer... but I can stumble around with VB or VBA to get done what I need...
<DoctorHook> I'm trying to learn...
<jcater> we use Python for any triggers/events... it's a VERY newbie-friendly language
<jcater> it would be a small step from VBA to Python
drochaid (~drochaid@pc2-kirk1-3-cust16.renf.cable.ntl.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<DoctorHook> Beautiful!  I have looked at Python.  It is very frustrating to move from an environment where I'm more than competent to a brand new one.  There is so much to learn and sometimes don't know where to start!  It's overwhelming, but you've been agreat help!  Thanks!

<dneighbo> piss i missed him
<dneighbo> jcater/jamest always someone coming from msaccess
<dneighbo> suggest that pgadmin has a MIGRATION tool
<dneighbo> that will migrate all tables + data for them
<dneighbo> which is a huge part of the work
<dneighbo> if they have not done anything too 'fancy' code wise (standard vb forms)
<dneighbo> designer will putty in their hands especially with wizards
Action: dneighbo has half considered writing a vb forms (and delphi forms) conversion tool
<jcater> ah
<dneighbo> jamest: can we get logging re facilitated on ash
<dneighbo> jcater: the biggest thing we are missing (and so is pgadmin) is a 'query designer'
<dneighbo> i think eventually it would be nice to have that in designer(schema tools)
<dneighbo> if you all add the quick table view stuff (what someone was calling grid view)
<dneighbo> the 'query designer' would be about only thing we are missing to be close to access replacement (imho)
<dneighbo> and unfortunately i have seen a LOT of access ;)
<dneighbo> jcater: it worked : http://www.gnu.org/software/gnue-sb/
<dneighbo> though the dates are dorked :)
<dneighbo> anyone know how to upgrade to gnome 2?
<dneighbo> and if you do can you still use gnome 1.4 apps?
Action: dneighbo was so impressed with kde fonts/smoothness i would like to see gnome2
<grib> dneighbo: you can still use gnome-1.4 apps with gnome-2.  it's pretty nice, esp from a developer perspective -- gtk2 fixes a good number of b0rkennesses in gtk
<grib> not all of course :) 
<grib> but a good number nonetheless
<dneighbo> you know what is necessary for debian?
<dneighbo> i think i have all the libgtk2 stuff as i got it when i got gphoto2
Action: dneighbo is mostly looking for cleaner fonts
<grib> if you're on unstable, you will automagically get the gnome2 stuff iirc with a debian upgrade
<dneighbo> re: kde fonts
<grib> not sure about what to do on stable
Arturas (~arturas@fmgs-03.vtu.lt) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> wife liked kde 'fonts' but nothing else about it :)
<dneighbo> asked to have gnome back
<dneighbo> yeah i just did upgrade on unstable
<dneighbo> we will see what it brings 
Action: drochaid prefers KDE to Gnome
<drochaid> but not enough to actually care which I use
<grib> dneighbo: one of my fave things about gtk2 is that things like GtkLabels now accept attribute markup on their strings.  so you can do something like <span foreground="red" size=20000><b>Hello</b>, World!</span>
<dneighbo> i use fluxbox so its not a 'me' issue
<dneighbo> its a 'wife' issue ;)
<jcater> dneighbo: what's the odds of getting that demo schema soon? (the music database)
<dneighbo> you want today?
Action: dneighbo can probably pump it out today
<jcater> today would work
<jcater> :)
<grib> my wife is a dedicated mac-o-phile unfortunately.  i'm hoping I can drive her towards linux using macosx :)
<dneighbo> ESPECIALLY if the schema wizard works
<dneighbo> in designer
<dneighbo> as i think i already have the tables created
<jamest> dneighbo: i didn't know logging was down on ash
<ra3vat> Arturas: you here?

<Arturas> ra3vat: yes, hi Dmitry
<ra3vat> hello Arturas
<ra3vat> can you look into common/doc/technotes/00002.txt
<ra3vat> i was thinking that encoding param in gnue.conf is only relevant for postgresql
<ra3vat> so it understand specific pgsql names
<ra3vat>  encoding is the client encoding and can be either : SQL_ASCII, EUC_JP, EUC_CN, EUC_KR, EUC_TW, UNICODE, MULE_INTERNAL, LATINX (X=1...9), KOI8, WIN, ALT, SJIS, BIG5, WIN1250. Available encoding depends on your PostgreSQL and libpq version. Refer to PostgreSQL manual for supported encodings for your PostgreSQL.
<Arturas> ra3vat: give me please about 5 mins...
<ra3vat> sure
Action: jcater thinks that belongs in connections.conf if its specific to postgres
<jcater> actually I thought it was already there?
<ra3vat> yes
<ra3vat> "encoding" name is confusing
<ra3vat> jcater: it was done in ancient time when connection.conf was not yet born :)
<Arturas> ra3vat: you mean #hack for db encoding in 00002.txt?
<nickr> wow, justt saw the release on freshmeat
<nickr> neat
dneighbo (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ra3vat> Arturas: yes, and the whole paragraph is not clear, some encoding names are mentioned there that are not relevant and would not work
<ra3vat> i agreed with jcater about moving that db encoding to connections.conf
<Arturas> ok, i agree with it too - (i would like to believe there was some reason why i did put it here, but i don't remember :\) - i'll do it in a few days
<dneighbo> jamest i think logging works
<dneighbo> i just think that 'reporting on logging' is down
johannes (~johannes@M701P023.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<ra3vat> dneighbo: logging?
<jamest> ra3vat: that 's a typo
<ra3vat> ?
<jamest> he means 'reporting on flogging'
<jamest> he's not sure who to beat next based upon what people in IRC promise to attempt to accomplish
<dneighbo> roflmao
<dneighbo> found out they are killing my dish soon :(
<dneighbo> and making it commericial so price will continue to climb over next year or two 
<dneighbo> and that sprint is working on using pcs network to offer broadband instead
<dneighbo> w/ radioshack as the hardware provider
<dneighbo> and it looks like it will be available soon
<dneighbo> so looks like i might have to switch to cox

<dneighbo> ah much better
<dneighbo> i think my modem is all fixed

<ra3vat> dneighbo: what about that modified_by fields? any decitions?
<dneighbo> ra3vat: i havent fully looked into it
<dneighbo> my understanding is that (at least with postgres i could do it directly from db)
<dneighbo> either via oncommit trigger
<dneighbo> or via backend db stsuff
<dneighbo> i BELIEVE i cna get username from gnue as well though from what i gather it will be an 'ugly' call
<dneighbo> so there was talk of 'convience' triggers to support it
StyXman (~mdione@ADSL-200-59-86-17.cordoba.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<StyXman> hi all
<StyXman> jcater: what would be that 'kstructural changes'that you tal about in (one of) your last commit?
<dneighbo> evil doings :)
<dneighbo> StyXman: talking about my butt i would say its seperation of logic and layout
<dneighbo> specifically what i gathered its moving block out from data
<dneighbo> er block ouut
<StyXman> ah?
<dneighbo> we REALLY need to merge our trees (i had hoped you would have merged for 0.4.1 release)
<dneighbo> but if you guys dont hop on it in next day or two it will likely be really BAD
<StyXman> dneighbo: I can send the big patch *now*
<dneighbo> i.e. the guts will change significantly and merging will be near impossible
<dneighbo> well you would need to coordinate with jcater/jamest
<StyXman> yes, I know. it's my job
<StyXman> are they around?
<dneighbo> siesel: my modem seems to be picking up speed 1,375 Kbps
<dneighbo> StyXman: they might be
<StyXman> ghhh

<StyXman> jcater: gimme 5 minutes.
<ra3vat> how is mysql sql is produced from schema when only base, oracle and postgresql exist in processors?
<StyXman> is there any locale support for date time entries?
<derek> ra3vat: it isnt :
<derek> )
<lupo> what is gnue sb?
<ra3vat> derek: how it is done in gnue-sb then?
<ra3vat> small business
<derek> currently gnue-sb only supports postgres
<derek> until the gsd tool is fixed to support the other databases
<ra3vat> good thing
<derek> as soon as the tool renders gsd's for a db that db should be supported by gnue-sb
<lupo> aha
<lupo> nobody told me about that! :)
Action: derek will warn if you are wanting to use gnue-sb w/ mysql you are asking for a world of hurt
<ra3vat> lupo: it was kept for christmas :)
<lupo> ra3vat: :)
<derek> mysql is not a kwality kode database for this type of application
<derek> if your restraint is gpl only database please consider sap-db
<lupo> mysql with more than 1:1 and 1:n relationships is a PITA
<lupo> or with more than 5-10 small tables
<jcater> can someone tell me how to do sequences in mysql?
<jcater> or an equivalent?
<jcater> and the first person who says "auto_incremenet"
<jcater> better be wearing a helment

<jcater> if I can get an answer to my question, I can add mysql support :)
<jcater> jamest: that's gonna be interesting
<derek> mysql uses autoincrement
Action: derek is donning a BIG ole helmet
<nickr> seems like sqlite would replace what a lot of people use mysql for.
Action: jcater thinks sqlite might prove to be really important to gnue-sb
Action: derek shudders

<nickr> seems silly
<nickr> viva sqlite!
<derek> if someone is willing to do local filesystem for a db then gnue-sb is bigger than them (imho)
Action: derek isnt opposed to getting sqllite working, but states strongly that is not the target market for gnue-sb
<jcater> of course not
<jamest> StyXman: you send that yet?
<jcater> but I bet we still see the single business owner strolling in
<jcater> wanting something for his PC
<derek> yes
<nickr> I just think mysql is overused for the wrong things.
<derek> i agree
Action: jcater isn't saying we code for that target
<jcater> but I'm just saying I bet we see it
<nickr> sqlite is simpler to manage than mysql in most circumstances that use mysql. Its so annoying to see a cool thing that uses a databes backing for only one host that uses mysql!
<lupo> nickr: right
<StyXman> jamest: just dpoing thast *now*
<nickr> thats why gnue rules, database neutrality

<jamest> gack!
<jamest> 143K
<derek> lupo: right now this is my big pain
<StyXman> true
<jamest> that's a lot of diff reading :)
<derek> im torn whether to make gnue-sb US only
<derek> or support foreign stuff
<derek> the problem i have with making it 'anywhere'
<StyXman> there are minor code fixes, and several new features
<derek> is you lose a TON of validation rules US business love
<StyXman> (wow, mail is fast)
<derek> and speed features
<derek> like if US only i can make it so you enter a zipcode and it auto populates city and state
<derek> i can validate phone numbers against states 
<derek> i.e. is that a valid area code for a state 
<derek> etc etc
<derek> as soon as i make it i18n
<derek> i end up with very sloppy validation and very general data entry
<StyXman> jamest: I'm leaving. just read the mail, and I'll be crossing fingers :)
Action: derek realizes there is a huge foreign market and doesnt want to discount that
<StyXman> bye all
<lupo> i see
<lupo> this is the dilemma
<derek> so im torn
StyXman (~mdione@ADSL-200-59-86-17.cordoba.sinectis.com.ar) left irc: "yes!"
<derek> if lots of non us people are willing to help
<derek> and use
<lupo> do either one or the other, just do it right
<derek> likely i will make it i18n
<derek> if not then i will likely make US centric as thats my target market
<lupo> i think having a market at all is better than fulfilling thousand problematic and inconsistent wishes
<lupo> if the resources aren't sufficient, we can still fork

<derek> siesel: i have comments on it
<derek> just havent been able to formulate them
<derek> been too busy
<derek> im having trouble deciding implementation
<derek> you are right that splits and such should be easy
<derek> but im not sure they shoudl be implemented as you speak or as triggers
Action: derek envisioned htem as triggers
<derek> and nothing would prevent the integrator UI from doing all the work
<derek> to me the tag set you propose seems confusing (and i do lots of integration)
<derek> i have seen the corresponding 'trigger' way to do things it might be even more confusing
<derek> but as i learned from my xslt ventures
<derek> doing complex things in xml SUCKS
<derek> so a simple split is probably much cleaner in XML as would be a simple mapping
<derek> however when things get complex the spec would probably be a nightmare
<derek> i can certainly run through scenarios i see daily and that i saw daily integrating with every known mortgage lending interface on the planet as well as edi
<derek> for now i have to run
<derek> i will be able to cmment further in about an hour
<siesel> hmmm, I'm not very contend with the whole stuff myself
<siesel> ok, cu then.
<siesel> I would like something more mapping orientated then process orientated :(

<ra3vat> how to set scrollbar over myltirow entry?
<ra3vat> jamest: ?
<jamest> ?
<jamest> our code doesn't support scrollbar's yet
<jamest> papo guys seem to have it as part of their patch
<jamest> if time permits I'll be going into the 0.4.1 banch
<jamest> and then into head
<nickr> theres no way to express in SQL the kind of uniqueness that says 'the combination of these two columns must be unique' is there?
<jamest> you mean only pull those rows?
<nickr> No
<nickr> like a constraint
<nickr> like a primary key which must be unique
<nickr> but instead, this row is uniquified by two columns
<nickr> instead of just one
<jamest> sure
<jcater> isn't it just "unique (field1, field2)"
<jamest> you can create a unique index on 2 fields
<ra3vat> jamest: it seemed to me you did some work on scrollbar already?
<jamest> or setup the primary key constraint at the end of the table def instead of behind one field
<jamest> ra3vat: i added the code it display it but never tied it into the event system
<ra3vat> ok
<nickr> is it that simple, really?
<nickr> qjust adding unique (field1, field2) to the create table?
<jamest> nah, we're lying to you
<jamest> :)
<jamest> which DB?
<jcater> nickr: one note, unique does not enforce nullness like primary key does
<jcater> so if you want "unique and not null" you need to specify not null for those columns
<jcater> at least, irrc
<jcater> iirc
<nickr> sqlite of course
<nickr> it says it supports unique constraints
<nickr> shite, what happened to gless!?
<ra3vat> my more then one year old example with three tables mixed in mastter-detail still does not work :(
<ra3vat> properly that is
<nickr> now, this unique constraint will only be triggered if both the values are the same as another row's two values, right?
<nickr> not just one or the other
<jcater> nickr: right
<jcater> I use those a lot
<jcater> example, we sell magazines
<jcater> so we have a table that holds our offers
<jcater> it contains the magazine id and the number of issues
<jcater> we have unique ()  set up on those 2
<jamest> naughty_flag coolean;
<jamest> grrr
<jamest> boolean
<jcater> so only one combination of (magazine, issues) can exist in that table
Action: jcater thinks that's the functionality you are talking about
<jcater> there can be plenty of 12 issue magazines
<jcater> and plenty of offers for People magazine
<jcater> but only one offer for People at 12 issues
<nickr> y6ea
<nickr> exactly
<nickr> I have a table that defines a specific relationship between two rows in two other tables
<nickr> and only one such relationship between those two particular rows must exist
<nickr> ah works as expected.
<nickr> How do I print an exception that just thew me into an except:
<nickr> ?
<jamest> traceback module IIRC
<jamest> hang on
<nickr> er? thheres no exception object that gets assigned or something?
<jcater> yeah
<jamest> or
<jamest> except:
<jamest>     print "Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0]
<jamest>     raise
<ra3vat>   <datasource database="icsinfo" name="dtsCompany" table="company"/>
<ra3vat>   <datasource database="icsinfo" name="dtsEmployee" table="employee, person"
<ra3vat>       master="dtsCompany" masterlink="id" detaillink="employee.org_id" prequery="">
<ra3vat>     <condition>
<ra3vat>       <and>
<ra3vat>         <eq>
<ra3vat>           <cfield name="employee.pers_id"/>
<ra3vat>           <cfield name="person.id"/>
<ra3vat>         </eq>
<ra3vat>       </and>
<ra3vat>     </condition>
<ra3vat>   </datasource>
<ra3vat> what's wrong with that?
<nickr> ah
<nickr> thantks
<jcater> ra3vat: what exception are you getting?
<jcater> oooooo
<jcater> I don't know how prequery="" behaves with child datasources
<derek> definitely i would not prequery a chiled
<derek> er child
<ra3vat> child is empty
<jcater> ra3vat: for one, get rid of prequery
<jcater> then 
<jcater> run with --debug-level
<jcater> and see what "select" statements are being executed
<jcater> and if they look sane
<ra3vat> am i asking about something terrible or just not yet implemented?
<jcater> it should work
<jcater> but we are giving you suggestions to find out why its not
<ra3vat> ok :), the query looks good
<ra3vat> will run it through psql now
<ra3vat> query is ok
<ra3vat>  SELECT pers_id,person.id,employee.id,employee.org_id,employee.pers_id,person.first,person.last FROM employee, person WHERE (((((employee.org_id = '26'))) AND ((employee.pers_id = person.id))))
<ra3vat> why is it nothing shown?
thomasr (~thomas@public2-seve3-4-cust146.walt.broadband.ntl.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ra3vat> after that query one other is in log:

<derek> is this some new syntax?
<derek> table="employee, person"
<derek> basically im not sure why you are doing this
<jcater> derek: that's an oddity that just works :)
<jcater> it wasn't actually coded to do that
<derek> why not do a view of those tables
<jcater> but it serves as an SQL join
<jcater> (readonly of course)
<derek> i.e. join them as a view
<derek> then use the view
<ra3vat> derek: it is very close to work without view, query is ok. i've pasted it via psql and it worked

<siesel> derek: do you want to discuss the gnue mapping description format now?
<derek> soon
<derek> im still cranking at work
<derek> was doing some 'research' on lost files
dsmith (firewall-u@cherry7.comerica.com) left irc: "later.."
<derek> ok siesel i have some time
<derek> well if you come back i shoudl be here
<jamest> ping
<derek> the thing that struck me was the mapping comment vs process
<derek> i can tell you from my experience RARELY can you just 'map'
<siesel> 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.1 ms
<derek> usually there is some form of conversion process in the middle
<derek> firstname        lastname in one db bcomes
<jamest> siesel: thanks, wasn't sure my dsl was up
<derek> name in the other
<derek> or
<derek> fund   org
<derek> in one table bcomes
<derek> acctingstring in another
<derek> etc etc etc
<derek> i dont have access to my email with what you sent
<derek> so i cant speak directly to those items
Action: derek i guess is most curious how you are going to do integrator, rpc, jsforms and phpforms all at once
<siesel> I don't want to do it at once, but I just need integrator for some stuff NOW.
<derek> ah
<siesel> the next step would be appserver and then I can continue on jsforms/phpforms
<siesel> but back to integrator: with the "mapping<->process" comment I just meant that a "user" would like to define mappings
<siesel> instead of a process
Action: derek is worried that appserver is seen as prequisite for jsforms/phpforms
<derek> siesel: again i state im torn between implmentation and UI
<derek> hopefully a user never sees the 'definition' file
<derek> they see a UI to build mappings
<derek> and those mappings need to be powerful
<derek> i should be able to say
<derek> src1.fielda -> src2.fielda
<derek> src1.fieldb -> src2.fieldb
<derek> src1.fieldc -> src2.fieldc
<derek> as well as
<derek> src1.fielda -> src2.fielda
<derek> src1.fieldb + src1.fieldc -> src2.fieldb
<derek> as well as example only here jsut to convey point ignore syntax
<siesel> I would like to write all these definitions in XML, instead of in a trigger. 
<derek> left(src1.fieldb,3) + '-' + mid(src1.fieldb,4,5) + ' : ' + lower(src1.fieldc) -> src2.fieldb
<derek> you are sadistic
<derek> you lose SO much power by moving that into xml
<derek> we wrote jadeke  basically gnue forms in php that was all xml
<derek> and it was murder
<derek> xslt was my example
<derek> to do easy transformations xml/xslt seems like such a good idea
<siesel> we can do it by trigger too, but then designer has to parse the python commands 
<derek> but start doing complex stuff and you are spending all your time fighting xmll
<derek> siesel: i think the answer is a combination of the two
<derek> some things will make well as xml elements to map
<derek> otehrs will not
<siesel> the last example of yours, f.e. shouldn't be possible with xml
<derek> i dont think i could provide a list of what would and what wouldnt right away
<derek> the first and second examples i gave probably could be all xml
<derek> but the third one would make for some ugly xml
<derek> and lot of complex tags/attributes
<derek> my point in essensce is that i do this stuff almost daily and rarely do i get something like 1 or 2
<siesel> what about that action syntax I've proposed:
<derek> i generally am dealing with #3
<derek> i dont have access to the email to review it
<jcater> http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue-dev/2002-November/000322.html
<siesel> <action name="field" splitmask="@1:@2"><field type="src" name="foobar"><field type="dest" name="foo"><field type="dest" name="bar"></action>
Action: jcater thinks an xml mapping approach quickly degenerates into a lot of clutter outside of 1:1 or other *very* combines
<jcater> err, *very* simple
<jcater> which, I already said that in my email
<derek> that is my fear
<derek> and what i guess i was trying to relay in that sample 1 and sample 2 (both simple) it would likely be ok
<jcater> i.e., we end up with docbook :)
<derek> but sample 3 would be an utter hell of tags and attributes
mdean (~mdean@mkc-65-28-72-76.kc.rr.com) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<jcater> something so complex no one understands even how to do simple stuff
<jcater> s/complex/overwhelming
Action: siesel sees the biggest problem in making trigger a MUST, that we have to parse python scripts to edit mappings with designer
<derek> for me i would need to see the trigger side to tell you which i would prefer
<siesel> <process>
<siesel>    <trigger type="ON-NEWROW">
<siesel>        if in.test[0]=="$":
<siesel>           out.out=in.test[1:]
<siesel>        else:
<siesel>           out.out=in.test
<siesel>    </trigger>
<siesel> </process>
<siesel> could be an example how to do remove a leading "$" with a trigger
<derek> i would be ok with some of this in xml if the designer is writing it all out
<derek> my only demand is i can go to triggers and get dirty if i have to
<siesel> IMHO integerator should support that mergemask, splitmask stuff and nothing more.
<siesel> nothing more in XML.
thomasr (~thomas@public2-seve3-4-cust146.walt.broadband.ntl.com) left irc: "Leaving"
<jcater> this is different than your email, no?
<jcater> I don't recall the mask thing in the email
<siesel> In the second mail: http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue-dev/2002-November/000331.html
<siesel> at the end, I speak of masks to do spliting merging etc. 
<jcater> ok, I missed that part
<siesel> I've changed the syntax a bit, but haven't posted yet.
<jcater> I wasn't giving the second email my full attention as I was at work
<siesel> Now, I would remove all <copy> <split> <merge> etc, and just have an
<jcater> I think I like the idea of a merge/split mask, and anything more complex would be handled by a trigger
<siesel> <action splitmask="" mergermask="">
<jcater> should we make the splitmask capable of handling regular expressions?
<jcater> that could be powerful, but might not be intuitive for regular users
<jcater> (not sure)
<siesel> you mean something like: <process>
<siesel>       <action name="sdsd" splitmask="$@1">
<siesel>          <trigger type="ON-MASKNOTFIT" raise="directcopy">
<siesel>          <field name="test" type="in" datasource="in">
<siesel>          <field name="out" type="out" datasource="out">
<siesel>       </action>
<siesel>    </process>
<siesel>    <action name="directcopy">
<siesel>        <field name="test" type="in" datasource="in">
<siesel>        <field name="out" type="out" datasource="out">           
<siesel>    </action>
<siesel> Possibly putting actions in the trigger name space is a bit too much 
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> I'm not sure I like the <trigger type="ON-MASKNOTFIT" raise="directcopy"> syntax
<jcater> but the overall idea
<jcater> I think may be ok
<jcater> bbias....
Action: siesel couldn't remember how trigger definitions looked in forms ;)
<jcater> well, triggers contain or point to python code
<jcater> not to another xml structure
<jcater> perhaps
<jcater>  <action name="sdsd" splitmask="$@1" on-fail="directcopy">
<jcater> ?
<jcater> or something like that?
<siesel> yes, that sound much better.
<derek> if i go away its cause i tried to use nautilus again
<siesel> ok, another point is how to handle "rowmappings"
<siesel> I mean, in normal case rows are mapped 1:1
<siesel> but I have a table with the fields "id, field, value" with three different possible entrys in "field"
<ajmitch> hi all
<siesel> like  (45,"name","Jan") (45,"zip","...") (45,"sdsd","...") that all should become one row in a table with the fields (id, name, zip, sdsd)
<ra3vat> could anyone provide a pdf for common/doc/Developers-Guide.sxw?
<siesel> hi Ajmitch
<jcater> ra3vat: have you looked at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/docs/common/ ?

<jbailey> No - Maybe tommorow or the day after.
<jbailey> Hmm..  Actually might take longer, since I'll be switching the arch: from any to all.
<jbailey> That'll need a change to the overrides file - so it'll be whenever the ftpmasters get around to it.
<jamest> jbailey: i hope to have a 0.4.2 out later in the week or early next
<derek> yeah no pressure or anything
<jamest> to address some issues and include some of the Papo stuff
<jbailey> Cool.
<jbailey> That will solve the versioning problem nicely, then.
<jamest> yeah
<jamest> figured you'd like that
<jbailey> Are the versions in CVS now going to be lexically sane?
<derek> hey i ahvent done much shell scripting someone willing to provide quick syntax for something that basically goes from directory ran in and executes a program in every subdirectory
<derek> i.e. if you were in /foo/
<derek> it would scan /foo/ for directories and then execute a program on that directory
<jbailey> find . -type d -exec (cd '{}' && FOO) \;
<jbailey> should do the trick.
<jbailey> FAiling that:
<derek> is FOO the program?
<jbailey> for x in `find . -type d`
<jbailey> do
<jbailey>   cd $x && FOO
<jbailey> done
<jbailey> Yup!
<jbailey> You need the cd VAR && FOO so that when it exits, you're left in the original directory
<jcater> ooo, and after 0.4.2, I think I'll have 0.5.0 sometime this decade
<jbailey> I had to show someone how to use ed for scripting today.
<jbailey> It was quite scary when I realised I knew how. =)
<derek> jbailey: what if i dont need to go into the directory
<derek> i assume find . -type d -exec myprogram 
<derek> wouuld work

<derek> er
<derek> for x in `find . -type d`
<derek> do
<derek>   myprog -d $x
<derek> done
<derek> that should work nicely i think
<jamest> we're shooting for this decade?
<jbailey> Yup.  The find case is faster, though.
<jbailey> so
<jbailey> find . -type d -exec myprog -d '{}' \;
<derek> ok
<derek> silly question since that was so painless
<derek> any way to make that recursive easily?
<derek> so that it will spider down a tree structure
<jbailey> What does that mean?
<derek> if i had .
<derek>  ./foo/
<derek>  ./foo/bar
<derek>  ./foo/bar/bar

<ra3vat> hello btami
<ra3vat> btami: what if you set encoding="ascii" in site.py and formFontEncoding=<your encoding> does forms work?
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-30.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<btami> hi ra3vat
<btami> why touch site.py ?
<btami> if you don't use sitecustomize.py
<btami> defaultencoding is "ascii"
<ra3vat> where you put your hu encoding now? in sitecustomize?
<btami> yes
<btami> but it does'n works with McMillan for me
<btami> yet :)
<ra3vat> what if you disallow sitecustomize for test i.e switch default encoding to ascii?
<btami> i get errors
<btami> in designer
<ra3vat> and forms?
<btami> in dumpXML
<btami> forms are ok
<ra3vat> hm
<btami> but reports not
<btami> until fontEncoding not introduced in [common]
<btami> section of gnue.conf
<ra3vat> translating now works for me from ru_RU dir but forms failed if i switch default encoding to ascii and hope on formFontEncoding only
<btami> sax error ?
<ra3vat> yes
<btami> :)
Nick change: reinhard -> rm-away
<btami> if formFontEncoding the same as in gfd header
<btami> s/if/is
<btami> ?
<ra3vat> because i translated button text for login screen
<ra3vat> oh it is not sax then
<ra3vat> but unicode
<ra3vat> let me try
<btami> ra3vat: do you know a public place to upload win32 setup exe's?
<btami> i failed to send them in e-mail
<btami> 2x13 Mb
<ra3vat> psu said hi got them
<btami> oh, ok
<btami> have to go now (about 1hour)

<jamest> what is atomic* stuff for?
<jamest> what do you use genericBox for?
<StyXman> genericBox is for asking questions with more options than 'yrs' and 'no'
<jamest> oooo, a biggie!
<jamest> in your code you replaced, for example,  self._form with self.getForm() then def getForm(self): return self._form
<StyXman> atomic* is to make sure only one person can modify a what-would-be-called database register at a time
<jamest> function calls in python are a hideous performance hit
<StyXman> jamest: uh, we didn't knew that
<jamest> we switched from a getFoo() to self._foo with the _ meaning private
<jamest> yeah, we didn't either at the start
<StyXman> ok, we'll live with that. we don't like it from an oo pov, but who cares :)
<jamest> so the atomic is like saying select for update?
<jamest> it locks the backend record?
<StyXman> jamest: yes
<jamest> hmmmmm
<jamest> could the same result be accomplished by adding an atomic="" to the datasource tag
<StyXman> the question is to let the driver implementing guy to select what would be right to acomplish that
Action: jamest hasn't dug thru all the details of the aptch yet :)
<jamest> so I don't know how you're using it 
<jamest> if you're calling it in triggers, or if you added a tag to the datasource 
<StyXman> the association with the entry is just to make sure only that entry must be atromic. the others may not be midified atomically
<StyXman> as in uptading a stock table.
<StyXman> jamest: it's a big one. take all the time you may need
<StyXman> it's 6 month of coding

<StyXman> aprono: jamest asked it 'you're calling it in triggers, or if you added a tag to the datasource'
<aprono> the first one
<StyXman> jamest: from triggers
<StyXman> can I paste?
<jamest> please
<StyXman>              lRecordCount = ownItemToUpdBlock.getRecordCount()
<StyXman>              for recNum in range(lRecordCount):
<StyXman>                 ownItemToUpdBlock.jumpRecord(recNum)
<StyXman>                 ownItemToUpdBlock.levelEntry.atomicModify(lambda x:x-round(float(str(ownItemToUpdBlock.qtyEntry)),4))
<StyXman> (it's an small excerpt; the trigger is bigger)
<StyXman> aprono: can you explain what are we doing here? you made the code..
<jamest> yes please
Action: StyXman has been too much tmie away from form writing
<StyXman> these lines are just before those ones:
<StyXman>              ownItemToUpdBlock.initQuery()
<StyXman>              ownItemToUpdBlock.ownDocumentEntry = lOwnDocId
<StyXman>              ownItemToUpdBlock.processQuery()
<jamest> on scrollbars you have them working with gridlayouts now?
<StyXman> the middle one is copying a foreign key, I guess
<jamest> is  ownItemToUpdBlock visible to the users?
<aprono> jamest:  no
<jamest> or all hidden fields
<StyXman> jamest: scrollbars associate to its surrounding block.
<StyXman> the 'register' to them
<jamest> StyXman: ok, good
<jamest> aprono: no to what?
<StyXman> so, when the data source is updated, and the block is notified, the scrollbar gets updated too.
<StyXman> what I can't make work is 'free scrolling'. wx is very ugly reporting these ind of events
<StyXman> jamest: they're hidden entries
<aprono> jamest: The parameter of the atomicModify method is a function that must be aplied to de field asociated to the entry
<aprono> s/de/the
<jamest> aprono: is the datasource itself only used for this one task?
<aprono> jamest: yes
<jamest> the reason I ask this is that we want datasources to support record locking which this appears to be
ariel_ (~ariel@ppp-217-133-242-13.dialup.tiscali.it) left irc: "Uscita dal client"
<jamest> if we were to add a atomic or locking="" attribute to a datasource that locked records after they were modified
<StyXman> ah, sounds greit
<jamest> would that serve the same purpose?
<aprono> jamest: yes
<jamest> and I think it may require less work on the trigger writters part :)
<jamest> also, you exposed some gnue internals via some of those trigger functions
<jamest> i was wondering why?
<StyXman> aprono: you just said that may be that would block more than onw might want, or I get it wrong?
<StyXman> jamest: like?
<jamest> ummmm
<StyXman> as I said in the mail ,some may be hacks to get things work in the wrong way
<aprono> StyXman: si pero tendrias que tener la precausion para qeu no pase eso
<jamest> getCurrentRecord
<StyXman> aprono says that 'yes, but you should be cautious so that does not happens' answering my question
<StyXman> aprono: we still use that?
<jamest> I have no idea
<aprono> StyXman: yes
<jamest> i know we did hacks like this at one time
<StyXman> allot
<jamest> but started to try to move away from them as internals can change and will alot :)
<jamest> so if we can figure out what is making you have to drop to internal levels we can adust the code
<StyXman> jamest: which would be the right way to do it?
<jamest> every time I've done this the workaround makes the triggers easier to maintain :)
<StyXman> ...
<StyXman>     if clientBlock.getCurrentRecord().isInserted():
<StyXman>       creditLimit1Block.newRecord()
<StyXman>       creditLimit1Block.movementTypeEntry = 1
<StyXman>       creditLimit1Block.creditLimitEntry = "0.0"
<StyXman> ...
<jamest> StyXman: that depends on what you need to accomplish
<jamest> are these forms in your cvs?
<StyXman> is just an example
<StyXman> yes, just grab them.
<jamest> cool
<jamest> that will help alot
<StyXman> guanderful
<StyXman> (I will frame this log)
<jamest> lol
<StyXman> when are the logs writen?
<jamest> i want to get a fair bit of this in for 0.4.2 but not all of it
<jamest> as I'm pressed for time
<jamest> and have other bugzzz to address ;)
<StyXman> jamest: just for the records, is there anywhere any docs on how to properly report bugs with dcl?
<jamest> not that I know about
<jamest> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/community/bugs.php
<jamest> looks like it's pure email interface
<StyXman> jamest: zanx
<StyXman> ah, yes, that

<jamest> that autocreates the tickets

fixe (~adam@dsl093-081-253.chi2.dsl.speakeasy.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> StyXman: not seeing the patch but gathering some from it
<revDeke> i think your history tables need to be implemented as tables and triggers and not embedded in forms (read hardcoded)
<revDeke> i had same need for gnue-sb
<StyXman> sb?
<StyXman> revDeke: and making it with triggers is just a PITA
<revDeke> was going to do all in triggers though there has been talk of making some 'convience functions' for such things so triggers would be nice and clean
<revDeke> sb = small business http://www.gnu.org/software/gnue-sb/
<revDeke> StyXman: you should be able to make it a shared trigger and just reuse it
<StyXman> revDeke: so, why don't put it in gnue?
<jcater> um
<StyXman> ah, yes, I remember now
<jcater> PITA or not
<jcater> we can't have harcoded schemas in common
<revDeke> because not everyone wants it
<revDeke> and HARDCODING it is not a solution
<StyXman> we done it that way because appserver (what would like to use) was not available when we started coding things
<revDeke> its not the idea that is disagreed with
<revDeke> even with appserver it woudl be separate
<StyXman> s/available/stable enough/
<StyXman> jcater: I agree, and amy be we can live with an external patch 'till we recode, I gues...
<StyXman> let me talk to aprono...
<StyXman> aprono: any comments? perlhead?
<StyXman> revDeke: you were meaning gnue triggers, right?
<StyXman> or db ones?
<revDeke> StyXman: after this merge there will need to be some ground rules
<revDeke> i will discuss with perlhead
<revDeke> the biggest ones being that you guys really need to not run own cvs copy it makes reconcillation a pain
<StyXman> ok, perlhead will comment qith us then.
<revDeke> and the other one is that all patches come in an as 'functional' patches or they are denied
<revDeke> i.e. if you have a multitable patch only code for that is part of the patch
<revDeke> not 5 fixes all in one patch
<StyXman> revDeke: remember that the patch was sent 'as is', as I had no time to filter out what I thought it won't get anyways.
<revDeke> as it makes it take 20 times as long to reconcile and get applied
<StyXman> and that those where just suggestions.
<revDeke> StyXman: yes... im saying 'in the future'
<StyXman> revDeke: NP
<revDeke> we are willing to do what it takes to merge the repositories
<revDeke> best we can
<revDeke> but we dont want 'resyncing' to be a regular thing... we want one repository and patches :)
<StyXman> revDeke: we too. I mean, I don't like the work of sync'ing. and I don't wish that to anyone :)
<grib> revDeke: have you guys thought about working with twisted?  seems like there could be a lot of redundancy between gnue and wtisted.

<StyXman> Chipaca: !
<Chipaca> hi all
<revDeke> grib: yes
<revDeke> in short i think we existed long before twisted so one should ask why isnt twisted working with us :)
Nick change: reinhard -> rm-away
<revDeke> specifically they iirc are much more web oriented
<revDeke> likely the appserver team would be the best to address 'twisted' stuff
<grib> revDeke: seems like there's mission overlap but not enough to point a finger and say somebody's wasting time.  they don't handle any of the forms/reports/etc, just the wiring and app-service. 
<revDeke> right
<revDeke> i think they are more similar to our appserver than gnue as a whole
<revDeke> i think jan or jcater mentioned offering an appserver provider for them or something
<grib> anyway their stuff looks pretty interesting.  it is sort of kitchen-sinky and the code/doc ration is a little high but I think there's useful stuff.
<StyXman> revDeke: I just can't catch up with all your nicks, man
<StyXman> how many nicks d'you have?
<revDeke> 3 mostly
<revDeke> derek, dneighbo, revDeke
<revDeke> unless im clowning on someone
<nickr> I love emacs.
Action: revDeke notes that is cause i have 3 machines that im logged into regularly
<revDeke> nickr: rms would like you to know that emacs loves you too
<nickr> I just discovered highlight-changes-mode
<nickr> beautious
<revDeke> my initial big problem with emacs was so hard to remember all the cool key combos :)
<revDeke> then i learned how to 'customize' emacs so that i could make my own easy to remember combos/functions
<nickr> you can bind them to anything you want
<nickr> yea
<nickr> the real power is like, write-hook and such
<revDeke> which now relates to my biggest problem is i cant use .emacs w/o my own .emacs file :)
<nickr> like highlight-changes pissed me off at first because it didn't clear the changes when I saved
<revDeke> i.e. i sit down with a stock emacs (The first thing i apt-get on any machine) and am like gack, its broked :)
<nickr> of course the solution there is clear
<revDeke> you can ask jcater about that.... he about died laughing at LWE when on a fresh debian box i installed emacs to edit a simple config file
<StyXman> I'm having problems with GFBlock.getFocusOrder
<StyXman> jamest: did you checked out papo?
<nickr> I know all the defaultn bindings for basic editing. I'm not really into customizing the bindings because I forget the ones I add
<nickr> of course I need global-font-lock-mode
<nickr> :)
<nickr> you know what'd be nice for python editing?
<nickr> if the current 'scope' were not only highlighted, but BIGGER than the rest of the file
<nickr> like the font face for the current scope added a line at the beginning of each line in the scope and increased the size of each line in the scope
<nickr> at least a line along the edge of the scope, up to line line that starts i

<Chipaca> jamest: (don't know if you're here -- I'll assume either you fill in when you return or you read the logs)

<revDeke> all the stuff was in spanish even
<revDeke> iirc
dsmith (firewall-u@cherry7.comerica.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> revDeke: err
<Chipaca> revDeke: perhaps there was a misunderstanding
<Chipaca> revDeke: the stuff is in spanish because we are an argentine team, but the plan has always be to translate it as needed
<Chipaca> revDeke: let me fish out that old email to gnue-dev
<Chipaca> gah, it's too long to paste
<Chipaca> revDeke: the PAPO team's medium-term objective is to replace an Argentine-specific ERP. There is, as far as we know, nothing in the design of PAPO that's Argentina-specific
<Chipaca> revDeke: the screens are in spanish because that is _our_ target audience, but we have i18n on the "after november" map
<Chipaca> revDeke: the ERD is in english, as are most of the comments. The mailinglist is spanish+english, but translations can be provided on demand either way
<Chipaca> revDeke: does GNUe support i18n of forms?
<psu> Chipaca: yes, with some flakiness. btami & ra3vat are our experts
<psu> (on i18n)
<Chipaca> psu: good. We'll be pestering them "after november" :)
<psu> (for all I know, they could be our experts on flakiness as well)
<revDeke> Chipaca: somewhat
<psu> ;-)
<revDeke> Chipaca: when i looked at papo it wasnt what i was after
<revDeke> specifically you appeared to be making what we want final GNUe to be
<revDeke> and i couldnt understand why you started papo :)
<revDeke> with gnue-sb we plan to be much simpler than what official end game gnue would be 
<revDeke> specifically there is no intention to use appserver with it
<revDeke> if you think we can work together great
<Chipaca> revDeke: because GNUe was (and is) a *long* way away of what we need, while the infrastructure is (mostly) there
<revDeke> Chipaca: im not going to argue that
<revDeke> its the reason gnue-sb exists :)
<revDeke> to take advantage of what is there
<Chipaca> revDeke: I beleive what you call small businesses in the US are what are small-to-medium here
<revDeke> and to be turned over rapidly
<jcater> Chipaca: but that begs the age old question "How is it faster/better to roll out your own" ?
<Chipaca> jcater: explain, please?
<jcater> I'm not criticising
<jcater> it's just a question
<jcater> how is it faster/better to do your own version of gnue than working within gnue?
<Chipaca> jcater: when we looked at gnue it didn't seem to be going to be an application, but rather a framework
<jcater> sure, gnue wasn't very far along... but it was further along than starting from scratch
<jcater> hmmm
<Chipaca> we liked the framework, but the apps (or whatever they're called) that were there seemed more like examples than anything else
<Chipaca> also, papo is pointed more towards small-to-medium organizations, while gnue (as it name implies) is aimed at fully fledged enterprise-level stuff, that is, IOHO, over papo's head
<Chipaca> which is why gnue-sb called our attention... it seems to be more or less what papo is getting to be
<jcater> lol
<jcater> seems like an odd circle
<jcater> we wonder why papo is doing what gnue was gonna do
<Chipaca> jeez
<jcater> then you wonder why gnue-sb is going to do what papo was gonna do
<Chipaca> yeap
<Chipaca> ok, let's get this straight:
<Chipaca> gnue was, at the time of papo's inception, no more than a (very alpha) framework
<Chipaca> [ ] True  [ ] False  [ ] Blue
<jcater> GNue Tools are a framework
<jcater> GNUe Packages are not
<psu> s/(very alpha)/ 
<jcater> Gnue Packages were in discussion/plans
<Chipaca> jcater: but nowhere near usuable or even useful, as they still used geas which was AWOL
<Chipaca> IIRC
<jcater> as opposed to......
<jcater> starting from scratch
<Chipaca> psu: we're speaking january
<jcater> btw, I'm not complaining/criticizing
<jcater> just geniunely curious
<jcater> as this seems to be a circular argument
<Chipaca> yes...
<Chipaca> but we really didn't feel like we were starting from scratch inspite of gnue packages
<Chipaca> we felt that we were starting from gnue, and that it was a shame the packages weren't there
<grib> jcater: you seem to say "starting from scratch" like it's a bad thing.  starting from scratch is often better than trying to get another project going the direction you need.
<psu> I suppose what we're all saying is 
<jcater> grib: that's true
<jcater> but in this context
<jamest> gnue has direction?
<jcater> we were just asked why we aren't using their stuff
<Chipaca> jamest: in a brownian sort of way
<jcater> it's kind of a circular argument
<jcater> or, ironic as the case may be
<jamest> Chipaca: perfect description!
<jcater> there's nothing wrong with starting from scratch
<jcater> I was just bringing recent context into the pictyre
<jcater> picture even
<psu> IMHO some of the "full and frank discussions" on the Tools to me indicate
<psu> that papo has compatible but different way of approaching things
<psu> so trying to get papo to write our GNUe packages for us 
<psu> (which is basically what this amounts to)
<psu> might have created too much pressure
<psu> gnue pushing one way, papo another
<psu> Chipaca: obviously today, papo uses 2-tier
<psu> do you see it long term doing 2-tier
<psu> or using appserver?
<psu> or will you decide when you see what appserver does ;-)?
<Chipaca> psu: long term appserver is by far the cleaner approach, but there is nothing wrong with 2-tier if the needed functionality is hidden away in dbsig, for example
<Chipaca> appserver, objserver, or whatever
<Chipaca> :-
<Chipaca> )
<psu> ok 
<Chipaca> stupid return key
<psu> so in that case, the "conflict" such as there is 
<Chipaca> for example
<psu> is between papo and full GNUe packages?
<Chipaca> currently today we have these weird transactional tables
<Chipaca> which dbsig sort-of knows about
<psu> but (a) our packages don't exist yet as we are waiting for appserver and 
<Chipaca> for a real, clean way to do it, either dbsig should know a bit more, or appserver should be there
<Chipaca> neither is better, although cleanliness is on the appserver side
<psu> (b) both sides knew this from the start - i remember conversations to this effect
<psu> probably in KC somewhere ;-)
<Chipaca> psu: s/sides/fronts/
<psu> Chipaca: agree
<Chipaca> :)
<Chipaca> psu: if that's a question, yes.
<Chipaca> there are some rough edges between what papo aims to do and what gnue seems to aim to do, mostly related to who the intended users are, but those are all confined to the UI AFAIR
<Chipaca> So.... what're we saying here?
<jcater> jcater is a r0x0r hunk?
<jcater> oh, wait... that's just me saying that
<jcater> Chipaca: I don't think anything was being said
<jcater> just inter-project discussions :)
<Chipaca> jcater: I would second that if my brain would stop wiggling at the thought
<Chipaca> (about the r0x0r thing)
<jcater> lol
Action: Chipaca still wonders about the perceived differences between gnue-sb and papo, and the possiblity of working together
<jamest> i'd like to see that
<Chipaca> jamest: me wondering?
<Chipaca> jamest: or jcater doing his r0x0r thing?
<jamest> dude, I've seen jcater in person, I'm not even going to touch that whole r0x0r hunk thing
<jamest> :)
<Chipaca> jamest: ssh, don't tell him, but dneighbo handed out pics of y'all a while back
<jcater> d00ds
<jcater> all women find my bear gut to be r0x0r
<jamest> i'd like to see how much papo and gnue can do together
<jcater> bear=beer
Action: Chipaca wonders what a grizzly beer is like
<Chipaca> jamest: <aol>me too!</aol>
<jamest> they really dig it when you fit a full bakers dozen of KK into your mouth at the same time dont' they
<jcater> jamest: oh, yeah
<Chipaca> KK>
<Chipaca> ?
<nickr> krispy kreme
<jcater> Chipaca: donuts
<Chipaca> youch
Action: Chipaca tries to imagine 13 doughnuts in 1 mouth, and fails
<revDeke> jamest: that was my comment
<revDeke> papo seemed to be argentina specific on the surface
<revDeke> and much more geared to 'manufacturing'
<Chipaca> revDeke: LOL no
<revDeke> my needs are more on wherehouse management than assembly line and english
<revDeke> and thus so is gnue-sb
<revDeke> i have no problem working together
<Chipaca> revDeke: our ERD tries to contamplate SB product mangling, but that's about it
<revDeke> and said even today... we should see
<revDeke> Chipaca: some of it will fall into grib's category of different approach so different hard to find common ground
<Chipaca> revDeke: how advanced is gnue-sb?
<revDeke> i hate ERD stuff
<revDeke> i find it over simplified yet grossly complex at the same time
<revDeke> in a perfect world it is good, as is UML
<Chipaca> revDeke: I'll be setting up a friendly web thingie to browse our ERD, as it is rather huge
<revDeke> but to often its more cumbersome than the value it brings
<revDeke> currently we have gsd stuff that is basically convertable into web documentation
Action: Chipaca can't wait for derek to learn the beauty of Zot
<revDeke> well gnue-sb i hope to be so rapid that i wont have time to learn anything new
<Chipaca> yah, I've got to get the docs of gsd and make a zot2gsd
<revDeke> which was the point of not doing offical gnue packages
<revDeke> but rather gnue-sb
Action: revDeke doesnt have time to debate argue and make things feature complete for the world
<revDeke> but rather something that is usable and shippable
<revDeke> and easily extensible
<revDeke> so while i have no problems working papo or other projects, very much gnue-sb is a nonsense 'get it done' application
<Chipaca> hmm
<revDeke> and likely wont spend long toying with trying to incorporate a ton of varying opinions
<revDeke> that is what GNUe official packages will tackle :)
<revDeke> again because it uses the gnue framework it will be VERY easibly customisable
<revDeke> oh crap im turning into psu....
<revDeke> s/customisable/customizable
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I did it earlier too
Action: jcater slaps himself
<Chipaca> the way you put it, it sounds like papo is more aiming at what you call a gnue package than gnue-sb
Nick change: psu -> mrs_psu
<mrs_psu> and what's wrong with that?
Nick change: mrs_psu -> psu
Nick change: rm-away -> reinhard
<ajmitch> hi
<revDeke> Chipaca: it could be...
<revDeke> im not sure
Action: ajmitch wonders why these silly people spell with 'z' instead of 's'
<jcater> sigh
<revDeke> ajmitch: to torture our children of course
<jcater> next you guys are gonna say "color" is misspelled
<psu> zilly? nope, doesn't look rite to me
<revDeke> have you read man pages for xvncviewer before
Action: Chipaca goes 
Action: Chipaca returns
<revDeke> it has --bgcolour or something as an option
<revDeke> and in it notes: "Americans please pay close attention and learn how to spell"
<revDeke> or something to that effect
<Chipaca> revDeke: VNC is developed in the UK, so that's sensible
<revDeke> yeah i was commenting it was funny
<ajmitch> center is misspelt as well :)
<Chipaca> lol
<revDeke> customise thy centre colour
<Chipaca> ok, so what
<Chipaca> gah
<Chipaca> stupid
<Chipaca> revDeke: customise thee thy centre colour
<Chipaca> ok, so what would it take to make papo a gnue package?
<Chipaca> other than ... um... not patching gnue (=:]
<ajmitch> donuts
<ajmitch> lots of donuts
<Chipaca> ajmitch: customise thee thy centre colour doughnuts
<ajmitch> (i'm spelling it the american way so they can understand me)
<revDeke> well to be 'official' gnue packages it will have to do formal review process
<revDeke> if it is to be GNUe Financials etc
<revDeke> i.e. it has to be a proposal before tis an app
Action: Chipaca wonders if donuts are nuts of Cs
<revDeke> and get general consensus and feedback
<revDeke> which is SLOW (but good)
<revDeke> and why we started gnue-sb
<revDeke> no long feedback loop (which is bad) but much quicker deliverables (good)
<revDeke> tis a trade off
<revDeke> if you want papo to be a gnue app that isnt official but is blessed or something
<revDeke> we havent fully discussed how to do this
<revDeke> we have toyed with the discussion
<revDeke> but not fully discussed
<psu> papo is sorta between the gnue and gnue-sb approach
<psu> i.e full functionality, but as "dictatorial" as gnue-sb
<Chipaca> sorta
<Chipaca> the database is.
reinhard (~reinhard@M693P020.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: "When all else fails, read the instructions"
<Chipaca> the screens are examples, the database is much more than the screens can convey, because the screens should "just work" for really small organizations, while medium (or, eve, large) can usually pay for a week of work to tweak the screens for their extra foo
<Chipaca> small, medium and large here are in Argentine terms, BTW
<jcater> just remember, enterprise doesn't have to equal multi-billion dollar companies ...
<psu> btami's setup.exes now on the website - linked from front page and 
<psu> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/news/news117.php
<psu> I manage to get a quick dig in re.free/ non-free s/w too ;-)
<jcater> wow
<jcater> 10Mb?
<jcater> was it 10Mb last release?
<psu> I think it was about that, yes
Action: psu suspect that the extra drivers (sapdb, firebird, etc) 
<psu> are the main causes of the bloat
<jcater> wow
<jcater> we were at < 5Mb
<psu> in particular, I can't imagine the sap-db drivers being small
<psu> How big are the full Oracle SQL*Net drivers these days?
<jcater> who knows
Action: jcater hasn't paid attention
<psu> ISTR that in Oracle 7/8 days, they could be up to 15MB if you installed the kitchen sink

<Chipaca> how is less than 10% a major performance hit? (call vs. dereference in python 2.1)
<Chipaca> or, how is less than 10% reason enough to through the whole OO thing out the window?
Action: psu is away: downstairs
<jcater> Chipaca: ???
btami (~btami@3e70d721.dialin.enternet.hu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<btami> hi all
<Chipaca> jcater: a quick benchmark showed that a direct dereferencing vs. a subroutine call costs less then 10% less
<btami> psu: thanks for all
<Chipaca> jcater: and performance was the only reason given for using self._form instead of self.getForm
<btami> psu: just one correction
<btami> setup exe contains reports too
<psu> ack
<psu> I'd forgotten that - we were going to include it when we got to 0.1.0
<psu> which it's now at ;-)
<btami> and just wx is about 6Mb in the bin
<btami> :)
<btami> db drivers aren't too big
<ajmitch> http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/53/28168.html
<jamest> that 10% isn't much on occasional calls but our UI system had lots of such things going on
<jcater> Chipaca: 2 things
<jcater> 1. it does make a difference
<jcater> we profiled our code for one release
<jcater> and spent a lot of time w/that data
<jcater> 2. that is our coding style
<jamest> it made a huge difference in performance of gnue
<jcater> patches shouldn't change a coding style
<psu> btami: now fixed
<jcater> btw, self._form is as much OO as self.getForm()
reinhard (~reinhard@M693P020.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<jcater> just maybe not by the java definition
Action: psu longs for the day when I can get site into CVS and say to people 
<Chipaca> I have no problem wiht self.form, in fact, I kind of like it. It's the /^_/ that bothers us, as that is always an indication of 
<Chipaca> "this is private"
<Chipaca> and in fact you agree
<psu> "you have CVS commit access - you can fix it"
Action: psu corrects himself
<Chipaca> but then you expect people to call that, so it's no longer private
Action: Chipaca hands psu wiki
<psu> we have a web CVS already, just if we actaully used it we'd
<jcater> Chipaca: no, not exactly
<jcater> in our model
reinhard (~reinhard@M693P020.adsl.highway.telekom.at) joined #gnuenterprise.
<psu> break the www.gnu.org website
<jcater> (and this is for a reason)
<psu> which is a bad thing
<reinhard> oops
<jcater> and thing without a '_'
<jcater> prefix
<reinhard> just for the record
<jcater> is considered to be a settable attribute
<jcater> ala XML files
<jamest> i explained badly this morning
<psu> Chipaca: wiki is good, but we still need an "official" website
<reinhard> gdm does _not_ just reread its configuration file if it gets a sighup
<reinhard> :)
<psu> Chipaca: see my many comments on wiki in KC
Action: Chipaca hands psu a wiki with auth
<jamest> our dumpXML keys on that _ to know to ingore it when translating an object to xml
<psu> Chipaca: see my many comments on wiki with auth in KC
<psu> ;-)
<Chipaca> psu: :) not right now
<psu> plus, wiki with auth implies users needing passwords resetting
<ajmitch> psu: how would you break www.gnu.org?
<psu> with a CVS website, I can dump that problem onto my nearest friendly savannah admin
<Chipaca> gnue-public.log.14Mar2002:<jamest_> anything with a _ is considered private 
<psu> ajmitch: I suspect a mod_php-less apache would get very unhappy with .php filetypes
<jamest> dude i just mentioned that i explained badly this morning
<Chipaca> jamest: that was in March
<ajmitch> psu: it would just serve them up, uninterpreted :)
<jamest> at least i'm consistently full of shit :)
<psu> ajmitch: yep, but to me pages full of uninterpreted code are broken
<ajmitch> hehe
<psu> of course, this is a common exp for lynx users
<Chipaca> jamest: so what we get is that stuff /^_/ is private, but we need to access it, so (naturally) we go and write some way of getting at it without breaking the (alleged) abstraction
<psu> <script> tags, anyone?
<jcater> Chipaca: you took that conversation out of context
<jcater> look at it again
<jcater> <dneighbo> jamest_ you get my commit mail

<jcater> <jamest_> i haven't chacked that account since yesterday
<jcater> <jamest_> let me look real quick
<jcater> <jamest_> ok
<jcater> <jamest_> what is your question?
<jcater> <dneighbo> well a few
<jcater> <dneighbo> in connectData[]
<jcater> <dneighbo> two items are prefixed with a _

<jcater> that's referring to the connections.conf file
<jcater> and it being loaded into our system
<Chipaca> jcater: ah
<Chipaca> jcater: sorry, I grep -C'd, but not with enough C, I guess
<Chipaca> jcater, jamest: anyhow, everybody here agrees that if it wasn't from you it was from the python docs, that /^_/ means 'private'.
<jcater> Chipaca: ok
<jcater> but we are explaining our design decision
<Chipaca> if that is not the case, that's fine, but seeing as we seem to have overlooked it in reading the coding style docs for gnue, ...
<Chipaca> jcater: no, you were giving us flak for writing accessor for what, in our book, was a private attribute
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> not exactly
<jcater> but now we understand each other, eh?
KeithJagrs (jorgre@63.74.24.9) joined #gnuenterprise.
Action: Chipaca ponders
<jamest> not flak
<jamest> just explaining why I didn't want to put it in 
<jamest> i figured I owed you a reason
<jamest> we have chillywilly if we need to give anyone flak
<jamest> or derek
<Chipaca> heh, like we have StyXman
<ajmitch> but styxman does work, doesn't he? :)
<jamest> lol
<Chipaca> he'd jolly well better
<Chipaca> ok, so, now.
<Chipaca> stuff that starts with _ is *never*, inside gnue, private
<Chipaca> *never* *ever* *ever*
<Chipaca> even if right after that _ there is another _
<Chipaca> ?
Action: jcater doesn't recall saying that
<Chipaca> jcater: which part?
<jcater> <Chipaca> ok, so, now.
<jcater> <Chipaca> stuff that starts with _ is *never*, inside gnue, private
<jcater> <Chipaca> *never* *ever* *ever*
<jcater> <Chipaca> even if right after that _ there is another _
<jcater> <Chipaca> ?
<jcater> that part
<revDeke> maybe im nuts but this boils down to 
<revDeke> i like
<jamest> i don't think we have a hardfast rule on private
<Chipaca> btw, seeing as nobody guffawed at the bit on gnue coding style, do those docs exist?
<revDeke> control statement
<revDeke>   {
<revDeke>   code
<revDeke>   }
<revDeke> jamest likes 
<revDeke> control statement {
<revDeke>   code }
<revDeke> and jcater likes
<revDeke> control statement {
<revDeke>   code
<revDeke>   }
<jcater> revDeke: no, this goes beyond this
<revDeke> well it has performance ramification and other things
<jcater> it goes to we want _var
<jamest> we all _know_ that doing foo in function bar should never ever have been done and we're a bad coder for doing it
<jcater> they want either var or getVar
<revDeke> but im saying its bad form to 
<Chipaca> revDeke: it's not coding style as in indent, it's coding style in the abstract (for now. heh, heh, heh)
<revDeke> take code that is done consistently and arbitarily break that
<jamest> but i think we make mental note (this needs cleaned up/rethought/etc)
<revDeke> w/o contacting the author to discuss
<revDeke> as it could be the author didnt understand the other way to do it
<Chipaca> revDeke: we'll get to indent later, ok?
<revDeke> and so this would be helpful to know so taht ALL code could be changed
<revDeke> or it coudl be they did it purposefully so there is reason to not do it that way
<revDeke> i think perhaps this was the argument jcater and jamest were getting at
<Chipaca> revDeke: *sigh*
<revDeke> i.e. its not necessarily the functionality that is being rejected its the implementation that is being rejected
Action: drochaid returns with PIZZA
<jamest> dude, there's some cool stuff in that patch
Action: drochaid feels the glare from revDeke
<Chipaca> revDeke: I wasn't aware we'd changed coding style wrt indentation, and if we have done that, in a file where coding style wrt indentation is clear and one single way, I apologize
Action: drochaid runs
Action: ajmitch chases down drochaid
<drochaid> :)
<Chipaca> jamest: may I hang that up on the wall here?
<jamest> huh?
<jamest> my commnet?
<jamest> if you like
<Chipaca> jamest: :)
<jamest> I'm happy to see a working scrollbar setup
<jamest> you're menubar patches inspired jcater to add trigger to flip them off and on (I think)
<Chipaca> revDeke: FYI, I have seen (and edited) a file where three different functions used three different indentation calls (and I don't mean one per function), so there
<jcater> indentation calls?
<Chipaca> revDeke: :)
<Chipaca> agh
Action: Chipaca shouldn't multitask at this speed
<jamest> the whole atomic* stuff has me seriously looking at replacing the TODO lock record here crap in datasources
<jcater> we are actually *very* standardized on indentation... any variancies are oddities that someone likely committed
<Chipaca> jamest: did you read my comment wrt atomic as an attribute
<jcater> we do two space indents, with no tabs
<Chipaca> ?
<Chipaca> jcater: are you certain? as in I'll write this up on the list of stuff to make sure before sending stuff in to gnue and it'll be ok?
<jcater> Chipaca: ?
<jcater> I don't think we want patches that do nothing but fix indentation levels
<jcater> but that is what we try to code at
<jamest> Chipaca: i don't think we're complaining about the patches
<jamest> being out of spec
<jcater> right, we are talking any future things
<jamest> i think we're just pointing out why we did something one way and why we didn't apply something
<Chipaca> jcater: I didn't mean that, I meant we usually just let emacs indent, but if we're to fix indentation before we send it to you, are you absolutely certain that that is the coding style you use, globally, and if so, we'll make it be so
<jamest> we owe you an explenation if getForm() doesn't make it in
<jamest> Chipaca: i use emacs to indent
<Chipaca> jamest: I thank you that you feel you owe us an explaination
<jcater> does emacs do 2 by default?
<jamest> jcater: you've never complained about my commits so I assume yes ;)
<jcater> jamest: well, I standardized my indents based on your code
<jcater> :)
<jcater> as that's how the vast majority of GNUe was done when I got here
Action: jcater wasn't gonna rock the boat wrt indentation :)
<jcater> even though I get that boat a rockin in other places
<Chipaca> *sigh*
<jamest> lol
<Chipaca> We really, really need some way to tell when it's ok to go in and use the stuff and when we must write an accessor for it
<Chipaca> really, really, really

<jamest> i think it's pretty simple
<Chipaca> really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really
<jcater> if there's not an accessor now, then we didn't intend for it to have one
<jcater> really!
<jamest> if you can just grab it self._form then you grab it
<Chipaca> jcater: now as in 0.4, or now as in ever?
<jamest> if it requires any type of logic at all to get what you require then you need an accessor
<Chipaca> jamest: oh is _that_ why you play with get/setattr so much!?
<Chipaca> jamest: logic as in ... ?

<jcater> yeah

<jcater> but fire away
<Chipaca> jamest: aren't there many places where stuff appears via getattr calls?
<Chipaca> maybe it was __getattr__, or something
<revDeke> better to play with get/set than yourself :)
<ariel__> ok why descrption is not child of step and process in getxmlelements of navigator?
<revDeke> Chipaca: is perlhead around?

<jcater> what is description?
Action: jcater doesn't remember that tag
<jcater> hang on, lemme look at something
<ariel__> when i fire a report from navigator i get : no option filters in section: common
<jcater> navigator now starts reports?
<jcater> that's new
<ariel__> description is cdata that is displayed on the right side of the navigator when step/process is selected
<jcater> ariel__: navigator needs patching to support reports
<jcater> I'll add that to my todo
<ariel__> look at foobulation sample under navigator
<jcater> ariel__: re the description thing, that's just an oversight
<jcater> we'll commit a fix to that
<jcater> ariel__: it looks like someone tried to patch navigator to support reports
<jcater> but didn't finish it
<jcater> I'll try to look at soon
<jcater> ok, description thing fixed

<Chipaca> jcater, jamest: here aprono wonders if for example _form is overridable in python; I can't really answer him, but I suspect you probably can :)
<ariel__> jcater: what's about format format for numeric fields?
<jcater> ariel__: in reports? or in forms? or both?
<jcater> reports, very soon
<jcater> forms, soon
Action: jcater is away: phone
<ariel__> it is not in common?
<jcater> ariel__: yes
<jcater> but reports needs and forms needs are slightly different
<jcater> reports just needs to pass it a valid value
<jcater> and get a valid display back
<jcater> forms needs real-time formatting
<jcater> for partial values
<jcater> if that makes sense
<jcater> so reports will see its thing sooner than forms will
<ariel__> ok thank.
<ariel__> i'm wondering if it is possible to add the preferite browser ( may also be the minibrowser of navigator) to the destination available for report

<ariel__> i have already discussed this with jan ( siesel) 
<ariel__> schema.xsw under common/utils/xml2sql
<jcater> ah, ok
<ariel__> is not only a problem of doc
<jcater> honestly I've been so focused on getting the schema part of that right'
<jcater> I haven't even looked at the <row> stuff yet
<ariel__> the fact is that xsl's produces a command like: insert into table foo values( bla, bla, bla)
<ariel__> instead of: insert into table foo(field1, .., fieldn) values( bla, bla, bla)
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> that is bad
<ariel__> so the field attribute in row is ignored

<jcater> I use the RTF mailmerge here at work almost daily
<jcater> but I don't use the script
<jcater> I use the new builtin filter adapter
<ariel__> jcater see irc 21th oct, also KC 52 point 20

<jcater> gah
<jcater> could be
<jcater> let me look....
<jcater> ooo
<jcater> that's the script, yes?
<ra3vat> what is a good example to start with filters?
<ra3vat> yes, i was trying script
<jcater> ra3vat: what are you trying to accomplish?
<ra3vat> i did my first report from monthly.grd example
<ra3vat> with merge i was thinking of filling template doc with data
<jcater> ok
Action: psu is back (gone 01:20:29)
<jcater> I committed a possible fix to the mailmerge.py
<jcater> I don't have anything to test with here
Chipaca (~john@ADSL-200-59-86-17.cordoba.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> but I think it works
<jcater> ra3vat: if you want to play with merge
<jcater> create an RTF document in the layout you want
<jcater> wherever you want a field in that doc
<jcater> do ::field::
<jcater> where field is a field name
<jcater> then run ./create-report.pl in that directory against that rtf file
<jcater> and it should create a basic report for you
<jcater> but you'll need to modify the <datasource>s in that report of course
<ra3vat> thanks
<jcater> I plan to make this into a wizard at some point
<jcater> but that'll get you started I think
banjaaraa (banjara@chandratech.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<banjaaraa> hi
<psu> hi banjaaraa
<banjaaraa> hi psu
<psu> a fellow demonite ;-)
<banjaaraa> just came across yesterday on the GNUe and was interested
<Chipaca> banjaaraa: escape while you can! they will eat your children!
<jcater> Chipaca: no, we eat _children
Action: jcater hides
<Chipaca> jcater: rats! I'm still confusing those
<banjaaraa> so long time for it to come to version 1.0
<psu> banjaaraa: we have a rule here
<banjaaraa> how to get involved in the project?
<psu> ooh, ooh
<banjaaraa> everywhere rules!
Action: psu put up a web page about that
<psu> just the other day
<psu> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/community/involve.php
<banjaaraa> well i read that
<psu> oh
<banjaaraa> thats where the channel was mentioned
Action: psu shuts up then
<banjaaraa> so i am here
<banjaaraa> got this IRC client also
<Chipaca> jcater, jamest: other than the "we foolishly created accessors for attributes that should be accessed directly" and the historic/transactional stuff, is there anything else?
<jcater> <entry style="textlookup">
<jcater> what is that??
Action: psu remembers when Demon (my ISP) had an open-access telnet IRC client
ariel__ (~ariel@ppp-217-133-245-92.dialup.tiscali.it) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
Action: jcater thinks that's identical to our <entry style="label">
<jamest> we think it's a re....
<jamest> yeah what jcater said
<psu> guess that lasted about 10 minutes when the spambots found it...
<Chipaca> more or less
<banjaaraa> psu: my ISP is also demon
<Chipaca> textlookup _is_ a label, except that it goes and fetches the labelee in a dictionary table
<Chipaca> rather like a cross between label and dropdown
<jamest> ah
<Chipaca> the name might be less than perfect...
<Chipaca> but we couldn't find anything better
<Chipaca> :)
<jcater> ?
<Chipaca> "textlookup"
<jcater> I'm lost
<jcater> what does it do?
<psu> Chipaca: so in effect, variable labels
<Chipaca> jcater: thing a read-only dropdown-like thing
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> jamest explained to me
<psu> is the dictionary in the GFD or the d/b?
<jcater> that could be useful
<Chipaca> jcater: good, I'm glad :)
<Chipaca> jamest: could you paste the explanation?
Action: Chipaca wants to learn to communicate better
Action: psu wonders if jcater will discover that papo have written 0.5.0 already 
<psu> and we can release next week ;-)
<ajmitch> well
<jcater> Chipaca: he said: db contains ks - it prints kansas
<ajmitch> that would be nice :)
<jcater> he knows how to speak my language :)
<Chipaca> point taken
<banjaaraa> is SAP experience of any use to u guys?
<jcater> err, I didn't mean english
Action: Chipaca takes too long to get down to examples
<jcater> I meant language == my particular flavor of tech speak 
<Chipaca> jcater: I know, I understood you the first time
<ajmitch> lol
<psu> banjaaraa: absolutely. We need to be slightly careful about intellectual property issues
<jamest> <jamest> db contains ks - it prints kansas
<jamest> <jamest> in a style=label
<banjaaraa> of course
<psu> but otherwise one way of looking at the GNUe packages is as a free SAP equiv.
<Chipaca> jcater: also, english is my first language, so I probably would've thought of the other interpretation later, instead of the other way round if that weren't the case
<psu> Of course, when it comes to d/b, SAP-DB is free anyway
<psu> and GPL
<banjaaraa> well SAP defines the ERP product as of now
KeithJagrs (jorgre@63.74.24.9) left irc: "later"
<jamest> jcater best understands a language of python, sed, english mixed together
<jcater> yes
<jamest> toss in the word donut once in a while to keep his interest
<jcater> but in that order
<jcater> python first, sed second, english as a last resort
<Chipaca> ok, textlookups out of the way. What next?
<psu> we aim to support as many d/b as possible but
<psu> if we had to pick a favourite, SAP-DB would probably be it 
<psu> as it is not just free software
<psu> but exactly the same license (GPL) as us
<revDeke> banjaaraa: yes sap experience is helpful to this project
<banjaaraa> another thing....why was python chosen as the language of choice?
<revDeke> yes we agree SAP is he ERP definer at this moment i time
<jamest> Chipaca: is it safe to say the menubar patches are no longer needed?
<revDeke> banjaaraa: why not? ;)
<ajmitch> who saw the url i posted earlier?
<revDeke> the choices were 
<revDeke> C, Java, Python
<revDeke> C is great for speed
<ajmitch> http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/53/28168.html
<ajmitch> MS' business plan ;)
<revDeke> horrible for maintainability, quick development and a ton of other things
<Chipaca> jamest: I understand that you (plural) have added a functional equivalent?
<revDeke> Python does everything java claims only it does it better :)
<jamest> Chipaca: yes
<ajmitch> revDeke: i personally dislike python for a few things :)
<jamest> Chipaca: on that textlookup how about
<revDeke> read: python is only 'free' xplatform lanugage that lives up to the hype
<Chipaca> jamest: you are correct
<banjaaraa> ok....have never seen python before....but hopefully shouldnt be any different
<revDeke> ajmitch: well python isnt perfect
<jamest> <entry style="indexedLabel"
<jamest> using the same keys as the dropdown support
<revDeke> banjaaraa: if you have never touched python and have coded in ANY other language before you will be productive in python within 7 days :)
<jamest> as 95% of the code already exists in there
<revDeke> i can almost guarantee it
<psu> banjaaraa: we also needed something that was simple enuf for biz people
<psu> for when they need to write triggers etc
<psu> look at me
<Chipaca> jamest: hold on, aprono is pondering that
<banjaaraa> well as of now ABAP is most experience i have in :)
<psu> I know more SQL than I let on
<revDeke> to me C is not for business applications
<revDeke> we could have written the tools in it (at one time appserver was in C)
<jamest> it'd use the same attributes as the style="dropdown"
<psu> but the last lang I learned formally was ZX Basic some 15 years ago
<revDeke> the idea of making our 'own' trigger language seemed really bad
<jamest> so to switch from a dropdown to a readOnly view would be 
<jamest> style="dropdown" -> style="indexedLabel"
<psu> and I can still do just-beyond-"HelloWorld" stuff in python
<revDeke> the only other real choices were java and python
<jamest> and it's match our readonly style="label" we have today
<revDeke> java didnt work on linux and wasnt free when we started so python it was :)
<revDeke> and we are glad to date we chose it
<banjaaraa> java didnt work on linux....meaning the project has been on for a long time?
<nickr> java still isn't usefully free is it?
<Chipaca> jamest: the code is different
<ajmitch> python is even understandable :)
<psu> nickr: let's not start that one again ;-)
<nickr> well
<Chipaca> jamest: because you don't want a textlookup (or indexedLabel) to fetch all the dictionary, you just want one value
<nickr> I *know* there are free ims but
<nickr> imps
<psu> banjaaraa: we have a history.php on website, dating back to 1996 ;-)
<nickr> they are incomplete
<Chipaca> jamest: the first implementation of textlookup was just what you describe, but then aprono fixed it to only fetch what was needed
<revDeke> banjaaraa: two things
<banjaaraa> 1996 cool! thats when i first touched SAP
<revDeke> 1. java still doesnt work on linux worth a crap
<psu> banjaaraa: in current form, probably been going since 2000
<Chipaca> jamest: and it is a style="textlookup"
<revDeke> 2. we started before java worked at all on linux :)
<revDeke> to date there is still no 'free' java past 1.3
<revDeke> iird
<revDeke> er iirc
<nickr> revDeke: Well, not to defend java or anything, but its mostly swing that doesn't work too well
<revDeke> all most all enterprise features are in java2
<revDeke> nickr: you are correct
<banjaaraa> well as long as u guys r happy with what u have chosen
<revDeke> java core was ok, but to do anything graphical was utter hell
<jcater> but without swing, why bother with a proprietary language?
<nickr> of course swing is the basis of all GUI
<revDeke> and to a large extent still does
<Chipaca> jamest: you there?
<banjaaraa> when u say java is not free...what do u mean? doesnt SUN allow free use of JRE?
<Chipaca> banjaaraa: gratis, not libre
<banjaaraa> k
<banjaaraa> have to get my mind send in tune with the FSF
<banjaaraa> mind set
<revDeke> same way MP3 is not free
<revDeke> you might be able to get GPL encoders
<revDeke> but all it takes is one group to remove all your rights
<revDeke> as if Java or MP3 group decide to enforce patent
<revDeke> bye bye
<banjaaraa> bye
<revDeke> doesnt matter if the code is 'free'
<revDeke> as copyright law and patent law are different
<revDeke> the code might afford you to do as you like
<revDeke> but patent law prevents you from running it
<revDeke> a perfect example of this is DeCSS
ariel_ (~ariel@ppp-217-133-243-218.dialup.tiscali.it) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> there are plenty of dvd player software but its 'illegal' to use it :)

<revDeke> but specifically there are no java2 'free' implementations that i know of
siesel (jan@xdsl-213-168-110-169.netcologne.de) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<revDeke> even if you discounted sun's ownership and patents
<banjaaraa> but isnt JAVA regulated by a world body now?
<revDeke> blackdown i think is 1.3
Action: Chipaca patiently waits for the topic he cares about to come round again
<revDeke> Chipaca: you were asleep at the wheel it came and went ;)
<revDeke> what does regulation have to do with it?
<revDeke> its about control
<jamest> real work...just a sec
<revDeke> i think sun still owns java patents, trademarks and 'verification' rights
<revDeke> i.e. you can be java2 compliant w/o paying huge sums of money
<banjaaraa> ok
<Chipaca> jamest: no problem :)  [ this is real work for me :D ]
<revDeke> or so goes the woe of jboss and enhydra last i heard
<revDeke> they cant officially be java2 apps
<nickr> its fascinating to note that you can run python on JVM.
<revDeke> because to do so would require rigiourous java2 certs that cost 50,000 or more
<psu> revDeke: similar issues (with AT&T) is why GNU is not UNIX?
<banjaaraa> but how important is it for GNUe to have a platform independence?
<psu> banjaaraa: fundamental goal
<jcater> banjaaraa: we run in more environments than a java app can
<jcater> just an fyi
<jcater> well, a java swing app
<psu> and by platform indep we don;t just mean Win32, MacOS, GNU/Linux
<Chipaca> psu: according to a vote in the POSIX board, Linux is their favourite POSIX implementation. You can't get more UNIXy than that :)
<psu> but 
<jcater> (to me, the two are the same)
<psu> PDAs, phone voice mail, 
<banjaaraa> ok...in the true sense
<psu> and even semaphore if someone can work out TCP/IP for that ;-)
<Chipaca> psu: semaphore?
<psu> ok, maybe not semaphore
<psu> your arms would get tired if you retrieved a 1000-record resultset
<Chipaca> psu: oh, _that_ kind of semaphore
<revDeke> psu: dont forget im in the wild west, cowboys and indians and all
<psu> smoke signals?
<revDeke> i have the 'smoke signal' module almost ready for prime time
<revDeke> again the several thousand row fetches prove to be a real 'bear'
<revDeke> you can only wave the darned rug so fast before you put out the fire
<psu> revDeke: gzip it?
<revDeke> hmmm i will have to contact the smoke compression guys
<revDeke> good idea
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise ("bedtime").
<jamest> Chipaca: so you do a new query to the db each time the index changes?
<Chipaca> jamest: correct
<jamest> vs our prequery
<jamest> on the datasource
<Chipaca> jamest: yes
<banjaaraa> what do you recommend to get started on the project?
<jamest> banjaaraa: beer and asprin
<banjaaraa> thats encouraging
<jamest> ohwait, that's to work on the code
<jcater> and none of that english pale ale
<banjaaraa> dont go for ales
<jamest> Chipaca: ok, a few questions, it's a cool idea btw
Action: Chipaca still remembers lake district bitter
<Chipaca> jamest: shoot
<jamest> how large are the dictionaries this thing is pulling from ?
<Chipaca> jamest: btw, we changed it work like that because in general we were using it for things that changed less often than number of things we could show
<Chipaca> jamest: ok, I think I answered your question. Did I?
<jamest> I don't follow that question
<jamest> er
<jamest> answer
<Chipaca> I'll answer, then (that was just a comment that happend to contain the answer)
<Chipaca> I don't know exactly how large they were, but for example, think the price of a product would be placed in a textlookup
<jamest> ok, i get it
<jamest> here are a few random thoughts on my end
<Chipaca> because we have a lot of (imaginary) products, and each client has its price list, so to bring in the data you'd have to do #products x #clients of data
<Chipaca> <end of answer> :)
<jamest> if we did this via a normal datasource with prequery="" and the result set it huge we kill memory (a shortcomming on our end)
<Chipaca> yes
<Chipaca> we have some thoughts on that, too
<Chipaca> :)
<jamest> if we're scrolling thru a partlist and it's having to pull the values each time from the backend the UI would get choppy (a shortcomming of the way you've set it up, i think)
<Chipaca> yes, you wouldn't use them for that
<jamest> now, our datasources already have a very stupid cache system built in
<Chipaca> yes
<jamest> could we take the following approach
<jamest> well, a few different approached
<jamest> s
<Chipaca> ah, that's better :)
<jamest> 1) this could easily be accomplished as a post-change trigger via the simpleQuery function (i think)
<Chipaca> "this" being "a label that updates itself"?
<jamest> 2) could we merge the concepts and use the datasources for now and concentrate on improving the cache system in datasources
<ra3vat>   File "mailmerge.py", line 98, in merge
<ra3vat>     parser.parseFile(data)
<ra3vat> AttributeError: ExpatParser instance has no attribute 'parseFile'
<jamest> yes
<jamest> well, you'd have to attach a hidden field w/ the value 
<jamest> then a post change trigger to an unbound entry style="label"
<Chipaca> jamest: correct
<banjaaraa> ****non relevant to the topic ---- are python and PHP in the same league?****
<jamest> banjaaraa: no
<jamest> IMHO they solve different problem sets
<Chipaca> jamest: but it's much easier/cleaner (in the client) the other way
<Chipaca> banjaaraa: PHP is the ASP of unix
<jamest> Chipaca: i agree with that
<jcater> I honestly think for *this* particular case, #1 makes the most sense
<jcater> although I do want to see cache system improvements
<ajmitch> bah, how do you comment out a whole block in emacs? ie, adding # to each line? :)
<jamest> mark it
<jamest> then ctrl-c #
<jcater> another alternative I've thought about is to add a fk_refresh="..." to entries that have fk_*
<jcater> with the default being fk_refresh="startup"
<jcater> (meaning the fk stuff is gathered at form startup)
<ajmitch> cool, thanks
<jcater> but having an fk_refresh="ondemand" (or something similarly named)
<jcater> that would give the same functionality as y;all describe
<jamest> ajmitch: to unmark ctrl-u ctrl-c #
<Chipaca> the silence means we're discussing this :)
<ajmitch> jamest: that doesn't seem to work in 'fundamental' mode (
<jamest> nope
<jamest> you have to be in python mode
<jcater> it's possible we could also emulate the resetForeignKey() calls that derek is having to do
<ajmitch> ah well
<jcater> with a fk_refresh="oncommit" 
<jcater> (or something similarly named)
<jamest> sorry, my brain thinks emacs == python editor
<ajmitch> that's mostly what i use it for :)
Action: ajmitch is just configuring nagios
<jcater> ra3vat: fix committed
<jcater> (I think)
<Chipaca> ok, let us assume for a moment that this way (setting fk_refresh in the datasource) works. How would you do what now is textlookup?
<banjaaraa> later----bye
<Chipaca> (the "let us assume" is because we're still talking it over)
<jamest> it'd be a style=label with the same attribs as a dropdown?
banjaaraa (banjara@chandratech.demon.co.uk) left irc: 
<jamest> yes/no/maybe/go to hell?
<jamest> i accept any of those answers
<Chipaca> wouldn't that amount to overloading of label?
<jamest> hmmmmm
<jamest> maybe :)
<Chipaca> is overloading bad? (here the consensus is: not necessarily)
<Chipaca> so, we do style=label overloaded with the presence or absence of the fk_stuff
<jamest> right now it's possible to do a entry style="default" and include the dropdown attributes
<Chipaca> now, back to the datasource: the veredict is IN
<Chipaca> jamest: and what does that do?
<jamest> 2 things
<Chipaca> jamest: good!
<jamest>   it can validate the user input on strings (big deal right :)
<Chipaca> pretty good ...
<Chipaca> (the "good!" thing was that I thought you'd say "breaks", which is just 1 thing)
<jamest>   it allows a uidriver that doesn't know how to deal w/ style=dropdown to still display a normal entry and then my first reason comes into play
<jamest> take the old, forgotten curses driver
<Chipaca> ah, ok
<jamest> it didn't do dropdowns but it did handle entries
<Chipaca> ok, gotcha
<jamest> our sample form had a dropdown where I could select Kansas in the dropdown
<jamest> the text client let me type ks
<jamest> as it failed to a workable state
<Chipaca> jamest: but now you could type kansas and it's ay ah, ks
<Chipaca> s/it's ay/it'd say/
<jamest> please don't think we have issues with the code you sent
<jamest> it's cool
<Chipaca> no, I get that
<jamest> we're just hashing out the details 
<jamest> jcater and I do this in private a bit
<jamest> <jamest> I have a l33t idea
<jamest> <jcater> sure you're not just being stupid again
<jamest> <jamest> um, hang on......nope not stupid
<Chipaca> ok, so entry is overloaded with style and the presence or absence of fk_stuff, instead of another style
<Chipaca> heh
<Chipaca> sounds like brainstorming to me
<jcater> I'm thinking this applies regardless of whether style="label" or not
<jamest> fwiw: we can use a different style
<Chipaca> HOWever, if we do that, do we still retain the old behaviour on fetch-on-demand, or does that have to wait for the fk_refresh thing, and if so, we think that's a way off
<jamest> style="textlookup" or "indexBehaviour" or "foo"
<jamest> can you paste a sample <entry style="textlookup"....> for us?
<Chipaca> because another reason for not fetching everything is that these things might change between the first fetch and the time one wants to display them, so in effect you have to fetch it every time anyway
<Chipaca> sure
<aprono>  <entry x="19" y="3" field="own_document.recipient" name="priceTypeEntry" readonly=""
<aprono>           width="20" style="textlookup" foreign_key="clientDataSource._entity_data._table"
<aprono>           foreign_key_description="_price_type_data.name" />
<Chipaca> (please ignore the multiple tableosity of this -- or not :)
<jamest> oooo, this is based upon the old dropdown format eh?
<Chipaca> jamest: probably, I guess it's changed, we haven't yet caught up if you recall
<jamest> we're trying to fix that :)
<Chipaca> <g>
<Chipaca> jamest: unless you refer to the a.b.c stuff, no, that's because of multiple tables :)
<jamest> nah, it was the foreign_key* attribs
<jamest> but I guess that field does look a little funny
<Chipaca> jamest: ah
<jamest> ok
<Chipaca> did you understand what I mentioned about having to fetch it all every time anyway?
<jamest> i assume that the clientDataSource is the name of your datasource
<Chipaca> jamest: ding!
<Chipaca> jamest: meaning, yes.
<Chipaca> jamest: also all those things strating with _ are due to the current half-magic historic/transactional tables
Action: Chipaca still wonders if you understood what he mentioned about having to fetch it all every time anyway
<jamest> is this datasource only used to lookup values by the textlookup
Action: jamest understands that you want the field to update if the backend data changes
<Chipaca> jamest: correct :)
<Chipaca> on the second count
<Chipaca> on the first count, correct, too.
<jamest> dude in shiiping drops 1/2 your supply of Brut aftershave

jbailey (~jbailey@atlas.fundserv.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> my vote is we add an fk_refresh attribute
<jcater> with a style of label
<Chipaca> ok, so on to the fk_refresh thing
<jcater> ?
<Chipaca> the problem with that is ... 
banjaaraa (banjara@chandratech.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> not problems, but things to be taken into account
<Chipaca> if we do it on demand there has to be a triggering field. So far the datasource doesn't know about fields.
<jcater> ?
<Chipaca> once that is done, the rest should be fine :)
<ajmitch> jeff!!
<jcater> hmmm
<Chipaca> ? <- ?
<Chipaca> or has that changed too?
<jcater> wait a minute... I'm confused
Action: jcater steps back a minute to think about something
Action: Chipaca waits
Action: Chipaca hands jcater a thinking cap
Action: jcater was thinking that when such a field is set, a query is done to the datasource to retrieve the current fk_descr with an fk_key of that value
<jcater> so I'm confused about the "triggering field" thing
<Chipaca> jcater: not all databases would know how to do that

<jcater> know how to do what?
<jcater> the datasource would do that
<Chipaca> know what fk_descr to return for a given fk_key ... oh, no, I got you backwards
<jcater> ok
<jamest> i have to run bbl
jamest (~jamest@leibniz.math.ksu.edu) left #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> jcater: you're getting information from the entry to modify the datasource -- again
<Chipaca> jcater: so maybe it's ok
<Chipaca> this is taking one more step down the road of "dropdowns need their own datasource"
<Chipaca> (when you include multiple tables in the equation)
<jcater> um
<jcater> whoa
<jcater> back up
<jcater> dropdowns do have their own datasource
<Chipaca> yes
<Chipaca> why?
<Chipaca> :)
<jcater> all references to a database are done via a datasource
<jcater> when you consider what all else datasources can do
<jcater> this opens up a lot of possibilities
<jcater> e.g., with our static datasources
<jcater> we can have combo boxes that pull from a static set of values
<jcater> defined within the form, not pulled from a table
<Chipaca> ah
<jcater> that's just one example
<jcater> remember we are abstracted from a relational database
<Chipaca> I just wanted to make sure the why was "because it works that way" :)
<Chipaca> s/was/wasn't/
<jcater> ah
<jcater> no
<jcater> we have good reasons :)
<jcater> at least good in our minds :)
<jcater> (I guess good is subjective)
<Chipaca> s/good in/as good as/ ]:)
<jcater> I take that as a compliment, thank you!
<jcater> :)
<Chipaca> rats
<Chipaca> about this ... should we do it, or will you?
<jcater> I will look at it
<Chipaca> ok
<revDeke> i would like it better than diong my refresh method :)
<revDeke> if it still applies there
<Chipaca> revDeke: probably
<revDeke> though im not unhappy with the method i have now
<revDeke> as it works
<Chipaca> revDeke: the suggested way separates when you fetch the stuff from how yuo show it, which is good
Action: revDeke has learned to not complain about things that work :)
<revDeke> at least not publicly
<jcater> this may open up some new interaction stuff
<jcater> that I want to consider wrt some other things
<jcater> possibly
Action: jcater has to think the whole thing thru
Action: revDeke is so happy with 0.4.1 release it will be hard to damper that
<Chipaca> is there a "guest" account on dcl to look at the tickets?
<revDeke> i think my next gripes will come via navigator and forms more than anything else 
<revDeke> oh and schema stuff
<revDeke> gripes==feature requests ;)
<revDeke> guest/guest
<revDeke> i think
<revDeke> i think your team has accounts :)
Action: Chipaca has to do a zot2gsd
<revDeke> if not you should
<Chipaca> revDeke: hmm, how would I know my u/p?
<Chipaca> or is it just papo?
<Chipaca> jcater: can you think of any further things in the Megapatch you had issues with/queries about/brainos to pick?
<revDeke> crap
<revDeke> dcl no worky with win2k
<jcater> Chipaca: I think we've hit everything major
<Chipaca> jcater: so, unless I'm mistaken, everything is in except for historic/transactional, the GetFoo() vs. _foo, and textlookup that'll be implemented differently but essentially the same?
<Chipaca> or did I miss anything?
<jcater> Chipaca: this is from us walking down the patch
<jcater> we still are applying it

<revDeke> crap

<Chipaca> I guess the first, the second sounds silly
<revDeke> sorry it was the codeworks guys that are all setup in dcl
<revDeke> chipaca can you send me
<chillywilly> hi
Action: Chipaca sends revDeke
<chillywilly> to /dev/null?
<revDeke> first name   lastname,  email address, preferred userid
<revDeke> to derek@gnue.org
<revDeke> and i will set them up for you guys
<Chipaca> revDeke: for the team as one, or for each of us?
<revDeke> each one i think is probably better
<Chipaca> ok
<revDeke> i will create an 'account' for papo as well
<revDeke> so anything pertaining to you or that you want to open make sure its account is set to papo and you can report off that
<revDeke> as well as by individual
<Chipaca> great
<revDeke> thats what i did for codeworks
<Chipaca> great
<revDeke> this way perlhead can see anythign outstanding for papo as well as see amount of hours worked by employee
<revDeke> or the likes
<Chipaca> hmm, so I don't give perlhead an account
<nickr> so much python, so little time
<revDeke> no perlhead gets one :)
<revDeke> if you can get me one quickly i will do asap
<revDeke> other wise it will probably wait some time
<Chipaca> sending...
<Chipaca> sent
<Chipaca> in no particular order :)
<Chipaca> was that "quickly"?
<revDeke> yip
Action: Chipaca grins
<revDeke> are you guys papo or via libre?
<Chipaca> papo is the project, via libre is the foundation
<Chipaca> we are both

<derek> The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful Princess, I will stay with you for one week." The boy took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it and returned it to the pocket. The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a Princess, I'll stay with you and do *Anything* you want." Again the boy took the frog out, smiled at it and put it back into his pocket. 
<derek> Finally, the frog asked, "What is it? I've told you I'm a beautiful Princess, that I'll stay with you for a week and do *Anything* you want. Why won't you kiss me? 
<derek> The boy said, "Look I'm a computer programmer. I don't have time for girlfriends, but a talking frog is really cool."

<ra3vat_> ask
<samuel> i just install the win2k version.
<samuel> how can i get the connection
<samuel> login can't pass
<samuel> maybe i need other relevant install ?
jamest (~jamest@leibniz.math.ksu.edu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ra3vat_> you need to define your connection in connections.conf file
<samuel> oh. in which document can i find the setting?
<ra3vat_> you should have dir gnue somewhere 
<ra3vat_> etc/connections.conf
<ra3vat_> what db?
<samuel> ya. i got it. i have sqlserver2k
<samuel> provider = sqlserver?
<samuel> comment = XuXu
<samuel> provider = oracle
<samuel> service = myTNSconn
<ra3vat_> may be you need to use odbc? i'm not sure
<samuel> yes.how to config it?i wanna use odbc to access
<jamest> sqlserver?  The the MS database?
<samuel> yes.MS SQL Server2k
<samuel> cann't use it?
<jamest> should be able to
<ra3vat_>        [myconn]
<ra3vat_>        provider=odbc           # Use the mxODBC adapter
<ra3vat_>        service=mydsn           # The DSN connection string of the database
<ra3vat_> jamest: have odbc included into setup.exe build?
<jamest> which version is this?
<jamest> i'm 99% sure they were in 0.4.0 but the newer ones i dunno
<jamest> btami packaged those up
<jamest> I think
<ra3vat_> jamest: yes, it was him
<jamest> ra3vat_: is that the sample odbc  entry?  if so where'd you find it?  I've been looking myself :)

<jamest> mentioned when?  i'll read the logs

<jamest> logs
<jamest> so are you saying there is a bug in python-mysqldb?
<jamest> or just the debian packaging of that driver
<bobacus> It is a bug in python-mysqldb that is present in Debian 3.0 (but apparently has been fixed upstream)
<jamest> hmmmm
<jamest> well, we could flip the driver to fetchall()
<jamest> or if the python-mysqldb gives us a version number to work with we could test for that on startup
<jamest> and do fetchall on buggy ones and fetchmany() on fixed ones
<jamest> i'd hate to require a fetchall for everything
jwalls (~jwalls@146.145.164.54) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> bobacus: do you know the version # that fixed the problem?
<bobacus> I think it's sourceforge bug 497492, which was fixed in 0.9.2a2. It may be possible to work round the problem by adding an argument to the call to fetchmany
<jamest> bobacus: sf.net's search engine is down which I depend on to find projects on the site ;(
<jamest> you happen to have the url?
<bobacus> http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=497492&group
<jamest> ERROR - No group_id was chosen. 
<jamest> seems the url is a little short :)
<bobacus> Oops, try: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=497492&group_id=22307&atid=374932
<jamest> thanks
<jamest> did you install the newer version?
<bobacus> no I downloaded the Debian source, fixed it by hand and built my own package :)
<jamest> gee, i needed a test subject
<jamest> here victim, victim, victim
Action: bobacus hides
<bobacus> I may be able to give it a try later
<jamest> bobacus: you running cvs head?
<bobacus> jamest: I assume so (that's the default isn't it?)
<jamest> yeah
<jamest> I'm going to commit what I think may autocompensate for this 
<jamest> any chance I could get you to update in a sec and tell me if it breaks anything?
<jamest> you'll know real quick :)
<bobacus> sure
<jamest> commiting now
<jamest> commited
<jamest> I tried to only choose the proper fetch function once per result set creation
<jamest> however I don't recall all the detials about our internal cursor setup
<jamest> if this doesn't work we should be able to put
<jamest>         if MySQLdb.__version__ >= '0.9.2a2':
<jamest>           rsets = self._cursor.fetchmany()
<jamest>         else:
<jamest>           rsets = self._cursor.fetchall()
<jamest> directly into _loadNextRecord
<jamest> i hope :)
<bobacus> jamest, not sure if I picked up the change - which file is it?
<jamest> common/src/dbdriver/mysql/DBdriver.py
<jamest> or something like that
<bobacus> I'm not receiving the update. I tried deleting the file and doing 'cvs update' again but I can't see any changes - I'm getting version 1.16 of the file
<bobacus> Incidentally the first thing I had tried was replacing fetchmany() with fetchall() but this had side effects, like hanging when doing an empty query to select all records
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> lol
<jamest> i checked it into the !@#!@ 0.4.1 branch
<jamest> i specifically meant not to do that
<jamest> i won't be able to play w/ mysql until tonight 
<jamest> but if the fetchall won't work then I think we may have issues
<jamest> unless we switch to fetchone()
Action: jamest thinks there is a fetchone
<jamest> switched gigabit networking isn't too steep a requirement for good mysql performance is it?
<bobacus> !!! ;-)
<derek> um jamest if you are using mysql the price of gigabit networking is the LEAST of your problems
<jamest> lol
<derek> bobacus: mysql is great for playing around but i would have serious reservations for doing production applications against it (short of dynamic web content)
<bobacus> yeah, yeah, I've read all the anti-mysql flames, but it's already well-established at my site
Action: derek is away: work

<yelsir_> Hello everyone
<jamest> hello
<jcater> good morning
<yelsir_> Does anyone know what is current status on console version of gnue forms?
<jcater> very close, but still a few issues
<yelsir_> I am looking to design gnue forms and have a curses based forms client.  In the past I saw some mention of this happening in the future but haven't gotten any news on it.
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/curses-intro.png
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/curses-login.png
<jcater> some screenshots from a couple of weeks ago
<jcater> current issues with curses:
<jcater> button support hasn't been finished
<jcater> no notebook page support
<jcater> um
<jcater> and a few other small things
<jcater> but it's VERY close
<jcater> I can actually use it to edit and save data
<jcater> oh, yeah, the menubar doesn't work
<jcater> that and the buttons are the biggies right now
ariel_ (~ariel@ppp-217-133-240-39.dialup.tiscali.it) left irc: "Uscita dal client"
<yelsir_> can I help?  where is the code for this (files)? is it in the cvs source tree?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> it's in cvs
<jcater> the curses widget library we are using is in gnue/common/src/cursing
<jcater> the actual forms UI driver is in gnue/forms/src/uidrivers/curses
<yelsir_> thanks, will download tree and take a look in a bit

<jamest> sorry because I need to work on that

<banjaaraa> lo
<psu> hi
<banjaaraa> hi, how is going?
<psu> well, my linux partition just ran out on HD space
<psu> but otherwise fine ;-)
Action: psu just deleted that last e-mail from btami & reclaimed 20MB 
Chipaca (~john@ADSL-200-59-86-17.cordoba.sinectis.com.ar) left irc: "brb"
<banjaaraa> do u have a 2 m/c setup to do the work or have u got it all on one BIG one?
<psu> well, at the moment I have a v weird set up
<psu> as I am migrating from demon to cable
<psu> the PC w/demon dial up is very, very full on the linux partition
<psu> the PC w/cable virtually empty
<psu> but I'm not moving onto that one permenantly until wife has finished dissertation
<banjaaraa> so basically u got all ur servers/DB on one m/c
<psu> for gnue testing purposes, that's all you need
<psu> but 
<psu> as gnue and d/b talk to each other via TCP/IP
<psu> migrating to a more "production" set-up is fairly painless
<banjaaraa> k
<psu> main issue is that some d/b (postgres for sure, prob mySQL as well)
<psu> in their defult configs will only recognise localhost (127.0.0.1) as a valid connection
<psu> which is fair enough for their most common usage
<psu> (where the only user that ever logs in is apache/php/zope/whatever from localhost)
<banjaaraa> so a computer with PIII wont die with a heart attack having all the apps necessary for GNUe then?
<banjaaraa> PIII-500
<psu> should be fine
<psu> RAM is probably more critical than MHz anyway
<psu> of course, the more juice you can give it the better
<psu> On very slow PCs, there is a know bug where the splashscreen can cause crashes
<banjaaraa> k...is there a sizing doc for GNUe yet?
<psu> (basically if the app takes so long to open that the splashscreen has already gone away)
<psu> actually that may have been fixed
<psu> sizing doc: not really. I guess the people with the most practical experience on this 
<psu> are jamest and jcater
<psu> both of whom use in production
<psu> jcater I know uses a LTSP set up (linux Terminal Server farm)
<banjaaraa> k...so they have people using it as a production system
<psu> oh yes
<jbailey> And more everyday.
<jbailey> I'm about to deploy a production system.
<banjaaraa> what size?
<jbailey> This one will be quite small - Probably a dozen people.

<banjaaraa> any major obstacle that come in deployement?
<psu> lack of debian packages ;-)
<btami> jamest: you put MailMerge.py and Label.py only in 0.4.1branch
<banjaaraa> BTW does GNUe have a customising transaction ala SAP - SPRO?
<jbailey> psu: Nothing wrong with the debian packages.  In fact, they have a newer version than the GNUe releases have ;)
<psu> that;s how we finally persuaded jbailey to debianise us 
<btami> jamest: ?
<banjaaraa> any production environment in the UK yet?
<jbailey> Well, psu's basement...
<banjaaraa> :)

<ra3vat_> does gnue/reports/samples/mailmerge/merge-rtf script involved in operation?
banjaaraa (banjara@chandratech.demon.co.uk) left irc: 
<jcater> ra3vat_: no, not in normal operations
<jcater> if you set up a report to do merging, it will use the merge_rtf filter adapter
<ra3vat_> merge-rtf expects data in <record>
<ra3vat_>         <field name="info" value="value"/>
<ra3vat_> form
<ra3vat_> but report is generated in <field name="name">value</field> 
<ra3vat_> ok
<ra3vat_> will try filter
<jcater> which report generated?
<jcater> err, I think that's right
<jcater>  <field name="name">value</field> 
<jcater> the merge_rtf in samples/ needs to be deleted
<jcater> I guess :)

<ra3vat_> jcater: how can i set up a report to do merging
<ra3vat_> ?
<jcater> ra3vat_: do you have the rtf made? and a grd file made?
<ra3vat_> yes
<jcater> add an entry similar to the following to your report-filters.conf file:
<jcater> [mailmerge:authorizations-rh.rtf]
<jcater> description = Reading At Home Authorizations
<jcater> engine = merge_rtf
<jcater> template = /public/data/merge-reports/authorizations-rh.rtf
<jcater> then you just do gnue-report --filter authorizations-rh.rtf myrep.grd
<jcater> (altering the names of course)
<ra3vat_> oh, that one i did not ever seen
<jcater> well, and you'd want a -d <filename>
<ra3vat_> looking
<jcater> ra3vat_: this is stuff I've been using inhouse
<jcater> this was really the first release usable by others
<jcater> I really need to start docs for reports
<jcater> as I think it's usable for others now
<jamest> i use it :)

<reinhard> ariel_: ok thanks
<ariel_> reinhard: there are two things i would add to the root class of the repository hierarchy
<ariel_> in the note i focused on the architecture, but i think we must consider them in design
<ariel_> 1) a sort of lock/semaphore mechanism
<ariel_> 2) a isSystemObject boolean function that will be checked against
<reinhard> hmm
<ariel_> so the repository knows if to produce the object from inside hardcoded knowledge or from the database
<reinhard> 2) could be internal to the repository
<reinhard> but yes we need it
<reinhard> to 1) i'm not sure if we need that on this level
<reinhard> we don't need to lock a _class_, do we?
<reinhard> we might want to lock an instance or several instances
<reinhard> not a class definition

<gontran> or just forms/
<gontran> jcater, let me take this opportunity to say that I'm glad that you're working on curses, 
<gontran> I wasn't sure how much further I could take it -- not being so familiar with ui subsystem. 
<jcater> thanks
<jcater> I needed it for some stuff at work
<gontran> cool. I hope I can help some.

<jcater> but I wouldn't put it in front of users

<jcater> 2.4.18
<siesel> strange. 
<siesel> Is it a Promise card?
<siesel> possibly the driver isn't compiled in.

<jcater> apparently CMD chipset
<jcater> lspci shows:
<jcater> 00:0a.0 Unknown mass storage controller: CMD Technology Inc: Unknown device 0680 (rev 01)

Action: siesel can't use debian start disks, because promise isn't compiled in.
<siesel> there is "CMD64X chipset support" kernel option, which is probably disabled
