<jamest> Varadhan?
<derek> Varadhan: here
<derek> not for long though
<Varadhan> Please contact Mr. M.P Anand Babu at 510-687-7045.. or mail him @ anand.babu@californiadigital.com / ab@gnu.org.in ...
<Varadhan> derek: yes tell me...

<Varadhan> ra3vat: yes tell me...
<pradhap> ajmitch: there ??
<jamest> Varadhan: what are you talking about at Oracle world?
<jamest> is this something you're doing right now or in the future
<Varadhan> actually, a sample banking application is written using gnue+oracle 9i and has been setup there for the show...
<jamest> do you have a demo setup and if so what gnue tools are demo'd
<derek> Varadhan: was that for me? to contect MP Anad Babu?
<derek> if so can you give me more information :)
<Varadhan> jamest: no.. its a live one...
<jamest> banking == on the teller side of the counter, personal side at home, other?
<Varadhan> jamest: it is currently running there to show the demo of gnue as well...
<Varadhan> derek: for the entire gnue community.. :)
<Varadhan> derek: what further details you want???
<Varadhan> jamest: it is a very very small banking application with which you can put in some amt and take out something from it...
<Varadhan> jamest: actually, it allows creation of an account, modification of account info, closing of accounts, depositting into an account, withdrawal from accounts,
<Varadhan> querying of account balance etc..
<derek> Varadhan: i dont get it
<derek> you said contact anand babu, but i dont know what to contact him for, i.e. why does he want to talk to me :)
<Varadhan> derek: pardon me with what you don't get from my messages???
<Varadhan> derek: we have setup a stall in the Oracle world to show demo of gnue with oracle9i on a IA64 debian box...
<Varadhan> derek: we have written a small application in gnue to show the connectivity of oracle with gnue... and the power of gnue based application...
<derek> Varadhan: i understand that
<derek> what i dont understand is why i need to contact anad babu :)
<derek> does he have questions?
<Varadhan> derek: so we thought of informing this to the entire gnue community so that they can have a look at the stall...
Action: derek must run to work i have meetings
<jamest> Varadhan: are these demo files private or could we get them to put into a sample pack for gnue?
<Varadhan> derek, if you want to jave a look at the stall.. you can contact Anand babu... 
<derek> ok
<Varadhan> jamest: we are much obliged to put them in the gnue sample pack...
<Varadhan> actually, we are working towards making it more redable for the future gnue users...
<jamest> cool
<Varadhan> and moreover, we hope to receive gnue community in our stall to make it more success!!!

<btami> hi all
<btami> i find an interesting issue with forms
<btami> 'v tested connection.gfd
<btami> saved it with designer
<btami> and then it failed with forms
<btami> Error: The connections.conf doesn't contain a definition for 'connection'
<btami> whe designer saves a gfd
<btami> it puts a <database> tag at the bottom of file
<btami> and forms doesn't likes this
<btami> if i put <database> tag befor <datasource> tag in gfd
<btami> it's OK again
<btami> forms depends on order of tags ?
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> it shouldn't
<jcater> let me look at something
<ra3vat> btami: hi, are you using reports with i18n data?
jan (jan@131.220.92.144) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<btami> hi ra3vat
<btami> trying, why
<btami> ?
<btami> ra3vat: ?
<ra3vat> for now can't get local message readable in html reports
<btami> i'm trying text report mainly
<btami> it seems something puts charset=UTF-8 into html header
<ra3vat> btami: it is not only header, encoding for text looks like UTF-8 too
<jcater> if someone can whip me up a simple report that fails with i18n, I can debug
<ra3vat> jcater:  it not fails but genetated in UTF-8 encoding. how to change encoding?
<btami> jcater: it doesn't fails, just wrong :)
<ra3vat> generated
Action: jcater would call that "failing"  :)
<ra3vat> jcater: it may be any report that pulls db data not in ascii, i suppose
<btami> jcater: you use dest.write ('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>\n') in GRReport.py
<jcater> I think there's more to it than just changing that header, though
<jcater> I think I have to open a codec
<jcater> which I learned to do this past weekend by accident
<btami> jcater: i'v sended patches into DCL #159-#160
<btami> those contains some i18n corrections too
<jcater> ok
<btami> and finally i put attachments into DCL too 
<btami> jcater: you don't have to deal with codecs, if sitecustomize.py looks like something this:
<btami> import sys, locale
<btami> loc = locale.getdefaultlocale()
<btami> if loc[1]:
<btami>   sys.setdefaultencoding(loc[1])
<btami> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, '')
<btami> print 'Default encoding: %s' %sys.getdefaultencoding()
<btami> print 'Locale conventions: %s' %locale.localeconv()
<jcater> ah
<pradhap> jcater: hi
<jcater> pradhap: hi
<jcater> congrats on the demo
<pradhap> jcater: thankx a lot..
<ra3vat> btami: Arturas solved it somehow that there is no need to change sitecustomize
<pradhap> jcater: you helped a lot for setting up GNUe + Oracle 9i + Debain on Itanium-64 ...
<ra3vat> even if ascii mentioned there
<btami> ra3vat: please let me know how
<btami> one thing i'm worry, where UTF-8 comes from

<ra3vat> btami: common/src/GParser.py
<ra3vat> revision 1.41
<ra3vat> date: 2002/07/31 11:01:25;  author: arturas;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2
<ra3vat> Corrected problem of i18n characters in .gfd file - in case of not
<ra3vat> only ascii characters, sax returned unicode string, which caused further
<ra3vat> errors in python. Earlier this was solved by changing system-wide
<ra3vat> site.py file option defaultencoding from 'ascii' to other value. Now
<ra3vat> encoding is read from gnue.conf file option formFontEncoding and is used
<ra3vat> to enforce sax returned unicode string recode to given encoding.
<ra3vat> ----------------------------
<btami> yes, it solves the gfd's problem, but what about data (from DBMS) ?
<ra3vat> btami: i'm not sure i follow
<ra3vat> the problem was that xml processing enforces internal representation in unicode
<ra3vat> it is not with db data
<ra3vat> you now db encoding and can convert to other encoding if you wish 
<ra3vat> you know
<btami> ra3vat: sorry for waiting, i'm thinking about reports
<btami> it makes an intermadiate xml file with dest.write() calls
<btami> and then a sablotron process comes
<btami> i don't know/when how UTF-8 comes
<ra3vat> btami: changing encoding in dest.write ('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>\n') in GRReport.py solved my problem with html report

<jcater> just out of curiosity, how are you processing the lines in the file?
<ajmitch> i looked at that one, but it's not wonderful - requires you to compile a python extension
<jcater> hmm
<ajmitch> at the moment, i'm doing it simply - i know it's not great :)
<jcater> ok
<jcater> I was just curious

<lupo> hi
<ajmitch> hi
<lupo> i'm currently trying to install gnue tools on my laptop
<lupo> i hope that python2.2
<lupo> works
<revDeke> yeah it works
<revDeke> wha tis your laptop running
Action: revDeke hopes not suse or some other hard to play with distro :)
<lupo> debian, what else? is there anything else at all?
<revDeke> whew
<revDeke> it should be easy then
<revDeke> you installing cvs?
<jcater> oooooo
<revDeke> or 0.4.0?
<jcater> lupo: debian unstable?
<lupo> cvs rulez
<revDeke> if 0.4.0 i would just use the debs
<lupo> jcater: debian stable
<jcater> ok
<jcater> didn't know python2.2 was in stable now
<lupo> jcater: there is no 2.1 in stable anymore
<revDeke> jcater: why woudnt it be 2.3 is in unstable ;)
<jcater> no 2.1 in woody?
<lupo> wasn't there some bug with 2.2 in gnue?
<lupo> no 2.1 in woody, unbelievably
<jcater> lupo: 2.2.0
<revDeke> lupo: long time ago
<jcater> but 2.2.1 fixed it
<lupo> okay
<jcater> they are on 2.2.2 now, I think
<jcater> lupo: against postgresql?
<revDeke> jcater: come one you know you can get 2.3 in sid, why say they are on 2.2.2 ;)
Action: jcater thwaps revDeke
Action: revDeke still think thats hilarious
<lupo> yep, just configuring postgresql
<jcater> lupo: make sure stable doesn't have python-psycopg 1.0.13-1
<jcater> it's broken
<jcater> I think stable has an older version of psycopg
<jcater> which is good
<lupo> i have 1.0.8
<jcater> ok, good
<lupo> setup-cvs.py or setup-cvs2.py
<jcater> what is setup-cvs2.py ??
<jcater> when did that get in there?
<lupo> dunno, it's here :)
<jcater> well, use setup-cvs.py
psu (psu@public1-wear2-3-cust42.midd.broadband.ntl.com) left #gnuenterprise.
<lupo> jcater: looks like arturas checked it in - it includes fixes for win32
<jcater> oh
Action: jcater would have named that setup-cvs-win32.py, then :)
<lupo> ImportError: No module named wxPython.wx
<revDeke> jcater i told them to rename setup-cvs-win.py
Action: revDeke assumes they never did it?
<revDeke> apt-get libwxgtk or something liek that
<lupo> i have
<revDeke> for the proper python?
<revDeke> do
<revDeke> python2.2
<revDeke> then type
<revDeke> import wxPython.wx
<revDeke> and if you get that error
<revDeke> then you dont have wxPython installed quite right
<revDeke> for python2.2
<lupo> i did a find
<lupo> this bitch has installed wxPy to /usr/lib/python2.1
<revDeke> Varadhan: are you around?
<lupo> argh
<lupo> dependency hell
<lupo> i can't remove 2.1 and install 2.2 exclusively, because some blockheads made a dependency on python2.1 and not python
<lupo> argh
<lupo> libwxgtk2.2-python is wx version 2.2 for python 2.1

<revDeke> isnt that quaint
<lupo> according to the copied config file, these values should be obsolete

<jcater> :)
<jcater> um
<jcater> wish btami or ra3vat were here
<jcater> I think they know how to get around this
<jcater> or Art
<lupo> what is the precise problem?
<lupo> l10n?
<jcater> i18n
<jcater> your locale setting
<jcater> something to do with site_customize
<jcater> or something
<lupo> because we use "," to seperate floating points and "." to mark thousands and you do it the other way round?
<jcater> I'm not 100% sure
<lupo> what is field type "serial" in postgres?
<jcater> I think that's an automatic sequence field
<lupo> great, thats what i suspected
<lupo> i'll use that for the id :)
<lupo> okay
<lupo> i've made a simple customers table
<lupo> let's see whether the wizards in designer are really as great as some people claim :)
<lupo> DB000: gnue.common.GDataObjects.ProviderNotSupportedError: No database driver found for provider type 'psycopg'

<jcater> r0x0rz
<jcater> gnue-reports -f postscript -F 'label="Avery 6879"' mylabels.grd
<jcater> that, boys and girls, now works
<jcater> I tested with 3-4 different label part numbers
<jcater> that I have in house
<revDeke> cool
<revDeke> how are you making the postscript?
<revDeke> ie.. what libraries or such in python are you using?
<jcater> fyi, -F == --filter-options == options to pass  to the filter process
<jcater> none
<lupo> revDeke: gnue rocks ass
<jcater> rocks ass? or kicks ass?

<ajmitch> hello people
<jamest> hi
<jamest> what's the native language of NZ?
<ajmitch> english is the main language used
<jamest> damn
<ajmitch> maori is apparantly also an official language, but a large part of the country doesn't speak it
<jamest> i swore you guys had a language other than english
<ajmitch> not as a primary language
<ajmitch> just cos i speak funny doesn't mean i speak english as a second language ;)
<jamest> don't worry, that's not why I thing you speak funny
<ajmitch> why'd you think we had another language?
<ra3vat> what version of wx would you recommend for fresh gnue install under w98?
<jamest> the most bleeding edge you can get
<ajmitch> ra3vat: the latest should work, i think
<jamest> even then good luck
<ajmitch> i used 2.3.2.1 on w98, but not with GNUe :)
<ra3vat> oh, thanks :)
<jamest> if you look at the feature plan you'll see the cleanup got pushed back a rev
<jamest> so that a native win32 driver can move up
<ajmitch> i still prefer gtk2 on GNU/Linux :)
rdean (~rdean@12-221-229-247.client.insightBB.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> hah, bug squashed
<ajmitch> 1-line change
<jamest> in our code i hope
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> in gtk2 driver
<ajmitch> i just compared it with the wx driver :)
<ajmitch> not sure what do do about the formAlert() method tho
<jamest> implement it
<jamest> :)
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> the wx driver produces a beep
<ajmitch> i don't see how to do that with gtk2, so i dropped it out
jcater (~jcater@cpe-066-061-083-220.midsouth.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> as long as a UI driver does things consistantly it does not have to do the same thing as wx driver
<jamest> instead of a beep you could flash the screen once then have the status bar blink 3 times 
<ajmitch> it works
<jamest> or something
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> hi jcater
<jcater> jamest: the curses driver does that
<jcater> it flashes the screen instead of a beep :)
<jamest> ok, i was just explaining that a UI driver only has to be consistant with itself
<jamest> as it defines the behaviour on that interface 
<jamest> jcater: the nz'rs speak english
<jamest> not kiwi
<jamest> so I can't use them in the tutorial
<jcater> hehe
<jcater> kiwi was a joke
<ajmitch> you could use maori :)
<jamest> i know :)
<jamest> maori it is then
<jamest> how to say "welcome" in it
<ajmitch> haere mai
<jamest> are those capitalized?
<ajmitch> iirc :)
<ajmitch> umm
<ajmitch> yeah, i guess
<jcater> jamest: don't forget: 'wassup, my nigga!"
<jamest> jcater had a url but that's at work not here 
<jcater> that's chillywilly speal

<jamest> ajmitch: New Zealand - Kia Ora - Hello ("Key or ra")\
<ajmitch> jcater: yeah, "Kia Ora" is another one
<jbailey> jamest: I'm hoping to have some time tommorow, but it's unlikely.
<jbailey> ajmitch: Heya.
<jamest> we've done a prerelease
<nickr> jive locale
<jbailey> Of which version?
<jamest> 0.4.1
<ajmitch> jamest: think you could sneak in some patches to forms before the release?
<jamest> absolutely
<ajmitch> cool
<jamest> no one actually runs the pre-releases
<jamest> and test them
<jbailey> Hmmm..  Weren't you skipping 0.4.1 because of the confusion with 0.4.1a?
<jamest> we just do it cause it makes us fell like we trie
<jamest> d
<jamest> we talked about it
<nickr> http://kel.otago.ac.nz/translator/
<ajmitch> hmm, an otago.ac.nz address... :)
<jcater> hehe
<jcater> kupu!
<jbailey> jamest: I can't make debs of 0.4.1. =(
<jbailey> Well, I keep mark an epoch, but I'd rather not.
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> well 0.4.2 or 0.4.1b
<jamest> both are confusing :)
<jamest> fwiw: we've switched to 0.4.0.99 for cvs
<jbailey> 0.4.1.1? =)
<nickr> whats with these crazy moon versionings?
<jamest> :)
<jamest> this is a 1 time issues isn't it?
<jamest> after this .debs will be based upon releases?
<ajmitch> the problem with gtk2 is the overabundance of API docs
<jbailey> jamest: Hopefully.  Unless you guys take a silly long time between releases and I need to pull from CVS to fix bugs.
<jamest> us
<jamest> take a long time?
<jcater> long time?
<jcater> no way
<jbailey> Having only recently successfully installed GNUe, I have no idea what your release cycles are. =)
<jcater> we always keep it under a year
<jbailey> *lol*
<jbailey> "We release more often than the Hurd"
<jamest> or debian!
<nickr> ajmitch: the problem with gtk is the overabundance of API
<ajmitch> yup
<jamest> we're so with the "in" crowd
<jcater> jbailey: y'all got a lot of bad press on that slashdot story
<jcater> wrt partition limits of 2 GB or whatever
<ajmitch> jcater: for sure
<jcater> :(
<ajmitch> don't worry
<jbailey> jcater: Well, rms promised something, and put no effort into making it happen.
<ajmitch> i've seen people come in here thinking GNUe was just a VB clone ;)
<nickr> jcater: Well, at least this time there were posters that actually knew what they were talking about re the limitations
<jbailey> He also failed to *ask* any of us first.
<jcater> ajmitch: true dat
<jbailey> So I think we should have a "fuck rms" release.  Call it 1.0 without the features. =)
<ajmitch> hehe
<jamest> lol
Action: jcater will stay out of that debate :)
<jbailey> =)
<nickr> you mean it isn't a VB replacement?
<jcater> nickr: no!!!
<jcater> its an Access replacement
<jbailey> nickr: You're looking for GNU Mono.
<nickr> =O
<jbailey> =)
<jcater> silly nickr
<ajmitch> hehe
<jbailey> With the motto: "Use C#, and you'll get Mono!"
<nickr> It replaces Access but isn't an access replacement, I think is what you meant to say
<jbailey> "You'll wish you had Mono"?
<ajmitch> it isn't limited to replacing access
<jcater> nickr: I was being sarcastic... that's a common association too... ppl think we are just an access replacement
<jamest> no, wp is an access replacement
<jcater> lol
<jcater> at least in your office, eh?
<jamest> wp = word perfect for those not in the know
Action: jcater still thinks we need a wp dbdriver
<jamest> dude
<ajmitch> jcater: so GNUe's not an access replacement? dang :)
<jamest> i need reports to output wp merge file format (AKA WP Database format)
<jcater> I need reports to print money
<ajmitch> wp is still fairly popular, isn't it?
<ajmitch> lol
<jcater> ajmitch: ask him the versions he's having to support
<jbailey> If he's lucky it's 5.1 for dos. =)
<nickr> it must've been crazy to have to write stuff back then for dos
<jamest> jbailey: it is
<nickr> Write your own everything driver.
<nickr> sheesh.
<ajmitch> fun!
<jamest> per machine: wp 5.1 for DOS, 6.0 for Win 3.1, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0
<jcater> ya, they needed GNUe-Common / DOS Edition
<jcater> :)
<ajmitch> was there an emacs for DOS? :)
<jamest> 5 friggen licenses per machine
<jamest> our office has everything in wp "databases"
<ajmitch> ouch!
<jamest> and the "programs" are wp 5.1 for dos macros
<jamest> I'm trying to get forms doing more and more but there is major resistance
<ajmitch> ultraconservative office staff?
<jamest> wp doesn't do input validation so forms is more limited
<jcater> ajmitch: worse
<jcater> tenured staff
Action: ajmitch shudders
<jamest> as they can't slap an 15 email addresses into the zipcode field
Action: jamest is NOT going to get started
<jamest> he is not
<jcater> jamest: you should be gnue'n
<ajmitch> jamest: where do you have the misfortune of working?
<jamest> ajmitch: I love my job
<jamest> Kansas State Universiry
<jamest> er,
<jamest> University
<ajmitch> thought it would have to be an institution like that :)
<jcater> jamest: you're supposed to remind yourself that you love your job, not ajmitch
<ajmitch> jamest: yes, you _don't_ love me
<ajmitch> you love your job
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> what to break next
<ajmitch> i'm still searching for how to flash the screen, or do something....
<ajmitch> i don't feel like grabbing the gdk layer, inverting it, blitting it, then restoring
<jamest> jcater: you need a list?
<jcater> um
<jamest> i have 1 thing that would be very very nice
<jcater> err
Action: jcater is afraid to ask
<jcater> um
<ajmitch> uh oh
<jcater> I don't do hired assassinations
<jamest> for the tutorial
<jcater> sorry, dude
<jamest> I'm repeating the lines
<jamest> import sys,os
<jamest> sys.path.append('/usr/local/gnue/lib/python')
<jamest> os.environ['INSTALL_LIB']='/usr/local/gnue/lib/python'
<jamest> os.environ['INSTALL_PREFIX']='/usr/local/gnue'
<jamest> for each sample
<jamest> it would be nice if we had some way for apps to discover this at runtime
<jamest> maybe a small module installed the in default search path of python
<jcater> I can do this
Action: jcater darts off to, um, do this
<ajmitch> gah
<ajmitch> stuff this, i'll just send the patch as-is & fix the alert problem later :)
<ajmitch> forms-support@gnuenterprise.org ?
<jamest> um
<jamest> i didn't even know that existed
<ajmitch> heh
<jcater> jamest: that's how all those tickets you have got in there
Action: jamest is off to adjust the system wide procmails on ash to properly route that stuff to, um, somewhere special
<ajmitch> sent - you may want to remove the commented lines instead :)
Action: ajmitch waits for mr cater to review the patch :)
