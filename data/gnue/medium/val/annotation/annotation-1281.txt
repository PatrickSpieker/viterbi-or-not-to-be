<p>Referring back to 
<kcref archive="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.15Nov2002" subject="[IRC] 15 Nov 2002" title="Merging GNUe and Papo CVS code" />, 
Marcos Dione (StyXman) asked <quote who="Marcos Dione">does 
anybody knows about the inclussion of features implemented in our patch into 
gnue?</quote> James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">i'm still 
working on it</quote>. He had been <quote who="James Thompson">hoping to get to 
over the holidays</quote> but was now hoping to start this week.</p>

<p>Later, Marcos asked <quote who="Marcos Dione">did you hacked anything in the 
way of &lt;form style="dialog" /&gt;</quote>, as discussed in 
<kcref archive="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.23Dec2002" subject="[IRC] 23 Dec 2002" title="Dialog boxes in Forms returning parameters" />.
James said <quote who="James Thompson">a fair bit of the work is done</quote> - 
<quote who="James Thompson">i just need to make some more adjustsment to the 
UI</quote>. Marcos asked for any hints as to how this would work - 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">I need to either reproduce it or backport it when is 
done.</quote> James said there would be radical technical changes - 
<quote who="James Thompson">I wouldn't reimplement - if you can give me the time
&lt;dialog&gt; was to be able to replace your genericBox - i planed on that being 
a dynamically created &lt;dialog&gt;</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">no offense if you 
would use official cvs you would save a LOT of time</quote>. James pointed out 
that papo were still using their own CVS as <quote who="James Thompson">I'm still 
trying to merge their changes up stream so they can migrate up</quote>. Derek 
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">that was my point - it takes time away from 
adding new features to try to sync with them - and then they out of sync 
again</quote>. He <quote who="Derek Neighbors">isnt overly 
concerned from a gnue standpoint, just would like to help papo out by giving a 
consistent tree</quote> -  but the <quote who="Derek Neighbors">gnue team cant 
constantly spend time trying to resync</quote>. Marcos said that, for some time, 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">we (almost) stopped to add features to our cvs ('cept for 
bug fixes)</quote>.</p>

<p>Marcos added <quote who="Marcos Dione">I guess we'll have our cvs anyways, as we 
have functionality that will never get into gnue. unless there were other ways to 
introduce them, like delegation in the db arch</quote>, as discussed in 
<kcref archive="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.03Oct2002" subject="[IRC] 03 Oct 2002" title="Adding delegates support to GNUe Common" />.
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">so what you are saying is you want a 
fork</quote>. Marcos disagreed - <quote who="Marcos Dione">it's the last thing we 
want.</quote> Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">well if you have your own cvs 
you have a fork</quote> - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">it might be a minor fork but 
a fork none the less</quote>. He felt that GNUe had <quote who="Derek Neighbors">bent 
over backwards to apply patches that you would stop using your own cvs so we wouldnt 
have such headaches</quote>. James said <quote who="James Thompson">we're not fast 
enough for their business needs - that's all - i mean it's been weeks/months(?)</quote> 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">well its a two edge sword - you have dialogs 
almost done and styxman will spend two weeks implementing or back port - so whom is 
slowing whom down</quote>? Applying patches generated from papo's CVS back into the 
main GNUe CVS was time-consuming, and was only really worth it if papo were intending 
to use GNUe's CVS in the future.</p>

<p>Federico Heinz (perlhead) said <quote who="Federico Heinz">We most definitely 
*don't* want to fork. We're doing our best to work with what we currently 
have.</quote> Derek emphasised that he was not opposed to forking - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">there are two types of forks - a pure fork... we make 
foo, you want to go right i want to go left and we fork - and - a mild fork, we 
make foo, you want to go right, we want to go right, you want to dress in red, we 
want to dress in blue - in a mild fork it makes sense to 'share' as much as 
possible - as things are going same direction.</quote> He 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">would rather see papo just use gnue and drop own 
cvs</quote> but <quote who="Derek Neighbors">understands business requirements and 
timelines</quote>. However, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">just like in a data 
conversion if you continue entering data in old system you will never cut over to 
the new one</quote>.</p>

<p>He felt that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">this dialog sample proves as well - 
there is functionality that might come into our cvs you want - and its murder for 
you to back port it.</quote> However, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if dialogs 
will take you 2 weeks to do - and its in our system - and if it takes two weeks 
to get cvs head to give you proper functionality</quote>, then there was no issue 
as the work could be done in GNUe's CVS directly <quote who="Derek Neighbors">and 
you are in sync - /me isnt saying thats the case - but you have to look at such trade 
offs</quote>. Federico said that getting the papo CVS in sync with GNUe's would 
take much longer than two weeks - Marcos had <quote who="Federico Heinz">played 
catch up for quite a while in nov/dec, and he never got anywhere near the head 
branch.</quote> Derek felt that the only way to re-sync was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">to check out our cvs - then add the functionality to 
it thats missing and submit as patches - one patch per functionality - not a giant 
patch - a. that will minimize amount of wait time you would incur from us - b. that 
ensures our cvs does what you need - in the mean time stop adding stuff to your 
cvs</quote>. Federico said that the <quote who="Federico Heinz">Problem is, as I 
understand it, that if we do that, our stuff STOPS WORKING. And we must have a 
widely deployable version in two months. Debugged and tested.</quote> Derek 
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">well then i would say it behooves you to do 
ASAP - unless you forever want a fork - as if you deploy you will NEVER get back 
to our cvs - as you will never be able to 'stop' adding features to sync up. 
Again im not saying you must do this, or even necessarily that you should do 
this - that is up to you - just be forewarned we wont take patches created from a 
cvs other than our own</quote>. Marcos did not think there was actually much 
difference in functionality. Federico agreed - <quote who="Federico Heinz">there's 
not actually that much more that we need... just now, a few UI things, and 
then we can rest.</quote> Derek warned that the forthcoming changes to the GNUe 
Forms Definition format (.gfd) in version 0.5.0 would make papo's CVS 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">incompatiable going forward without MAJOR work on 
your tree</quote>.</p>

<p>Marcos noted that there were some changes in papo's CVS that 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">won't get into gnue ever. and we know that.</quote> 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">for somethings like that if one off deals 
you could treat like</quote> patches to the Linux kernel, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">where its a 'mini fork' for specific 
functionality</quote>. Federico agreed, but said that the bigger issue was 
<quote who="Federico Heinz">We have stuff we need, and that GNUe wants but 
does not yet have in HEAD.</quote> Marcos said that, as papo had several 
devlopers, they would still want to have a CVS even if just for version 
control on their own patches.</p>

<p>Federico fully appreciated Derek's point about ideally merging CVS before 
papo did a wider release, but <quote who="Federico Heinz">it's a financing 
thing</quote> - <quote who="Federico Heinz">if we get a solution that *works* 
by march, we get the funding we need to continue work, and that work goes 
according to *our* schedule.</quote> Derek could relate to that, but warned 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if you dont make papo tree like 0.5.0 it will be 
an utter bitch for you to back port any new functionality we put in</quote>. 
He appreciated that papo <quote who="Derek Neighbors">have always been more 
than eager to share their improvements, i want to make it abundantly clear 
the gripe is not that they want to fork gnue and not give back - its more 
that applying patches is utter hell, because they are created off a cvs tree 
other than our own and in masse</quote>. Federico said that the funding 
situation <quote who="Federico Heinz">means that we *will* do some shit 
twice, which we could have gotten right the first time. But if doing so will 
cost us our release date, we won't even get to the point where we can get it 
right once.</quote> Derek agreed - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the question 
is does it outweigh what it will cost you to merge the other stuff over</quote> 
later? Once all of the papo patches from November had been applied, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">our cvs head after those patches might not be all 
that radiacally different feature wise - anywho its up to you guys to decide 
whats best for you</quote>. Federico said that papo's clients were not that 
used to software development cycles - they were 
<quote who="Federico Heinz">Sustainable development organizations, 
mostly.</quote> - <quote who="Federico Heinz">They have great trust in us, 
and we do all in our power to keep that trust.</quote></p>
