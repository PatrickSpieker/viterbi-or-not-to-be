Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) said he had <quote who="Mike Vincent">been 
thinking about the SKU thing.. I can imagine 3 ways to organize a</quote>
Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) - <quote who="Mike Vincent">1) 
Simple serialized number which is N digits long. 2) A number with N 
segments one or more of which are a serialized number and one or more are 
derived from predefined lookup tables and 3) a segmented number completely 
derived from lookup tables</quote>. Segments could either have 
<quote who="Mike Vincent">a predefined padded length</quote> or be 
<quote who="Mike Vincent">delimited with or without a contraint on 
their length/scope.</quote> If <quote who="Mike Vincent">there 
was a way to configure how a SKU were established, then you could use that 
information to create your forms to manipulate them based on that 
configuration.</quote> This meta-data could be queried to build the 
<quote who="Mike Vincent">form according to the data extrapolated. 
Descriptions would be labels, if the segment was a lookup a dropdown could 
be created, etc..</quote></p>

<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) said the <quote who="Derek Neighbors">way i planned 
on doing it was drop downs and triggers - you selected the 'categories' or 
such that generate the numbers</quote>. He added <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i 
really think making a dynamic form is a bad solution - at least in the gnue 
world. Maybe for gnue proper - but getting sku numbers that complex in gnue-sb 
i think is over kill.</quote> The main requirement for his clients was to be 
able to generate new SKU for new items using pre-existing categories from 
drop-down lists, but also use SKUs that did not fit the standard pattern - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i.e. the sku# is a free form field - but you can 
use the categories to generate a number</quote>. His users would typically have 
three levels of category. Mike said that, with too many segments, this 
could <quote who="Mike Vincent">would create very large numbers and very 
large numbers are hard to manage outside of the computer.</quote> 
However, as <quote who="Mike Vincent">if I were a consultant this could be a 
bonus to be able to adapt to a running system rather than expect a migration if 
things didnt fit.</quote> His <quote who="Mike Vincent">numbers are completely 
derived from lookup tables and are in 5 segments/categories</quote>.</p>
