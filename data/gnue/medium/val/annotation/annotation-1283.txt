<mention>ra3vat</mention>

<p>Marcos Dione (StyXman) asked <quote who="Marcos Dione">how should 
I use the .04to0.5 conversor?</quote> Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) said 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">run it with your form as param - old form 
will be saved with &lt;name&gt;-PRE050 name</quote>. The conversion
routine, which was designed to convert GNUe Form Definitions (.gfd) 
from the format used in version 0.4.x and earlier to the new format 
that split the logic and the display, was not completely automatic, 
but <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">in most cases mine worked</quote>. 
Marcos said <quote who="Marcos Dione">ok, I'll finish the file by 
hand</quote>. Later, Jason Cater explained that the syntax for the 
conversion script was <quote who="Jason Cater"><code>gfd04to05.py 
&lt;source.gfd&gt; [&lt;destination.gfd&gt;]</code> - if you specify 
two names on the command line, then the second one is the output name 
and the first one is left unchanged - if you only specify one form, 
then the original is renamed and the new one is created in its 
place</quote>.</p>

<p>Earlier, Marcos reported various errors trying to run a converted 
form, most of which seemed to be caused by the convertor putting 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">all my buttons in the logic part</quote>. 
This was a very simple form, just with a few buttons. He 
wondered if this was the problem - <quote who="Marcos Dione">can a 
form have no logic?</quote> Jason asked 
<quote who="Jason Cater">do you have a &lt;button&gt; as a child of 
a &lt;block&gt; ??</quote>. Marcos said this was true of 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">all the buttons</quote>. Jason said that 
the conversion script was not <quote who="Jason Cater">accounting for 
buttons in blocks</quote>. Marcos confessed <quote who="Marcos Dione">we 
have more complicated things like that. boxes inside boxes inside blocks 
and so on. would that be 'wrong'?</quote> Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">well, the converter won't support it - nor 
will</quote> the CVS head version of GNUe Forms - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I'm not sure what it will do</quote>.</p>

<p>Dmitry and Marcos concluded that the new format .gfds always had to 
have a &lt;logic&gt; section - at a minimum, this had to contain a 
&lt;block&gt; tag to specify which datasource to use. The conversion 
script would fail with very simple forms that had no datasource, but 
converted forms could then be made to work by manually adding a dummy 
datasource - Marcos noted that <quote who="Marcos Dione">tmpDataSource 
is valid</quote>.</p>

<p>Marcos asked about containers for widgets. Jason said 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">we haven't implemented containers yet - in 
the old version or the new - with the exception of a 
&lt;page&gt;</quote>. Marcos said <quote who="Marcos Dione">I sent a 
patch for that one a looong time ago and it almos got in, but it was 
disabled for 0.4.0 release, AFAIK</quote>. Jason explained 
<quote who="Jason Cater">it broke a lot of existing forms - when 
applying I thought it was backward compatable - but I haven't had time 
to correct it</quote>. He thought <quote who="Jason Cater">we are 
leaning to not having a dual function &lt;box&gt; tag, but an actual 
container tag of sorts - but I'm not 100% sure what we want to do there 
yet</quote>.</p>

<p>Dmitry asked <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">where should trigger be tied 
to field tag in logic or entry tag in layout? what's the difference if 
both ways are possible?</quote> Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">there's 
not a 1:1 relationship between a field (logic) and an entry (layout)... 
there's a 1:many. most of the time you'd probably want to do a &lt;field&gt; 
trigger</quote>. He confirmed that on-change triggers should exist for 
field tags, as for entry tags.</p>
