<p>Marcos Dione (StyXman) asked Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) whether he knew what 
was the supposed semantics for the different masks (display, input, format). 
Marcos needed them <quote who="Marcos Dione">to show just a few decimal but 
keeping all the decimals internally.</quote> James Thompson (jamest) was 
afraid <quote who="James Thompson">that's up in the air right now IIRC</quote>. 
Marcos said he <quote who="Marcos Dione">just want to know if I should 
implement displaymask or format mask. and what will be the use in thew 
future.</quote> James thought <quote who="James Thompson">there is
already work done on format masks, it's already in the code base but not 
in use IIRC</quote>. Marcos raised another question: 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">ok, let's do the question in a better way (I 
hope): what are display, input and format mask for? Especially, the
difference between display and format? Input seems rather clear.</quote> 
James noted that his answer came only from memory: 
<quote who="James Thompson">fields can display differently when you edit 
them vs when you're not in them. The best place to see this is in a date 
field, as IIRC it's the furthest along. When you enter the field, 
2003/01/06 may be displayed for editing. When you exit it may flip to 
read "Monday, Jan. 6th 2003". I _think_ display is non editing and format 
is editing, but again, I'm not sure.</quote> Marcos replied - 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">it sounds to me, but I may be wrong, that display 
is for showing (Mon, Jan 6th 2003), input for input (2003/01/06), and format 
for internal representation (20030106)</quote> and James, on the whole, agreed: 
<quote who="James Thompson">that could very well be. I think that 2 of the 3 
are in use and the 3rd one is pending proper setup of the format definition. 
The best source of info on this would be jason.</quote> Mike Vincent 
(Vee2d2) noted that <quote who="Mike Vincent">there's a bit of information 
in the forms dev guide (.5) pg 24.. but the only thing documented is 
datetime.</quote></p>

<p>Later, Marcos caught Jason Cater (jcater) and he answered immediately: 
masks <quote who="Jason Cater">don't work. That's part of
0.5</quote>. However, Marcos was also interested <quote who="Marcos Dione">what 
are they exactly for. I mean, de dev-guide talks about display and input masks, 
what is format for?</quote> Jason was still wondering if GNUe needed the 
"format" mask. <quote who="Jason Cater">Input mask --&gt; when field is in input 
mode, the mask used to validated/let the user enter the value, display mask 
--&gt; how the field is displayed when user is not editing it, format mask 
--&gt; (if there's a need) how the field is actually stored in the 
database</quote>.</p>
