<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) enquired <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">is it possible 
to do something like colspan in reports?</quote> (in general, in native xml 
report format). James Thompson (jamest) offered using 
<quote who="James Thompson">simple tabulation, just put in empty column defs
&lt;out:col/&gt;</quote>. Dmitry was trying <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">to do 
simple text output that fit with 80 chars screen to be send by
email. It'd be great to split one output db row on two rows in report ans span 
wide cells if needed</quote>. James thought that 
<quote who="James Thompson">with a little effort you might be able to get a trigger to 
do it, but the trigger support in reports is functional bu not complete. I would 
think some type of post-change trigger on a field that split the data and stored 
in 2 non-bound fields would do it</quote>. Dmitry asked 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">how to reach different report objects from report 
trigger</quote>? James said that <quote who="James Thompson">they should be able 
to be referenced by name <code>report.fieldName</code></quote>. There were no examples 
on this as of time of writing, because it seems that no one had used triggers in 
reports. James expected to write an example sometime later the same week.</p>
