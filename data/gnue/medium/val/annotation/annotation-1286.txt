<topic>Reports</topic>

<p>James Thompson (jamest) spoke about a practical use of GNUe Reports
from his own organisation -  <quote who="James Thompson">i took 
some sample code jason wrote for Oracle Reports/zope/php and reworked 
using GNUe Reports/Zope(with ZShellScripts).
It takes an RTF template of an invoice, merges it against data in the 
rdbms,  and pumps out a pdf file via a web site so customers can lookup 
past invoices. what's cool is if the people this is for use it for 
initialy printing their snail mail invoices then they will be the exact 
same as the pdf</quote>.</p>
