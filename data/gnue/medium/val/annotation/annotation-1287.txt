<p>Dan Bethe (dtm) reported a possible lead for someone looking 
<quote who="Dan Bethe">to move to Bayonne on a totally shoestring budget.  
probably can't even afford new hardware, still using ISA phone cards 
;)</quote>. Bayonne now had a demo mode that could run on an ordinary 
sound card <quote who="Dan Bethe">so you can test your bayonne 
apps</quote>. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) suggested 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">do you call up custumers and yell, 
"show me the money!!!" - cause that would be the cool way to collect 
on accounts payable ;)</quote>. Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) asked 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">what will be lost in that "testing" mode - 
/me owns a coulpe of sound cards and a heap of old soldering parts 
too</quote>. Dan said <quote who="Dan Bethe">it can't make 
phone calls obviously - you can just listen, and the software will 
function. as it can be very expensive or difficult to test on live 
equipment like a T1</quote>. Dmitry felt that might not necessarily 
be the case - <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">we have to find one 2400 
modem to make a phone call</quote>. Dan confirmed that, for a basic 
but useful Bayonne installation, <quote who="Dan Bethe">your 2400 bps 
modem can be your call center</quote> - as long as it could 
<quote who="Dan Bethe">do voice ;)</quote>. John Lenton (Chipaca) 
asked <quote who="John Lenton">what exactly can bayonne do? is it 
just a call center thing? or is it anything else?</quote> Dan 
pointed to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bayonne/bayonne.html">the 
website</a>, suggesting <quote who="Dan Bethe">go ahead and take a 
look - it's the best IVR on the planet! Think of it as the apache of 
telephony - takes virtually any type of telephony device and turns it 
into a call center, an IVR, voicemail server, etc</quote>. John asked 
whether <quote who="John Lenton">IVR is an interactive voice 
racoon?</quote> After a series of various racoon jokes, Dan explained 
<quote who="Dan Bethe">IVR == interactive voice response - i.e. a menu 
with prompts and often voicemail - "thank you for calling XXX.  press 
1 for sales, 2 for collections, and 3 to troutslap chilly"</quote>. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) urged everyone to 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">pick 3! pick 3!</quote>.</p>
