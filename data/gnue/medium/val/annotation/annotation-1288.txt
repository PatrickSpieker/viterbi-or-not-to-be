<p>Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) announced that the 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">new Appserver API is fully implemented - 
we now need - * somebody who makes the RPC around this work - * a 
dbdriver for forms that uses the new api</quote>. Actually, 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">it means that most of the api calls in 
usual cases have a result that is very close to what it should be 
;-) - but it should be enough to build upon</quote>.</p>
