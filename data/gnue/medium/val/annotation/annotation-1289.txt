<p>Anthony Lenton (aa_) queried an entry in the XML DTD for GNUe Forms, which 
did not seem to work when he tried it. He was using the latest CVS version. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">in cvs, the gfd format is 
changing somewhat - I guess the DTD needs to be regenerated</quote>. He 
explained <quote who="Jason Cater">we have moved the layout management to use a 
separate namespace - this is so we can migrate to supporting multiple layout 
mechanisms w/in the same form i.e., absolute positioning, grid layout, gridbag, 
etc. I think the "creating your first form" chapter in that pdf shows this - 
but because the layout stuff (x,y,width, height) is now in a separate 
namespace a separate dtd would be needed</quote>.</p>

<p>Anthony read the Developers' Guide, with details of the new format, and 
typed in the sample, which he could not get to work. 
<quote who="Anthony Lenton">It exits with ' Entry references non-existent 
field 'zipcode' I set up the db as is suggested.  The field really honestly 
does exist</quote>. Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) suggested 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">start with more simple example that does not 
require db</quote>. Anthony <quote who="Anthony Lenton">tried to remove all 
entries from the same example. It exited with 'There are no navigable widgets 
in this form.  Unable to display.</quote> Later, Derek Neighbors (revDeke) 
confirmed this error message was as expected - a form had to have at least 
one entry field, but not necessarily tied to a database. John Lenton (Chipaca) 
confirmed that Anthony's connections.conf settings were correct, 
<quote who="John Lenton">and with --debug-level it says it's reading the right 
connections.conf</quote>.</p>

<p>Dmitry suggested <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">if desingner is not broken 
you can easily build a simple form with wizard - and wizard will allow you 
explore your conncetions.conf file (choose datasource or db) and db tables 
when choosing particular columns</quote>. Anthony reported that the 
Designer seemed to work fine, but the Run-Form menu option from within 
Designer bombed out. Dmitry suggested saving the form, and running it 
from GNUe Forms directly. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">have you 
confirmed that forms works at all? If not, please run samples/intro/intro.gfd 
first to confirm that it functions properly - if it does then lets get a 
database form working</quote>. Anthony confirmed that 
<quote who="Anthony Lenton">ok! intro.gfd works fine - i'll take a look at 
how that works and move on from there</quote>. Derek explained that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">there is a HUGE jump from non datasource to 
datasource forms - and fortunately or unfortunately a lot can go wrong with 
datasource forms that have NOTHING to do with gnue - i.e. database or database 
driver misconfiguration - so we like to use a dataless form to get a 'quick' 
view of whether forms itself is working</quote>.</p>
