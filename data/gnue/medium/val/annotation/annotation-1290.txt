<topic>Forms</topic>


<mention>Calum Morrell</mention>

<p>Scott Lamb reported <quote who="Scott Lamb">Logging into to 
PostgreSQL from GNUe Designer 0.1.1 on win32 does not work
well for me.</quote> It was using his Windows login to try to 
log into the database server, instead of the database user 
name he had given it. Derek Neighbors reported 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">It is fixed in CVS. You can grab a 
snapshot from <a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/">
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/</a>. I believe we plan 
on releasing a 0.1.2 soon because of this very bug.</quote></p>

<p>Later, <a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.01Feb2002">
on IRC</a>, Derek Neighbors (derek) asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
slamb: you get things working?</quote>
Scott (slamb) confirmed <quote who="Scott Lamb">yeah, it logs in fine now with 
the 29 Jan 2002 snapshot :)</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) 
confessed <quote who="James Thompson">we can't blame the pypgsql 
driver as derek stated - it was my bug in our pypgsql interface
</quote>. He added that there was still a bug with editing properties -
<quote who="James Thompson">if you have a scrollbar on the property 
editor then you can't edit anything</quote> He said 
<quote who="James Thompson">i was under the impression this was a 
wxwin bug - but I noticed on Fri that the wxpython demo doesn't suffer 
from this - i hope to look at it in the very near future</quote>.</p>

<p>Scott asked <quote who="Scott Lamb">how are those win32 builds made, 
anyway?</quote>. James said <quote who="James Thompson"> you do a 
complete install of all dependencies on windows - add pypgsql, mysql, 
and pywin - then run it thru mcmillian installer version 4.x - then 
use inno to package it up</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Scott reported <quote who="Scott Lamb">
made new form, querying doesn't show anything. It adds new stuff fine, 
though.</quote> It turned out that the keyboard shortcuts for 
enter/execute query (f8/f9) were still working but <quote who="Scott Lamb">
the menu entries just don't do anything.</quote>. James and Calum 
Morrell (drochaid) said they hadn't noticed this before because 
they always used the keyboard shortcuts. James said 
<quote who="James Thompson">i imagine that the event system changed 
and the menu/toolbar entries didn't</quote>.</p>
