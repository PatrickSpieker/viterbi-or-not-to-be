<p>Further to 
<kcref startdate="22 Nov 2001 22:50:40 -0800" subject="[gnue-geas] Freedom of the ODMG Spec">Issue 5, Section 2</kcref>,
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) reported that 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">my ODMG book came in the mail today - 
"The Object Data Standard: OMDG 3.0"</quote>. Andrew 
Mitchell (ajmitch) asked <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">what are your 
GEAS plans now?</quote> Daniel said he wasn't sure - 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">I have some material to digest first - 
but this ODMG book should help things a bit</quote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.04Feb2002">
Several days later</a>, Daniel Baumann confirmed he was still working 
through the ODMG book, <quote who="Daniel Baumann">making notes on all 
the goodies in my book, which I plan to make available to some interested
GNUe hackers....ummm within limits of copyright ;)</quote> Several people
tried to guess what ODMG stood for, with varying degrees of obscenity. 
Daniel explained he was <quote who="Daniel Baumann">reading about 
metadata and the ODL Schema repository - in hopes of making a GEAS that 
doesn't suck</quote>, but felt <quote who="Daniel Baumann">the ODMG 
metadata stuff is confusing</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">
what d'ya expect with objects? something simple????</quote>. Daniel 
rretorted <quote who="Daniel Baumann">plz - objects rock - it's not that 
complicated  - I dun figured it out</quote>. The intention was to avoid  
having to design an object framework for GEAS from scratch, 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">but just write a Free implementation</quote>
of an existing standard. He thought that the <quote who="Daniel Baumann">
fun part will be converting all those gcds and doing a proper design 
there ;P</quote>. Jason commented that <quote who="Jason Cater">I don't 
want to be around when you tell reinhard his gcd lexer is shit</quote>. 
Daniel said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">it's not - the lexer will 
provide a good base - what it parses things into might change though - 
we need some real objects - not hacked up andrewm C structs 
;P</quote>.</p>

<p>He said that using ODMG would allow you to 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">define schema to store the objects and then 
you put that schema in the tables of the relational db - you want to add 
a new object you just add to the "repository"</quote>. This 
meant you could <quote who="Daniel Baumann">write it once and forget 
about the damn db and just use objects</quote>. This would take longer 
to design, <quote who="Daniel Baumann">but not if you just use an already
made standard ;)</quote>. He noted <quote who="Daniel Baumann">ODMG is 
pretty language neutral, you even do python bindings if you wanted to
</quote></p>
