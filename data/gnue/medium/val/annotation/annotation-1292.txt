<topic>Navigator</topic>


<p>Following on from  
<kcref startdate="08 Jan 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="Menus for GNUe Forms" />
and 
<kcref startdate="13 Jan 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="Testing GNUe Navigator" />,
James Thompson (jamest_) said <quote who="James Thompson">
i need custom menus soon (before the 15th of this month :( )</quote>.
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked <quote who="Daniel Baumann">
has anyone looked at the XForms  standard?</quote>. James said 
<quote who="James Thompson">long ago - it didn't (at that time) fit
forms target - and IIRC was pretty complex</quote>. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i need menus too :)
</quote>. He said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">navigator is neat 
and all - but it wont work for production stuff imho</quote>. He 
added <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think the basis is right - its
a matter of reading that file into a gfd as a menu - not a separate 
thing that hangs off the side</quote>. What he would like 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">is gpd file loaded into existing menu
</quote> at start-up. You could then decide whether to 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">a. only have one form in the framework
open at a time - b. allow multiple to be open - c. allow multiples 
but contain them like an MDI app all within the 'container'</quote>.
He felt <quote who="Derek Neighbors">a or c make most sense - and a 
is probably easies to do right away and would perform more like 
traditional app andd make easiest for 'curses' or other limited 
UI's</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Jason Cater (jcater) said he disagreed - having multiple 
forms open was equally valid. He said <quote who="Jason Cater">
I'd prefer to see 'Submenu items' that are attached to 'triggers'
and leave navigator as a separate tool</quote>, the way that Oracle
and SAP did it. James explained <quote who="James Thompson">
what I was wanting to do in menu system - GMenu's make a tree - they
have things like Text, HotKey, Trigger - so that all menu items 
fire triggers and that these triggers have default names so that 
a form could overwrite the std trigger with a custom one</quote>. 
For menu placement, menu tags in the XML needed to place themselves 
in the normal drop-down menus - <quote who="James Thompson">find 
File.Save and put me after it</quote>. Because 
<quote who="James Thompson">GMenu would be based upon GObj</quote> 
then <quote who="James Thompson">the entire default system menu and 
form customizations would be exposed to the trigger system</quote>.
He added <quote who="James Thompson">my initial thoughts are to put 
this in common - so that eventually any gnue app could define it's 
menus this way</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason asked <quote who="Jason Cater">did you see the pic of 
<a href="http://help.sap.com/saphelp_46c/helpdata/en/49/2dfe88088b11d396a9006094b9867b/content.htm">
SAP Easy Access</a> screenshot someone posted? that's what I'd like 
to have ;)</quote>. James noted <quote who="James Thompson">I'm 
pretty sure that I don't want a toolbar entry that isn't on the 
menu so I think the toolbar system should just contain links to 
menu entries</quote> Menu items could <quote who="James Thompson">
have a toolbarPosition and toolbarIcon attribute that if filled add 
to the toolbar</quote>. This would mean that 
<quote who="James Thompson">all toolbar entries must be on the menu,
they can't exist without a menu pick</quote>. Jason agreed - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">imho a mouse is 'always' optional 
equipment :)</quote>. James asked <quote who="James Thompson">
should we include the toolbar def as part of the menu def - or have 
a completely seperate GToolBar that sits seperate but acts to only 
"fire" the menu picks</quote>. Jason preferred the option 
<quote who="Jason Cater">that would also allow us to provide 
"custom" toolbars</quote> if that was desirable. James 
gave some examples to clarify what he meant.</p>

<p>Derek (derek) returned, and noted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
the sap thing is ok, if the current navigator was cleaned up to 
that kind of polish it might be pretty cool</quote>. He felt 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we will need ability to load gpd's as 
menus directly into the 'framework' - but i see value in a 'pretty'
navigator as well</quote>. In his view, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">navigator is hard to navigate for 
complex menus :)</quote> - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i.e. unless 
you know exactly where things are under the current navigator they 
are hard to find</quote>, although <quote who="Derek Neighbors"> 
the current navigator is perfect for curses world almost 
untouched :)</quote>.</p>
