Jens M&#252;ller noted the reference to storing infomation from previous
employers in the Human Resources module, and feared this might 
breech <quote who="Jens M&#252;ller">European privacy laws</quote>.

<quote who="Derek Neighbors">I was not saying GNUe would or wouldn't 
have this functionality, I was merely asking for the specification 
submitted to be more clearly defined in this area.  I am not of a Human

information on prior job history on an employee other than hand jotted 
down notes from reference checking or letters from past employers
