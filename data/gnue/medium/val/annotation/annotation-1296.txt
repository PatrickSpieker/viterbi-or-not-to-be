<p>It was asked whether there were any applications currently using 
the GNUe Tools. Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">
yes, but inhouse stuff</quote>, as discussed previously in
<kcref startdate="28 Jan 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="Building non-free apps with GNUe" />. 
Derek Neighbors explained they were <quote who="Derek Neighbors">not 
availalbe under gpl :) i.e. custom solutions</quote>. Jason explained 
<quote who="Jason Cater">gpl covers redistribution and inhouse solutions 
typically aren't redistributed</quote>. There would be no advantedge to 
using the GNU Public License (GPL) <quote who="Jason Cater">if its an 
app written around a single business' idiosyncracies</quote>. He noted 
<quote who="Jason Cater">unfortunately, aside from our samples/ 
directory, all the real-world uses of forms right now are in-house stuff
</quote>. However, <quote who="Jason Cater">early adopters are a GOOD 
thing :)</quote>.</p>

<p>Calum Morrell (drochaid) said that some companies might be afraid that
releasing customised GNUe applications under GPL might 
<quote who="Calum Morrell">allow your competitors to see how you do it 
and potentially modify there own system with some improvements gained 
from knowledge of yours</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">
I imagine its not as secret as most companies would like to think ;)
</quote> Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i see most people will 
take the 'base' then extend and not give back - which is fine, though 
over time i think they will realize the computer system is only a small 
advantage</quote>.</p>

<p>Jens M&#252;ller (ICJ) said <quote who="Jens M&#252;ller">what is really 
important are different tax laws in diff. countries - they have an heavy 
impact on accounting</quote>. Derek agreed, saying 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i see us 'templating' things by region/
location to handle tax specifics and such</quote>, as previously 
discussed in 
<kcref startdate="02 Dec 2001 06:19:08 -0800" title="GNUe Human Resources (HR) proposal" />
and 
<kcref startdate="20 Dec 2001 00:00:00 -0800" title="GNUe Templates for Applications" />.
He wanted to avoid having a system with a large number of tables, most 
of which were irrelevent for most users. <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
But rather you get a small base then 'apply' things based on 'country, 
tax laws, etc etc etc)</quote>. Jens said that would be fine, as long as 
there was good package management. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">you might have apt-get gnue-accounting, 
apt-get gnue-accounting-austrian-tax, apt-get 
gnue-accounting-euro-conversions or soemthing - only wont be apt-get - 
probably gnue-get or something similar</quote>.</p>
