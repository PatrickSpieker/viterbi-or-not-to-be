<p>Stuart Lamb reported a bug - <quote who="Stuart Lamb">
When a commit fails (a referential integrity violation), it pops up a 
dialog box as expected. But apparently doesn't tell the database server 
to rollback - because anything in the future (whether I hit "commit
" or "rollback" next, says this - libpq.Warning: NOTICE:  
current transaction is aborted, queries ignored until end of transaction 
block - and that transaction block never ends</quote>. This was with 
<quote who="Stuart Lamb">pypgsql</quote>. 
James Thompson (jamest) tested this, and confirmed that it could cope 
and recover from an attempt to duplicate a primary key, but not from a 
referential integrity error (i.e. a missing foreign key), despite the 
fact that <quote who="James Thompson">they call the exact same error 
routines on our end</quote>.</p>
