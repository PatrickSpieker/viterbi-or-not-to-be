<topic>Forms</topic>


<p>Jan Ischebeck (jan) confirmed he had <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">
continued the php client</quote> referred to in 
<kcref startdate="30 Jan 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="PHP client for GNUe Forms" />.
It could now do a <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">simple query on an 
database, input data into cache, marking as deleted, 
adding new rows, an About box, and ... some bugs ;-)</quote>
James Thompson (jamest) said he had made some changes to the main 
Forms client this week, and <quote who="James Thompson">
we need to coord better so we don't break stuff on you</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Jan confimed he had put a fairly limited sample 
<a href="http://131.220.92.80/~jan/gfc.php">on the web</a> - not 
all functionality was working yet. Jason Cater (jcater) noted that it 
didn't work at all with the Konq web browser, but did with 
<quote who="Jason Cater">mozilla</quote>. 
Jan said he had tested it with Mozilla, but <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">
I m no MASTER OF THE JAVASCRIPT</quote> so it might not work with all 
browsers. He asked <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">if anybody knows how to 
submit a form with an image button, ... and tell the server that it is
submit button no. 1 and not submit button no. 2, in a way IE, konq, 
netscape 4.x and mozilla understand,... please tell me.</quote>. 
Michael Dean (mdean) offered to help. Jan was trying 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">to catch an key event like "page 
down", but it dont work. - Just "ALT-P" and 
"ALT-N" are working now.</quote> Michael noted that 
<quote who="Michael Dean">key events aren't available for all keys :-(
</quote>. He later confirmed <quote who="Michael Dean">as of IE 5.0, 
you can catch pg dn/up for onkeydown and onkeyup, but not onkeypress -
if you're just wanting to catch when the press a key, you should use 
onkeyup - onkeydown will fire constantly while they hold the key down
</quote>.</p>

<p>Scott Lamb (slamb) thought <quote who="Scott Lamb">It may not be necessary 
to use javascript to do your graphical submit buttons. I'm looking at 
W3C spec. You can have multiple submit buttons and you can have 
graphical ones. It says "If a form contains more than one submit 
button, only the activated submit button is successful." Which I 
think means only its values are submitted, so you can know which was 
clicked. Give me a second and I'll actually try it.</quote> Michael 
agreed, but said <quote who="Michael Dean">if you need to change form 
data or the action based on which button, you probably need</quote>
Javascript.</p>

<p>Jan felt he could now write javascript that would work on most 
browsers, <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">Just lynx and links won't work...
</quote>. Scott didn't feel this was too serious, but asked 
<quote who="Scott Lamb">actually, what is it about lynx that makes it not 
work? I'm curious now.</quote>. Jan confirmed that, 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">Although not working, lynx is not too bad
</quote>. It degraded to <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">
[tb_save.png]-Submit [tb_new.png]-Submit ...</quote> so at least 
you had some idea of what was happening. Scott suggested putting in 
<quote who="Scott Lamb">alt="" attributes</quote> for the images 
to improve this, which would also <quote who="Scott Lamb">
give tooltip hints on graphical browsers</quote>.
However, Jan expected that <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">lynx doesnt 
like to send x,y arguments for an image he cannot display...... so if 
you can click on the image in lynx</quote> it wouldn't work. Scott 
confirmed by testing that <quote who="Scott Lamb">lynx is giving me .x 
and .y values of 0 on image submit</quote>.</p>

<p>He noted that lynx didn't like the encoding type in the web page 
header - the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.3">
W3</a> standard, which it complied with, required something different.
Jan said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">Thanks, i will never trust any 
SELF written HTML course anymore.</quote>. Scott agreed - 
<quote who="Scott Lamb">yeah, most of the info on the web about html is 
pretty misleading. why I just go to the official W3 specs</quote>? 
Jan said he had loooked at them for something some time ago, 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">and it was a little bit confusing, so I 
didnt use it. But looking on the HTML 4.0 spec. ... GREAT. I ve never 
heard about LABELS in forms etc.</quote>. Scott agreed, but noted 
<quote who="Scott Lamb">small catch, though: several of the things on the 
W3 specs aren't really done by any browser.</quote>. Michael reckoned 
<quote who="Michael Dean">html form labels rock - don't make 
checkboxes or radio buttons without 'em ;-)</quote>.</p>

<p>Jan asked for ideas <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">about the rest of 
the UI</quote>. He explained <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">In the 
beginning I had planned to make just the actual row in the actual 
block editable and now everything visible is editable. What do you 
think is better?</quote>. Scott thought that <quote who="Scott Lamb">
minimizing the number of times you have to submit/wait for the server 
to respond would be good - so from that perspective, the way you have 
it now is much better</quote>. Jan agreed, but asked about cursors - 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">Without cursor, how do I know which row to 
delete (if i don't use javascript)</quote>? Scott thought 
<quote who="Scott Lamb">how you have it now is probably the best you 
can do. No way you can know that w/o JS, so it'll always be a bit 
confusing to newbies. I like the way you highlight the deleted row in 
red. Actually, you could have a seperate delete button for each 
row. but that would require a change to the form definition.
