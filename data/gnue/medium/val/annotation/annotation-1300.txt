<p>Jason Cater (asked) <quote who="Jason Cater">can you think of some 
polls for our homepage? the current one is a little outdated</quote>
He suggested <quote who="Jason Cater">some object vs relational vs 
flatfile database usage poll? or, what is your preferred DB backend?
</quote> Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) liked the sound of this last one, 
and gave a list of possible answers. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I would qualify that with "for your 
business processes" or "business data", etc - as a 
backend for a dynamic website is irrelevent to us, imho</quote>. Derek
wondered if the question should be which database 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">do you PLAN to use with gnue</quote>.
Jason also wondered <quote who="Jason Cater">if we should do a 
"business size" poll to get a feel for the class of 
enterprises mostly viewing our web page</quote>. Calum Morrell 
(drochaid) gave some immediate answers for all the proposed questions, 
and asked <quote who="Calum Morrell">do I win a prize?</quote>. 
Jason said the prize was <quote who="Jason Cater">4 days/3 nights in 
the beautiful #gnuenterprise - (does not include travel or food)
</quote>. However, Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
it DOES include - free insults, complimentary fish slappings of 
you CHOICE, poor and crude jokes</quote>.</p>
