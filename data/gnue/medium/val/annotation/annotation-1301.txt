<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<mention>Scott Lamb</mention>

<p>David Sugar said he <quote who="David Sugar">originally 
had offered to help with a gnue presentation at 
eGovOS this year</quote>, as previously discussed in 
<kcref subject="Another opportunity to publicize GNUe" title="GNUe and Bayonne at eGovernment Conference?" />. But 
<quote who="David Sugar">For a number of reasons, and contrary to previous 
plans, after reviewing the circumstances of the eGovOS event, I have chosen 
this afternoon not to attend this year's eGovOS conference in mid-march after 
all.</quote> Derek Neighbors agreed <quote who="Derek Neighbors">that 
the event should be boycotted by GNUe and anyone else
that is sick of seeing Free Software slowly being eroded into "Open
Source" software and further watered down</quote>,  
with Microsoft being invited to talk about their "Shared Source" initiative
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">that negates the whole purpose of being of 
Free Software to begin with.</quote></p>

<p>Scott Lambert said <quote who="Scott Lambert">Boycotting gains you, 
and your cause, nothing.  They probably won't notice that you didn't 
show up.  Showing up and talking to people might help get people's 
attention.</quote> Ruben Safir said <quote who="Ruben Safir">It 
should be boycotted if your presenting Microsoft as a 'Open Souce' 
contributor</quote>. Jay Sulzberger replied <quote who="Jay Sulzberger">No. 
Let us go and show our better stuff and point out to everyone the
gross lies of Microsoft.</quote> Richard Stallman said 
<quote who="Richard Stallman">It is important to go to the event to correct 
the falsehoods, but at the same time we must also cast doubt on the 
legitimacy of the event</quote>, adding <quote who="Richard Stallman">The 
tendency for events that pretend to be part of our community to
betray its spirit is very harmful, and we have to push back against
it.</quote></p>

<p>Jay said he still felt attending was the best way to spread the message 
that <quote who="Jay Sulzberger">Microsoft being at this conference is a 
fraud.  It is a fraud on all those who do not yet understand free 
software.</quote> David suggested <quote who="David Sugar">thinking about 
what our goal really should be, and after that, then seeing if 
and how best we can achieve that goal.  Is our goal to have Microsoft removed 
from the venue?  Is it to have an effective platform and representation of 
our views at the conference to correct any mis-information they are 
permitting Microsoft to portray?  Is it something else?</quote> 
Richard said he thought the invitation to Microsoft and the lack of 
prominance to "free software" advocates (as opposed to "open source" 
speakers) was deliberate policy on the part of the conference organisers.
He was willing to meet them in person to discuss this if this would help.</p>

<p>Stan Klein said <quote who="Stan Klein">Are 
you suggesting that in order for the conference to be legitimate a
university and a conference committee that includes several government
employees should deny a speaker from Microsoft the right to present the
Microsoft position in debate before an audience almost guaranteed to be
packed with active competitors and adversaries of Microsoft?</quote>
He added <quote who="Stan Klein">I view the eGovOS conference as 
a positive move to help block Microsoft from what they are trying to do 
and to advance our cause within government</quote> as 
<quote who="Stan Klein">by the end of the session in which the Microsoft 
speaker appears, I expect it to be abundantly clear to every attendee that 
"shared source" is lipstick on a pig.</quote></p> 

<p>Ruben disagreed - <quote who="Ruben Safir">experience with
the Open Office.org mailing list, and my groups door knocking and 2 large
scale business demos clearly shows that the public will buy this line of 
reasoning without any trouble...</quote> David said the issue for him 
was not so much <quote who="David Sugar">Microsoft's participation in 
events, but in their deliberate attempt to mis-represent themselves and 
"shared source" as a legitimate form of "open source" somehow related 
to/an extension of  Free and Open Source software licensing.</quote></p>

<p>Stan said it was important to control the political agenda - by allowing 
Microsoft to participate, the focus could be on getting press for the 
clear difference between Free Software and Open Source on the one hand 
and Microsoft's "Shared Source" initiative on the other.
<quote who="Stan Klein">We don't want the headlines to be "Academic 
freedom is OK for controversial racists but not for Microsoft,"</quote>.
But Jean-Michael Poure felt that <quote who="Jean-Michael Poure">The 
simple fact that Microsoft speaks at an open-source meeting is a 
large victory for them.</quote> Richard Stallman did not see why 
<quote who="Richard Stallman">free software events must offer a platform 
to a convicted corporate felon.</quote></p>

<p>Stan pointed out that <quote who="Stan Klein">The entire list of 
speakers is available at
<a href="http://www.egovos.org/march-2003/agenda.html">
http://www.egovos.org/march-2003/agenda.html</a></quote> - 
Microsoft were in the same category - Corporate Open Source 
Perspectives Track - as speakers from RedHat, IBM, Sun, Dell and 
Oracle. He said <quote who="Stan Klein">If FSF wants to sponsor an event, 
it can be done as a pure advocacy event with no opposing views</quote> 
but <quote who="Stan Klein">Universities don't do pure advocacy
events.</quote></p>
