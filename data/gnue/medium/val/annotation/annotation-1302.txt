<p>Keith Jagrs (Keith_jgrs) asked whether GNUe Reports was better than 
Reportlab (library for PDF reports, 
http://www.reportlab.com/toolkit/index.html). Jeff Bailey (jbailey) 
thought <quote who="Jeff Bailey">probably not.</quote> 
James Thompson (jamest) was more enthusiastic about this - 
<quote who="James Thompson">GNUe Reports is better than 
everything</quote>! Jason Cater (jcater) also expressed his opinion 
- <quote who="Jason Cater">reportlab is a PDF library mostly, not real 
reporting application. It is the pdf library for their non-free 
reporting tool.</quote> GNUe reports at least initially would use that 
pdf library. He said that <quote who="Jason Cater">the reportlab pdf 
toolkit is free, the reportlab reporting tool is not, but the pdf 
toolkit is very good, from what I gather</quote>. Jeff offered using 
libgnomeprint in case reportlab pdf usage failed, but James noted that 
<quote who="James Thompson">libgnomeprint requires gnome libs</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason's first goal would be <quote who="Jason Cater">to output very 
robust postscript - from there many things could be generated via 3rd 
party stuff</quote>. To output reports in MS Word or MS Excel, or RTF 
- <quote who="Jason Cater">the way reports is structured, there's no 
reason we can't have a "gnomeprint" printer driver</quote>. Later 
Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">jcater 
/ jamest i agree 100% at this time libgnomeprint is not path of least 
resistance, .ps file is probably best bet and looking at reportlab 
might be a good thing a bit later</quote>.</p>
