<p>Arjen Runsink (Suit) asked: <quote who="Arjen Runsink">about app 
server, web site states: "user-defineable business objects". Is that 
user as in user or user as in "not core gnue developer"</quote>? 
Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) explained - 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">user as in everybody who wants 
to ;)</quote>, <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">much like not 
every secretary does set up excel macros but it's a "user" 
thing</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) was interested whether there 
had been any progress <quote who="Jason Cater">on what the 
actual business object "definitions" are going to look like?</quote> 
Reinhard said it had been decided 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">to have those "definitions" in 
the database for various reasons</quote>. Jason asked: 
<quote who="Jason Cater">is a scema in place for those?</quote> 
And Reinhard's answered he was working on it - 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">currently i'm planning to have 
it quite simple in the start and to grow it as we see what we 
need</quote>, but as Jan Ischebeck (siesel) had not been online 
for some time, Reinhard was lacking constructive contradiction.</p>

<p>Arjen inquired how to see these objects - are they SQL 
statements or code. Reinhard suggested to think 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">of a simple database table, 
then add some "calculated fields" that are accessible as if 
they were stored in the database but calculated by a given 
formula, then further add some "methods", that is code to 
operate on the data. The combination of those 3</quote> was 
a "business object" in GNUe terminology. John Lenton (Chipaca) 
asked whether business objects could be purely virtual (something 
like a view) and reinhard had to admit - 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">we aren't sure yet how 
exactly to do it - we want different "views" on the same 
objects depending on permissions</quote>.</p>
