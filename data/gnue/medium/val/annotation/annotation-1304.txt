<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>It was asked where it was possible to get examples - needed examples 
were any with multirows form for a mysql table. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) 
offered looking in the source and cvs for multirow forms - in designer 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">in the block properties, there's a 'rows' 
attribute</quote>. It was documented in forms developer's guide (for 
forms-0.4.x at 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/docs/forms-0.4.x/Developers-Guide.html">
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/docs/forms-0.4.x/Developers-Guide.html</a>). 
Also a question arose whether it was possible to run gtk2 interface for form in 
debian sid. Andrew confirmed that, however <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">it needs 
some work - it's not enabled in the debian packages</quote>. It was noted 
that copy/paste (select &amp; middle click) did not work - trying to paste text 
from another row seemed to work initially, but it then disappeared when moving 
off (whether by clicking or using the tab key). Andrew couldn't recall whether 
this has been reported as a bug or not and advised sending an email to 
<a href="mailto:forms-support@gnuenterprise.org">forms-support@gnuenterprise.org</a> 
with all technical details.</p>
