<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>
<topic>DCL</topic>

<p>Keith (kac) asked where he could find any user docs and Mike 
Vincent (Vee2d2) suggested asking questions directly, because 
<quote who="Mike Vincent">there's almost always at least someone 
lurking so it's usually best to just state your questions or 
comments.. if not some people read the logs and may answer later 
on</quote>. Keith said he would have liked to try GNUe on RedHat, 
so Mike answered - <quote who="Mike Vincent">if you were to grab 
the tarballs there should be sample directories contained within 
with some example forms and such to play with.. I would imagine 
they would be installed somewhere by the RPM, in debian they'd 
probably end up somewhere in /usr/share/doc/gnue*/examples. The 
forms will have extension of .gfd and you can run them with the 
forms client, gnue-forms.. some of the examples may require a db, 
though I'm not completely sure of that.</quote> After some small 
problems (like installing mxDateTime), Keith 
<quote who="kac">tried the helloworld sample "gnue-forms 
helloworld2.gfd" and i got a screen asking for name &amp; 
address</quote>. Keith did not find any GUI stuff and Mike 
listed all available GUIs: <quote who="Mike Vincent">right now, 
I think there's a text client, and gui client done with wxpython, 
a gtk2 client is in the works but I havent seen it, and I think a 
native windows client is also in the works but I maybe 
mistaken..</quote></p>

<p>Mike admitted he himself was not too long with GNUe - 
<quote who="Mike Vincent">I first bumped into the project a year 
or two ago.. but was too tied up with other things to really spend 
much time, and it really looked like things were still much in 
the planning stages anyway. Recently I checked it out again and 
found they had these neat tools to play with and so I spent a 
couple days reading as much as I could (the web docs, kernel 
cousins (&lt;-real good reads), etc..) then played with the 
samples and stuf. I have a small embroidery business and have made 
a couple attempts to make systems using php, but they've ended up 
being 'clunky' and hard to maintain.. I was about half way 
through my latest attempt when I decided to redo it, in a more 
gnue friendly manner.. So before my drive crashed, I was working 
on an inventory management system.. luckily I think I was able to 
recover that work from the dead drive</quote>. This followed Keith's 
history - <quote who="Keith">I'm involved with a small but growing 
company that needs some integrated software to handle its affairs... 
and commercial apps either do too little or too much or at too much 
cost or without giving you escape routes... so I started looking 
at linux as a desktop replacement (RedHat specifically). 
Desktop-wise it's all ok ... e-mail client, which we are 
mega-dependent on is FINE with evolution ... now we lack an 
accounting package and a repair-job-logging system - and they 
need to be integrated ... and if a local coding enterprise is 
going to take forever to do it &amp; keep it for himself, it's more 
sensible to look around and use what's publically avaliable... 
or assist in changing some of that and allowing others to use 
/ reuse / contribute... The only coding environment I can seem 
to get to grips with is the Anjuta/Glade combination, but i'm 
willing to try my hand at anything if it will help...</quote> It 
was asked whether "repair job logging" system meant ticketing and 
help desk type stuff - if so, Keith should look at 
<a href="http://dcl.sf.net">http://dcl.sf.net</a>. Keith explained 
in more details - <quote who="Keith">we repair photopiers... so I 
need to log jobs, send out guys to fix, and bill clients based on 
time and parts consumed...</quote>.</p>

<p>Keith asked what to database to choose - mysql or postgresql. 
The general consensus was for postgresql - Dan Bethe (ddttmm)
said the main GNUe <quote who="Dan Bethe">prefer it and hence 
it has less potential issues, and because mysql is known for data 
corruption under high volume concurrent writes - either mysql 
itself, or the way people tend to use it</quote>. 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) felt that <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">mysql 
is essentially a glorified SQL wrapper around a filesystem</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Keith asked for a brief integration of dcl and gnue. 
Jason Cater (jcater) offered a really short description - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I can do it in 3 words: "Hasn't happened 
yet". Next level up in briefness: "... but the details are being 
worked out"</quote>. Keith explained he needed dcl (in an ideal world) 
to dump billing records into an accounting system. Jason explained 
that <quote who="Jason Cater">dcl's database schema is fairly 
straight forward. I don't even think it'd be hard to get dcl to 
dump that data as a CSV file (if that was an option with your 
accounting package)</quote>. But sadly, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">gnue's accounting stuff is in the 
works... it woulnd't be usable for anyone looking for an accounting 
package to use today :(</quote>. As of time of writing, the current 
status of the financials was mainly proposals, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">but the bulk of the 
work is in getting the underlying tools in shape so I expect to 
see stuff really takeoff with actual modules soon</quote>.</p>

<p>Keith gave a short background - accounts executive for some 
years now, some experience coding using (mainly) MS Access, 
playing around with gnome/gtk/glade, fed up with commercial 
stuff &amp; looking for open-source alternatives and Jason invited 
him to <quote who="Jason Cater">stick around with us :)</quote></p>
