<p>James Thompson (jamest) asked <quote who="James Thompson">would 
people hunt me down if I broke cvs HEAD for probably about a week - 
I've got a paritial UI rerwrite completed but</quote> Jeff Bailey 
(jbailey) <quote who="James Thompson">was 
going to be starting work on the GTK ui this week - I'm debating on 
breaking cvs or just syncing tarballs with him. Breakage in this 
case means forms barely works only in wx mode, designer is 
toast</quote>. Later, Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">cvs head is meant to be broken - 
we have a stable 0.4.x - as well as a 0.5.x development somewhere.
i would say breaking head is better than tarball and synching</quote>.
James, suitably emboldened, said <quote who="James Thompson">well, 
seeing as no one has complained I'll break it tonight</quote>.</p>

<p>Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) had <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">a 
project that needs done within 2-3 weeks :)</quote> but would 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">just grab what's in cvs at the moment 
&amp; stick with that</quote> - he would be using the GTK2 user 
interface. James said this should be easier with 
<quote who="James Thompson">the new ui drivers</quote> he was 
working on - he 
suggested that Andrew look at his latest tarball. Andrew, who
had already seen it, agreed but said <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">i 
feel that i'll need something stable to work on :) - but i also 
need gtk2 drivers</quote>. James thought 
<quote who="James Thompson">well, honestly stability wize we're 
about the same I imagine - it's missing features that kills 
head</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater_) warned 
<quote who="Jason Cater">for the record, this commit will break 
designer's support of forms</quote> - <quote who="Jason Cater">as 
in, you load a form - designer will segfault</quote>.</p>

<p>Andrew was not sure what to do, as he had already done much 
work on getting the GTK2 user interface working with the stable 
releases. James suggested <quote who="James Thompson">what I 
would do is get the new drivers gtk'ized - if you have that much 
complete then you're really close to being functional now</quote> 
- and copy some of the old code across temporarily for missing 
features.</p>

<p>Later, Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) enquired 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">is 0.5.0 going to contain this ui 
rewrite?</quote> Jason said yes - <quote who="Jason Cater">0.5.0 
is shaping up to be a really major release</quote>. Peter Sullivan 
(psu) said this made sense, as <quote who="Peter Sullivan">from a 
practical point of view, "upgrade to 0.5.0, it breaks all your old 
forms" is a less attractive msg than "upgrad to 0.5.0 it breaks all your 
old forms but has radikool new UI drivers"</quote>. Andrew 
said this <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">depends if someone is 
willing to submit themselves to writing a win32 driver</quote>. 
Daniel suggested <quote who="Daniel Baumann">maybe start with kde 
first</quote>. James said <quote who="James Thompson">i've started 
a qt driver - the format changed - the ui drivers are *hopefully* 
cleaner</quote> to write for.</p>

<p>Peter suggested <quote who="Peter Sullivan">in effect, all that 
has happened is that we are skipping the planned 0.5.0</quote> release. 
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">the issue was that once we 
release 0.5.0, people expect the 0.5.x series to kind of stabilize 
(at least based on 0.4.0 experience)</quote>. Peter said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">to me, 0.4 remains stable unless &amp; 
until the</quote> GNUe core developers <quote who="Peter Sullivan">say 
otherwise</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I think we've 
been pretty good at keeping 0.4.x stable - that's the most point 
releases we've done since 0.0.x (which didn't count)</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Keith Jagrs (KeithJagr) asked <quote who="Keith Jagrs">how 
are things going</quote> with the Windows 32 native user interface 
driver? James said <quote who="James Thompson">it's still in progress - 
according to cvsweb a new ui driver model was commited 8 minutes ago - 
this does not have a win32 module yet but it will hopefully be a step 
in making one easier to create</quote>. The intention was not to 
discard the wxPython user interface toolkit - 
<quote who="James Thompson">it's still the first implementation in the 
new setup</quote>. Jason explained <quote who="Jason Cater">we'll just 
offer additional native models</quote>. Keith asked 
<quote who="Keith Jagrs">what is the porpuse of using 3 GUI builders 
at a time?</quote> James said <quote who="James Thompson">i'm doing it 
becase it will help keep the driver system more ui independent</quote> 
for Forms, although <quote who="James Thompson">designer will remain wx 
based</quote> only. He hoped to have new drivers done within the next week 
or so - <quote who="James Thompson">if the win32 widgets are not 
radically different in design I would hope it wouldn't take long at 
all</quote>.</p>
