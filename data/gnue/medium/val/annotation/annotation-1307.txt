<topic>Application Server</topic>
<topic>Designer</topic>

<p>Jason Felice volunteered to do <quote who="Jason Felice">a "request for 
proposal" for GEDI.</quote> He was <quote who="Jason Felice">not interested 
in the GEDI API itself, but I want to implement an XML schema plus utilities
for managing database schema's in sort of an object-oriented manner, but such 
work would make a pretty good foundation for a sophisticated data api.</quote>
Reinhard M&#252;ller said that the document Jason had seen was 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">nearly 2 years old and widely outdated. I feel
absolutely sorry for our incomplete and outdated documentation. It's a
pain to see how they are misleading people that look at the project.
We have talked about a webpage redesign. Maybe we should go through the
docs and remove the outdated ones - I believe that no documentation is
better than documentation that simply tells wrong stuff.</quote></p>

<p>Jason also asked <quote who="Jason Felice">are there any thoughts on 
making a database designer module for the designer?</quote> Derek 
Neighbors said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">We definitely want/plan/need to 
make a database designer module for designer.  We have an XML based markup 
for SQL table maintenance that supports 4 or 5 different DB's.</quote>
Jason asked <quote who="Jason Felice">Do we consider the database a business
object, or do we have neat hat tricks to map between the two?</quote>
Reinhard said <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">In our n-tier setup, there 
will be the "GNU Enterprise Application Server" which maps business objects 
into database tables. The person creating a module for GNUe will design 
business objects instead of database tables.</quote></p>

<p>Some days later 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.16Apr2002">
on IRC</a>, Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) asked <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">is 
there going to be a different cvs dir for the new geas, or gonna drop it in the 
existing dir?</quote> Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) suggested 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">i'll create a new directory "appserver" - 
to be consistent with "forms" "reports" etc</quote>. He wished he had 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">more GNUe time - it hurts so much to see people 
wanting to help and not even having time to put them to work</quote>.</p>
