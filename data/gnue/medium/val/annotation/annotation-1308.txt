<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">why 
two filter directories? in reports/</quote>. Jason replied 
<quote who="Jason Cater">one for your xsl files - and one for 
adapters</quote>. He explained <quote who="Jason Cater">if you 
look in adapters/filters you'll see raw and sablotron - 
/me likes pluggable stuff - even if we never use anything but 
sablotron</quote>. Derek agreed.</p>
