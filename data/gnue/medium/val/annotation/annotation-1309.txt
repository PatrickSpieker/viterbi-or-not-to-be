<p>It was asked if subforms (master/detail) were working in Forms 
under Windows. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">AFAIK master/detail is working
on all platforms</quote>. Later, Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami)
suggested <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">try master/detail form 
wizard in designer</quote>. This wasn't in the 0.1.1 
release, but <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">you can find it in 
cvs :)</quote>. Designer could be installed from CVS on Windows, as 
long as you had all the dependancies, including python - 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">dont use 2.2 - it has some bugs - 
use 2.1</quote>.</p>
