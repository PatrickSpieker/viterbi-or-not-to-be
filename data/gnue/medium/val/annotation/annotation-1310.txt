<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>It was asked where the two HTML drivers (as mentioned in 
<kcref startdate="28 Mar 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="HTML clients for GNUe" />) 
were in CVS. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">there was a java implementation of forms
but that development has stopped long ago due to lack of time</quote>. 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) noted <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">there was 
work done on a UIwebware driver, dunno what happened to it</quote>. 
Derek Neighbors (derek) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i believe 
the php implementation is in cvs - or is in process of getting there - 
~/cvs/gnue/phpforms</quote>.</p>
