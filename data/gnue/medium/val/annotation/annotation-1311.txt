<topic>Forms</topic>

<mention>ra3vat</mention>

<p>There was some discussion about how to do preselect in Forms using 
postgresql. Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) asked 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">are you able to fill the form some other 
way like manually "start query", 
"execute query"?</quote> It was confirmed this worked, so it 
was just a problem with the pre-select rather than a more general 
database connection issue. Later, Derek Neighbors (derek) confimed 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">prequery is used by doing 
prequery="" - unfortunately it is currently broken :) - 
i believe a bug is submitted against it</quote>.</p>
