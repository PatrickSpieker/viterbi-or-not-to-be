<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) reported he had sent <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">some
bugs/fix to dcl on i18n issue</quote>. He said supporting 2-byte unicode 
in the Microsoft Windows version of GNUe would not not easy, as 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">win9x doesn't support unicode</quote> - 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">but with last bugfix i'v sended, my texts in 
forms are all correct now - labels, gnue.conf msgs, input, all ok</quote> 
for 1-byte i18n. He had based this on Dmitry Sorokin's 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">old fix in 0.1.1 forms</quote>. Dmitry said that 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">i think we will not switch to unicode in one day
- i'm not ready to do my forms in utf8 right now</quote>. Bajusz confirmed 
that, for his fix, <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">encoding=xxx is needed in 
form header - and correct defautltencoding in site.py or in sitecustomize.py  
too</quote>. There was lots of good information about i18n in the 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">internationalizing topic in wxpython help</quote>.</p> 

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.16Apr2002">
Some days later</a>, Bajusz asked <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">jcater: have 
you seen my jpg-s about "collapsed" forms?</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
he had <quote who="Jason Cater">received them - but haven't had a chance to look 
yet</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">this is the 
fixed font vs non fixed font issue - we can't just move to non fixed font and it 
totally screws up some forms</quote>. There was an option in the gnue.conf file to 
force fixed width fonts for a particular installation, however. Jason said that 
the problem was that, on many systems, including Microsoft Windows 98 and 
GNU/Linux, the wxDEFAULT font <quote who="Jason Cater">falls back to non-fixed 
width fonts</quote> He added <quote who="Jason Cater">what I *really* want to do
is let the sysadmin specify exactly *what* font to use and if none is specified, 
use the wxMODERN</quote>. He had <quote who="Jason Cater">had really bad luck 
playing with wx's font system</quote>. James agreed - <quote who="James Thompson">what 
we have today is the result of lots of trial and error which has resulted in something 
that "sucks less" - less than what I'm not sure though :)</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Derek Neighbors (dnWork) asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">any chance 
specifying own fonts would fix darn ugly dropdown boxes?</quote> He said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">they are a different 'size' than the other widgets and 
the font appears different in them</quote>. James said <quote who="James Thompson">
no, own fonts won't fix problem IIRC - we had to put a fudge factor into the dropdown 
size calculations , again IIRC -  i don't recall why but I'm pretty sure it had 
something to do with my tester always running some damn themed desktop vs the default 
one I aways stick with</quote>.</p>
