<topic>Common</topic>
<topic>Application Server</topic>
<topic>Reports</topic>

<p>James Thompson (jamest) asked <quote who="James Thompson">what 
parts of gnue common should get documented first to be of 
the most use to the GEAS conversion?</quote>. Reinhard M&#252;ller 
(reinhard) suggested <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">db access - 
that's the most important imho</quote>. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think rpc 
has to be pretty high up there too - db allows geas to look at 
harvesting data - but without rpc no one can use it :)</quote>. 
But Jason Cater (jcater) noted that for Reports, he had 
got <quote who="Jason Cater">the engine working and a command 
line version of it running - so ppl can develop reports and 
see what it's gonna be like</quote>, before the client/server 
parts were fully operational. He was 
<quote who="Jason Cater">thinking the same thing could happen 
w/GEAS and Forms - that would allow ppl to start using the 
abstraction-qualities of geas - even before we get a 
solid/stable server/rpc setup</quote>. Derek was not convinced  
- <quote who="Derek Neighbors">unlike reports, geas is not 
usefull w/o client/server other than testing imho</quote>.
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">my point was to get app 
development started asap</quote>.</p>

<p>James said <quote who="James Thompson">its possible to 
figure out common by using it - so the docs aren't stopping 
anything from being developed</quote>. However, Reinhard said 
that <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">python doesn't do 
"encapsulation" - i.e. it isn't defined which routines 
are considered "public" and which ones 
"private"</quote>, which made just reading the source
code more difficult. James started documenting the GCClientApp 
to get started, <quote who="James Thompson">then I'll do DB as 
it's a bitch</quote>. He would leave RPC until last as the code 
base itself <quote who="James Thompson">is very much a work in 
progress</quote> in this area.</p>

<p>Later, James reported <quote who="James Thompson">in 
common/doc there is a common-techref.lyx file</quote>, and asked 
for feedback. Several people were having problems installing the 
software for various documentation formats, which lead on to a 
general discussion about the best format for GNUe documentation. 
Reinhard commented <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">actually it's not 
funny - but at least it's amusing - that there are less 
dependencies to run gnuef than to read it's docs :)</quote>.</p>
