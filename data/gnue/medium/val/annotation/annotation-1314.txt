James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">something 
extreme odd is going on on win32 - the widget is ok being passed 
strings with just \n in them - however it must autoconvert to \r\n
which throws the cursor placement off</quote>. Harald Meyer
(Harald1&gt; said <quote who="Harald Meyer">that explains why I hadn't 
problems, when I tested it in a small wypython app - did you change 
anything, or are there still problems?</quote> James said 
<quote who="James Thompson">I've just been playing - i haven't 
applied the latest patches you sent yet</quote>. Harald said they 
weren't a complete fix - <quote who="Harald Meyer">just an example 
of what I think has to be done to convert to \n when storing in the 
db. but I'm not sure that making a conversion in _tosqlString is enough
- but as the widget does autoconvert \n -&gt; \r\n, it could 
work</quote>.</p>
