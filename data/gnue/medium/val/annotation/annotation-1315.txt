<topic>Reports</topic>

<mention>Reinhard M&#252;ller</mention>

<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked Jason Cater (jcater) 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">any reason you started a lyx doc</quote> on 
GNUe Reports, as <quote who="Derek Neighbors">opposed to using existing 
docbook doc in cvs?</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I'm 99.8% 
sure they cover different parts of reports</quote>. Derek was not - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if the name is reporting concepts i think it 
belongs in report proposal [...] if its a users guide then i agree it 
should be separate</quote>. Jason said the original document 
<quote who="Jason Cater">addresses nothing that I'm addressing</quote>. 
Derek said it <quote who="Derek Neighbors">was a big picture overview 
but was meant to be filled with more detail [...] what you are doing now 
(the details) were to go in it - im more concerned that we are now going 
to have two documents  that have a reports overview that will probably 
'conflict'</quote>. Jason was clear that they were 
<quote who="Jason Cater">COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TOPICS</quote>.</p>

<p>Earlier, Peter Sullivan (psu) asked <quote who="Peter Sullivan">do we 
need to re-think our docs policy</quote>, as the official standard was 
docbook, but in practice most people used lyx as they 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">understandably want to use a wysiwyg 
editor</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) said he 
<quote who="James Thompson">just wants docs that 1) don't require me to 
program them 2) have tools that actually don't suck</quote>. He had had 
extreme difficulty getting docbook to work reliably (on GNU/Linux), 
or at all (on anything else). Nick Rusnov suggested 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">standardizing on the XML docbook would be a 
positive move</quote>, as any XML transformation tool could be used to 
produce the documents. Texinfo was also suggested. James said 
<quote who="James Thomspon">texinfo and docbook have me spending time 
programming the docs - instead of programming GNUe</quote>. Nick 
suggested <quote who="Nick Rusnov">use a standardized text format, and 
I'll write a perl script to convert them to docbook :)</quote> but 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">you don't really exploit the logical markup 
that way</quote>. James agreed - <quote who="James Thompson">we really 
need chapters, sections, etc - IMHO - if there was any editor that let 
me easily write docbook - then I'm ok with docbook</quote>. Nick 
commented <quote who="Nick Rusnov">I coulda sworn abiword supported 
docbook</quote>. James said he wasn't a lyx zealot - 
<quote who="James Thompson">lyx sucks too - it just sucks less than 
doing it by hand</quote>. Derek thought that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">99% of our docbook issues are that of 
staleness</quote> as they were still using the SGML version of docbook 
- <quote who="Derek Neighbors">so when you get the docbook tools that 
are now xml and xsl there are 'issues'</quote>.</p>

<p>James said he had started to document GNUe Common, 
<quote who="James Thompson">and jcater is (trying) to start on 
reports</quote>, but neither of them were keen on doing documentation. 
Derek and Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) both said they appreciated 
the effort put in on documentation. Derek said the 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">problem with the .txt docs is they are 
too incohesive and scattered and often conflicting so when someone 
tries to consolodate them and format them its nearly impossible w/o 
getting the original authors involved</quote>. He noted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">on at least 5 occassions i tried to 
consolidate geas docs to no avail</quote>. Jason felt 
<quote who="Jason Cater">one large doc is much worse than 5 targeted 
docs imho</quote>. Derek felt that was true for developers, but not 
for end-users <quote who="Derek Neighbors">becaues FINDING the docs 
is the problem - the idea originally was to have as many small docs 
as you want and then create books from them so users had a choice to 
search for a targeted doc or get a broader picture on a topic and 
garner all the docs for it</quote>. Nick suggested 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">should take the whole bodice of documentation
and treat it as one book in separate files - 'the gnue book'</quote>. 
Derek said that had been the intention.</p>

<p>Later, Derek suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we could 
always use debian-doc which is like a skinny version of docbook 
:)</quote>. Nick noted that <quote who="Nick Rusnov">debian-doc 
is being abandoned in favor of docbook</quote>. He felt 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">docbook xml is probably the best choice 
in this day and age, just need some tools and 
infrastructure</quote> - there were <quote who="Nick Rusnov">no 
really good frontends though</quote>. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">KDE and FreeBSD just moved to docbook 
for all docs - gnome alredy did - and sounds like debian will be - 
makes me wonder why [...] there are no good visual editors for 
it</quote>.</p>
