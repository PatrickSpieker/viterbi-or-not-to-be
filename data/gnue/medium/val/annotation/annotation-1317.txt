<p>Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) noted that 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">bkuhn on dotgnu list</quote>
had suggested <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">another irc meeting for 
GNUe, phpgw, and dotgnu over rpc stuff (including jabber )</quote>, 
following on from 
<kcref startdate="26 Nov 2001 00:00:00 -0800" title="GNU: The Gathering" /> and 
<kcref startdate="26 Nov 2001 00:00:00 -0800" title="The GNU Project - Meeting of the Minds" />. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked <quote who="Daniel Baumann">what's 
jabber got to do with it? jabber is sort of a SOAP replacement?</quote>. 
Nick Rusnov (nickr) said <quote who="Nick Rusnov">jabber isn't exactly 
a soap replacement</quote>. Daniel said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">they 
call it messagin middleware - that could be SOAP, CORBA, etc. - we can 
support jabber as we do all the others - but it's not going to be a 
defacto standard or anything - our objective is to provide choice, 
imho</quote>. However, <quote who="Daniel Baumann">please note I am 
saying this without even reading the message yet ;)</quote>.</p>
