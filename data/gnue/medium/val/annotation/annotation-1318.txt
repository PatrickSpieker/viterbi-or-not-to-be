<p>Todd Boyle asked about 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/compiere">Compiere</a> - 
<quote who="Todd Boyle">Can anybody advise +/- on this thing? Does it 
work?</quote>. Derek Neighbors, remembering 
<kcref startdate="07 Nov 2001 18:06:33 -0800" subject="[gnue-discuss] Kantor" />,
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">It has been a while.  If I reember 
correctly the biggest knocks were: a. It is java based. b. It only 
work with Oracle backend.</quote> Christopher Brown 
said the <quote who="Christopher Brown">BIG, BIG, BIG problem with Compiere</quote> 
was that <quote who="Christopher Brown">It requires a whopping big pile of software 
that is: a) Not open source, and b) VERY nontrivial to install</quote> - 
<quote who="Christopher Brown">Compiere may itself be "free software," 
but it's only free if you have already sent your briefcases full of money to 
Sun and Oracle.</quote> He also didn't like the use of the Mozilla Public 
License, as <quote who="Christopher Brown">Contributing to MPLed Compiere basically
amounts to giving your code to the vendor.</quote></p>

<p>Todd also asked about possible collaberation between projects. 
Derek replied <quote who="Derek Neighbors">Merging code generally doesnt 
work, ego's often prevent it.  Collaboration on other levels are good, 
but in case of RPC and such interoperation is generally much easier than 
10 years ago. GNUe is of course willing to collaborate in any way that is 
good for the user.</quote></p>
