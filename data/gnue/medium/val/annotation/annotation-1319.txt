<p>Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">in the next week, we'll 
be doing the first release of Reports - plus a maintenance release of common, 
forms, and designer. Some of the commits you see are documentation for Common
so GEAS can get underway again</quote>. Neil Tiffin (neilt) was pleased that 
GNUe Application Server (GEAS) was being rewritten in python now, but 
<quote who="Neil Tiffin">its just sad that it will take a while to get back 
to working state</quote> Neil asked how to debug python. Jason 
said <quote who="Jason Cater">our GNUe-Common includes a 
built-in stepping debugger now - just run the app with 
--interactive-debugger</quote>. This had just been 
added <quote who="Jason Cater">in this past week :) - 
but james was showing me all it can do - and it 
rocks</quote>.</p>
