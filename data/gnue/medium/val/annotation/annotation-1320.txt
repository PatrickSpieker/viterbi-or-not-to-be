<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) said he had been helping someone by e-mail 
with installing gnue, all the time wondering why no-one else was 
chipping in, only to discover it was all going to his local LUG mailing 
list rather than gnue@gnu.org. They had now got it working, and he 
quoted some feedback received - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">Can't recall 
who recommended gnue for my simple invoice system, but thanks :-)
Took a couple days break from the install problems, and within a 
hour or two today, I have most of it working. This is neat stuff.</quote>
There were some problems using the master-detail wizard with MySQL, 
as the primary key for the master was an auto-increment field that 
didn't get created until commit time. Derek asked 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">this is because he needs to use the 
spiff function? that doesnt exist for mysql? the get next id 
thing?</quote>. He suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we might 
want to change the 'master/detail' wizard to allow this to be auto 
created (the function) as an option</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) 
said that, in principle, <quote who="Jason Cater">auto-sequences 
are not a good thing in gnue-land</quote> but this was 
<quote who="Jason Cater">not a bad idea</quote>.</p>
