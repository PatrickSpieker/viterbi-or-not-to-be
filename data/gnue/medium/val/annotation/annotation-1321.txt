<topic>Reports</topic>

<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked about progress on the <quote who="Derek Neighbors">pysablot packages</quote>, as referred to in
<kcref startdate="03 Apr 2002 23:00:00 -0800" title="Using pysablot as an XML transformation tool with GNUe Reports" />.
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">I have them <a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/debian/">mirrored</a> </quote>,
as Nick Rusnov did not have an account on the gnuenterprise server. Jason
had <quote who="Jason Cater">looked into PySablot and the author is active -
he just started a new Python-related project on sourceforge this
month</quote>. Derek said he would rather that the original maintainer would
respond, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">but im pro adopting it if need
be</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Nick confirmed he was <quote who="Nick Rusnov">willing to 
maintain pysablot</quote> as an official Debian package 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">if there is ubstream and docs and a copyright and a 
license</quote>. Derek said he believed <quote who="Derek Neighbors">license
is GPL and copyright is the fellow who wrote it</quote>. He had e-mailed 
the developer <quote who="Derek Neighbors">asking if he was going to 
continue its development - and if not would he turn it over to 
GNUe</quote>. He said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i can probably whip 
together a license and copyright file for him and upload to him a new 
tar ball for release including at least a README ;) and maybe even a 
simple doc :)</quote>. Nick said this would mean he 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">could upload it to the archive</quote> as 
an official Debian package.</p>
