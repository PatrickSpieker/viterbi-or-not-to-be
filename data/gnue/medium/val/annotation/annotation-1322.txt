<topic>Reports</topic>

<p>Michael Dean (mdeanlt) asked <quote who="Michael Dean">how is reports 
going?</quote>. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) replied 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">good - we are generating html now - 
and text (though poorly formatted)</quote>. Output was currently 
to a static file, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">but its all using pysablot 
so we can do inline eventually</quote>. Already 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">reports support output of file, email, printer, 
fax</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.16Apr2002">
The next day</a>, 
Talli Somekh (talli) asked <quote who="Talli Somekh">i noticed that there's been 
quite a bit of activity with GNUe Reports in CVS the past few weeks - has it's 
status of proof of concept changed at all?</quote>. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) 
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the proof of concept works - if you take the 
foobulations report and run it, it reads teh database and creates resulting XML
and we have text and html transformations of that XML</quote>. Talli asked if 
it was production-ready. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i would say if 
you have to be in production like today and you arent willing to 'suffer the 
ills' of using growing software then reports is not for you today - IF however
you have a little time before you need to be in produciton i.e. you are coding 
production and you have developers on staff that can quickly patch code if for 
some reason the reports development team is around - then reports might be a 
pretty good bet for you</quote> He added <quote who="Derek Neighbors">for 
immediate focus text and html will be the concentrated outputs - but i am 
looking at gnumeric and excell outputs as well - ps, pdf etc will come shortly 
but with XSLT they have to go to FO first which i need to study up on</quote>.
Talli asked whether <quote who="Talli Somekh">creating new reports</quote> was 
a developer or end-user task. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">currently 
there is no visual report designer though we are expecting that our current 
visual forms designer will be easily adapted to the task</quote>. However, 
even at time of writing, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if they know markup 
they can do it - i.e. if they could write an html report they could write 
a gnue report right now</quote>.</p>

<p>On the postscript and PDF output, Nick Rusnov (nickr) suggested 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">someone will have to make a Python FO engine or 
else install java.</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i am 
somewhat of an old skool postscript wizard - and im HIGHLY likely to instead 
go straight from XML to raw postscript as we have a python libary for 
postscript</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) thought this 
<quote who="Jason Cater">would take ENTIRELY too long to write</quote>
Nick asked <quote who="Nick Rusnov">is FO really that complex? 
surely its mappable to TeX or something</quote>?</p>

<p>Jason said that <quote who="Jason Cater">the html and text markups are 
quick little scripts dneighbo did</quote>, so <quote who="Jason Cater">writing 
other output formats will be trivial</quote>. Derek noted that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">with nickrs help most of that report for 
html has css (so any html person) could alter it without touching any 
real 'code' or xslt style sheets</quote>. Eventually, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">our designer will allow you to drag and drop 
to create reports - i will go out on a limb and say after we nail some basic 
reports and iron out some kinks that will be probably high on the list 
of next steps</quote>. For client/server access, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">fairly quickly we should support clients that
can talk some form of RPC (CORBA or XML-RPC etc) to talk to it</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason confirmed that he had not implemented triggers in 
GNUe Reports yet - <quote who="Jason Cater">that'll be 0.0.2</quote>, 
but <quote who="Jason Cater">I feel I have enough to justify a first 
release</quote>. Talli felt <quote who="Talli Somekh">well, a free reports 
app is certainly among the holy grails in the free software 
world</quote>. Nick said <quote who="Nick Rusnov">perl has EXCELLENT 
report generation stuff - that people rarely use - which is silly, 
cause thats what perl is FOR</quote>. Neither Derek nor Jason were 
keen on perl as a dependancy.</p>

<p>For the column width tags, Derek was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">thinking it will be a lot easier to do 
width="" on each tag like you had it before - but we can make the 
'designer' do the work - i.e. if in a header row you set a width it 
sets teh width for all its children</quote>. Jason said that was possible 
- <quote who="Jason Cater">just seems redundant</quote>. Derek clarified 
that you could use Reports without Designer - indeed, as of time of writing 
you had to - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">you could certainly use emacs 
or vi or anything that would let you edit flat text or xml</quote>. 
Talli said <quote who="Talli Somekh">we've had many clients begging for 
reports, so this will certainly be something that will be on our 
radar</quote>.</p>
