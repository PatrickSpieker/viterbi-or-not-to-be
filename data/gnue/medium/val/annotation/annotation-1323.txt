<topic>DCL</topic>

<p>Derek Neighbors said that DCL (as set up for bug/feature tracking
on the GNU Enterprise project) sent e-mail updates to people who 
raised logs directly via their own DCL account, but not (as of time 
of writing) for logs raised via the e-mail gateway - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">thats somethign i want to 
add</quote>. Michael Dean (mdean) said 
<quote who="Michael Dean">that could be done, as long as the 
From: field matches the email in the personnel table</quote>. 
Derek, in the best recursive traditions of GNU, raised a 
work order on DCL for this functionality to be added to DCL. 
He asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">btw: you have an issue 
if we maybe shut down the bug stuff on sourceforge for dcl
and route to the gnue version of dcl</quote>? He wanted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">to start showcasing the beauty 
of dcl :)</quote>. Michael said he would 
<quote who="Michael Dean">have to go through it, but would be 
better to eat own dog food, I guess</quote>. Derek said that 
DCL was already <quote who="Derek Neighbors">rather usable</quote> 
when <quote who="Derek Neighbors">using it for software project 
(bugs features)</quote> like GNUe and 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">with MINIMAL work i think we could 
overcome the issues</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Derek noted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">yummy dcl 
gateway has been patched - if you send email to it for support 
with the to: line being the same as what is your user account 
there - it will log it as submitted by your user account!</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.16Apr2002">
The next day</a>, 
Jason Cater (jcater) reported <quote who="Jason Cater">woohoo! I submitted my 
first DCL patch today</quote>. He had <quote who="Jason Cater">added "Mailer: 
noreply-dcl@myhost.mydomain.com" to his email headers -  so I can filter the 
damn things</quote> in his e-mail client. <quote who="Jason Cater">Since the 
From: is always the user's name and the To: is your name - there wasn't much 
to filter against - at one point, I was searching for [WO#.* in the subject</quote> 
but now that the GNU Enterprise project was using DCL as well, he couldn't 
distinguish between work orders from different DCL servers. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think here i hacked it to always send from a 
special account instead of from the 'user' - at some point might want to make that 
an option - as right now if i get a ticket and hit reply to all it probably emails 
the original ticket submitter - which in a lot of environments might be good</quote> 
as <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we really want the end users communicating with 
developers through DCL not individual email :)</quote>.</p>
