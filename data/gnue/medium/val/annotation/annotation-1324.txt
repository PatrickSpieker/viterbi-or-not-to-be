<topic>DCL</topic>

<p>Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) asked how GNUe Reports would work
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">without x,y positioning - 
i'v used only fixed pos designers before</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater)
said <quote who="Jason Cater">I've used both - and in my experience, 
the fixed positions are a quick way to generate reports - but once you 
need more than they offer - you are kind of stuck</quote>. Peter Sullivan
said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">i have been anti-fixed positioning since 
before i used a report tool ;-0 - you have exactly the same problem with 
simple spreadsheet solutions - fundamentally, y-axis absolute pos breaks 
as soon as you get an extra row of data</quote>. Nick Rusnov agreed - 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">at some point you have to say 'this goes here'
- but up till that point, imho, you should say 'this is that'</quote>. 
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">there are instances where physical
markup is a necessity - i.e., pre-printed forms - and i plan to allow 
for those</quote>. He thought <quote who="Jason Cater">those would 
probably be different designer wizards - we haven't actually done the 
designer part yet - but I'd imagine you'd pick from a few choices of 
"types" of reports</quote>.</p>
