<topic>DCL</topic>

<p>Jason Cater said he had mirrored the new version of DCL to the gnuenterprise 
website - <quote who="Jason Cater">thought that'd be appropriate seeing as how 
he's gnue affiliated and all :)</quote>. Derek Neighbors (dnWork) 
noted that the only issue with upgrading DCL was <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if 
you allowed uploaded attachments you will need to move those off some where
and then move them back - mdean suggests making the attachment directory 
outside the dcl tree so you dont have to toy with it for upgrades</quote>.</p>
