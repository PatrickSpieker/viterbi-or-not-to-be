<topic>Bayonne (GNU Comm)</topic>

<p>It was asked what GNU Bayonne was. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) explained <quote who="Daniel Baumann">well 
for the enterprise it can be used to do voice mail - touch tone phone 
systems - like provide a menu</quote>. He wasn't sure about call 
forwarding. <quote who="Daniel Baumann">It basically provides telephony 
services like what some sophisticated phone system thingy does but with 
a PC and a telephony phone card</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Jason Cater (jcater) gave 
<a href="http://www.intel.com/network/csp/products/4473web.htm">a link</a>
to information about telephony cards, and confirmed 
<quote who="Jason Cater">bayonne can communicate directly with office 
PBX's - or it can take the place of a PBX - in which you have a complete 
call switching center on a linux box - you can use it for voice mail
(multiline) you could use it for interactive touch-tone menus - including 
tying back into a database (i.e., pulling up a client's account 
information via a phone menu) - ou could program autodialers (that work 
with a PBX or just on a plain old telephone line) - it's a pretty impressive 
piece of software</quote>. Jeff Bailey (jbailey) said he wasn't aware that 
Bayonne did <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Automatic Call Distribution.  Like 
call queues, and stuff.</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I'm 
not sure how much out-of-the-box functionality it can do - it's really an 
architecture - imho</quote>, based on <quote who="Jason Cater">conversations 
with the bayonne guy - I don't know what it will do without a little 
coercing by a knowledgable staff</quote>.</p>
