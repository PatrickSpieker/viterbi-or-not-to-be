<topic>Reports</topic>

<p>Jason Cater (jcater) asked about 
<quote who="Jason Cater">a gnumeric or such spreadsheet xslt script 
for our arsenal?</quote>. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said he had 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">started a gnumeric.xsl already - 
basically i formatted out in gnumeric what i thought report should 
look like and saved it - and dissected the xml to see</quote>. This 
produced very verbose output, but <quote who="Derek Neighbors">most 
of them are 'superflous' standard crap - so in essence i dont thing 
it will be tremendously difficult</quote>. For Microsoft Excel, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">its a little USED fact - but excel while
 it doesnt SAVE to xHTML has full support for it</quote>, so 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i planned on going xml -&gt;xslt-&gt; ms excel
xhtml</quote>.</p>
