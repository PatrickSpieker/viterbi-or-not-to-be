<p>Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) asked Jan Ischebeck (siesel) about 
i18n (unicode default) changes to forms status. Jan said 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">its allmost ready, just some small 
parts still have to made ready f.e. the way database encodings 
are set.</quote> Jan still hadn't 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">worked on "unicodification" of 
GParser entities f.e. the "name" type should be converted to 
unicode, because it's used for labels etc</quote>. Also, as he 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">was planning to commit some of the 
unicode changes to forms etc. Because common is changed to, 
some parts of reports possibly won't work as expected so it 
will be like the _() i18n changes i.e. there will be much to 
be fixed problems, which I can't check for, because I don't 
use reports regualary. I think, that now (after 0.5.1) is 
the time for changes like that, so I just want to ask if you 
have objections or what do you think about it.</quote> The 
changes basically should affect <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">the 
return type for strings is unicode instead of string when doing 
database access. It could made optional, so that f.e. gnue-pos 
can keep using normal string</quote>. Jan promised to talk 
about this more later.</p>
