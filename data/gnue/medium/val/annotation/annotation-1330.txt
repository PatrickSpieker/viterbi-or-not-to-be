<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) asked whether applications 
written with the GNUe tools would 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">have to be GPL-ed</quote>
(i.e. released under the GNU General Public License).
Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">no - of course you would 
not even _want_ to write proprietary software - but if you 
really want, you can write prop software with gnue</quote>. 
He explained <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">only the tools 
are gpl - so you have to provide the source for gnue-forms, 
gnue-common etc</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) said 
<quote who="James Thompson">you can make prop forms, reports, etc -
but you couldn't embed gnue-common in your app</quote>.</p>
<p>However, as Reinhard noted, in practice, 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">i don't see how you would 
hide the source of a form from your user ;-)</quote>
James suggested <quote who="James Thompson">i wonder if a 
person could do a pgp type setup w/ forms/reports/etc - 
so that forms could be encrypted w/ a private key - 
and the public key distributed with app</quote>.</p>

<p>Tam&#225;s said that he personally would prefer to 
release applications he wrote under the GPL, but his 
company would need to be convinced of the benefits of 
this. Reinhard saud <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">the 
main benefit is getting back imporvements from the 
community</quote> - <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">this 
is for example what i experienced with you last week with 
your fixes to appserver :)</quote> Also, opening up the 
source reduced the reliance on key individuals - this was 
especially significant for smaller software houses.</p>

<p>Also, <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">don't forget
you don't have to open the source code to the world - 
you just have to open it to your customer - 
and let him open it to whomever he likes. Most customers 
will probably keep it to themselves anyway</quote>. 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">The gpl doesn't say you 
have to give your code to anyone - you can keep it all for 
yourself if you like - but _when_ you give it away, you have 
to 1. give the source code, too 2. let the receiver give it 
to any 3rd persons he wants under the same conditions. 
So it might be totally normal to write code under gpl
- and give it only to a single customer</quote>. There 
was no requirement under GPL to make the source available to 
all and sundry, for example by putting it on an anonymous 
CVS service like savannah. der.hans (LuftHans) noted 
<quote who="der.hans">also, technically you don't have to give 
the source code to your customers, you just have to make it 
available to them</quote>. Reinhard agreed - 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">i provide a "written offer" 
myself instead of the source code</quote> when installing 
Debian GNU/Linux for clients.</p>
