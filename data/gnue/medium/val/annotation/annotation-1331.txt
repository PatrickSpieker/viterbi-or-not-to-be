<p>Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) asked <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">what 
is the correct way if i fix a packaging error</quote> for the stand-alone 
Windows 32 version of the GNUe Tools 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">and build a new setup exe?</quote>
James Thompson (jamest) suggested <quote who="James Thompson">gut tells 
me we should re-release w/ new point number - 0.5.2</quote>. Jason Cater 
(jcater) was not so sure - <quote who="Jason Cater">even if it's</quote>
just <quote who="Jason Cater">a packaging error?</quote> Tam&#225;s
confirmed <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">the designers toolbar wizards 
doesn't work in setup exe - just a packaging error</quote>. Jeff Bailey 
(jbailey) suggested <quote who="Jeff Bailey">add a .1 to the end.</quote>
James felt <quote who="James Thompson">0.5.1.1 is fine too - but I think 
we need way to mark the diff</quote>. Mike Vincent (Vee) suggested 
designating it as 0.5.1-1, but Jeff pointed out that 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">Versions with -'s are used by</quote> GNU/Linux 
distributions such as Debian to signify different packages of the same 
underlying version of an application, <quote who="Jeff Bailey">so unless 
all win32 versions are going to start -1, -2 for sub releases, it will 
just get confusing.</quote>.</p>
