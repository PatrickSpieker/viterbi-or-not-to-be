<topic>Forms</topic>
<topic>Designer</topic>

<p>James Thompson (jamest) asked <quote who="James Thompson">any reasons we 
can't be thinking release?</quote> Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) pointed out 
<quote who="Mike Vincent">on-startup trigger doesnt fire first</quote> 
(as discussed in <kcref subject="[IRC] 13 Jul 2003" title="on-startup and other triggers in Forms" />) and 
<quote who="Mike Vincent">touching the trigger drop down on the code editor 
in designer is still dangerous</quote>. James said that Jason Cater (jcater) 
had <quote who="James Thompson">mentioned having some code in designer(?) 
that could be copied to solve</quote> the on-startup trigger problem. 
Mike said it was <quote who="Mike Vincent">up to you guys if it's release 
critical or not.. I'm not sure if I found a different way to do what I 
needed</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Jason explained <quote who="Jason Cater">with that On-Startup 
bug - I'm thinking we just leave that as a known bug - release - then fix 
properly. I know how I want to fix it - and it should work w/o problem - 
but it will touch a bit of code. well, not really touch a lot of code - 
but touches on startup logic</quote>. Mike said this 
<quote who="Mike Vincent">works for me</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.21Jul2003">
Some days later</a>, Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">you'll be glad to 
know I just committed a fix for your Code Editor dropdown bug :) - it was 
a bugger to figure out</quote>. Later, Mike played <quote who="Mike Vincent">with 
the trigger dropdown - it's everything I dreamed it would be.. :)</quote> 
Jason said he was <quote who="Jason Cater">doing several forms</quote> himself 
as of time of writing - <quote who="Jason Cater">all using designer - hence the 
usability commits :)</quote> Mike felt <quote who="Mike Vincent">the block tabs 
Rock! too.. I'm all for a 0.5.1 now.. you guys have my vote fwiw..</quote> But 
Jason said there was <quote who="Jason Cater">a bug in forms I need fixed first. 
if you mark an entry as non-navigable - you can still click on it in the 
wxWindows-driver. The wx focus changes - but the forms focus doesn't 
change</quote>, which meant that the display logic and the form logic got out 
of synch. Mike said <quote who="Mike Vincent">I think I made mine nonnav and 
readonly</quote> in order to minimise the problem.</p>
