<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>der.hans (LuftHans) was <quote who="der.hans">working on a 
demo GNUe XML form. Good thing there's a 'using a text editor' section</quote>
for writing GNUe Form Definition files (*.gfd) in the documentation, since he 
could not get GNUe Designer to work. However, he was getting a traceback error 
when he tried to open the form definition in GNUe Forms. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) 
asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">what is wrong with designer? last i heard it 
pretty close to having most bugs fixed. plese note you need wxPython 2.4</quote>. 
He felt <quote who="Derek Neighbors">doing xml by hand is less than optimal 
(way easy to hose up) - also if you copied something out of the docs likely 
they are inaccurate</quote> since <quote who="Derek Neighbors">try as we 
might... development happens faster than documentation</quote>. der.hans 
said he had used the Zipcode example. He asked 
<quote who="der.hans">doesn't the PHP thingy have a 
validator?</quote> Derek said that the Forms client written in PHP was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">not usuable for anything remotely close to 
production - unless you want to contribute code to make it work :)</quote>
He was not keen on web-based enterprise applications anyway, for anything 
other than occasional data entry users.</p>

<p>Derek looked at Hans' form definition and noted that the 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">form spec has changed radically</quote> from 
version 0.5, as previously discussed in 
<kcref startdate="26 Nov 2002 19:00:37 -0800" subject="XML Changes for Forms 0.5.x" />
 - he personally had not been affected much by this, as he had 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">stopped editing dumb files by hand when 
designer got better</quote>. He suggested some changes to der.hans's 
form definition which got it up and working at Derek's end - but der.hans 
was still having problems as he had <quote who="der.hans">no db 
driver for psycopg</quote>.</p>
