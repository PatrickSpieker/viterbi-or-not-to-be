<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) noted two bugs in Designer, but 
Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) said he believed they were fixed in CVS. 
This lead Derek to update his CVS for the first time since CVS 
had been broken up into seperate modules for each application, 
as discussed in 
<kcref startdate="20 Jun 2003 08:06:29 -0800" subject="[GNUe-dev] Restructuring of CVS" />. 
Mike said <quote who="Mike Vincent">IIRC there's like a "wowiee wow! 
wow!" difference between</quote> the last official release of GNUe Designer 
(0.5.0) and the CVS version as of time of writing - 
<quote who="Mike Vincent">I dont remember if that 
happened prior to the cvs restructuring or not though</quote>. 
Derek reported that both his bugs had been fixed - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">jcater you are my hero -
