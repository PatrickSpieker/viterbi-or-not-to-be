<p>Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) said he had <quote who="Mike Vincent">an itch 
to get product (item) management to a state where I can: setup my product 
line, print a price list, and perhaps print brochures and or a catalog so 
I've been working to that end. </quote>. He had not 
<quote who="Mike Vincent">played with aria much.. well really, not at 
all.. </quote>. Chan Min Wai (dcmwai) said <quote who="Chan Min Wai">It 
is just a erp that is incomplete... and our objective is to complete every 
part of it.. and Joining with Gnue-sb will make things work without double 
work</quote>. Mike agreed - <quote who="Mike Vincent">I'm not sure what the 
roadmap for integration looks like though..</quote> Chan said 
<quote who="Chan Min Wai">We haen't have one yet...</quote> In the 
meantime, Mike suggested, <quote who="Mike Vincent">if the schema is set, 
then you could probably work on forms to do what arias currently does in 
the way of payroll, ap, ar, gl</quote>.</p>
