<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>Stuart Quimby (ToyMan) asked <quote who="Stuart Quimby">how web-integrated 
is gnue these days?</quote> Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">not very - i.e. same as before</quote>. 
He added <quote who="Derek Neighbors">really i cant imagine running a business 
off all web backend</quote> - he had seen proprietary ERP packages that 
had gone web-based <quote who="Derek Neighbors">and its rather horrible</quote>. 
He explained <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the problem is the web makes for a 
HORRIBLY inefficient UI - unless you use java applets or activeX controls - 
but then you are not a 'web application' - you are an application in a web 
browser - ie you lose all the good reasons to use a web app (as you have to 
deploy stuff client side)</quote>. The problem with HTML was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">basically if its 
not java/activeX etc its stateless which makes for horridly inefficient 
refreshes</quote>. His own bank had a web-based online banking application, 
which was fine when used (say) in the middle of the night (and being web-based 
allowed him to use GNU/Linux rather than Microsoft Windows)  
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">but when its a heavy traffic bank day - its 
'stateless' refresh times are so horrible it's nearly unusable :(</quote></p>
