<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 15 Jul 2003" title="popy and psycopg as alternative python drivers for PostgreSQL" />, 
Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) reported <quote who="Mike Vincent">I tried popy last week but 
had to revert back to psycopg because it breaks designer's schema navigator.. 
apparently because of the way it returns types.. like it was expecting</quote> 
Object IDs (oid) <quote who="Mike Vincent">to be returned as a int type but was 
getting a str, I think.. *shrug*</quote>. 
Thierry Michel (thierry), one of the popy developers, said 
<quote who="Thierry Michel">it's complex 
to deal w/ oid type - each table has an oid and lob are also using 
oid</quote>. He asked whether people had seen <quote who="Thierry Michel">the 
announce about pygresql/popy project merging ?</quote>. He offered to fix 
the problem with the popy driver if he could - <quote who="Thierry Michel">popy 
tries to detect LOB and handles them transparently - but as oid is used by tables, 
the automatic detection is impossible IMHO - so, LOB are not handled by default by 
popy and oid too...</quote></p>

<p>James Thompson (jamest) asked 
<quote who="James Thompson">just out of curiosity does popy deal with ' 
properly?</quote> - he had <quote who="James Thompson">tested out some of my forms 
with pygresql and it did the right thing wrt strings that contained ' - however 
one of my users told me the other day that strings with ' in them choaked the form
- the only change I recall was going to popy</quote>. He had had 
<quote who="James Thompson">0 time to look at gnue's code, the users example, or 
anything - so it could be user error but I figured since the popy author was here 
for abuse - it was too good to pass up</quote>. Thierry admitted that 
<quote who="Thierry Michel">popy has problem with quoting - we are working on 
it and a better types converter</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Thierry announced a <quote who="Thierry Michel">new version of popy 
2.0.10 available on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/popy/">sf's cvs</a></quote>. 
Mike noted that this <quote who="Mike Vincent">fixes the schema navigator breakage 
in designer while using popy</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.22Jul2003">
The next day</a>, Thierry confirmed <quote who="Thierry Michel">the popy team 
decided to continue the development of PoPy until the 2.1 which will be the last 
stable and mature release - in parallel, we'll begin to develop the new merging 
pygresql project</quote> with the psycopg developers. Meanwhile, 
<quote who="Thierry Michel">2.1 will correct all bugs of PoPy</quote>. 
James asked <quote who="James Thompson">any timeline for 2.1?</quote> 
Thierry said <quote who="Thierry Michel">until we receive bugs :/ - we planned 
5 (max) pre-release for the 2.1. we have already begin the pre1 (which includes 
bugs I fixed in the 2.0.11, and some code cleaning)</quote>.</p>
