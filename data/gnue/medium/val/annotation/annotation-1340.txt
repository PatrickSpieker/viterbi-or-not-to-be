<p>Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) had been <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">reading 
some interesting texts about the GFDL</quote> (GNU Free Documentation License) - 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">I start to doubt seriously if the GFDL is the 
correct license for GNUe Documentation</quote>. The problem was that making 
use of the part of the license that allowed you to 
specify invariant sections arguably made the whole document non-free. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) felt <quote who="Daniel Baumann">it is a sad fact 
in this day and age you have to jump through so mnay hoops in order to cover 
your backside legally, but I hardly blame it on the GFDL</quote>. Jeff Bailey 
(jbailey) recommended <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Please 
try hard to avoid the GFDL.  If you use it, please try hard to avoid invariant 
sections.</quote> He noted that this was causing problems 
for the Debian project - <quote who="Jeff Bailey">I'll be shortly moving Glibc's 
documentation to non-free in Debian. I think GCC's documentation is already 
there.</quote> Reinhard said <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">if i write a 
documentation - I _want_ it to be usable in manpages</quote>. Daniel pointed out 
that the copyright to all GNUe documentation was assigned to the Free Software 
Foundation (FSF), but the authors had joint copyright on their own contributions as 
well. Daniel felt the FSF <quote who="Daniel Baumann">should probably reevaluate the 
GFDL...but I alos see</quote> Richard Stallman's (rms) 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">point he doesn't want people changing the author's 
"opinion" either and making it easy to defraud them</quote>. Reinhard said 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">the main point is - i don't see _any_ advantages for 
us from the restrictions the gfdl places - but i see _many_ disadvantages for our 
users</quote>. Daniel and Reinhard agreed this needed to be discussed with the FSF.</p>

<p>Later, Jason Cater (jcater) agreed <quote who="Jason Cater">we should seriously 
re-evaluate our GFDL usage</quote>. Jeff noted that <quote who="Jeff Bailey">One 
solution I've seen applied though is that folks have refused to add invariant clauses.
Basically telling the FSF that if they want them, they need to add it 
themselves.</quote></p>
