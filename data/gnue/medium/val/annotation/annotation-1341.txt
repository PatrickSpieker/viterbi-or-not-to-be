<p>It was asked if GNUe could be used to implement web-accessible church management 
software (a type of CRM) to support the activities of a small missions organization.
Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) suggested 
talking to Derek Neighbors (dneighbo)- <quote who="Mike Vincent">I believe he does a 
fair bit of stuff for his church using gnue tools</quote>. Jeff Bailey (jbailey) warned 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">The html forms stuff isn't done yet.  I have some sketches</quote>
(as previously discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 15 Feb 2003" title="HTML User Interface for Forms" />), 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">but ran out of time. =(</quote> The biggest issue was that 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">The basic HTML forms should use CSS 
layout to put it on the screen, but CSS doesn't provide a perfect grid to work 
with.</quote> This would imply convincing the developers of the main non-web Forms client 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">that laying things out on grids 
is suboptimal. =) Also, there's no way to identify easily which tags are associated with 
which inputs, and that's another architecture change in designer.</quote> Ignoring 
these problems for the moment, <quote who="Jeff Bailey">I'm suspecting that a competant 
python programmer could have it displaying HTML in 20 to 30 hours of coding.</quote></p>

<p>However, continuing the theme from 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 19 Jul 2003" title="Are web-based enterprise applications evil?" />, 
he asked <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Does it have to be HTML? There's a Win32 client, and a 
Unix client. In general, native clients will suck less than web clients.</quote> It was 
noted that HTML was probably the best solution where people were accessing the system 
from machines that were not theirs - although if the Windows client executables were 
small enough, these could be downloaded and installed 'on the fly' each time.</p>
