<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Continuing 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 31 May 2002" title="Customising the main tool bar and menu bar in Forms" />,
James Thompson (jamest) said that Marcos' supressible toolbar widget was 
similar to ideas he had had - <quote who="James Thompson">i wanted to add 
visible attributes to lots of stuff in forms</quote> including the toolbar. 
This would allow the toolbar to be switched on and off using triggers, 
and <quote who="James Thompson">hiding a toolbar would have same syntax 
as hiding a entry widget - consistancy is a good thing :)</quote>
Marcos Dione (StyXMan) asked <quote who="Marcos Dione">why wait till code 
is run? set the toolbar optional by tag or attr. Easier, and more consistent 
for the developer.</quote> James explained <quote who="James Thompson">because 
all the other widgets will work like this too</quote>. Marcos certainly liked 
the idea of being <quote who="Marcos Dione">able to do things to widgets @ 
runtime</quote> - not just visible/invisible, but also enable/disable. 
James said that Marcos' <quote who="James Thompson">work w/ the 
toolbar would make this easy to implement</quote>. Marcos explained how 
this would work, but noted <quote who="Marcos Dione">defining your own 
menubar <cite>must</cite> be done by xml, not triggers.</quote> 
James said that <quote who="James Thompson">the self attribute in triggers</quote> 
was not currently working, which made triggers and trigger libraries less useful 
<quote who="James Thompson">if they have to have hardcoded references</quote>. 
However, it had been some time since he had looked at this.</p>
