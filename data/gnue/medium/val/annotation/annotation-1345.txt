<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Marcos Dione (StyXman) asked if there was a <quote who="Marcos Dione">multiselect 
widget</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">not yet</quote>. 
He added <quote who="Jason Cater">we need to think thru how we want it handled - 
it'd be a block style</quote>. Marcos did not see why - he was talking about being 
able to select multiple records for a single field. Jason said he was 
<quote who="Jason Cater">thinking of "fallback" - i.e., what would a UI driver fall 
back to if it doesn't support this nifty new feature</quote>, especially how 
you would <quote who="Jason Cater">tie that directly to a datasource?</quote>.</p>

<p>James Thompson (jamest) said that <quote who="James Thompson">the one thing that 
sucks about putting it in a block is navigation - as I have a similar need that I do 
via a block of dropdowns</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I <cite>need</cite>
something similar too - so I'm not arguing against such a thing</quote>. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) said he thought a good form dialog was more important, as 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i dont need the multi select really 'in' a form but rather 
as a 'utility' to rapidly assign data</quote>, creating many to many relationships 
between the primary keys of two tables via a switch table - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">once assigned it can be displayed in grid</quote>. 
Derek and Marcos traded some practical examples of this. Marcos said, in his 
particular case, he <quote who="Marcos Dione">would prefer a muktiselect list 
box</quote> as <quote who="Marcos Dione">the options are just a few in this 
particular case</quote>. John Lenton (Chipaca) suggested 
<quote who="John Lenton">if they're really few, surely checkboxes are 
better?</quote>. Marcos said that checkboxes existed, but it was not always 
easy to get the data back in the database from these.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.07Jun2002">
The next day</a>, Marcos said <quote who="Marcos Dione">I'm gonna do a 
listbox</quote>, and asked <quote who="Marcos Dione">should I just extend 
entry or better to add a new class?</quote>. James confirmed that all 
the entry widgets were <quote who="James Thompson">all &lt;entry&gt; tags 
with a style</quote>. Marcos said the box would start off single-select, 
but would eventually support multi-select.</p>
