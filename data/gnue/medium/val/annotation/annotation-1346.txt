<topic>Navigator</topic>

<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) did some testing of Navigator. James Thompson 
(jamest) noted that menu line entries in the GNUe Process Definition (.gpd) 
file - the standard file format for Navigator - now supported both &lt;title&gt; 
and &lt;description&gt; tags. He confirmed that using Navigator to launch
both Reports and non-GNUe applications was still supported. 
Derek noted that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">image works now - 
about box doesnt work</quote>. James said the <quote who="James Thompson">menu 
doesn't work yet at all - it's only there for looks at this time 
:)</quote> Navigator also <quote who="James Thompson">does single login 
for multiple forms - which is nice</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Derek posted some screenshots to the website for the 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">

navigator in actoin</a></quote>. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said that the web version of Navigator 
<quote who="Jason Cater">should be working</quote> but he had not 
<quote who="Jason Cater">tested it out in last day or two</quote>. 
It was not as advanced as the Navigator full client yet, however.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.07Jun2002">
The next day</a>
Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) asked <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">is there any special 
reason navigator uses treecontrol instead of classic menus? in a main window?</quote>.
He explained <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">some users (accountants) hate using mouse - 
and a main window with menus is maybe simpler</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) 
said that <quote who="James Thompson">the tree can be navigated via the cursor 
keys - and we're just trying things out to see what people think</quote>.
Bajusz said that he did not like having two windows - one for Navigator and one 
for the form. James explained <quote who="James Thompson">navigator can launch 
forms, reports, executables - anything you want really - I have mine here launching 
IIRC perl scripts</quote>. He added <quote who="James Thompson">just remember though 
we're still very much so playing - so if you want to see something just describe 
it</quote>. His users needed to be able to <quote who="James Thompson">have multiple 
forms open at same time</quote>, which is why he personally preferred the new 
layout to earlier versions of Navigator. Bajusz suggested 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">1 main window with menubar(navigator) - and forms,reports 
are the child windows in it - like excel opened with more then one xls</quote>. 
James thought this was <quote who="James Thompson">an interesting idea - may have 
to do some more playing</quote>. He noted that <quote who="James Thompson">navigator 
takes ui drivers - so nothing prevents us from making something like that in it's 
own UIwxmdi.py</quote>. He said <quote who="James Thompson">the entire UI system is 
under reworking - we need to start a wishlist</quote> as <quote who="James Thompson">I 
really would like to get most the UI stuff nailed down this next release</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) thought Navigator was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">giong good though im not sure of two things - 
a. why its dual paned - b. that we cant make gpd's load into menus if we so 
desire</quote>. This second option would be useful for curses (text-only) users 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">or people really liking deep ugly menus :)</quote>.</p>
