<topic>Financials (Accounting)</topic>

<p>Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) asked <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">anyone 
know of any small/medium business accounting software</quote>?
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">nola - 
its not gnue but well - its accounting that looks promising to do some 
gnue stuff too</quote>. Peter Sullivan, remembering 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 22 Apr 2002" title="Nola - free alternative to GNUe Financials?" /> 
said that Nola was <quote who="Peter Sullivan">a LAMP application 
(Linux, Apache, MySQL, php) - screenshots look moderately sophisticated 
(but then so do ours) - jcater downloaded for a look-see, you might want 
to ask him when he wakes</quote>. He noted that 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">there's an online demo</quote> on their 
<a href="http://nola.noguska.com/main.html">website</a>. 
He felt the <quote who="Peter Sullivan">look and feel 
isn't terrible, isn't wonderful - and being GPL gets you lots of 
gold stars in my book ;-)</quote>. Andrew said he 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">would still like something GNUeish tho - 
web-based is ok but not ideal for things like printing reports, invoices, 
etc</quote>.</p>

<p>Andrew said he <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">doesn't like NOLA's UI 
that much</quote>. Peter felt it was 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">LAMPish</quote>. Andrew said that 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">DCL could be called LAMPish, but i think 
it has a better UI - so does phpGW</quote>. Derek said that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">nola is far from perfect BUT 
i think its far enough that its a decent start - 
and it would be worth building gnue screens for and such</quote>. 
He would <quote who="Derek Neighbors">probably get gnue screens for 
it</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said he would probably do some work on Nola to 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">make it support fund accounting</quote>, so that 
you could record separate funds <quote who="Derek Neighbors">with self 
balancing set of accounts - usually used to observe some restriction or 
limitation of resources</quote>. This was a fairly common requirement 
in the US government sector, but he would be using it for church 
accounts, where there were separate funds for different church purposes - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">only instead of having a ton of bank accounts 
you have paper (or virtual) ones</quote>. Peter said he had seen similar 
set-ups, where <quote who="Peter Sullivan">each directorate has own balance 
sheet - but the "Cash" figure is not real cash - just their share of the 
central balance sheet</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">generally 
every fund has assests, liabilities, fund balance</quote>. Peter said
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">I keep wavering as to whether this is a good 
idea</quote> in cases where it was not a statutory requirement, as 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">the control aspects can be done w/ good row 
security</quote> instead.</p>
