<p>Nicholas Lee (esands) said he was not aware of any 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">SME open source business (accounting) 
software avaliable at the moment</quote>. He added 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">For myself I'm using gnucash at the 
moment.  Only thing else out there AFAIA is sql ledger and maybe 
nopa.  Not sure how good nopa is.  There are all pretty 
hacky.</quote>. Peter Sullivan (psu) said that a simple General 
Ledger (GL) would not take long to write, but 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">a GL w/o Purchase and Sales Ledger 
is fairly pointless</quote>. Nicholas said he
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">was hoping gnue would be RAD enough 
for me to hack together some tools I could us in my businesses.  
Not quite there yet.</quote>.</p>

<p>Nicholas agreed that <quote who="Nicholas Lee">GL is pretty 
straight-forward.  Dealing with the complications of multiple GLs 
and business logic is obviously harder</quote>. Peter said 
that <quote who="Peter Sullivan">GL is really just a big dustbin 
where you can store things to find 'em later - All the fuss over 
data warehousing - Accountants have had them for years - we just 
called 'em General Ledger</quote>. Nicholas felt 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">The operative word is "hope" to find 
then later.... Isn;t it? ;)</quote> Peter replied 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">not if you have a good enough chart 
of accounts</quote>. He personally <quote who="Peter Sullivan">prefers 
Chart of Accounts formats that cannot be depicted in real space - 
i.e. at least 4 dimmesnions of analysis</quote>. Nicholas said that, 
for small to medium enterprises (SMEs), a 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">4.2 code GL is good enough</quote>. 
Peter suggested <quote who="Peter Sullivan">keep the posting codes 
short - and build the reporting logic via parent-child 
relationships - one less keystroke on a million transactions is a 
million less keystrokes ;-)</quote> Nicholas agreed - especially
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">when I've been the one punching though 
codes at times. 8)</quote>.</p>
