<topic>DCL</topic>

<p>Perry Lorier (Isomer) asked <quote who="Perry Lorier">are there any 
reasonably complete GNUe "apps"?</quote>. Peter Sullivan (psu) said that DCL 
was <quote who="Peter Sullivan">part of the GNUe family but not yet 
part of the GNUe architecture - although there are some GNUe Forms 
that work w/it now it's still mainly a php app</quote>. It started 
as a bug-tracking system, but was <quote who="Peter Sullivan">evolving 
into general project mgt / contact management / multi-user to do list 
application</quote>. The GNUe Project's DCL server was set up for 
read-only guest access <quote who="Peter Sullivan">if you want a 
look-see ;-)</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.11Jun2002">
Some days later</a>, it was asked whether DCL would be a drop in program 
for a typical helpdesk. Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think its a stronger 
projects/work order system than a help desk - but i think it does helpdesk 
ok - and you have the code :)</quote>. GNUe and DCL had now merged 
(as discussed in 
<kcref startdate="05 Mar 2002 13:18:55 -0800" title="GNUe/DCL merger announced" />), 
and <quote who="Derek Neighbors">currently we are gutting the contact
 management for next realease that will be the base for a gnue crm that 
fsf will be using - already in cvs for working version there are gnue 
screens</quote>. He was also using GNUe Reports with it as well. Later, 
he pointed to <quote who="Derek Neighbors">a 
<a href="http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/service_request.png">screenshot</a>
of a gnue'ized dcl - going against production dcl data</quote>.</p>
