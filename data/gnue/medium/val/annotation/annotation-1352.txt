<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>It was asked why geasList had a geasSession field when 
geasInstance did not. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) explained 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">because geasList needs access to 
geasSession to get an GConnections object to create a list. 
geasInstance don't need that.</quote> This meant that 
loading an instance or creating a new instance had to be 
done <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">over the list object</quote>. 
The reason for this was <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">to move 
the resultset / row paradigm into an api. so you have to 
retrieve an object list, before you can get single 
instances.</quote> He explained that the current release of 
Application Server was <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">a (minimal 
features/as soon as possible production ready ) version of 
appserver - I hope that the overnext version will support much 
part of ODMG standart.</quote></p>
