<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">one 
should be able to do useful things with gnue w/o being a 
GNUe developer - BUT - i think they need to be a developer 
of some level to do something - i.e. they shouldnt have to 
be a GNUe tool developer, but they should have application 
development experience</quote>. For testing,
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">currently i have like 3 forms 
i use to 'test' things - as i find forms that 'break' 
things - i try to shovel them into my 'test' suite</quote>. 
He wanted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">to look at unit tester
that will test functions of GNUe w/o actually running forms - 
at some point we will need to build or find a free test suite 
to automate testing</quote> since <quote who="Derek Neighbors">as 
more people start to bring GNUe into production the more 
important test suite will come</quote>.</p>
