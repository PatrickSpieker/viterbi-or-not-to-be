<p>Aditya Gilra (aditya_gilra) said 
<quote who="Aditya Gilra">we're trying to change the list of 
values in a dropdown entry from a trigger</quote> and asked 
how to do this. Derek Neighbors (derek), referring back to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 04 Jun 2002" title="Look-up combo boxes in Forms" />
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">this 
is known issue</quote>, as <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the 
dropdowns get loaded at start time only - it is a problem for 
others as well, we have started to discuss best way to handle
- as we dont want them updating all the time as that could be 
a large penalty hit</quote> on performance. No real conclusion 
had been reached yet.</p>
