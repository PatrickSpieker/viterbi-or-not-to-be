<p>Marcos Dione (StyXman) noted, as previously discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 12 Mar 2002" title="Wizard changes in Designer" />, 
that the code for scrollbars
was currently empty, and asked for suggestions. He was 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">thinking in a kind of block, that 
could have any amount and kind of entry's - you then say how 
much rows want to see at once, and the block should pass that 
info to its childre, i.e., the entry's</quote>. 
Derek Neighbors (derek) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">that was 
jamest original intent iirc</quote>. James Thompson (jamest)
confirmed <quote who="James Thompson">my quick and dirty 
scrollbars were going to do - look at the block/datasource 
to get record count and based upon the rows (visible) set 
the size of the scroller - then set the up/down of the scroolbar 
to only really do a next/prev record event - after each next/prev 
event have the scrollbar look at the top visible record and adjust 
the scroller position to be about right.</quote> Everyone 
encouraged Marcos to try some code out with his own ideas - Derek 
even tried some reverse psychology on him.</p>
