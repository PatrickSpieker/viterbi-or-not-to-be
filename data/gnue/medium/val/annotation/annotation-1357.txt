<topic>Common</topic>

<p>It was asked whether there were perl bindings for GNUe. 
Derek Neighbors (derek_) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">yes 
and no - i expect that the trigger engine</quote> in GNUe Common 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">will eventually support perl
if someone writes the perl hookup</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) 
suggested looking <quote who="Jason Cater">at zope's Perl Script support
- as they have perl bindings for python</quote>. Derek emphasised that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we are not against such a thing but are 
limited on resources so its not high priority as of yet</quote>. 
For people with an interest in writing forms-like interfaces in 
perl, he recommended <a href="http://www.entity.cx">entity</a> -
although it had different goals and hence was not as database-orientated
or cross-platform as GNUe.</p>
