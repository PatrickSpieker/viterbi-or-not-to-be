<topic>Designer</topic>

<p>A problem with Designer was reported - it's was not letting users 
edit anything in the properties editor. Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
that was a known wxPython bug - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">make 
the property editor big enough the scroll bar goes away - and then 
you should be able to edit</quote>. If the object has too many 
properties for the screen size even when maximised, Derek suggested 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">um virtual desktops :) - thas how i 
solved it</quote>.</p>
