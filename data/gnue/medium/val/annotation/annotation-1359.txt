<topic>Base</topic>

<mention>Neil Tiffin</mention>

<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) asked for feedback 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">on packaging and such</quote>. 
He had discussed this with Neil Tiffin (neilt) on 
several occasions, including 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 04 Feb 2002" title="Private GNUe applications and GNUe Templates" />. 
The issue was that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">packages 
have overlap - dcl for example needs contact info as 
would say invoicing (vendors) etc etc etc as would salesforce 
automation - but each needs 'varying' degrees.</quote> At 
one time, a "base" package had been proposed, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">but do to do that schemas and 
such would have be done properly to break apart and 
such</quote>. With the work going on to add contact management 
to DCL and for the Free Software Foundation (FSF), 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">then maybe its time to do it 
more 'officially'</quote>.</p>

<p>He was not sure of the best approach, but expected to 
need <quote who="Derek Neighbors">something like apt/dpkg only 
specifically for gnue to manage dependencies and such</quote>. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said that he had not thought about it much, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">and my mind thinks in relational, 
2-tier fashion</quote>. Derek said that the same principles of 
packaging would apply to n-tier applications using Application 
Server. Jason pointed to a very old 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/ExtendingGNUe.txt">document</a>
of his - <quote who="Jason Cater">but that only addresses 
updating schemas - not dependencies/conversions/upgrades</quote>. 
Derek noted that the document had neatly predicted the need for 
a database-independant way of creating and updating database 
schemas, which they now had with the DCL schema generator that 
used XML. This could be expanded to include not just the data 
about what tables and fields were required, but also meta data 
about dependancies <quote who="Derek Neighbors">to say when 
to use what - obvioulsy its vastly more complex than this - 
but its a start</quote>. Jason said that the existing XML 
parsing code in GNUe could be used <quote who="Jason Cater">so 
you could have a "pre-install" trigger - and a 
"pre-dependency-check" trigger :)</quote>.</p>
