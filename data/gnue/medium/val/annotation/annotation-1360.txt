<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Marcos Dione (StyXman) asked <quote who="Marcos Dione">why 
forms 'drops' widgets that would be outside the current 
form?</quote>. <quote who="Marcos Dione">they don't appear, 
even if I resize the form manually (i.e., with the 
mouse)</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) explained that 
<quote who="James Thompson">the form size is set at startup 
time via it's height and width - it doesn't bother to create UI 
widgets for anything outside that set size</quote>. Marcos said 
that now he was hoping to add a scrollable widget, this might 
need changing. James had <quote who="James Thompson">never 
considered putting widgets inside a scrollable widget</quote>, 
but looking at the code he could not see why this would not
work, and explained how to test in the code whether a widget 
was created or not. Marcos reported <quote who="Marcos Dione">the 
widgets get created, but the ones that 'fall' off window's region 
are not shown...</quote>. James said that the User Interface 
driver must not be re-sizing the container widget when the form 
was resized. It might be possible to write code to do this 
triggered by <quote who="James Thompson">onsize event</quote>.</p>
