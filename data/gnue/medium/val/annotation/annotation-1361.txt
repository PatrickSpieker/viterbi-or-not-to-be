<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Marius Gedminas (mgedmin) asked <quote who="Marius Gedminas">suppose 
I have a numeric field in the database and I create an entry field 
in a form - can I enter NULL values into the db by leaving this field 
blank?</quote> Chad Walstrom (^chewie) suggested logging this as a 
bug in DCL if <quote who="Chad Walstrom">you don't find it in the 
current bug database</quote>. Later, Marius reported 
<quote who="Marius Gedminas">ah, solved the issue with nulls - 
apparently empty entry field is stored as NULL in the db if it is 
typecast as "numeric"</quote>. In his case, <quote who="Marius Gedminas">a 
couple of my field were missing that typecast</quote>. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) asked Marius to close the ticket in DCL for the issue 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">so jamest knows what you did and can look 
to see if either a. there needs to be a fix b. there just needs to be 
better documentation</quote>.</p>
