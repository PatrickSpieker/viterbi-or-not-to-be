<p>Marius Gedminas (mgedmin) asked <quote who="Marius Gedminas">suppose 
I have a master/detail form where for each master record there is a 
fixed number of detail records</quote>. How could he create the empty 
detail records when the master was created, so that they just needed 
editing. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i 
think it can be solved via master/detail hookup along with 
triggers</quote>. Marius noted that this <quote who="Marius Gedminas">is 
basically the same as ticket 58</quote> in DCL.</p>
