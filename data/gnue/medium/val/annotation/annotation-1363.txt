<p>It was asked why GNUe's python source files had # comments 
at the start of each module rather than proper python docstrings. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) thought <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we 
really should be using doc strings - so that we can build things 
with pydoc or happydoc</quote>, as previously discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 02 Jun 2002" title="man and info pages for GNUe" />, 
but <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we dont want code to be littered 
with documentation i.e. the source is not hte place for the api 
manual</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) felt that 
<quote who="Jason Cater">docstrings REALLY reduce the readability 
of the code imho</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">im 
thinking happydoc actually works with # stuff</quote>. Jason agreed. 
Derek said that a file generated from happydoc could form the shell 
of the API documentation.</p>
