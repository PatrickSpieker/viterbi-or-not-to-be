<p>Peter Sullivan said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">OK, based on comments 
in IRC, I don't think that anyone (including me) is totally 100% happy 
with the colour scheme on the new website. So I've pulled together a 
few alternatives for people to look at and provide feedback, or suggest 
other alternatives in our search for something that looks both good and 
suitably professional.</quote> Various people posted comments, based 
on varying browsers and operating systems. Peter summarised the 
results <quote who="Peter Sullivan">for this distinctly unscientific 
survey</quote> which showed an overall slight preference for option
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">3. Light blue navigation bar and no 
border.</quote></p>

really wish we could get a clean logo</quote> Derek Neighbors 
said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">I dont mind cleaning up logo and 
putting it in many different colors and such, but unlike others I 
like the actual logo itself.  It is very simplistic should transfer 
well from anything to letterhead to business cards.</quote> 
Jason disagreed - <quote who="Jason Cater">it relies too heavily 
on shading and anti-aliasing.</quote></p>
