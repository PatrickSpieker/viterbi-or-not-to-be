<p>David Goodenough reported problems trying to install 
Forms and Designer under Debian GNU/Linux. He had 
<quote who="David Goodenough">downloaded the tar.gz files, 
unpacked them into separate directories, and in each I ran 
./setup.py install.</quote> He was getting error messages 
trying to start either Forms or Designer, however. 
Derek Neighbors suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">Instead 
of going into each tool and running setup.py instead at the root
of the tarball run setup-cvs.py this should solve your 
problems.</quote></p>
