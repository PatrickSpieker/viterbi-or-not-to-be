<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 04 Sep 2002" title="GNUe dependencies in Debian GNU/Linux" />, 
Sacha Schlegal (SachaS) thanked Jan Ischebeck (siesel) 
<quote who="Sacha Schlegal">for your guiding through the 
intallation last night</quote>. Jan asked <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">you 
will use mysql ? I would recommend to use postgresql instead, its not 
much more complicated than mysql, and many samples work better using 
postgresql. The forms access is transparent</quote> as GNUe Common 
provided database abstraction, <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">but most 
samples have database creation scripts which are written for postgresql 
- there are just a few ones, which are using the new GSD format</quote> 
which used GNUe Common to write database-independant creation scripts.</p>

<p>Sacha reported <quote who="Sacha Schlegal">the property inspector 
seems to not let me change values, easaly, sometimes.</quote> Jan said 
this was a known <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">wx python bug. You have to 
make the property window so large, that the scrollbar disapears. Then 
you can change values again.</quote> He noted that 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">designer is under heavy development in cvs, 
so it will segfault sometimes :(</quote> He explained that the 
g???cvs files were <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">the scripts to start gnue 
programs directly from cvs source tree. gfcvs is for gnue-forms, gfdes 
for gnue-designer ... So you just ddon't have to install every package 
after every cvs update</quote>. Christian Selig (lupo_) said that 
bug reports for Designer should be sent <quote who="Christian Selig">to 
designer-support at gnuenterprise.org, with version and OS 
information</quote> - of course, including a patch to fix the bug was 
even better! He felt <quote who="Christian Selig">the code is quite 
understandable, even if you are not a python crack and wxPython guru, 
you will grasp the code quite fast</quote>.</p>
