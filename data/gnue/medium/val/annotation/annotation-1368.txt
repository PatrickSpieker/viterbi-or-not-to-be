<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 29 Aug 2002" title="Patches from papo and CVS access policy" />, 
Federico Heinz said that V&#237;a Libre had chosen GNUe as the 
framework to build papo, as they liked its design, vision, license 
and <quote who="Federico Heinz">active, friendly development 
community</quote>. They had also always recognised that 
GNUe was a work in progress, but <quote who="Federico Heinz">decided 
that those were not intractable problems</quote> since they 
had the funding <quote who="Federico Heinz">to solve (not work 
around) any issues that could come up.</quote></p>

<p>There was still no 
doubt this had been the right decision, but there were some practical 
problems they had not anticipated, both in terms of the length of time 
taken to apply patches they had submitted to the main code tree, and 
the lack of time to discuss new development ideas with the main 
GNUe developers. This was causing them problems, as the flip side of 
their funding was a need to meet deadlines. He cited the multi-table 
data source patch, as discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 25 Jun 2002" title="Multi-table Datasources" /> 
as a specific example. They had had to 
maintain their own branch of GNUe simply to make progress, 
although they did not want to, both for PR reasons - 
<quote who="Federico Heinz">the *last* thing we want is to be 
perceived as rogues</quote> - and for practical reasons - 
<quote who="Federico Heinz">As GNUe keeps advancing, our branch 
becomes outdated and we have to somehow merge the changes regularly, 
which consumes a great deal of time from our folks, time that would 
be *much* better devoted to writing code.</quote></p>

<p>He felt <quote who="Federico Heinz">we must
put some mechanism in place by which our contributions can flow more
freely into the GNUe tree. It must be a mechanism that doesn't tie up
our already overloaded project managers, so we can have time to discuss
with them on design and implementation issues. And we need this
mechanism to be in place fast, because every day our branches diverge
more, and that's the last thing any one of us needs.</quote> 
He felt that at least one PAPO developer should be given CVS write 
access. <quote who="Federico Heinz">The current situation is hurting 
both PAPO and GNUe, let's do something about it!</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.05Sep2002">
On IRC</a>, Derek Neighbors (derek) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i 
will attempt to get all patches applied tonight</quote>. Federico Heinz 
(perlhead) said <quote who="Federico Heinz">thank you for the offer.
However, my mail has broader implications than just applying the patches.
My guys have been preparing patches repeatedly, only to find that they 
become outdated before they get applied. And even if they manage to 
create valid recent patches for our current needs, and you manage to 
apply them tonight, we still have the problem of what will happen with 
our future patches.</quote> Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i 
will respond to the email, but in fairness doing your own cvs tree really 
hurts</quote>, although <quote who="Derek Neighbors">a major server 
issue</quote> for GNUe <quote who="Derek Neighbors">hasnt helped 
things</quote>. Federico said <quote who="Federico Heinz">I know the 
separate tree hurts. We don't like it, and I hope I made it clear in the 
mail. It hurts *us*. The problem is that our patches didn't start being 
this huge. They began life as simple things (save for some major 
functionality improvements) But as time went by without them being 
incorporated, they accreted. Most of them could have been incorporated 
as small fixes, only time conspired against it.</quote> He stressed 
<quote who="Federico Heinz">*we want to kill our branch* *we don't like 
it* *we did it because we had no other choice*</quote>, adding 
<quote who="Federico Heinz">Trust me, V&#237;a Libre will continue to 
contribute to GNUe in a major way. We want GNUe to succeed as a coherent 
project. The success of our own project depends from it.</quote></p>

<p>Derek suggested that sending patches to a named contact for 
review before they were applied <quote who="Derek Neighbors">is no 
different than say the linux kernel</quote>. Federico agreed, 
<quote who="Federico Heinz">But as far as I know, major contributors 
to the kernel have commit privileges to their areas of activity.</quote>
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">that is our problem - we dont 
have yet 'areas of activity'. We have one giant cvs tree that has no 
discrimination. That is high on our list to break cvs into smaller 
modules - so we can give commit access by module and such</quote>. 
Federico suggested <quote who="Federico Heinz">You guys are 
overworked as it is. You don't have the *time* to the segmentation.
There are more important things in the queue.</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">then we have to continue with patches i 
think. We have been burned on more than one occassion doing 
differently. Even in patches via libre has done, things were discussed 
in irc and everyone seemed in agreement - yet it was coded in way that 
was not agreed</quote>. He was sure <quote who="Derek Neighbors">it 
was just a communication breakdown (so not criticizing coding or coding 
techniques) - but the idea behind patches is that stuff like that gets 
caught pre checkin not post checkin</quote>. Federico said 
<quote who="Federico Heinz">I doubt the patches were coded in a way that 
was agreed to be *not* the right way. I'm absolutely sure the intent is 
to do things the right way.</quote> Derek agreed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.10Sep2002">
Some days later</a>, Federico was discussing <quote who="Federico Heinz">an 
issue wrt the encoding of UI strings</quote>, and concluded 
<quote who="Federico Heinz">OK, maybe this is *again* due to the fact that 
we're using an older version because our patches aren't in yet.</quote> 
Jason Cater (jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">we need to discuss the 
patches as in your email</quote>. Federico said <quote who="Federico Heinz">I 
am not aware of any thechnical or legal issues holding the incorporation of 
the patches</quote> - <quote who="Federico Heinz">If I undestand it correctly, 
the problem is that you guys are too overwhelmed with work.</quote> Jason 
said he had seen the mail, but <quote who="Jason Cater">gave myself a few days 
to cool off before responding</quote>. Federico said he had 
<quote who="Federico Heinz">tried my best to make the e-mail as matter-of-fact 
as possible. And made sure that I wasn't throwing blames around.</quote></p>

<p>Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I wholy admit that we are not handling 
the patches in the best manner possible - as they shouldn't sit around for a 
month or two BUT by the same token</quote> the patches submitted did not 
always match what he felt had been agreed on the mailing lists or in IRC, and 
in some cases were trying to take GNUe in directions it should not go. 
Federico said <quote who="Federico Heinz">Technical issues are, IMO, the least 
pressing. We *are* aligned with GNUe's direction. Of course, this doesn't mean 
that we won't ever have diverging views. We like to think that we are at least 
able to contribute some original thinking. This will most likely cause a few 
discussions and disagreements in the future. But that's for the good of the 
project.</quote> However, <quote who="Federico Heinz">The problem that looks 
harder to solve is of a more practical nature. You guys are *swamped*. You do 
great work, and have created an amazing project. That takes a lot of effort.
We acknowledge that, we know that you are not ignoring our patches.</quote> 
Jason agreed, <quote who="Jason Cater">but where do we go from 
here?</quote> Marcos Dione (StyXman) said <quote who="Marcos Dione">well, now 
we're trying to resync with *the* gnue and then, I guess, resubmitt the 
patches...</quote></p>

<p>Later, Derek Neighbors (derek) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we need to 
sit down and talk</quote> - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">and discuss how to get 
your tree and our tree back in synch so you can kill your tree and work out of 
cvs head - and we will institute some policies to ensure quick applying of 
patches</quote>.</p>
