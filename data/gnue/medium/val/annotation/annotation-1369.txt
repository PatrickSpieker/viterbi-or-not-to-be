On IRC</a>, Marcos Dione (StyXman) said <quote who="Marcos Dione">I have 
a very serious focus problem</quote> James Thompson (jamest) suggested 
<quote who="James Thompson">lay off the caffine and MTV - it'll help ;)</quote>. 
Marcos explained <quote who="Marcos Dione">the problem is that I have 
this nice fowm with lookups - the lookips are the same entry with 
rows=5</quote>. If he started <quote who="Marcos Dione">writing in this 3rd 
entry. the focus is 'there', even the 'cursor' (that '|' thingy) but as you 
write the leters appear in the 1st (!!!) entry</quote>. If there were 
several rows already queried back, the focus for entry always seemed to 
be the first row after the queried rows.</p>

<p>Later, Marcos posted his problem to the mailing lists, saying he 
had now found the problem, <quote who="Marcos Dione">but not
how to fix it.</quote> He noted that if 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">I use a slow machine, I see that, when 
I click in a 'wrong' row, the cursor (again, that '|' thing) goes 
to the 'correct' (in the terms of gnue) field and *then* to thew 
one clicked. it's a fast flicker, I was not seeing it until I 
started to use this machine</quote> Peter Sullivan suggested 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">The way you describe it working is 
the way I would expect it to - any new input *should* go 
immediately after the last existing record, not to some arbitrary 
later row entry</quote>. John Lenton said this was not really 
the point - <quote who="John Lenton">the problem is that the focus 
splits, i.e. gnue is focused on one place and the ui on another. 
Whether or not gnue or the ui are right is a different 
matter.</quote> Marcos agreed - <quote who="Marcos Dione">that's 
why my suggestion is to tell wx who must be the real widget
with the focus.</quote></p>
