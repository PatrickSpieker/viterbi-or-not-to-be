<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Daniel Baumann (chillywilly), continuing his work on an XML/Object 
parser for GNUe Application Server from 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 02 Sep 2002" title="Using the Common XML parser in Application Server" />, 
was <quote who="Daniel Baumann">being evil and using xml.dom.minidom - 
it is complainign abot some mismacthed tag but I can find the typo</quote>. 
He opened the XML in Emacs xml-mode instead. John Lenton (Chipaca) felt 
that <quote who="John Lenton">xml-mode is useless without a good DTD 
:(</quote> but Daniel reported <quote who="Daniel Baumann">C-c C-v gave 
a better error than the SAX parser</quote> - 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">end tag for "interface" omitted, but OMITTAG 
NO was specified</quote> - <quote who="Daniel Baumann">it helped me find 
the error even with no DTD. DTDs are lame anyway ;) - schemas is where 
it's at</quote>.He asked <quote who="Daniel Baumann">anyone know if there's 
debian packages for the <a href="http://4suite.org">4suite</a> set of xml 
tools</quote>. Sablotron, as discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 05 Jul 2002" title="XSLT support in GNUe Reports" /> 
was suggested as an alternative.</p>
