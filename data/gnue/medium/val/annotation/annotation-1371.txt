<p>Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) was <quote who="Charles Rouzer">wonderin how 
I can make a web-based forms client persistent-like - might require 
javascript or :-( flash</quote>. Derek Neighbors (derek) suggested 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">hmmm look at the</quote> php Forms client
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">in cvs?</quote> Charles said he had - 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">gotta love variables named "$this" 
:-((</quote> He was <quote who="Charles Rouzer">working on a Perl UI 
driver and webmin module - wondering how navigator and the client 
will integrate best</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">um 
variables like $this are HIGHLY acceptable - seriously - its an 
'instance' of an object</quote>. Charles said 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">I've never done OOP - will do that some 
other time - I want somethin workin first ;-)</quote>.</p>

Some days later</a>, Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) said he was 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">working on a GNUe Forms Client perl module..</quote> 
and was <quote who="Charles Rouzer">looking for comments on what I might 
"seperate" in my code.. which would be used in the perl module/library.</quote> 
Peter Sullivan (psu) said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">I think the key message is 
to think about how much you have to do in perl and how much you can reuse - i.e. 
I would definantly re-use GNUe Common</quote>. Charles agreed. Peter even felt 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">you might get 90% of what you want for 10% of the 
effort by just teaching the python version of forms to handle wrapped perl 
triggers - but, this is free s/w and it's your itch ;-)</quote> Charles asked 
<quote who="Charles Rouzer">ok, how would I use GNUe Common?</quote> Peter said 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">there's some docs somewhere, I'm sure - 
jamest wrote something for reinhard when we decided to make appserver use 
common</quote>.</p>

<p>Charles noted <quote who="Charles Rouzer">the php forms client has its 
owncommon</quote>. Peter said he had been under the impression that 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) <quote who="Peter Sullivan">had decided to use the 
python one</quote>. Later, it was explained that Jan has started his own 
common.php file to do database abstraction, but had decided to use 
the python-based GNUe Common as it also contained useful code for dealing 
with master/detail and other issues such as XML-RPC.</p>
