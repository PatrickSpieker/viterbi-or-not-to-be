<p>Arjen Runsink (Suit) was <quote who="Arjen Runsink">checking 
out GNUe and to get started fast I am getting the windows forms and 
designer and Sap-db. Are there any caveats with this combo or will 
it be fairly straight forward?</quote> Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said 
that <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">The most difficult part is to edit 
the connections.conf file to setup Sap-db as your favourite db</quote>. 
He was not sure if there was an example for SAP in the file, but it 
should be the same basic format as <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">for 
postgres etc., you just have to set "provider = sabdb"</quote>. Referring 
to <kcref subject="[IRC] 01 Aug 2002" title="SAP-DB and GNUe on slashdot" /> 
and similar threads, Arjen said <quote who="Arjen Runsink">I have 
come to believe that sap-db is one of the developers' favorites, so 
I expect it is well integrated with designer?</quote> Jan said 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">almost every database which supports 
introspection should work well with designer</quote>. He could not 
remember <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">if the sapdb driver was bundled 
with the windows installers for forms and designer :(</quote> - he 
suggested asking Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) as 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">he is the sapdb specialist.</quote> 
Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) was fairly sure the SAP-DB drivers were 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">not boundled with</quote> the Windows 
setup.exe install. Arjen said he was 
<quote who="Arjen Runsink">currently installing sapdb, will see 
what happens</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, he reported an error message 
<quote who="Arjen Runsink">Driver not installed: sapdb</quote>. 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) guessed <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">you'd 
need a python sapdb driver</quote>. Arjen downloaded it 
<quote who="Arjen Runsink">from sapdb.org, checking where to copy -
what version - looks like version 21 and copy both in forms and 
designer dirs. Ok, I got a login promp when choosing connect</quote>, 
pasting his error message, <quote who="Arjen Runsink">And login does 
not work, same username does make me connect to database using sapdb 
tools :-(</quote>. However, he noted <quote who="Arjen Runsink">Hmm, 
login in to db with sapdb tools an lowercase username an pw worked. 
Doing the same with designer not. But than uname and pw in Uppercase 
and it worked !</quote>. He asked <quote who="Arjen Runsink">Hmm, 
wouldn't I be able to select a table for my form and add some of the 
fields for it?</quote>. Bajusz suggested <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">try 
wizards</quote>. Arjen confirmed he could <quote who="Arjen Runsink">get 
the wizard form but nothing to chose from (?) - argh, I can connect 
to my test database, but cannot link with any table in it, is this 
totally broken in the windows package or should I read some fine manual 
that I just can't happen to find?</quote></p>

<p>Bajusz wondered <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">maybe 
the introspection in gnue SAP-DB driver 
was not completed in 0.3.0 - you can try CVS version, or another 
DB</quote>. Arjen asked which alternative database would be best. 
Bajusz said <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">on linux potgresql, on win 
firebird/interbase or mysql - but if you can meet with derek, he will 
help you with SAP-DB</quote>. Arjen said he was 
<quote who="Arjen Runsink">not especcially hung on sap-db, atm I 
will try anything that works, but as I read you correctly I should go 
and get CVS and all deps and run it on my linux box</quote>. Bajusz 
said <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">you can try CVS on win32 too</quote>, 
although you then had to install the dependencies manually - 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">wxpython and egenix-mx too</quote>. 
Arjen <quote who="Arjen Runsink">wonders why, if all that nice 
stuff is in CVS like sap-db and interbase, a new binary release has 
not been released including those ;-)</quote>. Bajusz explained that 
the <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">core peop are busy</quote>.</p>
