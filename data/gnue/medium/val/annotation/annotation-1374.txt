<topic>Designer</topic>

<p>Christian Selig (lupo) reported a problem with designer, before 
noticing <quote who="Christian Selig">hey, according to my config 
file, this and the option below are outdated</quote>. It was 
explained that gnue.conf was no longer necessary - all tools 
would assume appropriate defult values for conf options. 
Therefore, a quick way of diagnosing problems like this was to 
rename the gnue.conf file to something else temporarily and see if 
the problem went away if all the default values were used.</p>
