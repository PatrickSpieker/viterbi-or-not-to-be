<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) felt that <quote who="Daniel Baumann">btw, 
4ODS is pretty kewl - an ODMG</quote> (Object Data Modelling Group) 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">3.0 implementation</quote> that was 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">part of 
<a href="http://4suite.org">4suite</a></quote>. They were
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">doing some pretty interesting work - all 
100% python - they are doing like an enterprise data repository 
thing</quote>. Christian Selig (lupo) said <quote who="Christian Selig">it 
looks like zope on dope, the xml way</quote> and asked whether it was 
<quote who="Christian Selig">a possible candidate for the "document 
store"?</quote></p>

<p>Daniel said possibly, but <quote who="Daniel Baumann">they 
use a non-cpyleft license</quote>. Christian confirmed that their 
"FourThought License" was derived from the Apache license - 
<quote who="Christian Selig">they have only replaced the names and 
addresses.</quote> Daniel quoted from the GNU web site which said that 
the Apache License was <quote who="Daniel Baumann">a permissive non-copyleft 
free software license with a few requirements that render it incompatible 
with the GNU GPL. We urge you not to use the Apache licenses for software 
you write. However, there is no reason to avoid running programs that have 
been released under this license, such as Apache.</quote> He was not sure 
why it was GPL incompatible, unless it was <quote who="Daniel Baumann">because 
of the advertising clause and naming crud</quote> which was 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">very similar to original BSD license</quote>.
He pointed to <quote who="Daniel Baumann">gnu's 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">explanation</a> of why the 
advertising clase is BAD</quote>.</p>

<p>Daniel noted <quote who="Daniel Baumann">hmmm, they are arging that they 
wanted to protect the name 4Suite - that's why they used this original 
BSD-like license. But that makes no sense to me as copyright and trademark 
are different issues all together...I don't see how letting someone freely 
modify and redistribute the code effects trademark/branding - no one else 
can come along and use your trademarked name even if they have all your 
code.</quote> It was noted that copyright, trademark and patent were all 
different issues, which were all too often lumped together as 'intellectual 
property'.</p>
