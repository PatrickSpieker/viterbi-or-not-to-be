Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) asked <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">about 
standard output tags for reports</quote> - 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">why not FO</quote>? Jason Cater 
(jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">best I can tell, FO specifies 
physical formatting properties (much like an XML version of PCL or 
Postscript) such as fonts, margins, font sizes, colors, etc - 
as opposed to a functional markup (like docbook, latex, etc)</quote>. 
Bajusz agreed - <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">yes, it is for "cosmetics" 
formatting - but reports needs this too</quote>. Jason asked 
<quote who="Jason Cater">so are you thinking we take the FO elements 
that we need and add them to our spec - or just use all of FO as it 
sits?</quote> Bajusz was not sure - <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">maybe 
it's too complex for a business report</quote>. Jason was also 
<quote who="Jason Cater">torn</quote> - <quote who="Jason Cater">the 
GNUe Reports engine could output FO markups right now - currently, we 
have the SimpleTabulation style we could easily add a FormattingObjects 
style that is nothing but XSL-FO so the out: tags would actually be
FO tags</quote> Bajusz could not <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">imagine how 
designer will work with complexity of FO...</quote> Jason agreed.</p>

<p>Jason noted that <quote who="Jason Cater">if we go that route 
I'd want us to commit resources to doing a free python-based implementation
- I have issues with depending on a java program</quote>. Derek Neighbors 
(derek) was more forthright - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i wont depend on 
FO from java (end of story) - i will write my own python FO - or i will use 
reportlabs or such and go straight from xml to native pdf or 
such</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek also said that he <quote who="Derek Neighbors">thought we had 
some</quote> formatting tags defined already <quote who="Derek Neighbors">as 
i had to have that to make the HTML reports</quote>, pasting an example. 
Bajusz agreed, but felt that <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">these far from 
complete for GNUe:Reports:Standard</quote>. He quoted a previous 
post of Jason's which said that the Reports Engine should allow for
<quote who="Jason Cater">a PDF (or HTML or TeX) formatting engine (instead 
of an external XSLT script) for reports of type GNUe:Reports:Standard that 
the engine could load.</quote> However, Bajusz noted that this needed 
standard tags agreeing - <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">the original monthly.grd 
was good enough for a sample, but wasn't declared as a gnue standard</quote>
in the same way <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">as forms has "standard" 
tags</quote>.</p>
