<p>David Goodenough reported <quote who="David Goodenough">Now 
Forms and Designer install and run properly</quote> but he 
could not find out how to define a connection to a postgreSQL 
database. Jason Cater said <quote who="Jason Cater">You will 
need to modify /usr/local/gnue/etc/connections.conf and add an
entry for each database you will use.</quote> He explained 
<quote who="Jason Cater">If you have a production PostgreSQL 
database database called "tiger", your connections.conf file 
might look like:</quote></p>

<p><quote who="Jason Cater">
  [prod]<br />
  provider = psycopg<br />
  host = localhost<br />
  dbname = tiger</quote></p>

<p>Then <quote who="Jason Cater">in your forms definitions, 
your datasources will have a database="prod" property.</quote> 
This example assumed that the psycopg driver was being used to 
connect python to PostgreSQL.</p>
