<p>David Goodenough noted that, in Designer, 
<quote who="David Goodenough">many of the fonts appear too big 
for the data and the window.</quote> Jason Cater said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">The wizard resizing issue is being 
fixed in CVS</quote> and <quote who="Jason Cater">hould be 
resolved in the next release</quote>. Also, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">If the actual form layout (both in 
designer and in the GNUe Forms Client) is appearing larger 
than you'd like, you can add a pointSize=11 into your 
gnue/etc/gnue.conf file (under the [forms] section.) There
should be a sample entry commented out.</quote></p>
