<p>Sacha Schlegal (SachaS) asked whether triggers had to 
be written in code. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said yes, but 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">python is easy :)</quote></p>

<p>Sacha said that, as of time of writing, 
<quote who="Sacha Schlegal">i download the source from cvs 
(cvs update) and install it each time. how does the other way 
work, with the cvs scripts?</quote> Andrew said that 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">./setup-cvs.py is easier</quote>. 
This <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">makes scripts that let you 
use the cvs copy of gnue and sets up the conf dir</quote>. 
There was no need to, as Sacha suggested, 
<quote who="Sacha Schlegal">go into common, forms and designer 
and do a setup in each.</quote> Andrew explained that 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">setup-cvs.py creates programs with 
different names like gfcvs for gnue-forms</quote> so that 
developers could test the CVS version without over-writing the 
official releases.</p>
