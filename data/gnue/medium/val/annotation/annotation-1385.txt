<p>Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) noted that Derek Neighbors (derek) 
would be giving an interview about GNUe on WOPN, the internet 
radio station dedicated to open projects and free software. 
Various technical details about listening to the ogg-format broadcasts
on <a href="http://stream.wopn.org:10000/wopn-broadband.ogg">broadband</a>
were discussed, including the need to have a working sound card 
installed(!)</p>

<p>Later, Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) reported <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">he's 
on WOPN</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) wished <quote who="Jason Cater">we could 
get a transcript - /me is really curious what kind of promises derek is making 
that we will have to deliver :)</quote> Andrew noted that Derek had mentioned 
a <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">new release anyday? now that's something 
new... ;)</quote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.10Sep2002">
After midnight</a>, Derek said he had <quote who="Derek Neighbors">got 
nervous :)</quote> but Daniel felt <quote who="Daniel Baumann">you did 
a great job, imho</quote> - he <quote who="Daniel Baumann">has it 
recorded :)</quote> (over 100MB of .ogg). Andrew said that the WOPN host 
had <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">said he might try &amp; split out the 
interviews into separate files</quote> for the WOPN website archives.</p>

to put with the nick(s) derek, dneighbo, etc.</quote> Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">scary, isn't it :)</quote> Daniel liked 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">his answer to "what is something you hate 
doing?" - "any physical work"</quote>. Derek told Jason 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if people start emailing you asking when 
the next release is and why they cant get it in debian  - its 
chillywilly's fault - not mine</quote>. He had 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">mentioned most of the db drivers came 
out of a pissing contest between you and jamest one afternoon as 
well :)  - so you got plugged personally even</quote>. Andrew 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">wonders how many people listened to 
the interview - 10, perhaps? ;)</quote>.Derek said at least 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">3 - you, hans and chilly ;)</quote>.</p>
