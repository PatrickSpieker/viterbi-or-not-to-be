<topic>Financials (Accounting)</topic>

<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) was not keen on Quickbooks - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">not only is it far from free software - 
but its an ASP - the evil twin of prop software - if i get NOLA 
working</quote> that would be a better alternative as a financials
package for small businesses. Hans Kugler (LuftHans) said 
<quote who="Hans Kugler">currently there aren't any Free Software 
packages, so we'll have to use a non-free package until one is - 
that or just not track accounting stuff, which is what we currently 
do</quote>. Derek suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">paper/pencil
- or large marker ;)</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Nicholas Lee (esands) said he had tried 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">the cvs version of gnucash and the new business 
conponents.  Now I'm fiddling around with acclite to see what thats 
like.</quote> He felt that <quote who="Nicholas Lee">the business part 
of gnucash is functional - It has promising and is usable. However, if 
you've used gnucash before you'll know when I says its very manual</quote>, 
reflecting the fact that the main developer had (not unreasonably) 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">designed it so far mostly for his own use</quote>. 
Derek said it really needed to be developed to do 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">reads/writes to SQL database - 
i.e. flatfiles are just not suitable for business (imho)</quote>. 
Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">I figure its current target is 
home size businesses</quote>. Derek agreed - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">to me its a quickbooks replacement (or sounds 
like) - which there is a market for, but not market persay that gnue is 
going after</quote>. </p>

<p>Later, Nicholas  said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">its probably worth 
changing the acclite footer to point at the gnue web site instead of the 
nola site.  Its not polite otherwise.</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i figured not giving them attribution was 
worse. fwiw: the idea is not to have a fork - just to finish our 
regutting and give back to noguska - at which point if they dont like 
we fork</quote>. Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">Sure, but for 
the purposes of bug reports acclite is not their problem.  Since its not 
their development</quote>. Derek agreed, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">though 
it was never meant as public consumption - short of gnue folks helping us 
review our changes :) it kind of grew into more than that, because we were 
slow getting changes back to nola</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.11Sep2002">
Some days later</a>, Nicholas asked <quote who="Nicholas Lee">is there a 
reason why you guys decided to base acclite on this instead of 
sql-ledger?</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) said that 
<quote who="Jason Cater">sql-ledger looks really bad under the 
hood</quote>. It was noted that sql-ledger was written in 
uncommented perl. Nicholas felt that <quote who="Nicholas Lee">nola 
has some issues as well.  Like at the moment it doesnt seem to have a 
sales tax acculation flag for vendor invoices.  Might have missed it 
though</quote>. Jason agreed there were issues - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">that's why we branched it :) - 
but the underlying structure looked by far more advanced than most of 
the free accounting packages we looked at</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Jason asked <quote who="Jason Cater">is gnucash actually 
usable?</quote> Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">it's missing some small business features
- they are adding that - I think it may be in cvs</quote>. Jason 
said <quote who="Jason Cater">there's no way I'd use gnu-cash for small 
business - it just ain't right</quote>. Daniel said 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">well of course not - it's "personal" finance
and as derek mentioned before - a different market ;)</quote>
Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">gnucash is usable.  And their 
are some small business features in the cvs; they are workable, but 
require some more polish.  I think it does have scheduled now in the 
cvs as well - I'd check but my machine with the gnucash cvs deb is 
still broken</quote>.</p>

<p>Nicholas asked <quote who="Nicholas Lee">is it possible to get 
read access to the acclite cvs?  Would make hacking on it a little 
easier.</quote> Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">unfortunately 
we don't have anonymous cvs for acclite - I can set up ssh-based 
access</quote>. Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">That would 
be better than downloading the 2Mb *-09-10.. and discovering it was 
the same as 09-08.</quote>. He asked <quote who="Nicholas Lee">what's 
the goal with acclite at the moment?  What sort of work needs 
doing? is it tidying up postgres issues, like that ''/'0' defaults 
patchs I forwarded though or working on the gnue side of things?</quote> 
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I think there are still a few oddities 
left over from our conversion from mysql to postgresql - but the biggest 
goal is to write GNUe Forms screens for the various PHP screens. Probably 
the first goal is little stuff like you posted - that are showstoppers when 
testing</quote>.</p>

<p>Nicholas asked about coding style. He <quote who="Nicholas Lee">hates 
the (non) ident in nola's php files. Crazy mad-driving screen fulls of 
characters...</quote>. Derek agreed - his php coding/indentation style 
was heavily influenced by python, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">though im 
not a nazi - i.e. if its code im not complaining - but this is one reason 
i liked python so much - is it elminates this debate entirely 
:)</quote></p>
