<p>Further to
<kcref subject="[IRC] 09 Sep 2002" title="Free financials packages for small businesses" />, 
Nicholas Lee (esands) agreed that <quote who="Nicholas Lee">Definitely gnue 
and gnucash target different markets.  The big different though between the 
two products is that gnucash is stable having reached MILESTONE 1. 
Gnue is still work in progress. Useful no doubt, but still needing 
further work.</quote> Derek Neigfhbors (derek) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we have really hit past our milestone one - 
as our first milestones were for the framework not the applications - 
and soon now, we will enter first phase of application development. 
Expect working goodies within the month - and kick butt goodies within 6 
months</quote>. He had sold GNUe <quote who="Derek Neighbors">to a few 
customers last month alone - there is this fixation that 'shrinkwrap' means 
good and complete</quote> which he felt was often unwarrented - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">oh well different markets i suppose</quote>.</p>

<p>Nicholas said <quote who="Nicholas Lee">Sure, but you are a core developer. 
Consider the part-developer who spends a lot of time doing business stuff (ie. 
me ;). I'm ready to do some work (hell I've compiled gnucash cvs to for myself) 
but I don't have a lot of time to spend trying to get things going. Or at least 
that's been my experience so far with gnue. Of course since its a FS/OSS type 
project I've missed much in the last three months. Things are probably different 
again</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">on a BLANK debian 
install gnue takes no longer than say 20 minutes to install (including postgres) 
- on redhat/mandrake then yes its hell, but i cant help crappy packaging 
;)</quote></p>

<p>Nicholas felt that <quote who="Nicholas Lee">the lack of 
documentation make it tricky to use.  Although I haven't checked the document 
in the last couple months.</quote> Derek agreed that the 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">yes docs are not quite there - problem is its a 
framework not an application - so making docs is difficult - as there is a 
certain amount of given one needs to know - until we get a real users 
manual</quote>. But <quote who="Derek Neighbors">docs for a framework (that 
covers all users) is a HUGE task - and we dont want our developers doing it - 
and we havent had volunteers :)</quote> He accepted that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we have personal needs for gnue - and so we are 
concentrating on the tools and our needs - we would love someone to help with 
docs</quote>. Nicholas agreed <quote who="Nicholas Lee">itches to scratch 
are the reason projects like this exist.  Wouldn't be fun for you to do it 
otherwise</quote>.</p>

<p>He suggested <quote who="Nicholas Lee">You guys probably need something 
like a wiki/fom.  Make document in the first instance a communitity 
task</quote> Derek felt that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">wiki's are good 
for informal documentation and throwing ideas around - but i dont think they 
shoudl be a documentation substitution</quote>. Hans Kugler (LuftHans) felt 
that <quote who="Hans Kugler">docs with room for comments on the end are 
better, they're semi-wiki</quote>. Nicholas felt <quote who="Nicholas Lee">I 
think though at the moment you don't really have any formal document. 
Something that's easy keep up to date is more important than something that 
is 'formal'.</quote> Derek said that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we like to 
deal with thing slike we do in business world i.e. get up and go to someones 
desk - in our world the equivalent is IRC</quote>. Nicholas said 
<quote who="Nicholas Lee">Business process is important to document. 
Otherwise if you have outsides/newbies entering a business unit without 
knowledge of how tasks are processed its harder to bring them up to speed 
without effective resources</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">you 
misunderstood me - i didnt say business process was unimportant to document. 
At work we have a professional technical writer that comes to our meetings 
and translates our development process - i dont have that here ;)</quote>
He noted that Peter Sullivan (psu) <quote who="Derek Neighbors">does this to a 
degree with his kernel cousins and i adore him dearly for it</quote>. 
Nicholas agreed - <quote who="Nicholas Lee">definitely. kc is the only reason 
I'm able to follow what's happening with gnue sometimes</quote>.</p>
