<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Phil Cole (fil_c) asked <quote who="Phil Cole">what's the policy on 
submitting patches... say if I've found some typos in the docs, or maybe 
a howto for redhat 7.3?</quote> Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">for now sumbit to info@gnue.org - 
if its for other than minor documentation we will need copyright 
assignment</quote> He appreciated that copyright assignment was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">a barrier, but have solace that there will 
be no scares (like there was with python recently) about who can protect 
the code and whom cant</quote>.</p>

<p>Phil said <quote who="Phil Cole">ok... it's a tiny patch to change 
GEAS to "App Server" in the main README.  But I've sent it to 
info@gnue.org to get a taster.</quote> Later, Reinhard M&#252;ller 
(reinhard) confirmed <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">I highly appreciate 
your patch - we have defined it as incorrect to use the acronym "GEAS" 
outside the code - to clearly distinguish between (old) GEAS and (new) 
appserver</quote>.</p>

The next day</a>, Phil Cole (fil_c) <quote who="Phil Cole">wonders if 
there's any place people would recommend to look at about the copyright 
issue... ... just been sent an assignment form, but I don't really have 
any background on it.</quote> Nick Rusnov (nickr) explained 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">generally assignment forms are to give 
copyright ownership in addition to you to another organization such 
as the FSFM</quote>. Phil discovered 
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/why-assign.html">an explanation</a>
on the FSF web site. It was explained that the paperwork did not 
normally take long - minor patches 
would sometimes be accepted on the basis that author had agreed to 
give copyright assignment rather than wait for the full paperwork to 
be completed and returned. The intent was to protect the project, not 
to bog things down.</p>
