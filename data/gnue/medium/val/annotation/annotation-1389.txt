<p>Phil Cole (fil_c) was <quote who="Phil Cole">Just trying to follow 
through the install notes for redhat7.2, and update for 7.3 - 
... downloaded from cvs, but seem to be missing objectserver/setup.py 
... infact anything in objectserver ;( - is it dead?</quote> 
Jason Cater (jcater) confirmed this - <quote who="Jason Cater">you 
should be in appserver/ :)</quote> Phil reported that he needed 
<quote who="Phil Cole">new versions of wxPython and co for RedHat 
7.3 :(</quote> - he was getting <quote who="Phil Cole">Python C API 
version mismatch</quote> errors. It was noted that versions of 
wxPython were dependant on specific versions of wxwindows and 
python, but it was hoped that the RedHat distributions would have 
been consistant on this. Phil said he had got the dependancies working, 
and would e-mail these, along with an updated version of 
<quote who="Phil Cole">the install guide for redhat 7.3.</quote>.
It was noted that the various documents people had submitted 
about installing GNUe on different GNU/LInux distributions, or 
other platforms, needed to be in a single location on the 
website, under 'Quick Start Guides' or similar.</p>
