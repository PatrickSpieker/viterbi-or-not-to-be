<topic>Designer</topic>

<p>Stan Klein reported problems <quote who="Stan Klein">trying 
to use designer in a CVS-based installation</quote>, and 
pasted his traceback error message. He was not getting the 
same problem on a machine with an older installation of 
GNUe. Jason Cater said <quote who="Jason Cater">I fixed 
the typo in Designer's code that throws this exception. 
However, I think there's a problem in your setup that is triggering
this.  Is your gnue.conf file empty?</quote></p>
