<p>Marcos Dione (StyXman) reported a bug in Forms - 
<quote who="Marcos Dione">open a form that has several blocks - 
say 2 - now, click in the *frame* of one entry widget of the 
second block while the focus is in one widget of the first 
block - with this click, the cursor is changed to that widget, 
while the focus is in the other block's entry</quote>. 
He noted <quote who="Marcos Dione">it does not even need to be 
entries from different blocks. it's a wx problem, I 
think...</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) had 
<quote who="Jason Cater">seen that bug before - but could've 
swore we resolved it</quote>. Marcos said he would
<quote who="Marcos Dione">try that on a new gnue. Another one: 
select some text (with the mouse) and pres &lt;backspace&gt;. 
it gets unselected and only the char @ the left of the cursor 
gets deleted.</quote></p>
