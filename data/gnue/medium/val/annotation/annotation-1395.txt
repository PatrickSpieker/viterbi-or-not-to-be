<p>Jeff Bailey (jbailey) was asked if he could help getting 
Debian GNU/Linux packages (.debs) done for GNUe. Jeff said he 
should be able to help, but was currently getting caught up, and 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">I'm now a co-maintainer for DEbian 
glibc.</quote> This was because of his work for GNU/Hurd, 
which depended heavily on glibc. Even so, Nick Rusnov (nickr) 
felt <quote who="Nick Rusnov">thats like 'oh by the way I'm 
now the president of ex-soviet republic of georgia'</quote>. 
Jeff said an important pre-requisite of him doing 
GNUe debs was to <quote who="Jeff Bailey">try getting gnue to 
work one day. Y'know that I've still *never* gotten it installed, 
right? =)</quote> It was suggested that, if they had help for 
the first run of Debian packages, the GNUe team could probably 
do most of the maintenance work themselves afterwards, as they 
were mainly Debian GNU/Linux users anyway. Nick, referring to 
his efforts in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 30 May 2002" title="Debian packages for GNUe and DCL" />, 
said <quote who="Nick Rusnov">Well if dist-utils wheren't so 
cockeyed they'd be done by now</quote> Jeff agreed - 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">The limited python hacking I've done 
has all stayed nicely with automake. =)</quote> Nick said 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">if they put files in sane places or at 
least in a way that could be easily specified on the command line 
without horking the 'install path' it'd be so easily</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Jeff asked <quote who="Jeff Bailey">So, are you looking 
for a mass conversion from distutils to the autotools finally? 
=)</quote> It was explained that none of the core GNUe developers 
were keen on autotools either. James Thompson (jamest) felt 
that <quote who="James Thompson">dist utils? it sucks. It just 
sucked less that autoconf for python</quote>. Jeff asked 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">What is it that you needed out of autotools 
that it failed at?  Last time we spoke (like 18 months ago) you 
hadn't tried it at all.</quote> James said that
<quote who="James Thompson">gnue used autoconf before distutils
from the start - we rapidly switched to distutils at that time 
autoconf had no support for python beyond some 3rd party patches
- at least that is what I recall</quote>. Jeff noted that 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">automake has native support for python 
now</quote> although <quote who="Jeff Bailey">i've only used it for 
tiny projects, though.  I had hoped you had tried it since 
then.</quote> Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said that 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">I was adding auto* support then someone 
told me I better stop</quote>. James found this hard to believe - 
<quote who="James Thompson">since when do you listen to what people 
tell you?</quote> - asking <quote who="James Thompson">did you guys 
switch chilly's while I was away?</quote> Daniel said 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">nope - I am a wiser 
chillywilly</quote>.</p>

<p>Daniel asked <quote who="Daniel Baumann">why does distutils 
suck for debian packaging?</quote> Jeff said 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">Because alot of things seem quite difficult 
to override</quote>. He explained some of the steps involved in 
creating a Debian package, saying that <quote who="Jeff Bailey">A 
package that's done properly with auto* and libtool and such takes 
me 2-4 hours to package now. (where by properly, I mean they actually 
implemented it *well* with those tools) (half the time I have to send 
patches upstream so that they're using the tools well)</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Daniel told Jason Cater (jcater) 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">jbailey wants us to switch to auto* 
;)</quote> Jason retorted <quote who="Jason Cater">yeah, and ppl in 
hell want icewater :)</quote> Jeff felt that was a 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">Good analogy!</quote></p>
