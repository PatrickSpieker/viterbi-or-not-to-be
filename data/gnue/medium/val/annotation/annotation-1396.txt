<p>Phil Cole (filc) asked <quote who="Phil Cole">how do I create the 
gnue/www base directory as stated in the gnue/README.... or is this a 
misnomer?</quote> Jason Cater (jcater) noted <quote who="Jason Cater">um
for some reason I think the www/ directory was moved last week - I didn't 
receive any notice but noticed that it was no longer valid</quote>. He 
confirmed that <quote who="Jason Cater">www was a hack by the gnu.org 
administrators to let us maintain our www page on their servers. 
I think they've made us consistent with the other projects, now.</quote> 
Phil said he would <quote who="Phil Cole">send a patch in to remove it 
from the README</quote>.</p>
