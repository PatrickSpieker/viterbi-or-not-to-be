<Vee2d2> they had me wait as they still dont have room for me yet.. ;)
<Vee2d2> playing tomorrow by ear as well
<Vee2d2> noticed new docs so I'm up'ing to check 'm out.. 
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> just uploaded latest pdfs, as a matter of fact
<jcater> ( http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/docs/forms/ for our irc-log viewers)

<SachaS> sku = stock keeping unit right?
<SachaS> yep must be.
<SachaS> and each item in stock has a sku number.

<SachaS> hi derek
<derek> hi SachaS
<LuftHans> derek: we've been spreading rumors about you
<SachaS> hi LuftHans
<derek> hopefully they were nice and gushy
<derek> as the real me is quite boring
<derek> hmmm i love when clients pass me windows virii that don't affect me
<LuftHans> hallo SachaS
<LuftHans> derek: announced the workshop at the devel mtg
<derek> cool
<derek> i just sent you an email on it
<chillywilly> w00t, got the hurd installed on this lappy in a spare partition
Action: derek notes the tone is probably nasty sounding (though not meant to be overtly so)
Action: derek is not in a good mood in general right now
<derek> probably should go vent in blog
<SachaS> LuftHans: yesterday you told me you are going to get involved in an inventory project.
Action: LuftHans goes and checks his email again
<SachaS> LuftHans: I am curious. How do you know, how an inventory system works?
<LuftHans> SachaS: I don't, but I won't let that stand in my way :)
<LuftHans> derek: got your mail, will respond in a few
<LuftHans> SachaS: they currently are using vb and m$access, it seems to be a fairly simple setup with some somewhat complex forms
<LuftHans> I figure I can reimpliment what they have. I'll fix a couple of UI probs ( dual-entry in several places ) and give them a more stable environment
<SachaS> LuftHans: I see :) I see.
<LuftHans> hopefully it leads to further work, some of which might be in actually developing GNUe/GNUe SB
<SachaS> eg. i have to implement an inventory system. so my first question is: what is an inventory system.
<SachaS> and then you have 10 people and 10 different views of what an inventory system is :)
<derek> it really depends
<derek> that is like asking what is 'position control'
<derek> it means different things to different people
<derek> depending on vertical industry
<SachaS> exactly
<derek> and size of business
<derek> a retail business thinks of inventory a bit differently than say a manufacturer
<SachaS> yes
<derek> and a manufacturer that only 'assembles' things bought from other people might think of inventory different from the manufacturer that actually fabricates their own products from raw material
<derek> or such
<derek> though i think they are all very similar
<SachaS> yes
<SachaS> what do you suggest how to deal with this problem ?
<SachaS> find the similarities. and then the specialties ?
<derek> depends
<derek> the best way to learn is by doing
<derek> the problem is to get "learned" you have to be exposed to large numbers of installations
<SachaS> yeah good answer
<derek> if you were to do the gnue-proper way
<derek> you would study every business you could find
<derek> write lots of white papers
<derek> and ask any and everyone to comment
<derek> and try to build the largest tome of knowledge you could to begin an implemenation with
<derek> if you do it the gnue-sb way
<derek> you find one customer willing to use it TODAY
<derek> implement for them
<derek> and then when the next guy comes along learn the differences add them to your package and refine
<derek> rinse and repeat with every customer until you have something that appears to be working for 80% of the people untouched
<derek> i.e. SAP and friends didnt get where they were over night 
<derek> it took 25 years of 'soap, lather, rinse, repeat' for them too :)
<SachaS> true
<SachaS> your doing both ways ;) sb and proper gnue
<SachaS> ok. back to some reading.
<LuftHans> http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/industry/08/05/linux.software.ap/index.html
<LuftHans> $500,000 for a test, though :(
<derek> SachaS: yes as both ways have merit
<derek> one is faster than the other
<derek> one is probably a "cleaner" way

<derek> reinhard: says he refuses to speak german with you unless you use that cool austrian "hick" accent like arnold has ;)
<derek> so reinhard, what would the austrian papers write if Arnold was elected the first austrian born governor of california ;)
<reinhard> they would be mostly proud
<reinhard> i fear ;-)
<LuftHans> "better them than us" :)
<LuftHans> what'll they write if Larry Flynt wins?

<SachaS> warning: install: modules installed to '/usr/local/gnue/lib/python/', which is not in Python's module search path (sys.path) -- you'll have to change the search path yourself
<SachaS> where is sys.path on debian unstable with python 2.2 ?
<ajmitch> sys.path is a python variable
<SachaS> ajmitch where do I have to set the variable? 
<ajmitch> in python :)
<ajmitch> but if you're starting gnue apps with the scripts, you don't need it afaik
<SachaS> :) ajmitch.
<SachaS> thanks
<LuftHans> hey, is there a non-gui interface for running the forms?
<derek>  -u curses
Action: LuftHans is looking at the new Developers-Guide
<derek> oh way non gui as no interaction?
<derek> you could make python scripts that use common
<derek> and have them be unattended
<LuftHans> ooh, wow, fun blowup...
<LuftHans> curses is what I wanted
<derek> curses was poorly maintained for a long time
<derek> then it got a lot of attention just before 0.5.0 and was brought to a nearly working state
<derek> but likely with the changes in cvs it has fallen to less than maintained again
<LuftHans> scripted would be cool too, but right now in an xterm over ssh would be mucho awesome :)
<derek> but shouldnt need a ton of work to get it going again
<derek> LuftHans: i regularly make ssh tunnels to postgres db
<derek> and run gtk client locally to ssh tunnelled postgres over net
<LuftHans> not putting it in the background helps too :)
<derek> and honestly its so seamless i dont notice that its not on my local net
<derek> LuftHans: yeah kind of hard to do data entry in a curses& mode ;)
<LuftHans> derek: yeah, but I like options, options are good :)
<LuftHans> options for failed companies, however, are worthless :(
<derek> well they pay for recyclable paper dont they :)
<LuftHans> I don't even have paper copies
<LuftHans> BTW, I'm one bug away from being able to do this in PHP
Action: LuftHans turns up the heat ;-).
<ajmitch> evil
<derek> if you want to use php thats fine with me
<derek> i dont have time to help get you up to speed with GNU Enterprise right away

<SachaS> using gnue-cvs hourly snapshot
<SachaS> ajmitch have installed both ??? 2.4 and 2.2
<SachaS> oh acutaly 2.2
<SachaS> libwxgtk2.2-python
<ajmitch> you need 2.4
<SachaS> ok ;)
<ajmitch> iirc there were backports to woody that jcater did
<ajmitch> but you're using debian unstable anyway...
<ajmitch> so apt-get install libwxgtk2.4-python 
<ajmitch> :)
<SachaS> :) thanks yep thats it
<SachaS> designer gets nicer and nicer 
<ajmitch> sure
<LuftHans> python dictionary?
<ajmitch> hmm?
<LuftHans> assoc array?
<ajmitch> I guess, a dictionary is key-value pairs
<LuftHans> yup, assoc array, hash, named list
<derek> LuftHans: if you dont know what python dictionary is
<derek> no wonder you dont like python

<SachaS> hi Vee2d2 i see you are active in building/discussing an inventory system (plus-minus)
<Vee2d2> sure
<SachaS> cool.
<SachaS> you guys doing arias/gnue-sb at moment. integration of arias into gnue-sb?
<SachaS> or checking how things are done in arias and aking the good things and forgetting the bad things?
<Vee2d2> I'm not, in particular, but I believe jcater is working on that to some extent
<jamest> jcater works on everything, he's not human
<Vee2d2> I intend to do some of that when I get moving again
<Vee2d2> ;)
<jamest> but no one believes me
<Vee2d2> donut powered codebot
<jamest> exactly
<jamest> have people tested the pre-releases?
Action: SachaS installed cvs-hourly snapshot today.
<jamest> if we follow gnue tradition then the answer should be "no, i use cvs"
<SachaS> install process was fine :)
<lupo__> subversions sucks today.
Action: SachaS just found Mikes gnue-sb feature list
<Vee2d2> jamest: I looked for them breifly last night with that intent but didnt find them
<jamest> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/downloads.php
<jamest> the pre-releases link
<SachaS> Vee2d2 i like your list
<Vee2d2> SachaS: it'd be nice to embellish it some more.. 
<SachaS> Vee2d2 I downloaded the tarball from gnue-sb today, they are the cvs files ...
<SachaS> Vee2d2 guess I have to put it into my cvs server, and then check them out locally
<Vee2d2> SachaS: I think that's not working properly, it'd be best to just check it out
<lupo__> damnit
<lupo__> now subversions refuses ssh and rsh connections
<lupo__> a.k.a. "no updates"
<Vee2d2> lupo__: yea, seems to be afu atm. ;)
<lupo__> Vee2d2: i need uuuuupdates! fast! *dyingfromoldversions*
<lupo__> oh
<lupo__> wait
<lupo__> i think it's working again. WHOHO!
<jamest> lol
<jamest> what you cvs up'n?
<SachaS> Vee2d2 you got the two liner for cvs checkout of gnue-sb?
<lupo__> jamest: whaddayamean?
<SachaS> Vee2d2 got it.
<Vee2d2> SachaS: https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=gnue-sb gives you the skinny, I think
<jamest> <lupo__> Vee2d2: i need uuuuupdates! fast! *dyingfromoldversions*
<lupo__> jamest: /me wants new versions from gnue and wants to up fsfe/projects/education stuff.
<SachaS> Vee2d2 you guys working against gnue cvs in gnue-sb?
<jamest> what is arias?
<Vee2d2> SachaS: I am, but I think anyone useing 0.5.x should be ok
<SachaS> cool.
<SachaS> Vee2d2 the schema describes the database, eg tables etc?
<SachaS> wow designer can read schemas.
<Vee2d2> SachaS: yip
<jamest> SachaS: what distro you running?
<SachaS> jamest: debian unstable
<SachaS> gnue-schema, i think i am impressed :9
<SachaS> i think i am excited
<Vee2d2> SachaS: are you talking about the schema navigator in designer?
<SachaS> Vee2d2 yes and the gnue-schema tool
<SachaS> Vee2d2 schema navigator .. actually object navigator when i open a gsd file
<SachaS> just inserted a table, guess i cannot add a field yet to that new table ?
<SachaS> no problem
<Vee2d2> interesting.. I've never used this aspect of designer
<Vee2d2> I have been using things like psql, phppgadmin, phpmyadmin and the like to manage the actual tables and then use designer to bring them into the gnue world
<SachaS> :)

<jamest> dneighbo: no
<Vee2d2> arias.sf.net
<Vee2d2> reincarnation of nola
<jamest> why's it in gnue-sb cvs?
<jamest> and what's it's status?
<jcater> hey dneighbo
<jcater> jamest: they are merging w/gnue-sb
<jamest> the foolz!
<jamest> er, i mean good
<jcater> we are taking their AP/GL/AR schema and combining w/our Contacts and Item management
<jamest> what's the status of all this?
<jcater> same as the status of all our stuff
<jcater> "Started"
Action: jcater ducks :)
<jamest> started as in gnue-desginer started
<jcater> I've done a few forms
<jamest> or as in gnue-nav started
<jcater> not sure if I've committed them or not
<jcater> ah
<jcater> more like gnue-reports started
<jcater> some usable stuff
<jcater> but not ready for the masses
<jamest> well, i need inv control/shipping dept stuff ASAP
<jcater> ooooo
<jamest> with barcoding
<jamest> picklists
<jamest> etc
<jcater> well, that's outside of the arias merge
<jcater> that's what Vee2d2 has been working on
<jcater> pester him
<jamest> i'm willing to bet alot of this i can put into gnue-sb 
<Vee2d2> mommy!
<jamest> here Vee2d2, Vee2d2, Vee2d2
<jamest> nice Vee2d2
<jamest> net? what net?
<Vee2d2> I'm somewhat in the same boat as LuftHans, trying to get myself up to a useable speed. Hoping I might have a chance to kick it some more one or more of the evenings this week, will be going out of town again this weekend... wish I had a useable laptop :(
<dneighbo> yeah i think that needs are similar across the board
<lupo__> is arias a bit closer to international usage than initial gnue-sb design?
<dneighbo> jcater: is there schema stuff in designer in cvs to 'create' tables?
<jcater> ?
Action: dneighbo is going to whip up a "registration" database for GNU Enterprise training classes
<dneighbo> needing to know if designer will let me make a table or if i need to emacs up an xml file ;)
<jcater> there are designer wizards that extract a schema from a database
<jcater> this works reasonably well
<jcater> but aside from that, no
<Vee2d2> dneighbo: appears so.. file->new->schema
<SachaS> I could add a table but ... no fields for that table.
dsmith (~dsmith@mail.actron.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> yeah, I've been so focused on forms support in designer
<jcater> i haven't done much on schema support
<dneighbo> was not a complaint, just a question
<SachaS> when i generate sql code thats all naked tables without any functions and the like; because you want to have the functions in triggers (not down in the database)?
<SachaS> to be able to support several databases?
<dcmwai> hello SachaS I see you talking about inventory :)

<dcmwai> damn... 
<dcmwai> SachaS, I've been wroking with arias to change it db so that a work order can be done when doing a PO
<dcmwai> wxPythonSrc-2.4.0.7 ??? I'm only using pyton 2.2 why use 2.4???
<Vee2d2> 2 different things
Action: Vee2d2 gets something to eat
<jcater> dcmwai: cvs update and try again
<dcmwai> jcater, Just did that update before I post the problem..
<lupo__> dcmwai: 2.4 is the wxPython version, not the required Python version!
<jcater> dcmwai: update again
Action: dcmwai supect that this is cause by python... will do update
<jcater> it's actually caused by GTK
<jcater> not wx or python
<jcater> which is what makes it so hard to fix

<dcmwai> jcater, Guess what...
<dcmwai> jcater, I finnaly solve this damn problem...
<jcater> cvs update again
<jcater> how?
<dcmwai> gnue-forms/src/uidrivers/wx/MenuBar.py" Line 59 -60 the keys
<dcmwai> comment them and jobs done.. :)
<jcater> um
<jcater> no
<jcater> cvs update and try aggain
<dcmwai> Damn ... Python... why don't they say so in the first place..
<dcmwai> jcater, Yes it does..
<jcater> yes it does what?
<dcmwai> jcater, should I remove the files I modified as it will me merge.
<jcater> I'm sure that stops the bug
<jcater> but I don't think that's an acceptable fix
<dcmwai> s/me/be
<jcater> yeah, remove your files
<jcater> or file
<dcmwai> jcater, Let try..
<dcmwai> jcater, did we have any there choices? other then python?
<jcater> ?
<jcater> you are talking to a big fan of python
<jcater> so that's a loaded question
<dcmwai> jcater, NAN.. not working..
<jcater> what error now?

<dcmwai> beg///
<dcmwai> jcater, did we have any other better gui? or ... 
<jcater> well
<dcmwai> hum... nan that is not an options..
<jcater> we're workong on native GTK, curses, native Win32, QT 3
<jcater> so, yeah
<jcater> but wx has given us the biggest bang for the buck initially
<dcmwai> on great ... but it will be so lot more harder isn't it?
<dcmwai> biggest bang for for buck?
<dcmwai> s/on/Oh ...
<jcater> it got us on the most possible platforms with the least amount of effort
<jcater> cvs update and try again

<lupo__> Vee2d2: yep.
<lupo__> jcater: Do I have to save the file first?
<jcater> save what file?
<Vee2d2> does the 'Run Form' in designer read the file from disk or designer?
<lupo__> before calling the "Run Form" menu item
<jcater> oh
<jcater> the Run Form menu item may or may not work
<jcater> I was working on it recently trying to get it to work again
<Vee2d2> :)
<lupo__> ah
<lupo__> okay :)
<jcater> dcmwai: forth time's a charm? cvs update and try again

<jcater> sure
<jcater> just set my pass word to: GTKmustDieDieDIeDie
<jcater> (just joking)
<havoc> QT is much better, from a development standpoint
<havoc> *much* better
<jcater> GTK likes to second guess what I'm doing
<jcater> which is very frustrating
<havoc> QT is designed very well
<havoc> IMHO anyway
<jcater> I agree
<havoc> (having used both QT and GTK)
<havoc> porting to win32 is also much easier w/ QT

<SachaS> does schema-navigator in designer look at the database tables and create the schema accordingly?
<SachaS> or simply list the fields of the tables it gets from the db ..inspections?

<btami> hi

<jcater> SachaS: right now, only the forms module uses the Schema Navigator
<jcater> you can click and drag from schema navigator onto the page grid
<jcater> and automatically create fields, blocks, datasources, etc
<btami> jcater: i have to say it doesn't works on win32
<dcmwai> jcater, any hints?
<btami> :(
<jcater> :(
<jcater> dcmwai: cvs update and try again
<jcater> it appears to work now
<dcmwai> oh
<dcmwai> what is the main problem then
<jcater> gtk sucks
<dcmwai> Ah.. finally.. it work..
<dcmwai> Oh yea....
<jcater> off to lunch...
<btami> jcater: is there any reason simple wizard limits field length to 25 ?
<dcmwai> jcater, ok enjoy..
<jcater> btami: to keep the size of the form reasonable
<btami> but i have length 30 in my tables
<jcater> it doesn't actually limit the user to 25 characters
<jcater> just only displays 25 at a time
<jcater> we can up the default to 30
<jcater> but we needed some display limit
<jcater> as we don't want to display 2000 length strings as a width of 2000
<btami> 80 ?
<btami> :)

<dcmwai> SachaS, what atm? again
<dcmwai> SachaS, I'm a developer in arias :)
<SachaS> :( i never followed what aria, and nola were ...
<SachaS> guess two projects which had some parts of an small ERP working
<dcmwai> SachaS, Yes.. too small that take too much time to make change ...
<SachaS> so you bring your knowledge, experience from arias to gnue/gnue-sb?
<dcmwai> SachaS, I bring myself to gnue-sb :) after I know that gnue-sb is actually doing something similar on nola.
<dcmwai> change so that it support postgresql.
<dcmwai> make a framework that follow gnue-sb and test if that break :)
<SachaS> ??
<SachaS> i dont understand what you mean.
<dcmwai> SachaS, i bring all things I've to gnue-sb until I've got a working version (web) of gnue-sb then arias development may be stop :)
<SachaS> ok.
<dcmwai> SachaS, any comment about inventory...
<dcmwai> SachaS, Are you an Expert or with experiences on that fileds.. I do need some help.
<SachaS> i wish i were expert
<SachaS> my background is banking and computer science and ebXML (electronic business XML)
<SachaS> one day I want to look at gnue communicating to gnue
<dcmwai> SachaS, Oh you are a xml expert that is good.. try XUL before?
<SachaS> dcmwai sorry never used XUL myself
<dcmwai> nvm but i did love it UI :)
<dcmwai> there was a time I was thinking of changing arias to XUL base and force people to use mozilla with Aria :)
<SachaS> dcmwai I checked out cvs from gnue-sb
<dcmwai> SachaS, there are still nothing much...
<SachaS> dcmwai and I can open the schemas in gnue-designer
<dcmwai> so...
<SachaS> so ... you are designing/converting the schemas at the moment?
<dcmwai> that not me, jcater did that.. 
<dcmwai> I'm now still finding a place to fit myself in ;)
<SachaS> ok. i dont have a place either :)
<dcmwai> Vee2d2 do ask me to start to design from that will be use for gnue-sb later using aria (way)

<SachaS> after last nights play with gnue I will update my slides for the next linux presentation (coming tuesday)
<Vee2d2> cool
<SachaS> i will remeove a line similar to "gnue is not yet ready" to "let me show a little demo" :)
<SachaS> hi Vee2d2 i played with contact in gnue-sb last night
<Vee2d2> that's derek's baby
<SachaS> the user interface is not intuitive, eg the behaviour of the gui is not obvious; at first. But user do adopt :)
alandd (~alandd@h-68-165-192-191.PHNDAZ91.covad.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<SachaS> i had a quick look at the source of contact.
<SachaS> the schema seem straight forward
<dneighbo> remember that form is nearly 3 years old
<dneighbo> er 2.5 years old (iirc)
<Vee2d2> heya derek
<dneighbo> so some of the stuff was due to limitations of forms
<Vee2d2> I'm sure it'll receive a good massaging at some point
<SachaS> the forms ... layout is ok, logic and triggers need a little more time to understand
<dneighbo> hi Vee2d2
<dneighbo> so does full time work onsite mean no more embrodiery?
<SachaS> hi dneighbo. played with gnue-sb last night.
<Vee2d2> no, I've just kicked it into a part time operation as it had been
<alandd> SachaS: gnue-sb?
<SachaS> i hope i can play a little more with gnue in the future
<SachaS> alandd gnue-sb = gnue for small business
<Vee2d2> alandd: http://www.gnu.org/software/gnue-sb/
<alandd> dneighbo: i alerted elitepc to the workshop hours and asked them about the system image thing.  Have not heard back yet.
<alandd> Vee2d2: thanks.  i'll check it.
<SachaS> dneighbo from far away and not followed discussions on here i thought that you will need some methodology how to go ahead and ... designe modules
<SachaS> dneighbo like when i am reading a book on inventory with all the diagrams and examples ... thats very helpful (to me) to understand what they are talking about.
<SachaS> its like Vee2d2 gnue-sb features list with support of diagrams
<SachaS> oh i dont know
<SachaS> just a way to communicate/discuss/illustrate the ideas you guys have
<SachaS> :)
<SachaS> all i want to say is: i am excited haha
<Vee2d2> SachaS: if you have extra material you can contribute, I'd be glad to integrate it in
<SachaS> Vee2d2 I h I will yes.
<SachaS> have to write this thesis first!

<dneighbo> its been an ETERNITY
<dneighbo> i think i forgot how :(
<dneighbo> new office is making it feel peachy
<dneighbo> large enough for wifey to sit in here while i hack
<dneighbo> so there is a good chance we will get more computer time

<dcmwai> If I order something in packing for example (350 Pcs/Pack) then in my inventory I should have N x 350 But in arias the (N x) is missing..
<dneighbo> that sucks for you :)
<dneighbo> sorry im teasing
<dcmwai> damn have to hack the code somewhere so that it work.. damn.. Any suggestion?
<SachaS> dcmwai: why dont you just trash aria and start again in gnue-sb?
<alandd> Question: I downloaded the CVS with the gnuecheckout.sh script.  slick.  now, why would I want to install with setup-cvs.py instead of setup.py?  I just want to start playing and learning.
<SachaS> alandd: have you downloaded gnue? or gnue-sb?
<alandd> gnue
<alandd> should I have gone with gnue-sb?
<SachaS> alandd: yesterday I installed gnue from cvs and it wais working (gnue-common, gnue-designer, gnue-forms is all i used so far)
<SachaS> alandd: what distribution are you using?
<dneighbo> alandd: how was vacation?
<dneighbo> gnuecheckout.sh?
<Vee2d2> gnuecheckout.sh ? 
<dneighbo> that is new eh?
<Vee2d2> jinx
<dneighbo> 1 2 3 4 5 6...
<alandd> good grief!  Talking all a once.  Let's see...
<alandd> SachaS redhat 9
<dneighbo> alandd: setup-cvs.py is for cvs installs 
<dneighbo> it does 3 things really
<dneighbo> 1. it allows you to 'self contain an install'
<alandd> dneighbo vacation was great!  3700 miles traveled with 4 kids but they are good kids.
<dneighbo> 2. it allows you keep development conf files separate from production ones
<dneighbo> 3. it allows you to have multiple devel installs by name
<dneighbo> i.e. when you run setup-cvs.py it asks for an 'extension'
<dneighbo> generally i run cvs head
<dcmwai> SachaS: Not to say not going to gnue-sb but because I need something working real fast.... (on the Orgnazation I'm working with)
<dneighbo> and a few pre-releases at run time
<dcmwai> and Gnue-sb recode need some time...
<alandd> gnuecheckout.sh is a script that LuftHans sent me.  logs in an does a 'cvs -up P' on each of the gnue modules.
<dneighbo> because often times people ask
<dneighbo> was it broken in XXXX
<dneighbo> and having to install another copy is a pain
<SachaS> dcmwai: ok. 
<Vee2d2> dcmwai: *shrug* I always counted things as 1ea, unless we only ever sold the 'Pack' of 350ea, in which case I counted that as 1ea. So the problem didnt lay in inventory but in the manner in which the ordering was handled
<dneighbo> easier to just keep some snapshots aroudn as a developer
<dneighbo> then if you break crap you can see if its broken in other versions :)
<dneighbo> but thats just me
<dneighbo> then i keep a production installed in all default locations
<dcmwai> and also I don't want gnue-sb suffer from the problem I'm having so... We need a framwork that is to avoid all these kind of problem and being better
<dneighbo> LuftHans: keeps telling me he cant get GNU Enterprise to work :)
<SachaS> alandd: dneighboo helps you how to install gnue :) have to say with debian unstable i had all dependencies as debian packages so I had no real issues to first meet the dependencies.
<dcmwai> Vee2d2: Yea... something like that and I hate it...
<dcmwai> alandd: gnue-sb run well on my redhat 9 :)
<alandd> dneighbo I talked to him last night at the devel meeting.  he's frustrated but I don't remember which tools is giving him problems.  Needs to put out a solution ASAP for a customer and was threatening to go with PHP.
<alandd> dcmwai: gnue-sb is the framework along with the beginings of some apps, correct?
<dcmwai> alandd: Yes it
<SachaS> alandd oops. if you need a solution asap ... hope you get it with gnue ... from what i see it would take time (for a newbie) to write up a biz app based on gnue.
<SachaS> but on the other hand somebody has to start it
<alandd> SachaS: LuftHans is the one that wants something right away and has been playing with gnue for a couple of weeks.  I'm just playing and learning on my own before the workshop on the 30th.
<Vee2d2> that'll no longer be the case with gnue-sb as you will have a working framework there to beat up as you please
<dneighbo> alandd: you get it installed and working?
Action: dneighbo thinks GNU Enterprise is pretty easy to install on debian unstable 
<Vee2d2> quite
<dneighbo> even using cvs
<dneighbo> infact i thikn cvs might be easier than packages :)
<Vee2d2> just apt-get this and that and cvs co the modules, setup-cvs.py weeee..
<SachaS> alandd oh cool. LuftHans is under pressure
<alandd> Have not run the script yet.  I'll go do common cvs setup right now.  Please stand by...
Action: dneighbo hears david bowie under pressure in background
<dneighbo> gets a mental image of hans
<dneighbo> and then brains freaks w/ a "does not compute" ;)
<SachaS> dneighbo true. was a smooth. most time I needed was to get the permissions right with the postgresql database
Action: Vee2d2 should hurry up and finish his php'n for the night and see if he can get some gnue'n in 'fore crashtime
<dneighbo> SachaS: thats what i find funny
<dneighbo> when we had a lot of people installing early on
<dneighbo> they would piss and moan GNU Enterprise sucked
<dneighbo> and 99.8% it was a mysql or postgres setup issue
<dneighbo> the problem is GNU Enterprise is a framework
<ajmitch> hi
<Vee2d2> 'sup ajmitch
<dneighbo> we except GNU Enterprise users to business application developers to the point where they can handle the db stuff 
Action: ajmitch wanders in & collapses :)
<dneighbo> i suscept as time moves on we will make that more and more visual and wizard based as we integrate tighter with different vendors
Action: Vee2d2 props ajmitch up in the corner 
Action: ajmitch thanks Vee2d2
<dcmwai> I think they are asking for roo much during this developing times..
<SachaS> hi ajmitch. how are you?
<ajmitch> alive, I think :)
<ajmitch> how is everyone here?
<SachaS> ajmitch: what happened? dotgnu overdoes?
<ajmitch> busy hacking away? :)
<ajmitch> nah, just ill :)
<SachaS> oh ok.
<SachaS> who was from the east coast of australia???
<ajmitch> hmm?
<SachaS> i remember a guy lives north of sydney (way north)
<Vee2d2> SachaS: maybe wt, who I havent seen in a while
<SachaS> and as i am going to Sydney we might have a gnue beer
<alandd> setup-cvs.py barfed because I don't have the docbook directory.  I'll try it without the docs requested...
<SachaS> wt ok will check when is is coming
Nick change: SachaS -> Sacha-away
<alandd> OK. setup-cvs.ph in common was mostly successful.  I got one error:
<alandd> ln: creating symbolic link `/home/alandd/GNUe/source/common/src/.GDTD.py' to `/home/alandd/GNUe/source/gnue-common/scripts/gnuedtd': No such file or directory
<alandd> the /source/common/ directory does not exist.  Am I missing something?
<alandd> gfcvs says I need mxDateTime.  I'll hunt that down another time.  Must go care for kids.  Thanks for the tips!
<alandd> dneighbo: let me know if i can help more with the workshop.
Action: alandd is away: Children, gotta love 'em
