<chillywilly> hehheh
<jbailey> I hate mailman
<chillywilly> you're such a corn ball
<jbailey> I need to make that a public declaration.
<chillywilly> hack it ;)
<chillywilly> it's written in the beautiful python programming language
<chillywilly> :)
<jbailey> It's written largely without exception handling.
<jbailey> Even though it likes to throw exceptions.
<chillywilly> blech
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> actually what I was doing before was typing IRC command via telnet ;P
<chillywilly> and trying to keep myself entertained
<jbailey> It also seems to manage to run itself out of ram.
<jbailey> But we WILL have mail archives again at gnu.org, DAMMIT!
<chillywilly> the thing that sucks is that python-irclib is synchronous and blocking
<chillywilly> jbailey: woooooooO!
<chillywilly> what's the dman method to give you the size of a list?
<jbailey> What language?

Action: jbailey yawns.
<jbailey> Might be time for a nap soon.  I was up too late.
<jcater> g'morning, gnue-land
<jbailey> Heya Jason.
<jbailey> Happy new year. =)
<chillywilly> happy gnu year jc!
Action: chillywilly needs a nap too
<jbailey> chillywilly: Did you go out last night?
<chillywilly> what would be ideal for gnue...to support only async i/o via asyncore/aynchat (select or poll) or to support threading too?
<chillywilly> ummm, nope
<jbailey> chillywilly: Depends on the load.  threading always adds a level of complication because of the locking needed.
<chillywilly> right and it is good for cpu bound stuff
<jbailey> chillywilly: A fast poll loop is always more efficient on a single processor, assuming you yield back to the loop frequently.
<chillywilly> but network servers are mostly i/o bound
<jbailey> Sure, but we're talking an irc bot, right?
<jcater> chillywilly: when I started doing the GServerApp stuff (as well as the RPC stuff) I had intended to use asynchronous only -- at least for the foreseeable future
<chillywilly> no, we're talking chaning the gnue server architecture in common to use ayncore stuff
<jbailey> Oh, I see. =)
<jbailey> I thought you meant your bot.
<chillywilly> jcater: ok
<chillywilly> jcater: so ideally any server should se GServerApp.py? becase that is not that case right now...it is kind of a mixture
<jcater> what is not using GServerApp?
<chillywilly> like the pw_xmlrpc driver uses ThreadingTCPServer
<jcater> oh
<jcater> these are two different things
<chillywilly> that's what I am trying to sort out I guess
<jcater> GServerApp --> all GNUe server applications should be based on this
<chillywilly> right
<jcater> It will spawn off a fork for each supported "server model"
<jcater> i.e., it'd spawn off an instance for XMLRPC
<jcater> or an instance for CORBA
<jcater> so those are two different references to a "server", me thinks
<chillywilly> well server int he broad sense and "server adapter" in the rpc sense, afaict
<chillywilly> where does the rpc stuff 'fork' at?
<chillywilly> GCommBase.py?
<jcater> I think so
<chillywilly>   def serve(self):
<chillywilly>     pass
<chillywilly>   
<chillywilly>   def serveAsNewThread(self):
<chillywilly>     thread.start_new_thread(self.serve,())
<chillywilly> I finally understand proxy objects...but I figured it out from reading what Jan wrote in the "proposal" ;)
<jcater> proposal?
<chillywilly> GComm proposal
<chillywilly> in docbook/proposals
<chillywilly> Jan added some nice notes there a while back
<jcater> we've had proxy objects from day one
<chillywilly> I know
psu (psu@public1-wear2-3-cust42.midd.broadband.ntl.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> anyone here use wine?
Action: derek was amazed at how much easier its gotten w/ debian
<jcater> Turning Leaf is a decent inexpensive brand
<derek> apt-get install a few things
<derek> run a setup tool and you are off
Action: psu gets communion wine twice a month
<jcater> wine still doesn't quite do what I need :(
<derek> however i dont like how on many things it takes whole screen (i.e. i lose my linux desktop)
<derek> is there a way to prevent that
<derek> as when as jcater says 'it doesnt do what i need'
<derek> and locks up
<derek> i have to kill X
<derek> in order to stop it :(
<derek> or
<derek> go to a vt
<jbailey> derek: I use wine a bit.
Action: psu wishes he could get X running on his laptop
<derek> and manually kill 10 or so wine processes
<derek> i got simple things working
<derek> but none of the 'kids' games work
<derek> they all get the same error
<derek> first it was a winprint.drv problem
<derek> but apg-get install libwine-print or something fixed that
<derek> now its another error i see all over the net
<derek> but no apparent fix (some patches suggesting a recompile) but im not willing to do that
Action: chillywilly is soooooo tired
<derek> rock!
<chillywilly> rockabilly
<derek> a setting change has me running in a window now!!!!
<derek> AND
<derek> it seems to have solved the problems i was having
<derek> uh oh it wants to install directx
<derek> probably will kill things
<derek> holy crap
<derek> it works
<psu> derek: doing that with "real" Windows happens often enuf
<derek> sound and everything a 3D game
<psu> so consider that a feature, not a bug
Action: derek is going to be a hero
<derek> the kids have their games!!!!!!
<chillywilly> coolness
<chillywilly> is this wine from debian sid/.
<chillywilly> ?
<derek> yes now i should never here crap for linux at home again!!!!
<derek> yes
<chillywilly> I have a PC copy of Madden 97 that I'd like to play
Action: derek has NEVER had an OUNCE of success with it
<chillywilly> me either
<chillywilly> never worked
<derek> jbailey: you get roller coaster tycoon working under wine?
<chillywilly> what packages you need besides wine?
<jbailey> derek: I haven't tried with winex 2.2.1
<jbailey> derek: (I use winex for all the games)
<derek> jbailey: what is winex?
<derek> is it in sid?
<chillywilly> a fork
<derek> another dumb question
<derek> i installed this app
<derek> where does it 'put' it
<derek> i.e. if i dont have windows does it make a 'menu' or such?
<chillywilly> dunno
<chillywilly> there's a #wine on this network I think
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> #wine-hq
<psu> btw, anyone know what's wrong with pipermail on mail.gnu.org?
<psu> I saw jbailey mention it earlier
<chillywilly> nope
Action: derek is away: footbal
Action: psu notes that Newcastle-Liverpool doesn;t start for another 45 minutes ;-)
Action: jcater notes that it's lunch time
<jbailey> psu: Yes, mailman sucks.
<jbailey> psu: I've fixed bug-inetutils and I'm fixing emacs-devel right now.
Action: psu noted it had died when I was doing KC
<psu> wasn;t sure who/how to report it
<jbailey> psu: I think I have enough test cases to submit to the author though to get him to fix it.
<psu> In the meantime, I'm doing a temp manual mirror for the gnue lists
<psu> at http://www.burdonvale.co.uk/mail/
<jbailey> It should be fixed shortly, I think.
<psu> cool
<psu> don't know whether mailman password reminders are fubar too
<Vee2d2> The year of the Goat is coming! The year of the Goat is coming! The year of the Goat is coming!
<psu> I've had my usual raft of 1st-of-the-month password reminders
<jbailey> psu: No, they should be fine.
<psu> but not from mail.gnu.org
<jbailey> I don't know what time thye go out.
<jbailey> But I've also had the mailing lists all halted for like 6 hours now.
<psu> Vee2d2: every year is the year of the goat, around here.
<psu> jbailey: ah, fair enough. That probably does it.
<jbailey> I should probably enable them again soon to let traffic flow.
<psu> Not that i'm complaining
<jbailey> BUt I'm irritated at this taking so long, so oh well.
<jbailey> I'll enable it before I take my nap.
<psu> just being a good bug reporting & reporting all know symptoms, whether significant to me or not
<jbailey> Yup!  Appreciated!
Action: chillywilly was about to take a nap but has to pick caroline up from work in half an hour
