<chillywilly> hi derek
<derek> hi
<chillywilly> wassup my homie?
<chillywilly> waaaazaaaapaaaaneeeeen!
<derek> sleep soon hopefully :)
<derek> btw: what the heck happened to your packers :(
<chillywilly> they have been playing like shit lately
Action: derek made committment to not be a 'sports' nut after getting married
<chillywilly> scored er....34 in last 3 games
<chillywilly> 34 points
<derek> so generally i limit myself to one or two games a week if that
<chillywilly> yea
<derek> i watched ohio state and miami on friday so only decided to watch one playoff game
<chillywilly> dude I thought the Giants were gonna whip the forty whiners
Action: derek thought gb / atlanta would be a good one
<chillywilly> I watched that game too
<chillywilly> heh
<derek> but they just got mopped up 
<derek> it was fun to watch vick though
Action: derek will watch the atlanta / philly game for suure
<chillywilly> derek: cause they did not go into the playoffs hot
<chillywilly> and they're still riddled with injury
<chillywilly> but it's inexcusable to loose at Lambeau
<chillywilly> that shit just doesn't happen ;)
<chillywilly> they actually got booed
<chillywilly> that NEVER happens at Lambeau
<chillywilly> hell I love watching the game there
<chillywilly> it rocks
Action: chillywilly has 3-game Milwaukee package
<chillywilly> season tickers
<chillywilly> tickets
<chillywilly> I have my dad to thank for that as he signed up for them years ago and these last couple years we've had the tickets now
<chillywilly> the waiting list for season tickets and lambeau is insanely long

<StyXman> hi all
<Chipaca> StyXman: hi
<StyXman> ah, you again :)
<StyXman> jamest, ra3vat: y'alive?
<ra3vat> hi, i'm here
<StyXman> ra3vat: d'you know which is the supossed semantics for the different masks?
<StyXman> I mean, {display,input,format}
<jamest> that's up in the air right now IIRC
<Chipaca> meaning, empty?
<StyXman> jamest: I know. I need one of those (display, I guess) to show just a few decimal but keeping all the decimals internally.
<StyXman> so, I may hack a support but in such a way when those get implemented our forms will still work
<jamest> in forms itself?
<jamest> or reports?
<jamest> or other?
<jamest> as there is a number format hack in reports now
<Chipaca> what are they for? I mean, what's the difference between display and format?
<StyXman> jamest: forms
<StyXman> it will in the ways of
<StyXman> .. displaymask="%.2f" ...
<StyXman> and that will be used with
<StyXman> format % value
<StyXman> I guess I don't explain myself clearly
<ra3vat> StyXman: i do not use it now, sorry
<StyXman> er, I just want to know if I should implement displaymask or format mask. and what will be the use in thew future.
Action: drochaid is away: no ere
<jamest> actually I think there is already work done on format marks
<jamest> masks
<jamest> it's already in the code base but not in use IIRC
<jamest> as it's needing a good debugging
<StyXman> ok, let's do the question in a better way (I hope):
<ra3vat> i would like to debug it, i was trying it for dates
<StyXman> what are display, input and format mask for?
<StyXman> especially, the difference between display and format? input seems rather clear.
<jamest> i'm going to have to do this from memory
<StyXman> ok
<jamest> sorry users
<jamest> fields can display differently when you edit them vs when you're not in them
<jamest> the best place to see this is in a date field as IIRC it's the furthest along
<jamest> when you enter the field 2003/01/06 may be displayed for editing
<jamest> when you exit it may flip to read  Monday, Jan. 6th 2003
<StyXman> 'sorry users'?
<StyXman> _that_ flip, is display or format mask?
<jamest> I'm at work and users > irc on priority list
<jamest> :)
<StyXman> ah. :)
<jamest> i _think_ display is non editing and format is editing
<jamest> but again, I'm not sure
<jamest> jason (of course :) did this work 
<jamest> and it's never been finished
<jamest> i've only don't minor maintenance on the displayhandler stuff a few months back
<jamest> he might even have a doc on this somewhere
<StyXman> it sounds to me, but I may be wrong, that display is for showing (Mon, Jan 6th 2003), input for input (2003/01/06), and format for internal representation (20030106)
<jamest> that could very well be
<jamest> i think that 2 of the 3 are in use
<StyXman> i.e., format not being used?
<jamest> and the 3rd one is pending proper setup of the format definition
<jamest> i think so yes
Remosi (dahoose@210.54.58.22) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> the best source of info on this would be jason
<StyXman> anyways, knowing that display is the one I want, I'll go and see what I can do.
<jamest> I believe date would be your best sample to look at 
<StyXman> jamest: zanx
<Vee2d2> there's a bit of information in the forms dev guide (.5) pg 24.. but the only thing documented is datetime
<ra3vat> is it possible to constract outer joins via datasource conditions?
Action: ra3vat fears to hear: "Brew a view" if ever
<jamest> ra3vat: read only?
<jamest> or r/w?

<jamest> as for the conditional you'd have to setup......
<jamest> it might possibly just may be slightly possible, maybe :)

<ra3vat> yes, normalized
<jamest> jcater and I discussed some stuff thurs or friday about better forms normalization support
<jamest> he's got some need 
<jamest> and had a proposed solution to that need
<jamest> i think he was going to whip something together based on that
<jamest> but at the time I was ill and medicated so I don't recall the details 
<jamest> they should change the boxes on cold medicine to read "Do not operate heavy machinery, or attempt to think while on this medication"
<Vee2d2> =)
<Vee2d2> I could have used that warning a few times

<ra3vat> jamest: is it possible to do something like colspan in reports?
<jamest> um, you mean in the html output?
<jamest> or just in general
<ra3vat> in general
<ra3vat> in native xml report format
<jamest> using simple tabulation?
<ra3vat> it is what i only use now
<ra3vat> what i started with
<jamest> ah, i just put in empty column defs
<jamest> <out:col/>
<jamest> and my output looks ok
<jamest> but I'm sure you want something more :)
<ra3vat> may be not :)
<jamest> i just looked thru the adapter code and I'm not seeing anything like that
<ra3vat> currently i'm trying to do simple text output that fit with 80 chars screen to be send by email

<jamest> i do this alot

<ToyMan> ok
<ToyMan> I'll be in and out, but would like to talk later
<ra3vat> jamest: it'd be great to split one output db row on two rows in report ans span wide cells if needed
Arturas (~arturas@gsk.vtu.lt) left irc: "Bye :)"
<jamest> ack!
<jamest> with a little effort you might be able to get a trigger to do it
<jamest> but the trigger support in reports is functional bu not complete
<jamest> i would think some type of post-change trigger on a field
<jamest> that split the data and stored in 2 non-bound fields 
<jamest> would do it
<jamest> sigh, i need to look at triggers there anyway
<jamest> as i need computed field values
<ra3vat> i do not know how to reach different report objects from report trigger
<jamest> well, they should be able to be referenced by name
<jamest> report.fieldName
<ra3vat> can you send me an example?
<jamest> lol
<jamest> i'll have to write one
<jamest> i don't think anyone used triggers in reports yet
<ra3vat> for example how to assign cparam value?
<jamest> i added the support as I knew we'd need it 
<jamest> but until this last weekend I hadn't found out exactly where I'd need it
<jamest> ra3vat: i'll have to dig back in, add some new trigger types, then write the example
<jamest> it'll be later this week
<ra3vat> thanks
<jamest> for stupid gnue reports tricks
<jamest>   i took some sample code jason wrote for Oracle Reports/zope/php
<jamest>   and reworked using GNUe Reports/Zope(with ZShellScripts)
<jamest>   it takes an RTF template of an invoice, merges it against data in the rdbms,  and pumps out a pdf file 
<jamest>   via a web site
<jamest>   so customers can lookup past invoices 
<jamest>   what's cool is if the people this is for use it for initialy printing their snail mail invoices then they will be the exact same as the pdf
<ra3vat> These files are the latest CVS snapshots of GNU Enterprise. These snapshots are updated every hour on the hour, 24 hours a day
<ra3vat> jamest: is it valid info?
<ra3vat> and cvs snapshots updated hourly? i need one for a friend
<ra3vat> for a friend to present right now that is :)
<StyXman> hint fot *masks: there's the freeclx thing in freeclx.sf.net, which may be useful for taking ideas from.
<StyXman> ok, I hacke that thing down
<StyXman> now is just a simple format % value, but is enought for us till yours is implemented.

<Vee2d2> I assumed 'format masks' was a general term for either input or display
<jcater> StyXman: I'm still wondering if we need the "format" mask
<jcater> I've been debating both ways
<jcater> input mask --> when field is in input mode, the mask used to validated/let the user enter the value
<jcater> display mask --> how the field is displayed when user is not editing it
<jcater> format mask --> (if there's a need) how the field is actually stored in the database

<reinhard> question for all GNUe Common experts
<reinhard> does resultset.post only post the changed fields to the database
<reinhard> or all fields that have gone through referenceField ?
<jcater> the former
<reinhard> thanks
<reinhard> that's what i wanted to hear
<reinhard> :-)
<reinhard> another question
<reinhard> is it possible to write data to the database (using common of course) without having requested a resultset before?
<jcater> you mean, issuing an "update" statement directly?
<reinhard> update or insert
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> i mean directly not as in "direct SQL"
<reinhard> but directly as in "without having requested a resultset"
<jcater> ah
<jcater> not really
<reinhard> or even more precise
<jcater> we do: 
<reinhard> having requested a resultset, but the field to update wasn't in the resultset
<jcater> ah
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> right now a field has to be "referenced" to be updatable
<reinhard> can i reference an additional field after having requested the resultset?
<jcater> I think so
<reinhard> or does the "referenceField" have to be done before the getresultset
<jcater> I haven't tried it post-init before
<jcater> but I think it'd work
<reinhard> I think I'll try
<reinhard> if it doesn't work would you be willing to make it work?
<jcater> I think so
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> I'll let you know
<reinhard> thanks so far
<reinhard> could it be that mail @gnu.org is down?

<chillywilly> hi
Chipaca (~john@ADSL-200-59-86-138.cordoba.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> what's cookin' jbailey?
<Chipaca> is it a quiz? as in gas or electric?
<jbailey> chillywilly: Not much.  I'm trying to decide what I should do for lunch.  If I should try to go to school full time in September.  And lastly, what I should be working on at work right now.
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> Chipaca: nope
<jbailey> I think I can actually afford to do school in Sept.
<jbailey> Exciting idea.
<chillywilly> I dunno I think school is a waste of time
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> BIG waste of time
<jbailey> I don't.  I've hit limitations several times where I couldn't get jobs because they demanded a university degree.
<jbailey> I've also hit several times where I just didn't have the theoretical knowledge to do something I needed to.
<jbailey> Also, it's easier to get work visas in foreign countries with a degree.
<jbailey> With the Free Trade talks starting between North America and Europe, I'm hoping that after I do a degree, I might be able to go over there and work.
<chillywilly> I suppose it doesn't hurt to play their game
<jbailey> Also that current economic predictions are that most jobs in Canada in the next 10 years will simply require a university education.
<jbailey> So it's relatively cheap, there's no reason people shouldn't have them.
<chillywilly> how long will you have to go?
<jbailey> Dunno.
<jbailey> 3 or 4 years probably.
<jbailey> Since I'll be working at the same time to avoid student loans, I'll probably choose to take a little longer.
<jbailey> Also free up time for Free software hacking, too.
<chillywilly> heheh :)
<reinhard> jbailey: "I might be able to go over there and work."
<reinhard> over there == Europe?
<jbailey> reinhard: Yes, sorry.  I don't live that far from Dan.
<jbailey> Maybe an 18 hour drive or so.  Depending on the border crossing.
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> we need more long-haired Free Software hippies here ;-)
<chillywilly> when you gonna be in Madison jeff?
<chillywilly> HEH
<jbailey> reinhard: Hmmm.  What languages do I need to go to Austria?
<chillywilly> so the sign said, "long-harid freaky people need not apply"
<chillywilly> German probably
<jbailey> reinhard: Angie can definetly dance in Germany.  We've never talked about anywhere other than there, France, or England.
<chillywilly> jbailey: are you still coming to Madison?
<jbailey> chillywilly: Patiences, I'm looking up the dates.
<chillywilly> oh, ok :P
<jbailey> Feb 21st - 24th, I think.
<reinhard> jbailey: we speak German in Austria

<chillywilly> and no one gets pressured into doing anything they don't want to
<jcater> there was a big takeover of the southern baptist association
<jbailey> I have two friends who are "baptist-not-suthern" 
<jcater> in the late seventies/early eighties
<jcater> by the fundamentalist groups
<chillywilly> well it seems all the SB churches up here are only SB by association
<jcater> (the leader of that movement is about 10 minutes from me :(
<jcater> the SB headquarters is also in TN
<jbailey> chillywilly: Why would they retain the association then?
<jcater> not far from here
<jcater> jbailey: usually for financial reasons
<jcater> my favorite church 
<jcater> was "SB" technically
<jcater> but were a very progressive church
<dtm> yeah chillywilly's geography is quite non-southern
<jbailey> jcater: Are the churches there supported by the denomination then?
<chillywilly> well we don't fit these stereotypes that jcater keeps going on abot
<chillywilly> althogh
<chillywilly> Falls Baptists Church is a bit weird
<chillywilly> Baptist
Action: jcater isn't talking stereotypes... he's talking expectations
<chillywilly> (menomonee falls)
<chillywilly> but they're not SB
<chillywilly> they believe all "rock n' roll" is evil and of the devil
revDeke (www-data@alt1.libertydistribution.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> it's just weird
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> BUT
<jcater> on the bright side
<jcater> churches like yours
<jcater> (the more progressive ones)
<jcater> are starting to try to take back the SB convention
<jcater> lord, I hope they succeed
<chillywilly> I hope to start encoding our services into ogg
<chillywilly> then you guys can judge for yourselves :)
<chillywilly> I think I need to give the other guys working on the website a kick in the pants
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> at any rate I am gonna start practicing my guitar with Matt on wednesday nights so I can start playing during servce again
<chillywilly> we need a drummer though :(
<jbailey> I can play drums. =)
<chillywilly> right now we got piano, 2 guitarists, base player, but no drmmer anymore since he went off to college
<chillywilly> er, bass
<chillywilly> jbailey: ok ;)
<chillywilly> jbailey: you kinda live far away
<chillywilly> :P
<jbailey> and I'm generaly busy Sunday mornings.
<chillywilly> jbailey: you going to drive down here and play every sunday morning?
<chillywilly> heheh
<jbailey> We've been talking about doing Sunday evening services here with rock/folk music.
<jbailey> Hard to find the startup budget for it, though.
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> I wonder what the heck this is supposed to mean
<dtm> jbailey: what area do you live in?
<jbailey> dtm: Toronto.
<chillywilly> Prayer Needs: Government Officials: Sen. Jon Corzine (NJ), Rep. Martin Frost (TX), Sen. Ernest Hollings (SC), Gov. Gary Johnson (NM), Gov. Tony Knowles (AK), and Rep. Robert Menendez (NJ) \x{00B7} Pray for one more person to read through the Bible \x{00B7} Country: Mexico (100 million) in North America \x{00B7} Major language: Spanish \x{00B7} Religious freedom \x{00B7} 88% Roman Catholic; 4% Protestant; .1% Eastern Orthodox \x{00B7}

Action: chillywilly sees Fritz Hollings in there
<chillywilly> ack!
<chillywilly> I will pary that he sees the light ans gets off the CPBTA thingy :)
<jbailey> dtm: You?
<chillywilly> er, pray
<jbailey> Prey? =)
<jbailey> Hunt him down.
<chillywilly> heheh, no
<jbailey> Tell him that you're preying for him.
<dtm> jbailey: san francisco bay area
<jbailey> Until he gets off of the CPBTA.
<chillywilly> lol
<jbailey> dtm: Ah, lovely!  I have a few friends down there.
<dtm> jbailey: gravy
<dtm> jbailey: yeah i work at OST
<dtm> i'm gonna meet dyfet in march when he comes here for codecon
<jbailey> dtm: That's the company dyfet works for?
<dtm> yes
<dtm> ostel.com
<dtm> whirrrrr
<jbailey> Cool.  I've thought of applying for the CTO position that seems to be constantly open.
<dtm> you guys can call me if you need any telephony cards... starting at $550!  we can work out a developer/community discount!  ;)
<jbailey> Aside from currently planned trips, I'm avoiding the US as much as possible for the next year or two, though.
<dtm> jbailey: heheheh
<dtm> yeah well you'll have to fight dyfet over the CTO position
<chillywilly> Dave is CTO isn't he?
<dtm> yeah
<jbailey> dtm: Hmm.  It's tempting.  I'd really like to do some serious phone system hacking.
<dtm> and then that means you'll have to fight everyone else because he's the ultimate telephony engineer in the universe ;)
<dtm> jbailey: well then.
<dtm> i can hook you up.
<jbailey> dtm: I don't have a spare PRI to work with.
<dtm> not for CTO though ;)
<dtm> there's tons of stuff to work on
<dtm> jbailey: what's your area of interest?  codecs?  IVR?  voicemail?  UMS?
<dtm> signals
Action: dtm . o O  ( 01010010101000001010101001 )
<jbailey> dtm: Mostly IVR, Voicemail, ACD queues, that sort of thing.
<dtm> well.  perhaps you know of bayonne.
<jbailey> Multi-site integration.
<dtm> you worked with that?
<dtm> you interested in PBX?
<jbailey> dtm: No.  Like I said, I don't have spare PRIs to hook it up to. =)  But I keep being annoyed that I have to use Option 11cs, or NEC PBXs or Mitels at various offices.
Action: chillywilly doesn't know crap about phone systems
<jbailey> (I'm relatively skilled on all three)
<dtm> jbailey: we dont even have a spare PRI :) we simulate it!
<jbailey> No to the 'worked with that' as opposed to the 'interested'
<chillywilly> it's freakin' cold down here!
<dtm> jbailey: ok well bayonne is going to be a PBX.
<jbailey> dtm: All I know of bayonne is that the FSF just stopped using it.
<jbailey> I never saw what the list of complaints about it were.
<chillywilly> HEH
<chillywilly> that figures
<dtm> jbailey: let's put it this way.  if you're seriously interested, you should get Bayonne, do some development using the sound card driver, and we can do a subcontract on something
<dtm> we're swamped
<dtm> jbailey: ah yes well since this is a publicly logged channel, i'll just say that there probably weren't any complaints.  They're just neat like that.
<jbailey> Yes, publicly logged.
<dtm> one might ask why they're not using GNUe either
<dtm> yes
<dtm> so we mustn't say what we're thinking
<chillywilly> jbailey: maybe you were talking about the CIO postion?
<dtm> on the subject
<jbailey> chillywilly: Maybe.
Action: chillywilly sees that it is listed at the bottom
Action: jcater wants to get the CIO position at Krispie Kreme
<chillywilly> lol
<jbailey> Chief Ingestion Officer?
<jbailey> AKA Taste Tester?
<jcater> Chief Inspection Officer :)
Action: chillywilly likes jbailey's first expansion of the acronym
Action: chillywilly can picture jcater "inspecting" them
<chillywilly> oh that one is not the right shape
<chillywilly> I better take care of that
<chillywilly> *gulp*
<chillywilly> oh and this one doesn't have enough powdered sugar

<jcater> I don't want KKK next to my name
<jcater> I might not live
<jbailey> jcater: Yeah.  Avoiding the KKK is probably a good thing.
<jbailey> The donuts aren't worth it.
<revDeke> come on, yuo have to wear a white hat
<revDeke> but its not pointy
<jbailey> And instead of slaughtering humans, you slaughter donuts?
Action: revDeke jots down, that there are some things jcater wont do for a donut
<revDeke> i think superdonut man has a weakness
<jbailey> Still probably better to have a different title.
<jbailey> Like.  Fried Berliner Inspector.
Action: revDeke gets this funny image
<revDeke> like when i was operations manager at macys the perfum buyers
<revDeke> had noses
<revDeke> where they would blind test perfums and such
<revDeke> amazing what they could detect

<revDeke> sniffing, licking and eating donuts
<revDeke> and giving feed back (like a fine wine taster or a perfum smeller)
<jbailey> I just got a spam. "Big screen TV for pennies"

<Chipaca> has anyone got a hosts.txt lying around somewhere?
<Chipaca> I mean the old, pre-DNS thing
<jbailey> Like a UUCP map?
<jbailey> Or the old ARPA hosts file?
<jbailey> You could probably get the UUCP map off of ftp.uu.net
<Chipaca> the ARPA hosts file
<jbailey> Check here: ftp://ftp.univie.ac.at/netinfo/netinfo
<Chipaca> cheers
<Chipaca> whee, trip down memory lane
<jbailey> Yeah.
<jbailey> I see our old netblk in there.  that's funny.
<jbailey> I guess that makes me harcore.
<jbailey> phear.
<Chipaca> what is yuma?
<Chipaca> as in
<Chipaca> NET : 6.0.0.0 : YUMA-NET :
<jbailey> Do a `whois YUMA-NET`
<jbailey> It tells you there.
<Chipaca> ho ho hee hee
<Chipaca> I didn't know whois spoke that still
<jbailey> Yup
Action: Chipaca notes ge has a class A to themselves
Action: Chipaca thinks they don't deserve it
<revDeke> careful or they might decide you dont deserve to still be breathing....
<Chipaca> on the other hand, genuity has one too, and I haven't even heard of 'em
<revDeke> oh wait only the mafia and microsoft play that game ;)
<Chipaca> gack wheeze thud
Action: Chipaca notes genuity has 4/8 and 8/8 (and I've not checked beyond 8)
<Chipaca> who is genuity?
<revDeke> Chipaca: when level 3 went to buy genuity it got blocked
<revDeke> er held up for antitrust review
<revDeke> if that helps gauge the size :)
<Chipaca> what's level 3?
<revDeke> genuity is a tier 1 IP networking firm
<revDeke> lots of voice over IP and VPN stuff
<revDeke> level 3 laid about 20,000 miles of fiber
<revDeke> so they own a lot of little subsidaries
<revDeke> that had to give a left nut to get htat fiber :)
<psu> ok, folks, time for the collected wisdom of #gnuenterprise
<jbailey> psu: Buy low, Sell hi!
<jbailey> gh
<jbailey> Bah.
<jbailey> Thinking of high..
<psu> what's the best way, using a simple html file, to do a redirect 
<psu> that is as cross-browser (even 
<jbailey> It looks like the US president is threatening Canadians with fingerprinting us all at the border if Canada decriminalises mirijuana.
<psu> stuff like lynx and emacs-w3) as possible
<Chipaca> psu: put it in the headers of the html file
<Chipaca> psu: those browsers choose _not_ to jump on redirect petitions, but rather no notify you of it and have you click it
<jbailey> psu: meta redirects is the best way within an HTML file.  The right way is to tell the webserver to issue a redirect.
<psu> Chipaca: If I just put it as first line, will that do? Assume I have no server access
<revDeke> i think genuity might be a part of BBN planet or the parent company to them or something
<revDeke> been a long time since i shopped for a t1 and services
<psu> jbailey: ISTR that sits fairly badly with lynx,, but if that's the only problem, I'll live with it
<revDeke> but last time i did the names stuck
<jbailey> psu: Hmm.  Might be.  I try to avoid compensating for broken browsers.
<Chipaca> print ISTR.__doc__
<Chipaca> psu: "as the first line"?
<psu> Chipaca: found it - meta http-equiv refresh
<psu> should work with most browsers
<psu> those that don't will have to click the link...
Action: psu used to do this with php, but that's not an option on new server
<Chipaca> psu: refresh is slower than redirect, but works ok (lyns users will see the ugly but manageble "Refresh --"
Action: psu is more worried about emacs-w3 users, given this website's location ;-)
<revDeke> all the browser compatiability loving just makes me want to write a gnue html client ;)
<jcater> psu: bah! just set up a gopher site for them
<revDeke> roflmao
<jbailey> Gopher was a good tool.
<revDeke> i think i just got the newly updated gopher client too
<revDeke> i want to know what happened to archie and veronica
<revDeke> and other cool toys
<psu> gopher was to www what CP/M-86 was to MS-DOS
<Chipaca> psu: meaning, same shit, different smell?
<jcater> revDeke: I imagine archie and veronica found some cool toys of their own, and that's why you don't see them any more ;)
<psu> so cool for its time - until the 900 pound gorilla showed up ;-)
<psu> maybe archie found veronica or vice versa?
<psu> emphasis on the "vice"
<psu> ;-)
<revDeke> jcater: maybe they just decided to 'gopher' it
<jcater> hehe
<psu> IIRC CP/M 86 was way superior to MS-DOS 1.0
<psu> cool UNIX-like things like subdirectories, etc.
<revDeke> actually it was the 30 pound chimp (netscape) that probably killed gopher for the most part
<revDeke> SUN and Microsoft (the large apes) then ruined that
<psu> monkey see, monkey do
<psu> that was one of my accountancy lecturer's favourite expressions
Action: jcater thinks netscape wanted to be the 900 lb ape
<jcater> hence the name
<jcater> perhaps they meant net-ape
<revDeke> i still remember writing a thesis on java back when sun thought it was DUMB idea
<jcater> but marketing got confused
<revDeke> gosling had visions of it making him toast by running on his toaster
<revDeke> some other sun folks thought 'applets' were the bomb
<revDeke> and SUN basically just wanted them to 'shut up'
<revDeke> how funny a few years made a huge difference
<jcater> I made my first SWIG-based library this weekend
<jcater> :)
<revDeke> i remeber research for that paper on the net then
<revDeke> a search of 'java' returned like 30 hits max
<revDeke> and 5 were links to some islands
<revDeke> jcater: you are sick
<jbailey> Java is named after indonesian islands.
<revDeke> what the hell did you swig
<jcater> gnu barcode
<revDeke> actually the orginal name iirc was 'tree'
<jcater> couldn't find any python-based barcode generators
<revDeke> er
<revDeke> 'oak'
<revDeke> the original name gosling used was oak
<jcater> yeah
<revDeke> as he had a huge oak tree outside his window at the lab
<jcater> I could see why they would want to change that name
<jcater> as oak implies rock-solid
Action: revDeke is really going back in the mental archive
<jcater> and that sure as hell ain't java
<psu> jbailey: as the nearest thing to a www.gnu.org webmaster here, do you think it would be OK 
<jbailey> psu: *lol* I suppose I qualify.
<revDeke> but i thought it was funny as only info you could get on java was gosling interviews
<psu> to not have the normal FSF copyright bolierplate
<revDeke> and that damn 'sunspot' logo
<psu> on a redirect page ? ;-)

<chillywilly> btw, my buddy from the lug says that GNUe's killer app is forms
<chillywilly> what do yall have to say about that?
<jcater> hell no!
<jcater> reports dude
<chillywilly> bah
<jcater> :)
<psu> Common!
<chillywilly> reports are for girls
<chillywilly> common isn't an app
<psu> common is an app framework
<chillywilly> but it is not an app
<chillywilly> framework's don't make the apps
<chillywilly> just makes it quicker to make a real app
<psu> gnue w/o common would be like jedi knight w/o force
<psu> common has a light side, and a dark side
<psu> & it holds the (gnue) universe together
<jamest> it has a light side?
<chillywilly> bah, it's al light side
<chillywilly> er, all
<chillywilly> the drak side is J2EE ;)
<chillywilly> er, dark
Action: psu imagines a Fox special - "Bloopers: the lighter side of GNUe Common"
<chillywilly> jkd;klajhsdk; alsjhdklajhsdl;kjaksjfdhk
<psu> on after 
<psu> "CVS's Most Dangerous Commits"
Action: chillywilly falls over
<revDeke> seriously gnue's killer app doesnt exist yet
<revDeke> if you were to call an existing tool 'killer' 
<revDeke> i would say reports
<revDeke> or designer
<revDeke> forms is up there too
<revDeke> but the real killer will be when something is written in gnue framework and largely adopted
<chillywilly> well he does mostly 2-tier development so I can see his point...then again he writes everything in perl
<chillywilly> so he's already fscked in the head
Action: revDeke is putting a higher level on 'killer' app
<chillywilly> yea yea
<revDeke> i think all the tools in the tool box are incredibly powerful and cool
<revDeke> but one that will radically change free software i think will either a completed framework, but more than likely some ERP in the framework
<revDeke> i.e. the number of 'tool' developers compared to the number of 'business users' is radically different
<revDeke> think about which is more killer
<revDeke> tcp/ip or 'the graphical browser'
<revDeke> people talk of the browser as being the killer app
<chillywilly> tcp/ip is more killer
<revDeke> but really doesnt tcp/ip and such deserve the glory
<chillywilly> but I can understand and appreciate the engineering that went into it
<revDeke> i.e. i dont know many people who say they couldnt live w/o tcp/ip, even though they couldnt
<chillywilly> most ppl are too stupid to realize it
<chillywilly> ;P
<revDeke> but i see people saying, i would die w/o email
<revDeke> i guess my point is the framework is killer, but poeple arent looking for tcp/ip 
<revDeke> they are looking for email ;)
<chillywilly> right
<chillywilly> but perhaps he meant from a developers standpoint
<revDeke> thats the most irrating thing with gnue right now
<chillywilly> at any rate, we need en user apps too and we know this
<revDeke> we have these really great tools that are quite amazing
<revDeke> yet people go...
<chillywilly> where are the apps
<revDeke> gnue, someday they will be interesting
<chillywilly> where can I enter my invoices, etc.
<revDeke> like nothing exists
<chillywilly> it's all a matter of time
<chillywilly> you should know that
<revDeke> it will take a nicely polished and functioning application from gnue
<revDeke> to get some broad usage
<revDeke> and then when people find out how easy it is to 'extend it'
<revDeke> it think the cat will be out of the bag and the poopy will hit the proverbial fan
<chillywilly> then they will lick our boots?
<chillywilly> ;)
<esands> psu: damn you are here, but I have to run off and get someone from the airport.  Did you see that email to the gnue@gnue.org list about multiple currency thing?
<revDeke> hmmm 
<revDeke> we use phrase 'butt licker' around here sometimes maybe i will change that to 'boot licker' to be more kid friendly
<chillywilly> there ya go
<chillywilly> er, but I have a patent on that
<chillywilly> so you have to pay me fat royalties
<chillywilly> :-o
<jbailey> revDeke: That reminds me of a story my friends told.
<jbailey> They have these things called 'rim pagers' here.
<jbailey> (I don't know if they're in the US)
<jbailey> They're standard 2-way pagers, text messaging type of thing.
<jbailey> Apparently they were refering to using them as 'rimming one another'.
<jbailey> They had never heard the expression before, I guess. =)
<psu> esands: seen it yep. Had time to read it properly & respond, no
<chillywilly> a rim job?
<chillywilly> heheh
<psu> New website is ready for beta testing 
<psu> http://www.gnu.org/software/gnue/gnue.html
<psu> Should look exactly like the old one ;-)
<psu> Main known bug is that the tabs across the top don't change yet
<psu> any other problems should go to www-support@gnuenterprise.org

Action: siesel is using a win98 box to control linux to chat, quite weared..., nit x0rfbserver is cool 
<reinhard>  siesel: i'm here
<chillywilly> hey guys I tried to post this to gnue-dev a while ago but it never got there
<chillywilly> er, this link: http://libertyetech.com/mappingObjects.pdf
<reinhard> siesel: appearently gnue-dev mailing list is broken
<chillywilly> it's paper on doing an object-relational mapping with 3 distinct approaches and the pros and cons of each
<reinhard> but i received your answer through the cc:
<siesel> reinhard: good. 
<reinhard> siesel: i'm ok with most of your answers
<reinhard> because gnue-commit is also broken you didn't see that i already continued with implementation of the api
<chillywilly> well I saw some commits from you reinhard
<siesel> I saw the code comments, and it looks good.
<reinhard> however i did a "minimal" implementation just to make things work like they are documented
<reinhard> so that i can continue for example with putting a python object interface above the raw api
<siesel> ok.
<reinhard> and we can later improve the appserver internal code
<siesel> Will you still be here in approx. 20 min?
<reinhard> i'm not sold about the gnue_id vs gnue_apps_id
<reinhard> i can
<siesel> ok, bbl
<kid> hi again - hope u could use the kid-less time for some progress
<reinhard> kid: :-)
<reinhard> kid: the commit list is broken, otherwise you would have seen a commit from me
<reinhard> basically, 80% of the api now works as documented
<kid> sounds good
<kid> sad that my work starts again on wednesday
<reinhard> if i'm lucky i can care about the second-to-last function tomorrow
<kid> my biggest hope is that i receive my new machine tomorrow
<reinhard> the last function to make work is the call of a procedure
<reinhard> where i need siesel's help
<kid> this would lighten my burden for the 1st weeks
<reinhard> i wish you luck then :-)
<kid> thx - i'll need it
<kid> the nice point about tomorrow is that my children will have to go to school again whereas i have an additional day
<reinhard> i know that effect :-)
<reinhard> however
<reinhard> for me work starts again tomorrow real hard i guess
<reinhard> as most of my users work for the first day in the new year tomorrow
<reinhard> and there are some things to do before you can work in a new year in my software
<reinhard> and my users tend to forget such things ...
<kid> sounds after some interesting phone sessions
<reinhard> oh yeah
<reinhard> i love my phone
<reinhard> at least i spend more time with it than with my wife ;-)
<reinhard> (please note the sarcasm)
<kid> at least u can hang up the found
<kid> but what about our wifes
<reinhard> lol
<kid> didn't find a perfect solution for this after nearly 17 yrs of marriage
<chillywilly> send them to the mall to shop?
<chillywilly> muwahahaha
<kid> i was talking about 'perfect'
<kid> and what costs me money can not be perfect
<chillywilly> hence the evil menical laughter
<kid> ah - i just recognize german-translated comic laughter from mad 
<kid> and prince valiant
<kid> that's all for now - this night hopefully will give me sweet dreams about a new-smelling machine with at least 5 different perfectly installed OSes
<kid> before reality catches me

Basically I thought that i) either implicit exhchange rate existed because the BASE:CURR_1 had a non-zero balance, or ii) It had a nill balance, thus no current implicit information about the currency existed.

<Mr_You> hi
<chillywilly> yo
<Mr_You> today was my first day getting back to "real life" hehe
<Mr_You> over the chicken pox
<Mr_You> one girl from my dojo thought I had small pox hehe
<chillywilly> eek
<chillywilly> well there's supposed to be a smallpox epiodemic going on or something like that
<Mr_You> sigh 44 counts of animal cruelty for a breeder
<chillywilly> epidemic
<Mr_You> umm where?  
<chillywilly> what did they do?
<chillywilly> I dunno where
<Mr_You> pretty sure small pox has been eliminated 
<Mr_You> its just potentially useful for bioweapons
<chillywilly> I remember a news story about it was going to come on but I didn't finish watching the news
<chillywilly> that day
<Mr_You> nah I think its been eliminated, only in labs so far
<Mr_You> no known natural case for years
<chillywilly> well I wasn't to concerned about it
<Mr_You> well small pox is no joke
<chillywilly> well why did she think you had smallpox/.
<chillywilly> er ?
<Mr_You> thats why we are lucky its "gone"
<chillywilly> *wink* *wink*
<Mr_You> no doubt sadam probably has small pox bioweapons and many other countries including the US
<Mr_You> IIRC we gave sadam the small pox for "lab use"
<Mr_You> or atleast I know we did with anthrax
<Mr_You> not sure if small pox was one.
<chillywilly> why did we do that?
<Mr_You> don't ask me.
<Mr_You> ask the CDC
<Mr_You> its documented.
<Mr_You> in the 80s IIRC
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> lovely
