<Arturas> sorrym yes, i'm here
<ra3vat> another one 
<Arturas> this is from gettext.py?
<ra3vat> yes
<ra3vat> Author: James Henstridge <james@daa.com.au>
<ra3vat> (This is loosely based on gettext.pl in the GNU gettext distribution)
<ra3vat> looks very different
<Arturas> loosely means not closely? :)
<Arturas>     def gettext(self, message):

<Arturas>         tmsg = self._catalog.get(message, message)
<Arturas>         return unicode(tmsg, self._charset)
<Arturas> this is gettext from python2.1
<Arturas> looks the same
<ra3vat> yeah, than my guessing is wrong
<Arturas> where did you get "Author: James Henstridge <james@daa.com.au>" ?
<Arturas>                       ... from?

<ra3vat> <Arturas> DB000: TypeError: unicode() argument 2 must be string, not None
<ra3vat> then check why self._charset is not set properly
<Arturas> i can't - don't have admin rights on this machine - can't do simple and helpful print :/
<Arturas> but 
<Arturas> runtime_charset is set for sure (i checked)

<kid> @reinhard: will delete() really delete an object from the database or just from object cache?
<reinhard_> from database
<kid> so some ref-integrity stuff will be necessary on app-server
<reinhard_> yes of course
<kid> k, thx
<reinhard_> not only that
<reinhard_> but for example business rules can describe that
<reinhard_> a customer may not be deleted if it is from austria
<kid> but in cases where the information about object references is available also the framework could
<reinhard_> (bad example but maybe you get the point)
<reinhard_> well 
<kid> so i just would change the state of the object if its master data
<kid> but this starts to repeat our discussion
<reinhard_> that is something that i think the framework _will_ do
<reinhard_> check integrity
<kid> btw: i'm currently trying to add the features discussed y'day to a subclass of geasSession
<kid> good point is: property definition handling seems to be quite straightforward 
<reinhard_> which features exactly?
<reinhard_> the status handling?
<kid> yes, this is one
<reinhard_> ah ok
<reinhard_> i'm curious
<reinhard_> :-)
<kid> other is the processing of "external" generic definitions for properties

<reinhard_> i didn't get anything done actually

<kid> is this support paid or do you have some fixed amount for it?
<reinhard_> i have support contracts

<dtm> his name was Greg
<dtm> sounds good dewd
<dtm> told him about gnue, etc
<dtm> so you might possibly call the govt and ask for anyone in IT or engineering named Greg  :}
<dtm> i didn't take his contact info coz he has tiny budget and can't afford any commercial services
<dtm> just wanted to know about bayonne
<dtm> so i loaded him with community info, told him to run bayonne on his sound card, and to call again
<dtm> and he was quite pleased in light of his budget
<dtm> he'd even heard of voxilla.org, woohoo
Action: chillywilly couldn't frelling get ccadio to compile

<Chipaca> how does bayonne run on your sound card?
<revDeke> Chipaca: first it puts on its adidas
<revDeke> peels off its jogging suit
<revDeke> steps up to the soundcard and stretches a few times
<revDeke> takes a warm up lap or two around the motherboard

<dtm> everyone except for chillywilly is installing and using it right away!
<chillywilly> are the debian packages of all the stuff?

<dtm> go ahead and take a look
<dtm> it's the best IVR on the planet!
<dtm> think of it as the apache of telephony
<dtm> takes virtually any type of telephony device and turns it into a call center, an IVR, voicemail server, etc
<dtm> it's the best for most people.
<Chipaca> IVR is an interactive voice racoon?
<dtm> yes
<dtm> it's best to wear a turtleneck though when calling a Bayonne, because otherwise the 'coon will go to town on your neck, seeing how the phone's held up to your ear
<dtm> possibly kevlar
<dtm> the coons are clean, however
<dtm> unlike competing products' coons
<dtm> some may use cheaper imitation coons, such as possums
<dtm> or feral cats
<dtm> Derek's organization actually *has* some in its employ, from what I hear

<dtm> running the place!
<dtm> Chipaca: IVR == interactive voice response
<Vee2d2> seriously ivr is like a voice menu?
<dtm> i.e. a menu with prompts and often voicemail
<Chipaca> the image of open racoons is at least disturbing
<dtm> "thank you for calling XXX.  press 1 for sales, 2 for collections, and 3 to troutslap chilly"

<dtm> well

<dtm> we compiled kernel 1.2.13 on a 90 MHz pentium in that time!
<Chipaca> chillywilly: you should really go for the 387
<chillywilly> I have gnome 2 running on my 450MHz laptop w/160MB RAM
<chillywilly> and gcc 3.2
<chillywilly> which is kinda slow
<chillywilly> and my kernel config is...
<chillywilly> kinda big
<Chipaca> compiling 2.5?
<chillywilly> no
<chillywilly> 2.4.20-xfs
<chillywilly> from sgi's cvs
<Chipaca> I didn't know 2.4 worked when compiled with 3.2
<chillywilly> hmmm, maybe I do have the old gcc laying around
<chillywilly> 2.95.4
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> oh well
<dtm> is 3.2 slower?
<chillywilly> but I only use g++ 3.2 for c++ hacking
<chillywilly> well g++ 3.2 is slower
<Chipaca> dtm: depends what you're measuring
<chillywilly> and it is just a c++ frontend
<Chipaca> chillywilly: "
<chillywilly> to gcc
<Chipaca> chillywilly: g++ is contained in gcc
<chillywilly> right
<chillywilly> the gnu compiler collection
<chillywilly> BUT I was meaning the c++ compiler is a frontend to the C compiler
<Chipaca> dtm: the resulting binaries are usually smaller, faster, or both
<chillywilly> and in the sense Iw as talking gcc == the c compiler
<chillywilly> right, but it takes longer to compiler
<chillywilly> compile
<Chipaca> chillywilly: gcc is the compiler, when invoked directly it works like cc
<chillywilly> but my machine isn't the fastest int he world
Action: Chipaca 's is
<chillywilly> Chipaca: really?!?1
<chillywilly> WOW!!!!
<chillywilly> AWESOME!!!!!
<Chipaca> not _this_ world
<chillywilly> YOUS JUST SAID WHAT I SAID!!!!!!
<Chipaca> chillywilly: no, you didn't
<chillywilly> what?
<chillywilly> are you blind?
<chillywilly> gah, phone
Action: Chipaca tries to figure out what chillywilly is on about
<chillywilly> you're trying to arge semantics with me about gcc
<chillywilly> gcc is the command for the c compiler
<chillywilly> and also mean the gnu compiler collection when talking about the project as a whole
<chillywilly> and I was acknowledging that
<chillywilly> and then you attempted to argue with me about it
<Chipaca> chillywilly: no, I didn't attempt to argue. I just came in and won the argument.
Action: Chipaca grins
<chillywilly> you didn't win squat
<Chipaca> why would I want to win *that*?
<chillywilly> you attemtped to say what was already said
<chillywilly> therefore making an ass of yorself
<chillywilly> so cork it
<Chipaca> chillywilly: I think you misunderstand...
<Chipaca> try this
<Chipaca> ls -li /usr/bin/g{cc,++}-2.95
<chillywilly> I know gcc is a symlink
<chillywilly> that's besides thew point
<chillywilly> I have both installed
<chillywilly> but
<Chipaca> agh
<chillywilly> the current symlink points at the old one
Action: dtm declares all of gnue the winner in this contest!
<Chipaca> look at the file sizes!
<dtm> the amount of knowledge that chillywilly and Chipaca have just imparted to this channel are invaluable to humanity
<dtm> you all get the nobel prize
<Chipaca> dtm: here, go get me a coke
<dtm> for increasing the amount of ascii in the world
<dtm> ok sure
<chillywilly> I don't have the old g++ though
<chillywilly> so that command only half works
<Chipaca> chillywilly: what I'm trying to say is that, as far as I know, gcc and g++ are the same program
<chillywilly> g++ 3.2 ias more standards compliant and secksy
<chillywilly> s/ias/is/
<chillywilly> right
<dtm> Chipaca: here ya go sir
<dtm> *coke*
<chillywilly> I jst said g++ was a frontend to the c compiler
<Chipaca> cheers
<chillywilly> silly
<chillywilly> lakajhdflkjs hdlkjfh slkdjfhk
<Chipaca> chillywilly: what I'm trying to say is that they are the _same_ _program_
Action: Chipaca is about to win by default
<chillywilly> nah

<chillywilly> eat it
<chillywilly> it's not the same program but a frontend
<chillywilly> to make the c++ code c code, afaik
<Chipaca> rats, that's new
<chillywilly> right, case gcc has had extensive changes to it anyway

<chillywilly> see I made those symlinks
<chillywilly> I could change it to 3.2 if I wanted
<chillywilly> anyway
<chillywilly> this all was a pointless conversation
Action: chillywilly compiled mach64 drm module to hopefullty get 3d acceleration with his Rage Mobility P/M
<chillywilly> er, compiles
<jcater> aren't all #gnuenterprise conversations relatively pointless?

<jcater> um, yeah
<revDeke> been a few months and only 24 packages to upgrade
