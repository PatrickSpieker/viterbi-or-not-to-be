<jamest> hi
<andrizas> hi
<andrizas> jamest, I need some help
<jamest> ok
<jamest> what's up?
<andrizas> i have gforms-win32-binary install
jbailey (~jbailey@HSE-Toronto-ppp318843.sympatico.ca) joined #gnuenterprise.
<andrizas> i have mysql driver for python
<andrizas> when i install it, this thing is looking for python installation
<andrizas> I don't have python 
<andrizas> how to make this thing work for gnue
<jamest> you shouldn't have to install the mysql driver seperately
<jamest> the win32 install should have it included
<andrizas> before I had python 2.1 and forms 1.0 on the same machine. Forms was working only when copied mysqldb directory from python2.1 to gnue/forms
<andrizas> connections.conf file was ok.
<jamest> ouch
<jamest> hmmmm
<jamest> i can't test forms win32 install so maybe it's messed up
<jamest> :(
<andrizas> :(
<andrizas> ok . I have another problem
<drochaid[pain]> which forms version?
<drochaid[pain]> I can test mysql as well as postgres
<andrizas> 1.0
<jamest> ah
<jamest> you'll want to move to at least 0.1.1 or better yet the win32 build from the 29th
<jamest> (if your connection will allow for it)
Action: jamest hates to recommend new downloads for people that have to pay by the minute
<andrizas> I'm not sure 100%
<drochaid[pain]> but not forms designer build from 29th .. go with forms designer 0.1.1 as it works
<drochaid[pain]> sorry jamest ;)

<jamest> sorry I'm so choppy
<jamest> at work
<jamest> and on phone
<andrizas> another problem is I can't start designer on python 2.2
<jamest> ooo
<andrizas> it says "missing Gnue conf fileDB000 
<jamest> nothing has been tested on python 2.2
<andrizas> I see
<jamest> the win32 bins are completely self contained
<jamest> you shouldn't need anything else installed 
<jamest> you don't need python, db driver, etc, etc
<drochaid[pain]> jamest: I run 0.1.1 and the 29th win32 build  on python2.2 with no more probs than you currently know of
<andrizas> i installed from src
<jamest> andrizas: ah
<jamest> drochaid[pain]: the 29th snapshot of forms is broken?

<jamest> the 29th snapshot of designer is broken, the 29th forms binaries should work
<drochaid[pain]> sorry, so far I've used forms client and forms desinger to distinguish
<jamest> 0.1.1 forms binary has faulty login logic for the pypgsql driver 
<jamest> andrizas: so everything you've done is from source?
<andrizas> yeap
<jamest> ok
<andrizas> 1.1
<jamest> cool
<drochaid[pain]> just to confirm for future use .. you use, common, forms, designer, navigator and geas ? is that the right terminology to let you know what I mean?
<andrizas> I see confusion
<jamest> drochaid[pain]: yip, or just say "hey james, don't be stupid"

<dneighbo> ToyMan: yes we were bumbed that we were not able to make as well
<dneighbo> hopefully FSF made good use of the extra booth space in some way shape or form
<dneighbo> jamest: you are in correct in saying nothing is tested on 2.2
<dneighbo> i run python 2.2 on my redhat 6.2 box at home
<dneighbo> and up to 0.1.1 seems to run fine on it
<jamest> boing!
<dneighbo> not tested on python2.2 on windows though
<dneighbo> but i did test on 2.1 and 2.0
<ToyMan> hi dneighbo
<dneighbo> for 0.1.1
<dneighbo> i can test the mysql portion if you like as well for 0.1.1
<dneighbo> as i have a mysql db here
<dneighbo> though i cant do so until end of day
<dneighbo> if someone is having issues they can always grab the ODBC driver
<dneighbo> for their db of choice
<dneighbo> as odbc has been tested pretty extensively by me here :)
<dneighbo> of course the wizards wont work, but it could 'tide' them over until later
<dneighbo> btw: did you tag cvs before you started gutting triggers?
<dneighbo> in case we have issues with drivers we can release a 0.1.2
<Vooch> What version of python do I need?
mdean (~mdean@mkc-65-28-73-63.kc.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> vooch 2.1 is probably most 'tested'
<dneighbo> but 2.0, 2.1 or 2.2 should work
<Vooch> dneighbo: thanks
<dneighbo> if you get 2.2 you will have to 'compile' some of the dependencies
<dneighbo> because they dont have binaries that work with 2.2
<dneighbo> i did 2.2 and all dependencies from source and it works
<Vooch> i suck, so i'll go with 2.0 or 2.1...hehe
<Vooch> I'm trying to install GNUe for the first time.  Right now I'm trying to install GNUe-Designer-0.1.0 and I did "./setup.py install" and it says "Warning: modules installed to '/usr/local/gnue/lib/python/' which is not in Python's module search path (sys.path) -- you'll have to change the search path yourself".

<Vooch> Does anyone know where I should go after I do the "make install" in the geas-0.0.6 folder?  (ie. how do I run the program)?
<dneighbo> Vooch: on the error for designer ignore it (iirc)
<dneighbo> daminal: i have same issue, designer i assume
<dneighbo> designer will work, BUT the object navigator wont
<dneighbo> iirc
<dneighbo> i think it might be a wx thing
<dneighbo> what versio nof wxWindows you running there?
<dneighbo> or did you go from install?
<dneighbo> Vooch: geas is not usable in production, i would only install if you plan on developing on it at htis point
<dneighbo> or want to play with it
<dneighbo> after you make geas 
<dneighbo> you have to edit some conf files
<dneighbo> and then you can start ./geas-server (iirc)
<daminal> dneighbo - I don't think it's wxWindows, I just checked out a fresh cvs.
<daminal> The images in the html directory ore ok, and display in iexplorer.
<daminal> The images in common don't
<mdean> if you got them out of cvs, they may not have been checked in as binary
<dneighbo> mdean what verson of forms are you running?
<mdean> dneighbo: I'm not currently - it has been a while
<dneighbo> er i meant daminal :)
<dneighbo> btw mdean snow day?
<mdean> yup
<mdean> 3 days now
<dneighbo> relatives in olathe, say they have been  BOMARDED
<mdean> ja
<mdean> power is out @ work
<dneighbo> daminal: i have cvs from 3 days ago on windows
<mdean> I actually worked from home on wednesday
<dneighbo> and i have image errors
<dneighbo> but the files seem ok
<dneighbo> its just my version of wx doesnt like .ico files much
<dneighbo> and thats what object navigator uses
<daminal> dneighbo: I've tried this with two different cvs checkouts, and with the 0.1.1 zips
<daminal> Also, I managed to get some png's working by using images from older releases.
<daminal> Python complains about corrupted line endings.

<daminal> Ok - need a pointer to the download location.
<daminal> All I could find were snapshots.
<mdean> dneighbo: were those checked into CVS with -kb ?
<mdean> if they aren't, windows will have problems with them because of eol conversion

<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> did you install it or did you run from source directory?
<Vooch> i think i installed it
<Vooch> it's in /usr/local/bin

<reinhard> if you uninstall

<reinhard> it is a python script that shows how geas could be used from a client
<Vooch> do I have to uninstall it? or, can i just go to the source dir and run it from there?
<reinhard> however this script depends on geas being run from the source directory
<reinhard> and if you have geas installed it will possibly find some files twice and not know which ones to use
<reinhard> you can try w/o uninstall

<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> you'd better not mess around with that
<Vooch> ok
<Vooch> ahhh
<Vooch> i've got an idea
<reinhard> ok?
<Vooch> i typed python2
Nick change: ajmitch__ -> ajmitch
<Vooch> and that got me into a 2.2 version of it
<reinhard> damn
<reinhard> you had the idea just 10 seconds before me :)
<ajmitch> mmm, python
<Vooch> lol
<ajmitch> hi Vooch, reinhard
<Vooch> ok, so it's import ....?
<Vooch> import corba
<reinhard> when you enter "import CORBA" in python2?
<Vooch> ok
<Vooch> i'll try it
<Vooch> ack!  ImportError.  No module named CORBA
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> please try
<reinhard> python
<reinhard> import sys
<reinhard> print sys.version
<reinhard> --
<reinhard> and then you will see what version of python is loaded when you type just "python"
<Vooch> >>> print sys.version
<Vooch> 2.1.2 (#1, Jan 31 2002, 10:21:59)
<Vooch> [GCC 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-81)]
<Vooch> ---
<reinhard> ok
<Vooch> maybe it's a corba problem.
<reinhard> what about
<reinhard> :
<reinhard> python1.5
<reinhard> import CORBA
<reinhard> ---
<reinhard> ?
<Vooch> >>> import CORBA
<Vooch> >>>
<Vooch> when i do the --- I get a syntax error
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> sorry
<reinhard> that was only to tell you that i am finished :)
<Vooch> but the import CORBA did seem to work
<Vooch> lol
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> so "python" starts python2 by default
<reinhard> but orbit-python installs where only python1.5 finds it
<reinhard> actually "python1.5 addrbook.py" should work
<reinhard> than
<reinhard> then
<Vooch> ok i'll try that
<reinhard> bb in 30 min
Nick change: reinhard -> rm-afk
<Vooch> k
<Vooch> I ran python1.5 addrbook.py and got:
<Vooch> IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../../src/geas-server.ior'
<Vooch> i went into the src directory and didn't see a file called "geas-server.ior".
<daminal> Bother. I went back to the 0.1.1 zips, and now I can't log in to postgresql.

<chillywilly> dunno yet
<chillywilly> I have some material to digest first
<ajmitch> k
<chillywilly> but this ODMG book should help things a bit
<reinhard> Vooch: if you read this
<reinhard> Vooch: the "ior not found" problem can probably be solved with uninstalling geas
<Vooch> ok
<Vooch> thanks
<reinhard> oh you are here
<Vooch> aye!
<Vooch> reinhard:  How do I uninstall geas-0.0.6?  It's not in RPM format, so I haven't a clue.
<chillywilly> you compiled it?
<chillywilly> make uinstall
<chillywilly> er
<Vooch> ok thanks
<chillywilly> make uninstall
<Vooch> thanks chillywilly
<chillywilly> np
<reinhard> thanks chillywilly for jumping in
Action: reinhard is a bit sleepy today
<chillywilly> 11pm eh?
<chillywilly> er, pm
<Vooch> ack!   I did the make uninstall, but:
<chillywilly> it's only 4pm here
<Vooch> IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../../src/geas-server.ior'
<reinhard> Vooch: geas-server is running?
<chillywilly> you need to hack your config
<Vooch> <--- El Stupido!
<Vooch> lol
<chillywilly> specify where the ior is
<reinhard> however the default config should place the ior in the right place
<chillywilly> hmmm
<reinhard> i think Vooch has found the mistake ;)
<Vooch> error: Connection to database 'gnue' failed: FATAL 1:  user "hacker" does not exist
<reinhard> ok
<Vooch> Before it was looking for user 'gnue'
<Vooch> I set up a 'gnue' user in PostgreSQL
<reinhard> NOW you have to hack your config
<reinhard> :)
<chillywilly> again that's int he config file ;)
<reinhard> src/geas.conf
<Vooch> ok
<reinhard> near the bottom
<reinhard> "user=hacker"
<reinhard> or something close to tha
<reinhard> that
<reinhard> chillywilly: yes 11 pm
<chillywilly> username       gnue
<chillywilly> like that
<Vooch> ok thanks!
<reinhard> chillywilly: but what bites me most is
<chillywilly> yes?
<reinhard> i had 200% work over the last weeks
<reinhard> euro conversion
<reinhard> it was like i was on adrenaline all the time
<chillywilly> eeek
<reinhard> euro conversion is better than crack ;)
<Vooch> AWESOME!
<reinhard> and now i'm on cold turkey so to speak
<Vooch> ty ty ty!
<chillywilly> you had to hack your software to support the euro?
<reinhard> all the sleep i missed in the last weeks falls back on me now
<reinhard> chillywilly: sure
<reinhard> quite a lot
<chillywilly> heh
<reinhard> well to be precise
<chillywilly> must've been a pain
<reinhard> not to support the euro per se
<Vooch> thanks reinhard and chillywilly !
<reinhard> but to support the _conversion_ to euro
<chillywilly> no problem Vooch
<chillywilly> reinhard: I see
<reinhard> for example if you support a company with over 70.000 items
<reinhard> they wouldn't be happy to enter the new prices manually
<chillywilly> indeed
<chillywilly> that would suck
<reinhard> plus this all needs to be installed
<reinhard> and the conversion has to be run
<chillywilly> yay!
<chillywilly> question is
<reinhard> and lots of customers don't dare to do anything that is out of the normal
<chillywilly> did you make some nice cash/
<chillywilly> ?
<chillywilly> ;)
<reinhard> well i can make a living from it :)
<Vooch> Select a country from the following list:
<Vooch> Got any idea how I can select a country?
<Vooch> I'm trying to add someone to the address book.
<chillywilly> should be a list there and you type int he number
<Vooch> Or, do I add that in Postgresql
<reinhard> with the menu item "S" = Setup
<Vooch> no list appears
<Vooch> ok
<reinhard> you can setup the available countries
<chillywilly> maybe there is a scrupt you have to run
<chillywilly> ah yea
<chillywilly> you have to do setup first
<reinhard> Vooch: please don't laugh at the silly colums of the countries table
<reinhard> it was to test all available data formats :)
<Vooch> hehe
<Vooch> number of cabinetmakers within country....number of carjackings per year...
<reinhard> lol
<Vooch> lol
<Vooch> ok got it to work
<reinhard> congrats
<reinhard> now you could try to do things like
<reinhard> connect addrbook.py over the network to a geas-server running on another machine
<reinhard> etc
<reinhard> j/k
<reinhard> in fact it _should_ work
<reinhard> but not sure if somebody ever tried it
<chillywilly> hrrrrm
<reinhard> actually this is why we use corba
<chillywilly> you need to get at the ior though
<reinhard> IIRC i tried it with 0.0.4 or something like that
<reinhard> yeah i ftp'd the ior before trying :)
<chillywilly> did it work?
<chillywilly> ok
<reinhard> it did work IIRC but not sure
<chillywilly> which is lame
<chillywilly> imho
<reinhard> it's more than a year
<reinhard> yes it's lame
<chillywilly> we need corba name space thingy
<reinhard> we need something like a name server
<reinhard> yes
<chillywilly> orbit2 might have it
<chillywilly> and it id getting pretty stable and usable
<chillywilly> Gnome 2 is going to use it
<chillywilly> I think orbit2 may also be thread safe
<chillywilly> or getting close
<Vooch> reinhard:  Actually, I have this installed on our web dev server and I'm telnetting into it from my computer.
<chillywilly> I would mich rather be able to use the current rpc abstraction mechanism that jcater is writing
<chillywilly> but it's in python
<chillywilly> dunno how easy it is to call python code from C
<chillywilly> then again this is the whole damn point of corba
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> er, one of the "features"
<reinhard> Vooch: that's easy
<reinhard> Vooch: but geas-server and addrbook.py run on the same machine
<reinhard> they should be able to run on different machines
<chillywilly> why do we call the binary geas-server?
<reinhard> as long as addrbook.py has access to the ior file that is generated by geas-server
<chillywilly> what's the point?
<chillywilly> it should just be geas
<chillywilly> server is already in the name
<reinhard> well actually the "s" in geas already means "server"
<reinhard> it's like you say
<chillywilly> exactly
<reinhard> gnue-enterprise
<reinhard> or
<reinhard> jamest thompson
<chillywilly> we need a nice init script
<chillywilly>  /etc/init.d/geas start
<chillywilly> ;)
<reinhard> chillywilly: we even need a nice working code
<reinhard> before
<chillywilly> :D
<chillywilly> yes, of course
<chillywilly> or do e let distros worry about making init scripts?
<chillywilly> whatever, guess an init script is not important anyway
<reinhard> i would guess init scripts are a distro thing
<reinhard> we need maintainers for the different distros
<reinhard> a redhat rpm maintainer
<reinhard> (we have a debian maintainer)
<reinhard> a windows maintainer
<chillywilly> we have a debian maintainer
<chillywilly> hehe
<reinhard> guys
<reinhard> yesterday i was nearly starting to cry
<reinhard> i was on local lug meeting
<reinhard> they presented their new homepage
<reinhard> done with postnuke
<reinhard> (looked quite familiar to me :) )
<reinhard> and they told us members could upload files to the download section

<chillywilly> the apache init script is very generic and just uses apachctl program/script

<dsmith> AHHH!
<chillywilly> why would they say that in a lug?
<chillywilly> that's retarded
<ajmitch> our LUG demos are usually done on a slackware box :)
<ajmitch> most ppl seem to use debian :)
<reinhard> that's cool
<reinhard> most of our lug members are regular win users
<ajmitch> oh
<reinhard> use windows for all serious things
<reinhard> and have a linux box somewhere to play with when they are bored
Action: dsmith admits to using windows for taxes
<reinhard> i would bet that 50% of our lug members don't know what "ls" means
<ajmitch> we're getting a few more win users, but most seem to be only gnu/linux (a couple of gnu/hurd users)
<dsmith> But that's IT!
<reinhard> virtually NOONE has understood the concept of FREE SOFTWARE
<reinhard> the concept of freedom
<Vooch> does ls mean 'list'?
<chillywilly> bah, my mom bought turbo tax and offered to do my taxes but I refused as I will not use non-free software
<dsmith> Vooch: exactly
<ajmitch> reinhard: that seems to be lacking a bit in our LUG too
<chillywilly> I'd rather just suffer for now
<reinhard> as opposed to the fact that gnu/linux is more stable, more secure etc.
<Vooch> anyone here with nashville lug?
<ajmitch> only meeting i missed was based around demoing vmware & compupic
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> http://www.mlug.net
<chillywilly> that's our LUG
<ajmitch> i know noone else here is with dunlug :)
<reinhard> i would use a free alternative even if it was LESS stable than the ms program
<Vooch> nlug.org
<reinhard> s/would/do actually :)

<jamest_> hey
<jamest_> menus in forms
<jamest_> i need custom menus soon (before the 15th of this month :( )
<chillywilly> has anyone looked at the XForms  standard?
<chillywilly> I am just curious
<jamest_> long ago
<chillywilly> it's not any good?
<jamest_> it didn't (at that time) fit forms target
<jamest_> and IIRC was pretty complex
<chillywilly> man, freakin' miguel is smoking great crack
<dneighbo> "But .NET has another security system on top. It's designed to have same sort of security as Java. Instead of the application being the unit of security - you trust the whole app or you don't trust any of it - each portion of the program can be running on a separate trust domain.
<dneighbo> "So you can have Gnumeric running and you import a file from 1-2-3. Gnumeric asks the network or service do you have a plug-in for 123 - but the problem is you cannot trust this code, right? So you give it limited permissions. You're not going to let them write to the file, just read, populate the spreadsheet. If they try anything else the plug-in is killed, it throws an exception.
<dneighbo> It's a sandbox?
<chillywilly> wish he would come around so I could tell him to his face
<dneighbo> this is scary
<dneighbo> basically its a good thing 'security wise' to lock WHOLE APPLICATIONS OUT?
<dneighbo> sounds like predatory behavior to me
<dneighbo> just an FYI
<jamest_> well
<dneighbo> change his sample
<jamest_> what gnome does doesn't bother me much
<dneighbo> you are running word and you get a file from star office
<dneighbo> and the plugin dont let you do shit cept convert it to word or die
<dneighbo> :)
<dneighbo> jamest_ im just curious because redhat has a lot of money tied into gnome
<dneighbo> as does now sun
<jamest_> well, star office is too well known for macro viri to be trusted by word
<dneighbo> how do they FEEL about this
<jamest_> :)
<dneighbo> i.e. sun was going to (is) shipping gnome on all its desktops (iirc)
<jamest_> they're proud, card carrrying members of the .net-bon(e) project
<dneighbo> jamest_: i need menus too :)
<jamest_> anyway
<dneighbo> i hit jcater up on it as navigator is neat and all
<jamest_> on menus
<dneighbo> but it wont work for production stuff imho
<dneighbo> i think the basis is right
<jamest_> what do people need
<dneighbo> its a matter of reading that file into a gfd
<dneighbo> as a menu
<dneighbo> not a separate thing that hangs off the side
<jamest_> btw - I'm talking menus on the top of the form app
<jamest_> not embeded in the app
<jamest_> er
<jamest_> not embeded in the form
<dneighbo> im not saying there is NO value to the side
<dneighbo> what i would like to see
<jamest_> that's a far more complicated issue
<dneighbo> is gpd file loaded into existing menu
<dneighbo> so you have
<dneighbo> file data help
<dneighbo> or whatever currently
<dneighbo> and that the gpd file at load time
<dneighbo> loads
<chillywilly> jamest: how the3 fuck do you know what sun, readhat, etc, feels about ximian's .NET bs initiative?
<dneighbo> after that
<dneighbo> so you woudl have
<dneighbo> file data help accounting humanresources 
<dneighbo> or whatever
<jamest_> chillywilly: I was joking....would you like to be a member of a club proclaiming to be "boned"
<dneighbo> and then loads a 'blank' or 'default' gfd
<chillywilly> in fact i think the whole reason for the umteen flame wars with reaqdhat folk and ximian folk on gnome-hackers was because of these differences
<dneighbo> jamest_ is that making any sense?
<jamest_> i think so
<jamest_> you want a .gpd to sit inside a data sub menu on forms menus
<dneighbo> yeah
<jamest_> forms menus = forms file menu
<dneighbo> then we can argue is is better to
<dneighbo> a. only have one form in the framework open at a time
<dneighbo> b. allow multiple to be open 
<dneighbo> c. allow multiples but contain them like an MDI app all within the 'container'
<dneighbo> i think a or c make most sense
<dneighbo> and a is probably easies to do right away
<dneighbo> and would perform more like traditional app
<dneighbo> and make easiest for 'curses' or other limited UI's

<chillywilly> Mono has already slayed one of the holy cows of the Gnome project - the insistence that all code be released under the GPL. The decision to change to an MIT X11 license for some libraries passed off without too much protest this week, and Miguel said it was to avoid fragmentation, as it allowed the project to use Intel's optimizing run time:-

<jcater> 'sup all?
<Mr_You> hi jason
<Mr_You> + everyone
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> for the record, I disagree w/derek's analysis of navigator menus
<jcater> I think b has as much value as a or b in his example
<jcater> to me, option "a" (and in general having GPDs loaded as submenus) are a "gee-whiz" feature that is only practical for small subsystems
<jcater> not entire production systems
<jcater> I'd prefer to see "Submenu items" that are attached to "triggers"
<jcater> and leave navigator as a separate tool
<jcater> Oracle does it this way
<jcater> SAP does it this way
Action: jcater guesses Delphi does not ;)
<jamest_> hey
<jcater> howdy
<jamest_> what I was wanting to do in menu system
<jamest_> GMenu
<jcater> I was out sick today :(
<jamest_> :(
<jamest_> GMenu's make a tree
<jamest_> they have thinks
<jamest_> things
<jamest_> like Text, HotKey, Trigger
<jamest_> so that all menu items fire triggers
<jamest_> and that these triggers have default names
<jamest_> so that a form could overwrite the std trigger with a custom onw
<jamest_> one
<Mr_You> hope you feel better jason
<jcater> I do
<jamest_> also on menu item placement
Action: jcater got lots of rest today
<jcater> I see where you're going, and I like that :)
<jamest_> I _think_ we'd need to be able to find menu entries
<jamest_> somehow
<jamest_> so that my <menu> tags
<jamest_> can somehow place themselves like this
<jamest_>   find File.Save and put me after it
Action: jamest_ has not thought about this much
<jamest_> also
<jamest_> GMenu would be based upon GObj
<jamest_> and thus the entire default system menu and form customizations would be exposed to the trigger system
<jamest_> so that we could do menu.file.save.disable = Ture
<jamest_> True even
<jamest_> overview might look like this
<jamest_> menu - top level menu object
<jamest_>   file
<jamest_>   data
<jamest_>   foo
<jamest_>   bar
<jamest_>     item1
<jamest_>     item2
<jamest_> anyway
<jamest_> my initial thoughts are to put this in common
<jamest_> so that eventually any gnue app could define it's menus this way
Action: jamest_ worries that everyone is laughing too hard at the design to type on their keyboards
<jamest_> btw - this should allow for derek's custom gpd loader
Action: dsmith is busy watching funny home videos.
<jcater> nah
<jcater> doing my taxes
<jcater> dude
<jcater> I'm using TaxSlayer this year
<jcater> and I swear they used a form generation program a lot (in concept) like GNUe Forms
<jamest_> TaxSlayer?
<jcater> .com
<dsmith> jcater: What platform is TaxSlayer ?
<jcater> pc only :(
<dsmith> :P
<jcater> and you know "pc" == Win32
Action: dsmith is away: Picking up my daughter at school
<jcater> I used turbotax for the web last 2 years
<jcater> but they are getting expensive
<jcater> used SecureTax.com before that
<jcater> but they were bought out by TurboTax :(
<jcater> (they were good)
Action: jamest_ is too mainstream
Action: jamest_ always buys TurboTax
<Mr_You> I think thats what I usually end up using also.. 
Action: dsmith is back (gone 00:05:12)
<jcater> jamest_: did you see the pic of SAP Easy Access screenshot someone posted?
<jamest_> no
<jcater> that's what I'd like to have ;)
<jcater> lemme see if I can find my bookmark
<jamest_> i wonder
<jamest_> should the menu system be entirely seprate from the toolbar system
<jamest_> I'm pretty sure that I don't want a toolbar entry that isn't on the menu
<jcater> http://help.sap.com/saphelp_46c/helpdata/en/49/2dfe88088b11d396a9006094b9867b/content.htm
<jamest_> so I think the toolbar system should just contain links to menu entries
<jamest_> but what I wonder
<jamest_> is if menu items should have a toolbarPosition and toolbarIcon attribute
<jamest_> that if filled add to the toolbar
Action: jamest_ has little thought in this
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> are you talking custom stuff? or built-in toolbar/menu stufF?
<jcater> or both?
<jamest_> all toolbar entries must be on the menu, they can't exist without a menu pick
<jcater> I definitely agree w/that statement
<jcater> as imho a mouse is "always" optional equipment :)
<jamest_> good
<jcater> if you allow toolbar options w/o a corresponding menu option, it's easy to "forget" that aspect
<jamest_> yip
<jamest_> what I guess I'm asking
<jamest_> is should we include the toolbar def as part of the menu def
<jamest_> or have a completely seperate GToolBar that sits seperate but acts to only "fire" the menu picks
<jcater> imho, the former
<jcater> (that would also allow us to provide "custom" toolbars in that the end user can add to/remove tools from the toolbar
<jcater> "These actions (from the menu system) are the default toolbar, but you can add other "Actions")
<jcater> btw, I'm saying that would provide the framework for that; not that we should do it :)
<jamest_> um
<jamest_> i'm confused
<jamest_> the former was the one tied directly into the menu def
<jcater> ah, well pay no attention to me, then
<jamest_> um
<jamest_> help
Action: jamest_ is confused
<jamest_> which did you want?
<jamest_> or better yet
<jcater> that one
<jamest_> tied direct?
<jcater> are you talking about "defining" menus?
Action: jcater thinks maybe jcater is confused
<jamest_> <menu blah="" toolbarPos="2" toolbarIcon="Goat.png"/>
<jamest_>   <menu .....>
<jamest_> <menu>
<jamest_> or
<jamest_> <menu .......>
<jamest_>   <menu ......>
<jamest_> <menu ....>
<jamest_> <toolbar>
<jamest_>   <link>menu.file.save</link>
<jamest_>   <link>menu.file.goatrape</link>
<jamest_> </toolbar>
<jcater> ah, I was confused... I'd think the latter
<jamest_> btw - that was on the fly so the struct sucks
<jamest_> ok
<jcater> except goatrape should go under "View" not "File"
<jamest_> rofl

<derek> i think i get misunderstood at times
<derek> btw: jcater delphi doesnt do menus
<jcater> that was a joke ;)
<derek> not in this context as delphi is a different type of tool than forms
<derek> the sap thing is ok, if the current navigator was cleaned up to that kind of polish it might be pretty cool
<derek> in fact if we made navigator a tree
<derek> instead of the clicks that it currently is
<jcater> well, it functions the same way... I said early on it was ugly ;)
<derek> it might substitute for menus for the short term
<derek> i still think we will need ability to load gpd's as menus directly into the 'framework'
<derek> but i see value in a 'pretty' navigator as well
<derek> :)
<derek> its not so much navigator is ugly is that its not super easy to use
<derek> i.e. navigator is hard to navigate for complex menus :)
<jcater> well, this is a difference in perspective, obviously ;)
Action: jcater comes fomr a curses world
<jcater> but this is why we support many options w/all the tools :)
<derek> i.e. unless you know exactly where things are under the current navigator they are hard to find
<jcater> so we can make everyone happy
<derek> yes
<derek> the current navigator is perfect for curses world almost untouched :)
<derek> as it performs like classical navigation system in curses
<derek> i think menus will be important though (as many people like them)
<derek> i got 'gagged' by them at omega as they had more menu options than you could shake a stick at :)
<jcater> that's my fear
<jcater> as at ncs, we have hundreds of forms
<jcater> (just ask jamest some time how many we have ;)
<derek> how would jamest know
<derek> i dont get gmenu
<derek> it appears to be what gpd's already are
<jcater> err, we're discussing internals now
<jcater> GMenu would be a python object
<jcater> (memphis!oracle)$ ls -l *.inp|wc -l
<jcater>    1319
<jcater> (memphis!oracle)$ ls -l *.rep|wc -l
<derek> ok so <menu> is merely an 'internal' DOM object
<jcater>    1641
<jcater> 1319 forms and 1641 reports
<jcater> please don't ask why
<jcater> ;)
<derek> not a physical file containing <menu>
<derek> why?
<derek> also did you all see conversation here that
<derek> images are done incorrectly in cvs?
<derek> i.e. they got checked in as other than binary
<jcater> oops
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> how do we fix that
<derek> and cvs chewed them up so they are bad on windows boxen
Action: jcater didn't know cvs made the distinction
Action: jcater is still learning cvs
<derek> grab the good copy and check in
<derek> jcater: a good admin sets image types to AUTO do binary so the user doesnt have to
<derek> i.e. you can set on the server certain extensions to ALWAYS do binary check in
<derek> so things like .png, .jpg etc we should have set like
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue/www/images$ man cvs |grep binary
<derek>               binary  files),  and  -kv  which  is  useful for an
<derek>               CVSROOT if your cvs binary has the right path  com
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue/www/images$ 
<derek> time to saunter off for a bit.....
