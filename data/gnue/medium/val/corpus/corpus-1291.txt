<jamest> hi
<andrizas> hi
<andrizas> jamest, I need some help
<jamest> ok
<jamest> what's up?
<andrizas> i have gforms-win32-binary install
jbailey (~jbailey@HSE-Toronto-ppp318843.sympatico.ca) joined #gnuenterprise.
<andrizas> i have mysql driver for python
<andrizas> when i install it, this thing is looking for python installation
<andrizas> I don't have python 
<andrizas> how to make this thing work for gnue
<jamest> you shouldn't have to install the mysql driver seperately
<jamest> the win32 install should have it included
<andrizas> before I had python 2.1 and forms 1.0 on the same machine. Forms was working only when copied mysqldb directory from python2.1 to gnue/forms
<andrizas> connections.conf file was ok.
<jamest> ouch
<jamest> hmmmm
<jamest> i can't test forms win32 install so maybe it's messed up
<jamest> :(
<andrizas> :(
<andrizas> ok . I have another problem
<drochaid[pain]> which forms version?
<drochaid[pain]> I can test mysql as well as postgres
<andrizas> 1.0
<jamest> ah
<jamest> you'll want to move to at least 0.1.1 or better yet the win32 build from the 29th
<jamest> (if your connection will allow for it)
Action: jamest hates to recommend new downloads for people that have to pay by the minute
<andrizas> I'm not sure 100%
<drochaid[pain]> but not forms designer build from 29th .. go with forms designer 0.1.1 as it works
<drochaid[pain]> sorry jamest ;)

<jamest> sorry I'm so choppy
<jamest> at work
<jamest> and on phone
<andrizas> another problem is I can't start designer on python 2.2
<jamest> ooo
<andrizas> it says "missing Gnue conf fileDB000 
<jamest> nothing has been tested on python 2.2
<andrizas> I see
<jamest> the win32 bins are completely self contained
<jamest> you shouldn't need anything else installed 
<jamest> you don't need python, db driver, etc, etc
<drochaid[pain]> jamest: I run 0.1.1 and the 29th win32 build  on python2.2 with no more probs than you currently know of
<andrizas> i installed from src
<jamest> andrizas: ah
<jamest> drochaid[pain]: the 29th snapshot of forms is broken?

<jamest> the 29th snapshot of designer is broken, the 29th forms binaries should work
<drochaid[pain]> sorry, so far I've used forms client and forms desinger to distinguish
<jamest> 0.1.1 forms binary has faulty login logic for the pypgsql driver 
<jamest> andrizas: so everything you've done is from source?
<andrizas> yeap
<jamest> ok
<andrizas> 1.1
<jamest> cool
<drochaid[pain]> just to confirm for future use .. you use, common, forms, designer, navigator and geas ? is that the right terminology to let you know what I mean?
<andrizas> I see confusion
<jamest> drochaid[pain]: yip, or just say "hey james, don't be stupid"

<dneighbo> ToyMan: yes we were bumbed that we were not able to make as well
<dneighbo> hopefully FSF made good use of the extra booth space in some way shape or form
<dneighbo> jamest: you are in correct in saying nothing is tested on 2.2
<dneighbo> i run python 2.2 on my redhat 6.2 box at home
<dneighbo> and up to 0.1.1 seems to run fine on it
<jamest> boing!
<dneighbo> not tested on python2.2 on windows though
<dneighbo> but i did test on 2.1 and 2.0
<ToyMan> hi dneighbo
<dneighbo> for 0.1.1
<dneighbo> i can test the mysql portion if you like as well for 0.1.1
<dneighbo> as i have a mysql db here
<dneighbo> though i cant do so until end of day
<dneighbo> if someone is having issues they can always grab the ODBC driver
<dneighbo> for their db of choice
<dneighbo> as odbc has been tested pretty extensively by me here :)
<dneighbo> of course the wizards wont work, but it could 'tide' them over until later
<dneighbo> btw: did you tag cvs before you started gutting triggers?
<dneighbo> in case we have issues with drivers we can release a 0.1.2
<Vooch> What version of python do I need?
mdean (~mdean@mkc-65-28-73-63.kc.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> vooch 2.1 is probably most 'tested'
<dneighbo> but 2.0, 2.1 or 2.2 should work
<Vooch> dneighbo: thanks
<dneighbo> if you get 2.2 you will have to 'compile' some of the dependencies
<dneighbo> because they dont have binaries that work with 2.2
<dneighbo> i did 2.2 and all dependencies from source and it works
<Vooch> i suck, so i'll go with 2.0 or 2.1...hehe
<Vooch> I'm trying to install GNUe for the first time.  Right now I'm trying to install GNUe-Designer-0.1.0 and I did "./setup.py install" and it says "Warning: modules installed to '/usr/local/gnue/lib/python/' which is not in Python's module search path (sys.path) -- you'll have to change the search path yourself".

<Vooch> Does anyone know where I should go after I do the "make install" in the geas-0.0.6 folder?  (ie. how do I run the program)?
<dneighbo> Vooch: on the error for designer ignore it (iirc)
<dneighbo> daminal: i have same issue, designer i assume
<dneighbo> designer will work, BUT the object navigator wont
<dneighbo> iirc
<dneighbo> i think it might be a wx thing
<dneighbo> what versio nof wxWindows you running there?
<dneighbo> or did you go from install?
<dneighbo> Vooch: geas is not usable in production, i would only install if you plan on developing on it at htis point
<dneighbo> or want to play with it
<dneighbo> after you make geas 
<dneighbo> you have to edit some conf files
<dneighbo> and then you can start ./geas-server (iirc)
<daminal> dneighbo - I don't think it's wxWindows, I just checked out a fresh cvs.
<daminal> The images in the html directory ore ok, and display in iexplorer.
<daminal> The images in common don't
<mdean> if you got them out of cvs, they may not have been checked in as binary
<dneighbo> mdean what verson of forms are you running?
<mdean> dneighbo: I'm not currently - it has been a while
<dneighbo> er i meant daminal :)
<dneighbo> btw mdean snow day?
<mdean> yup
<mdean> 3 days now
<dneighbo> relatives in olathe, say they have been  BOMARDED
<mdean> ja
<mdean> power is out @ work
<dneighbo> daminal: i have cvs from 3 days ago on windows
<mdean> I actually worked from home on wednesday
<dneighbo> and i have image errors
<dneighbo> but the files seem ok
<dneighbo> its just my version of wx doesnt like .ico files much
<dneighbo> and thats what object navigator uses
<daminal> dneighbo: I've tried this with two different cvs checkouts, and with the 0.1.1 zips
<daminal> Also, I managed to get some png's working by using images from older releases.
<daminal> Python complains about corrupted line endings.

<daminal> Ok - need a pointer to the download location.
<daminal> All I could find were snapshots.
<mdean> dneighbo: were those checked into CVS with -kb ?
<mdean> if they aren't, windows will have problems with them because of eol conversion

<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> did you install it or did you run from source directory?
<Vooch> i think i installed it
<Vooch> it's in /usr/local/bin

<reinhard> if you uninstall

<reinhard> it is a python script that shows how geas could be used from a client
<Vooch> do I have to uninstall it? or, can i just go to the source dir and run it from there?
<reinhard> however this script depends on geas being run from the source directory
<reinhard> and if you have geas installed it will possibly find some files twice and not know which ones to use
<reinhard> you can try w/o uninstall

<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> you'd better not mess around with that
<Vooch> ok
<Vooch> ahhh
<Vooch> i've got an idea
<reinhard> ok?
<Vooch> i typed python2
Nick change: ajmitch__ -> ajmitch
<Vooch> and that got me into a 2.2 version of it
<reinhard> damn
<reinhard> you had the idea just 10 seconds before me :)
<ajmitch> mmm, python
<Vooch> lol
<ajmitch> hi Vooch, reinhard
<Vooch> ok, so it's import ....?
<Vooch> import corba
<reinhard> when you enter "import CORBA" in python2?
<Vooch> ok
<Vooch> i'll try it
<Vooch> ack!  ImportError.  No module named CORBA
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> please try
<reinhard> python
<reinhard> import sys
<reinhard> print sys.version
<reinhard> --
<reinhard> and then you will see what version of python is loaded when you type just "python"
<Vooch> >>> print sys.version
<Vooch> 2.1.2 (#1, Jan 31 2002, 10:21:59)
<Vooch> [GCC 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-81)]
<Vooch> ---
<reinhard> ok
<Vooch> maybe it's a corba problem.
<reinhard> what about
<reinhard> :
<reinhard> python1.5
<reinhard> import CORBA
<reinhard> ---
<reinhard> ?
<Vooch> >>> import CORBA
<Vooch> >>>
<Vooch> when i do the --- I get a syntax error
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> sorry
<reinhard> that was only to tell you that i am finished :)
<Vooch> but the import CORBA did seem to work
<Vooch> lol
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> so "python" starts python2 by default
<reinhard> but orbit-python installs where only python1.5 finds it
<reinhard> actually "python1.5 addrbook.py" should work
<reinhard> than
<reinhard> then
<Vooch> ok i'll try that
<reinhard> bb in 30 min
Nick change: reinhard -> rm-afk
<Vooch> k
<Vooch> I ran python1.5 addrbook.py and got:
<Vooch> IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../../src/geas-server.ior'
<Vooch> i went into the src directory and didn't see a file called "geas-server.ior".
<daminal> Bother. I went back to the 0.1.1 zips, and now I can't log in to postgresql.

<chillywilly> dunno yet
<chillywilly> I have some material to digest first
<ajmitch> k
<chillywilly> but this ODMG book should help things a bit
<reinhard> Vooch: if you read this
<reinhard> Vooch: the "ior not found" problem can probably be solved with uninstalling geas
<Vooch> ok
<Vooch> thanks
<reinhard> oh you are here
<Vooch> aye!
<Vooch> reinhard:  How do I uninstall geas-0.0.6?  It's not in RPM format, so I haven't a clue.
<chillywilly> you compiled it?
<chillywilly> make uinstall
<chillywilly> er
<Vooch> ok thanks
<chillywilly> make uninstall
<Vooch> thanks chillywilly
<chillywilly> np
<reinhard> thanks chillywilly for jumping in
Action: reinhard is a bit sleepy today
<chillywilly> 11pm eh?
<chillywilly> er, pm
<Vooch> ack!   I did the make uninstall, but:
<chillywilly> it's only 4pm here
<Vooch> IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../../src/geas-server.ior'
<reinhard> Vooch: geas-server is running?
<chillywilly> you need to hack your config
<Vooch> <--- El Stupido!
<Vooch> lol
<chillywilly> specify where the ior is
<reinhard> however the default config should place the ior in the right place
<chillywilly> hmmm
<reinhard> i think Vooch has found the mistake ;)
<Vooch> error: Connection to database 'gnue' failed: FATAL 1:  user "hacker" does not exist
<reinhard> ok
<Vooch> Before it was looking for user 'gnue'
<Vooch> I set up a 'gnue' user in PostgreSQL
<reinhard> NOW you have to hack your config
<reinhard> :)
<chillywilly> again that's int he config file ;)
<reinhard> src/geas.conf
<Vooch> ok
<reinhard> near the bottom
<reinhard> "user=hacker"
<reinhard> or something close to tha
<reinhard> that
<reinhard> chillywilly: yes 11 pm
<chillywilly> username       gnue
<chillywilly> like that
<Vooch> ok thanks!
<reinhard> chillywilly: but what bites me most is
<chillywilly> yes?
<reinhard> i had 200% work over the last weeks
<reinhard> euro conversion
<reinhard> it was like i was on adrenaline all the time
<chillywilly> eeek
<reinhard> euro conversion is better than crack ;)
<Vooch> AWESOME!
<reinhard> and now i'm on cold turkey so to speak
<Vooch> ty ty ty!
<chillywilly> you had to hack your software to support the euro?
<reinhard> all the sleep i missed in the last weeks falls back on me now
<reinhard> chillywilly: sure
<reinhard> quite a lot
<chillywilly> heh
<reinhard> well to be precise
<chillywilly> must've been a pain
<reinhard> not to support the euro per se
<Vooch> thanks reinhard and chillywilly !
<reinhard> but to support the _conversion_ to euro
<chillywilly> no problem Vooch
<chillywilly> reinhard: I see
<reinhard> for example if you support a company with over 70.000 items
<reinhard> they wouldn't be happy to enter the new prices manually
<chillywilly> indeed
<chillywilly> that would suck
<reinhard> plus this all needs to be installed
<reinhard> and the conversion has to be run
<chillywilly> yay!
<chillywilly> question is
<reinhard> and lots of customers don't dare to do anything that is out of the normal
<chillywilly> did you make some nice cash/
<chillywilly> ?
<chillywilly> ;)
<reinhard> well i can make a living from it :)
<Vooch> Select a country from the following list:
<Vooch> Got any idea how I can select a country?
<Vooch> I'm trying to add someone to the address book.
<chillywilly> should be a list there and you type int he number
<Vooch> Or, do I add that in Postgresql
<reinhard> with the menu item "S" = Setup
<Vooch> no list appears
<Vooch> ok
<reinhard> you can setup the available countries
<chillywilly> maybe there is a scrupt you have to run
<chillywilly> ah yea
<chillywilly> you have to do setup first
<reinhard> Vooch: please don't laugh at the silly colums of the countries table
<reinhard> it was to test all available data formats :)
<Vooch> hehe
<Vooch> number of cabinetmakers within country....number of carjackings per year...
<reinhard> lol
<Vooch> lol
<Vooch> ok got it to work
<reinhard> congrats
<reinhard> now you could try to do things like
<reinhard> connect addrbook.py over the network to a geas-server running on another machine
<reinhard> etc
<reinhard> j/k
<reinhard> in fact it _should_ work
<reinhard> but not sure if somebody ever tried it
<chillywilly> hrrrrm
<reinhard> actually this is why we use corba
<chillywilly> you need to get at the ior though
<reinhard> IIRC i tried it with 0.0.4 or something like that
<reinhard> yeah i ftp'd the ior before trying :)
<chillywilly> did it work?
<chillywilly> ok
<reinhard> it did work IIRC but not sure
<chillywilly> which is lame
<chillywilly> imho
<reinhard> it's more than a year
<reinhard> yes it's lame
<chillywilly> we need corba name space thingy
<reinhard> we need something like a name server
<reinhard> yes
<chillywilly> orbit2 might have it
<chillywilly> and it id getting pretty stable and usable
<chillywilly> Gnome 2 is going to use it
<chillywilly> I think orbit2 may also be thread safe
<chillywilly> or getting close
<Vooch> reinhard:  Actually, I have this installed on our web dev server and I'm telnetting into it from my computer.
<chillywilly> I would mich rather be able to use the current rpc abstraction mechanism that jcater is writing
<chillywilly> but it's in python
<chillywilly> dunno how easy it is to call python code from C
<chillywilly> then again this is the whole damn point of corba
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> er, one of the "features"
<reinhard> Vooch: that's easy
<reinhard> Vooch: but geas-server and addrbook.py run on the same machine
<reinhard> they should be able to run on different machines
<chillywilly> why do we call the binary geas-server?
<reinhard> as long as addrbook.py has access to the ior file that is generated by geas-server
<chillywilly> what's the point?
<chillywilly> it should just be geas
<chillywilly> server is already in the name
<reinhard> well actually the "s" in geas already means "server"
<reinhard> it's like you say
<chillywilly> exactly
<reinhard> gnue-enterprise
<reinhard> or
<reinhard> jamest thompson
<chillywilly> we need a nice init script
<chillywilly>  /etc/init.d/geas start
<chillywilly> ;)
<reinhard> chillywilly: we even need a nice working code
<reinhard> before
<chillywilly> :D
<chillywilly> yes, of course
<chillywilly> or do e let distros worry about making init scripts?
<chillywilly> whatever, guess an init script is not important anyway
<reinhard> i would guess init scripts are a distro thing
<reinhard> we need maintainers for the different distros
<reinhard> a redhat rpm maintainer
<reinhard> (we have a debian maintainer)
<reinhard> a windows maintainer
<chillywilly> we have a debian maintainer
<chillywilly> hehe
<reinhard> guys
<reinhard> yesterday i was nearly starting to cry
<reinhard> i was on local lug meeting
<reinhard> they presented their new homepage
<reinhard> done with postnuke
<reinhard> (looked quite familiar to me :) )
<reinhard> and they told us members could upload files to the download section

<chillywilly> the apache init script is very generic and just uses apachctl program/script

<dsmith> AHHH!
<chillywilly> why would they say that in a lug?
<chillywilly> that's retarded
<ajmitch> our LUG demos are usually done on a slackware box :)
<ajmitch> most ppl seem to use debian :)
<reinhard> that's cool
<reinhard> most of our lug members are regular win users
<ajmitch> oh
<reinhard> use windows for all serious things
<reinhard> and have a linux box somewhere to play with when they are bored
Action: dsmith admits to using windows for taxes
<reinhard> i would bet that 50% of our lug members don't know what "ls" means
<ajmitch> we're getting a few more win users, but most seem to be only gnu/linux (a couple of gnu/hurd users)
<dsmith> But that's IT!
<reinhard> virtually NOONE has understood the concept of FREE SOFTWARE
<reinhard> the concept of freedom
<Vooch> does ls mean 'list'?
<chillywilly> bah, my mom bought turbo tax and offered to do my taxes but I refused as I will not use non-free software
<dsmith> Vooch: exactly
<ajmitch> reinhard: that seems to be lacking a bit in our LUG too
<chillywilly> I'd rather just suffer for now
<reinhard> as opposed to the fact that gnu/linux is more stable, more secure etc.
<Vooch> anyone here with nashville lug?
<ajmitch> only meeting i missed was based around demoing vmware & compupic
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> http://www.mlug.net
<chillywilly> that's our LUG
<ajmitch> i know noone else here is with dunlug :)
<reinhard> i would use a free alternative even if it was LESS stable than the ms program
<Vooch> nlug.org
<reinhard> s/would/do actually :)

<jamest_> hey
<jamest_> menus in forms
<jamest_> i need custom menus soon (before the 15th of this month :( )
<chillywilly> has anyone looked at the XForms  standard?
<chillywilly> I am just curious
<jamest_> long ago
<chillywilly> it's not any good?
<jamest_> it didn't (at that time) fit forms target
<jamest_> and IIRC was pretty complex
<chillywilly> man, freakin' miguel is smoking great crack
<dneighbo> "But .NET has another security system on top. It's designed to have same sort of security as Java. Instead of the application being the unit of security - you trust the whole app or you don't trust any of it - each portion of the program can be running on a separate trust domain.
<dneighbo> "So you can have Gnumeric running and you import a file from 1-2-3. Gnumeric asks the network or service do you have a plug-in for 123 - but the problem is you cannot trust this code, right? So you give it limited permissions. You're not going to let them write to the file, just read, populate the spreadsheet. If they try anything else the plug-in is killed, it throws an exception.
<dneighbo> It's a sandbox?
<chillywilly> wish he would come around so I could tell him to his face
<dneighbo> this is scary
<dneighbo> basically its a good thing 'security wise' to lock WHOLE APPLICATIONS OUT?
<dneighbo> sounds like predatory behavior to me
<dneighbo> just an FYI
<jamest_> well
<dneighbo> change his sample
<jamest_> what gnome does doesn't bother me much
<dneighbo> you are running word and you get a file from star office
<dneighbo> and the plugin dont let you do shit cept convert it to word or die
<dneighbo> :)
<dneighbo> jamest_ im just curious because redhat has a lot of money tied into gnome
<dneighbo> as does now sun
<jamest_> well, star office is too well known for macro viri to be trusted by word
<dneighbo> how do they FEEL about this
<jamest_> :)
<dneighbo> i.e. sun was going to (is) shipping gnome on all its desktops (iirc)
<jamest_> they're proud, card carrrying members of the .net-bon(e) project
<dneighbo> jamest_: i need menus too :)
<jamest_> anyway
<dneighbo> i hit jcater up on it as navigator is neat and all
<jamest_> on menus
<dneighbo> but it wont work for production stuff imho
<dneighbo> i think the basis is right
<jamest_> what do people need
<dneighbo> its a matter of reading that file into a gfd
<dneighbo> as a menu
<dneighbo> not a separate thing that hangs off the side
<jamest_> btw - I'm talking menus on the top of the form app
<jamest_> not embeded in the app
<jamest_> er
<jamest_> not embeded in the form
<dneighbo> im not saying there is NO value to the side
<dneighbo> what i would like to see
<jamest_> that's a far more complicated issue
<dneighbo> is gpd file loaded into existing menu
<dneighbo> so you have
<dneighbo> file data help
<dneighbo> or whatever currently
<dneighbo> and that the gpd file at load time
<dneighbo> loads
<chillywilly> jamest: how the3 fuck do you know what sun, readhat, etc, feels about ximian's .NET bs initiative?
<dneighbo> after that
<dneighbo> so you woudl have
<dneighbo> file data help accounting humanresources 
<dneighbo> or whatever
<jamest_> chillywilly: I was joking....would you like to be a member of a club proclaiming to be "boned"
<dneighbo> and then loads a 'blank' or 'default' gfd
<chillywilly> in fact i think the whole reason for the umteen flame wars with reaqdhat folk and ximian folk on gnome-hackers was because of these differences
<dneighbo> jamest_ is that making any sense?
<jamest_> i think so
<jamest_> you want a .gpd to sit inside a data sub menu on forms menus
<dneighbo> yeah
<jamest_> forms menus = forms file menu
<dneighbo> then we can argue is is better to
<dneighbo> a. only have one form in the framework open at a time
<dneighbo> b. allow multiple to be open 
<dneighbo> c. allow multiples but contain them like an MDI app all within the 'container'
<dneighbo> i think a or c make most sense
<dneighbo> and a is probably easies to do right away
<dneighbo> and would perform more like traditional app
<dneighbo> and make easiest for 'curses' or other limited UI's

<chillywilly> Mono has already slayed one of the holy cows of the Gnome project - the insistence that all code be released under the GPL. The decision to change to an MIT X11 license for some libraries passed off without too much protest this week, and Miguel said it was to avoid fragmentation, as it allowed the project to use Intel's optimizing run time:-

<jcater> 'sup all?
<Mr_You> hi jason
<Mr_You> + everyone
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> for the record, I disagree w/derek's analysis of navigator menus
<jcater> I think b has as much value as a or b in his example
<jcater> to me, option "a" (and in general having GPDs loaded as submenus) are a "gee-whiz" feature that is only practical for small subsystems
<jcater> not entire production systems
<jcater> I'd prefer to see "Submenu items" that are attached to "triggers"
<jcater> and leave navigator as a separate tool
<jcater> Oracle does it this way
<jcater> SAP does it this way
Action: jcater guesses Delphi does not ;)
<jamest_> hey
<jcater> howdy
<jamest_> what I was wanting to do in menu system
<jamest_> GMenu
<jcater> I was out sick today :(
<jamest_> :(
<jamest_> GMenu's make a tree
<jamest_> they have thinks
<jamest_> things
<jamest_> like Text, HotKey, Trigger
<jamest_> so that all menu items fire triggers
<jamest_> and that these triggers have default names
<jamest_> so that a form could overwrite the std trigger with a custom onw
<jamest_> one
<Mr_You> hope you feel better jason
<jcater> I do
<jamest_> also on menu item placement
Action: jcater got lots of rest today
<jcater> I see where you're going, and I like that :)
<jamest_> I _think_ we'd need to be able to find menu entries
<jamest_> somehow
<jamest_> so that my <menu> tags
<jamest_> can somehow place themselves like this
<jamest_>   find File.Save and put me after it
Action: jamest_ has not thought about this much
<jamest_> also
<jamest_> GMenu would be based upon GObj
<jamest_> and thus the entire default system menu and form customizations would be exposed to the trigger system
<jamest_> so that we could do menu.file.save.disable = Ture
<jamest_> True even
<jamest_> overview might look like this
<jamest_> menu - top level menu object
<jamest_>   file
<jamest_>   data
<jamest_>   foo
<jamest_>   bar
<jamest_>     item1
<jamest_>     item2
<jamest_> anyway
<jamest_> my initial thoughts are to put this in common
<jamest_> so that eventually any gnue app could define it's menus this way
Action: jamest_ worries that everyone is laughing too hard at the design to type on their keyboards
<jamest_> btw - this should allow for derek's custom gpd loader
Action: dsmith is busy watching funny home videos.
<jcater> nah
<jcater> doing my taxes
<jcater> dude
<jcater> I'm using TaxSlayer this year
<jcater> and I swear they used a form generation program a lot (in concept) like GNUe Forms
<jamest_> TaxSlayer?
<jcater> .com
<dsmith> jcater: What platform is TaxSlayer ?
<jcater> pc only :(
<dsmith> :P
<jcater> and you know "pc" == Win32
Action: dsmith is away: Picking up my daughter at school
<jcater> I used turbotax for the web last 2 years
<jcater> but they are getting expensive
<jcater> used SecureTax.com before that
<jcater> but they were bought out by TurboTax :(
<jcater> (they were good)
Action: jamest_ is too mainstream
Action: jamest_ always buys TurboTax
<Mr_You> I think thats what I usually end up using also.. 
Action: dsmith is back (gone 00:05:12)
<jcater> jamest_: did you see the pic of SAP Easy Access screenshot someone posted?
<jamest_> no
<jcater> that's what I'd like to have ;)
<jcater> lemme see if I can find my bookmark
<jamest_> i wonder
<jamest_> should the menu system be entirely seprate from the toolbar system
<jamest_> I'm pretty sure that I don't want a toolbar entry that isn't on the menu
<jcater> http://help.sap.com/saphelp_46c/helpdata/en/49/2dfe88088b11d396a9006094b9867b/content.htm
<jamest_> so I think the toolbar system should just contain links to menu entries
<jamest_> but what I wonder
<jamest_> is if menu items should have a toolbarPosition and toolbarIcon attribute
<jamest_> that if filled add to the toolbar
Action: jamest_ has little thought in this
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> are you talking custom stuff? or built-in toolbar/menu stufF?
<jcater> or both?
<jamest_> all toolbar entries must be on the menu, they can't exist without a menu pick
<jcater> I definitely agree w/that statement
<jcater> as imho a mouse is "always" optional equipment :)
<jamest_> good
<jcater> if you allow toolbar options w/o a corresponding menu option, it's easy to "forget" that aspect
<jamest_> yip
<jamest_> what I guess I'm asking
<jamest_> is should we include the toolbar def as part of the menu def
<jamest_> or have a completely seperate GToolBar that sits seperate but acts to only "fire" the menu picks
<jcater> imho, the former
<jcater> (that would also allow us to provide "custom" toolbars in that the end user can add to/remove tools from the toolbar
<jcater> "These actions (from the menu system) are the default toolbar, but you can add other "Actions")
<jcater> btw, I'm saying that would provide the framework for that; not that we should do it :)
<jamest_> um
<jamest_> i'm confused
<jamest_> the former was the one tied directly into the menu def
<jcater> ah, well pay no attention to me, then
<jamest_> um
<jamest_> help
Action: jamest_ is confused
<jamest_> which did you want?
<jamest_> or better yet
<jcater> that one
<jamest_> tied direct?
<jcater> are you talking about "defining" menus?
Action: jcater thinks maybe jcater is confused
<jamest_> <menu blah="" toolbarPos="2" toolbarIcon="Goat.png"/>
<jamest_>   <menu .....>
<jamest_> <menu>
<jamest_> or
<jamest_> <menu .......>
<jamest_>   <menu ......>
<jamest_> <menu ....>
<jamest_> <toolbar>
<jamest_>   <link>menu.file.save</link>
<jamest_>   <link>menu.file.goatrape</link>
<jamest_> </toolbar>
<jcater> ah, I was confused... I'd think the latter
<jamest_> btw - that was on the fly so the struct sucks
<jamest_> ok
<jcater> except goatrape should go under "View" not "File"
<jamest_> rofl

<derek> i think i get misunderstood at times
<derek> btw: jcater delphi doesnt do menus
<jcater> that was a joke ;)
<derek> not in this context as delphi is a different type of tool than forms
<derek> the sap thing is ok, if the current navigator was cleaned up to that kind of polish it might be pretty cool
<derek> in fact if we made navigator a tree
<derek> instead of the clicks that it currently is
<jcater> well, it functions the same way... I said early on it was ugly ;)
<derek> it might substitute for menus for the short term
<derek> i still think we will need ability to load gpd's as menus directly into the 'framework'
<derek> but i see value in a 'pretty' navigator as well
<derek> :)
<derek> its not so much navigator is ugly is that its not super easy to use
<derek> i.e. navigator is hard to navigate for complex menus :)
<jcater> well, this is a difference in perspective, obviously ;)
Action: jcater comes fomr a curses world
<jcater> but this is why we support many options w/all the tools :)
<derek> i.e. unless you know exactly where things are under the current navigator they are hard to find
<jcater> so we can make everyone happy
<derek> yes
<derek> the current navigator is perfect for curses world almost untouched :)
<derek> as it performs like classical navigation system in curses
<derek> i think menus will be important though (as many people like them)
<derek> i got 'gagged' by them at omega as they had more menu options than you could shake a stick at :)
<jcater> that's my fear
<jcater> as at ncs, we have hundreds of forms
<jcater> (just ask jamest some time how many we have ;)
<derek> how would jamest know
<derek> i dont get gmenu
<derek> it appears to be what gpd's already are
<jcater> err, we're discussing internals now
<jcater> GMenu would be a python object
<jcater> (memphis!oracle)$ ls -l *.inp|wc -l
<jcater>    1319
<jcater> (memphis!oracle)$ ls -l *.rep|wc -l
<derek> ok so <menu> is merely an 'internal' DOM object
<jcater>    1641
<jcater> 1319 forms and 1641 reports
<jcater> please don't ask why
<jcater> ;)
<derek> not a physical file containing <menu>
<derek> why?
<derek> also did you all see conversation here that
<derek> images are done incorrectly in cvs?
<derek> i.e. they got checked in as other than binary
<jcater> oops
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> how do we fix that
<derek> and cvs chewed them up so they are bad on windows boxen
Action: jcater didn't know cvs made the distinction
Action: jcater is still learning cvs
<derek> grab the good copy and check in
<derek> jcater: a good admin sets image types to AUTO do binary so the user doesnt have to
<derek> i.e. you can set on the server certain extensions to ALWAYS do binary check in
<derek> so things like .png, .jpg etc we should have set like
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue/www/images$ man cvs |grep binary
<derek>               binary  files),  and  -kv  which  is  useful for an
<derek>               CVSROOT if your cvs binary has the right path  com
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue/www/images$ 
<derek> time to saunter off for a bit.....

<slamb> oops, he logged off
<jamest_> slamb
<jamest_> we can't blame the pypgsql driver as derek stated
<jamest_> it was my bug in our pypgsql interface 
ra3vat (ds@195.239.204.226) joined #gnuenterprise.
<slamb> ahh *nod* well, in any case that does work
<jamest_> as for not being able to edit properties
<jamest_> there is a bug that if you have a scrollbar on the property editor then you can't edit anything
<slamb> ahh, okay
<jamest_> i was under the impression this was a wxwin bug
<jamest_> but I noticed on Fri that the wxpython demo doesn't suffer from this
<jamest_> i hope to look at it in the very near future
<slamb> ooh, yeah. I expanded it and can edit now
<jamest_> yip
<jamest_> too bad the designer snapshot is screwed up
<jamest_> it allows you to drag and drop fields from the table view onto the form
<slamb> nice
<drochaid> drag'n'drop? cool
<jamest_> yip
<jamest_> we've went to drag and drop for everything in cvs designer
<jamest_> well
<jamest_> almost everything
<jamest_> widget placement was a big one though
<slamb> how are those win32 builds made, anyway?
<jamest_> um
<jamest_> you do a complete install of all dependencies on windows
<jamest_> add pypgsql, mysql, and pywin 
<jamest_> then run it thru msmillian installer version 4.x
<jamest_> ms=mc
<jamest_> then use inno to package it up
<jamest_> we've got a doc in forms/doc/installer
<jamest_> and designer/doc/installer
<slamb> cool
<jamest_> i may try and make snapshots today if jason fixed the designer windows issues
<drochaid> :D
<drochaid> I'm going to be flat out getting ready to launch for the next month .. an early snapshot would be good ;)

<jamest_> cool

<drochaid> full time
<jamest_> IIRC you were injured on last job ?
<drochaid> aye
<drochaid> and combination of it job market in Scotland being depressed, and I've wanted my own business for 10 years ...
<drochaid> I think it's time to do it instead of dreaming ;)
<jamest_> you can't go back to old job?
<drochaid> nope
<drochaid> they waited until I was just about to return, the dismissed me
<drochaid> *then
<jamest_> i think that's against the law here
<drochaid> here as well
<drochaid> that's why I've got two legal actions against them

<slamb> Hmm. Current Linux CVS, made new form, querying doesn't show anything.
<slamb> It adds new stuff fine, though.
<jamest_> hmmmmmm
<jamest_> lemme test
<jamest_> latest cvs is working fine for me
<jamest_> what db driver are you using?
<slamb> pypgsql 2.0
<slamb> hmm. maybe I should turn on query logging on the server.
<jamest_> same db driver
<jamest_> however I think i've seen what youre talking about
<jamest_> tell me
<jamest_> if you hit f8 then f
<jamest_> er
<jamest_> if you hit f8 then f9
<jamest_> does the record counter on the form update
<jamest_> to show how many records it should be displaying
<slamb> hmm. there it worked. I see entries in the form.
<slamb> yeah, the menu entries just don't do anything.
<slamb> but the accelerator keys do

<jamest_> ok
<jamest_> ouch
<jamest_> you are right

<slamb> It kinda makes sense that no one else would notice, though. You never use those once you know your way around the program.
<drochaid> doh!! I've only used f8/9 and the icons ... never the menus
<jamest_> well
<jamest_> the keyboard input routine are being worked on
<jamest_> i imagine that the event system changed and the menu/toolbar entries didn't 
<jamest_> ok, i'm uploading a new snapshot of designer that "works for me" on win32
<jamest_> I'm on 56K modem and the ETA reported by scp is ~ 11 minutes
<jamest_> i need to run for a while
<jamest_> I'll try and fix the forms menus later today
<slamb> cool. :)

<dtm> dont do what
<chillywilly> he'll drop dead of pure shock
<mdean> hey d00d!
<dtm> who will?
<dtm> jesus already closed out my workorder anyway
<chillywilly> no mdean will
<chillywilly> fewl
<chillywilly> just like I did
<chillywilly> he probably thought you fell off the face of the earth
<chillywilly> anyway, time to dig into my ODMG book
<dtm> mdean: hey i was axing chillywilly about the doc mgmt question i sent you and he said "WWJD?"
<dtm> so i said this:
<dtm> he sayeth so unto me, "Do you edit your html with 'vi'?  Cannot the cgi produce far more output faithfully, than by you directing each line of code yourself?  Who was there when http was invented?  Was not I?!?!  I tell you!  I shall show you the content management system, and you shall make webmasters of men."
<dtm> he then denies my request for an entry in /etc/sudoers
<dtm> and he closed my WO
<chillywilly> you didn't say anything about a doc mgmt thing dtm
<dtm> chillywilly: yeah i did in the beginning
<chillywilly> hmmm
<dtm> that was the problem i was demanding that everyone else solve for me
<dtm> oh wait
<mdean> you looking for doc or content mgmt?
<dtm> sorry
<dtm> it was about a church content management which i mentioned to you, chillywilly.  you're righ
<dtm> t
<chillywilly> well nickr is supposed to be writing something
<dtm> i axed mdean about doc mgmt
Action: chillywilly prods nickr witha  cattle poker
<mdean> yes - nickr is writing the holy grail of doc mgmt
<chillywilly> you needsta step off and stop xing me foo
<chillywilly> er, axing
<dtm> lskjdkf
<dtm> is nickr da bomb or something?
<chillywilly> nickr is like the freak object molester
<chillywilly> er, freaky
Action: chillywilly thwaps nickr with a trout innocently
<chillywilly> s/innocently/playfully
<chillywilly> I guess he's away or something
<dtm> he likes those objects, does he?
<chillywilly> ah well
Action: chillywilly thwaps jcater with a tuna
<dtm> what does he think about protrusions or dongles
<dtm> hey i have some tuna here
<chillywilly> this is a fresh tuna
<chillywilly> no canned crap
<chillywilly> I mean heck I don't use canned trout so why would I use canned tuna?
<chillywilly> I want to "wake" ppl up not knock them out
<dtm> furthermore i am microwaving this morning's leftover pancakes.
<chillywilly> that's good to know
<chillywilly> I think....
<dtm> that's knowledge which you can take, and run with
<chillywilly> I am attempting to read my odmg book, but I haven't even opened it yet
<dtm> be yourself.  be free.  go.  do.
<dtm> chillywilly: it's all about the baby steps
<chillywilly> heheh
<dtm> baby step #1:  dont tell us about it on irc.  just read the thing.
<dtm> ;)
<dtm> hahah
<dtm> lol
Action: chillywilly trout-slaps dtm
<chillywilly> you shall be smitten
<chillywilly> by the power of the trout
<chillywilly> take that!
Action: chillywilly is going to name the next GNUe module he writes 'trout'
<chillywilly> thus spoke zarathusa
<chillywilly> anyway...
<chillywilly> anyone ever read that?
<chillywilly> it's by neitzsche
<dtm> nope.  i dont read!
<dtm> zeitasche?  you heathen!  ;)
<chillywilly> umm, no
<chillywilly> neitzsche
<dtm> yeah that too!
<dtm> i dont know how that 'z' got there.
<dtm> pancake status:  consumed
<chillywilly> he was a German philospher
<dtm> gentlemen, pancakes away.
<dtm> we have confirmation of pancake deployment
<chillywilly> whatever
<chillywilly> feed your face then
<dtm> yeah i've read some of his quotes
<dtm> seems to be a real pessimist, eh?
<chillywilly> no
<chillywilly> he's an existentialist
<dtm> yeah 
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> get it right ;)
<dtm> where such values are meaningless eh?  ;)
<dtm> yeah but it sounds lke he has a negative bias
<chillywilly> existentialism is definitely interesting
<chillywilly> in fact I sorta like it
<dtm> si si
<chillywilly> Camus is one of my favorites
<dtm> i have read Descartes a bit
<dtm> long ago
<dtm> in PHIL101 or whatever
<chillywilly> but I don'
<dtm> chillywilly: so what's your job situation dood?
<chillywilly> t take it as the end all
<dtm> doin ok with that?
<chillywilly> working at SimplexGrinnell
<chillywilly> same shit
<chillywilly> er, stuff
<dtm> yeah i like how Descartes first proved his own existance and then proved the existance of God
<chillywilly> ;)
<dtm> allegedly
<dtm> hehe
<dtm> that was handy of him
<chillywilly> I guess
<chillywilly> Kierkegaard is a Christian Existentialist
<chillywilly> he's bery interesting to read
<chillywilly> er, very
<chillywilly> wasn't descartes a mathemetician too?
<chillywilly> ok, read ODMG book
<dtm> dunno
<chillywilly> pretty sure he was
<dtm> coz like i didn't really study in school
<chillywilly> feh
<dtm> i got C's on my PHIL homework because it was good work but completely offtopics
<dtm> i was just bursting with love to give
<dtm> i read those papers now and describe them as frenetic
<chillywilly> well it is nmot love until you give it away
<dtm> HEHHEHE
<chillywilly> seriously
<dtm> yeah, true
<chillywilly> it's about sacrifice ;), that's what life is all about being a living sacrifice
<chillywilly> christ-like even'
<chillywilly> we studied the sermon on the mount today
<chillywilly> so I am in that sorta mood
<chillywilly> "blessed are those who morn..."

<skeeter> san antonio, texas - Road Runner
<chillywilly> ah
<skeeter> good old AOL time warner..
<chillywilly> blech
<chillywilly> they are about as good as M$
<mdean> they're better than M$ - M$ never sent me free floppies in the mail
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> or put them in your grocery store aisle, let's not forget that
<chillywilly> s/grocery//
<skeeter> luckily Road Runner has a few more partners than just AOL Time Warner..
<skeeter> M$ for one.. only about 5%...

<nickr> woee
<chillywilly> hello, it's the same company
<skeeter> I'm just amazed I still have a choice to NOT have them..
<chillywilly> hey nickr
<nickr> maybe I should actially produce some docustore code
<mdean> nickr: hey - dtm was asking about your holy grail doc mgmt stuffs
<nickr> When I finish ratmaze and poplar I'll work on docustore
<chillywilly> nickr: yes, maybe you should ;)
<chillywilly> feh
<chillywilly> GNUe is life
<chillywilly> all other projects are insignnificant
<chillywilly> you will obey your masta
<chillywilly> s/your/the
<chillywilly> ;P
Action: chillywilly really needs ops in this channel
<chillywilly> or someone needs to turn the topic lock off
<chillywilly> heh
<nickr> Heh
<chillywilly> http://goats.gnue.org/~chillywilly/masta.txt
<chillywilly> darn
<nickr> ratmaze is sort of like docustore actually
<chillywilly> what happened to it
<nickr> more like 'projectstore'
<chillywilly> guess I'll have to find it
<nickr> 404
<chillywilly> doh!
<chillywilly> where is my masta song?!?
<chillywilly> boy it sucks when you loose your masta song
<nickr> holy cow
<nickr> i just realized hov I can save a lot of time with diplicated work
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> that's the best thing to do
<chillywilly> find things that overlap
<chillywilly> ;)
<nickr> i'll rewrite the docustore spec to use ratmaze's metadata structure
<nickr> and then use ratmaze as a prototype
<nickr> muah ah ah
<mdean> nickr: what do you mean by "projectstore"?
<chillywilly> only id you name a module 'trout'
<chillywilly> s/id/if
<chillywilly> we need something with that name
<chillywilly> hehe
<nickr> mdean: well, you see I keep all my projects and data and such in a directory tree like proj/blah/blah
<nickr> mdean: ratmaze basically adds metadata to this structure as separately stored xml files
<nickr> also enables journal entries and thumbnails and such
<chillywilly> I think mdean was just curious if it was project management software as that's his domain
<mdean> ah
<mdean> well - it sounds useful nonetheless
<chillywilly> nickr: so we can use it ina  GNUe ide?
<nickr> its basically so that I can have 'homepages' for my projects
<nickr> and have them all browsable
<nickr> maintaining the same directory structure as the projects and allowing other info to be associated with them
<mdean> nickr: cool - I wonder if it could be implemented within DCL to some extent
<chillywilly> ok, this time I am really going to read my book
<nickr> well it follows my project structure ethic
<nickr> the metadata will be managed like the proj/ and data/ dirs with rsync
<mdean> but that is customizable, right?
<nickr> so locally I have the cananical copy, and remotely I have 'mirrors' of it
<nickr> so I work on my cananical copy and rsync it to my web-accessable place
<nickr> the metadata will be managed the same way
<nickr> as files rather than in a true dbms
<mdean> right
<nickr> it'd be much more streamlined if it were in a dbms
<mdean> files in db can drag down the server
<nickr> but its cooler this way for my way of doing things
<chillywilly> I really should get spam assassin working
<nickr> well i mean the metadata is in xml files rather than database tables
<mdean> dcl can attach files to projects, but it doesn't allow you to place a structure for storage into the project
<nickr> which allows me to make all sorts of local tools to manipulate the metadata and keep it 'up to date' on my publication site
<chillywilly> anyone see those urls I posted to the gnu=dev@gnu.org?
<chillywilly> er, gnue-dev
<mdean> so, I already have a "root" dir for each project
<nickr> mdean: if you want we can coordianet xml or table specs
<mdean> nickr: sure - if you have some docs/specs, just send them to me
<nickr> What ratmaze will do is chase down all the constituant parts of an index and then transform them with an xslt
<mdean> nice
<nickr> well I have a working draft of the DTD for the end-result-xml
<mdean> what are you implementing this in?  psp?
<nickr> and the constituants will be just sub parts of that
<dtm> nickr: hi
<nickr> python, it'll be a cgi script
<nickr> actually it already is a cgi script ;)
<mdean> ah
<nickr> and using DOM to manipulate the page as I assemble it
<nickr> then using 4Front to transform it
<nickr> dtm: Hi
<mdean> haven't tried 4front - only Sablotron
<nickr> I just went with what had a debian package :)
<mdean> hehe
<nickr> Sablotron looks simpler, but 4front lets you do basically the same thing with very little extra work
<chillywilly> apt-get install I-am-damn-lazy
<nickr> exacto.
<mdean> isn't part of 4front in the official Pyton distribution anyway?
<mdean> python, even
<dtm> apt-get install I-am-a-sysadmin
<mdean> apt-get install rpm
<chillywilly> apt-get install real-sysadmins-use-debian
<dtm> hahah
<dtm> mdean: :)
<nickr> mdean: maybe so :)
<chillywilly> plz
<nickr> chillywilly:: yea.
<dtm> nickr: so you're doing document mgmt, eh?
<chillywilly> apt-get install rpm-is-for-weenies
<mdean> rpm -ivh real-sysadmins-use-vi
<dtm> nickr: are you primarily with the gnue team or phpgroupware or dcl or what?  :)
Action: dtm uses vi
<chillywilly> he's with us
<chillywilly> we claim him as aour code slave
<nickr> dtm: I'm mostly a lone wolf
<dtm> rpm -Uvh real-sysadmins-code-all-docs-in-html-with-vi
<mdean> we're all one big happy family - only slightly dysfunctional because of chillywilly ;-)
<nickr> dtm: the gnue people pretty much ignore me
<dtm> nickr: oh so your'e also an alternate species, eh?
<chillywilly> because of me?!?
<dtm> _only_ because of chillywilly?
<chillywilly> heh
<mdean> :)
<dtm> well i think we can find or create a better reason than that!
<dtm> or an additional reason
<chillywilly> jamest comes to mind
<dtm> nickr: so what tools currently exist which you may be modeling after
<chillywilly> he's pretty dysfunctional
<chillywilly> and jcater is a donut addict
<chillywilly> he'll do just about anythign for a donut
<dtm> ok is it jcater or jamest who's in KS?  it's jamest, right?
<mdean> jcater accepts them via DCC too
<chillywilly> and masta, welll....doesn't his little nick name say it all?
<mdean> jamest
<jamest_> I'm in ks
<mdean> speak of the jamest
<chillywilly> captin jamest of the GNU Enterpise
<chillywilly> er, captain
<dtm> AHAHAHS;lwjeks
<dtm> THAT WAS FUNNY.
<nickr> dtm: I'm creating a system based on my experiences mostly, not on any document management system that currently exists. I should probably look at those.
Action: mdean wonders if S;lwjeks was dtm's head hitting the keyboard...
<dtm> negative
<nickr> With this new idea to unify docustore and ratmaze I have a little to think about
<dtm> nickr: yeah you might do that :)
<dtm> nickr: i hear ya
<nickr> My main problem right now is that there hasn't been a lot of interest or encouragement.
<dtm> nickr: so do you have anythinjg functioning right now
<mdean> nickr: less think!  more code! ;-)
<dtm> nickr: well i can help you fix that
<dtm> mdean: isn't that right?
<nickr> dtm: I have an oldish proposal, pre-ratmaze
<dtm> i can supply the encouragement and interest
<chillywilly> To bold write code that no one has written before
<chillywilly> er, boldly
<mdean> nickr: well, I'd like to have a look at what you're doing and see if I can implement something compatible within DCL
<dtm> chillywilly: yeah coz we _have_ to  :)
<nickr> http://green.zorcat.com/~nick/proj/document-store/gnue/spec/DocumentStore/documentstorespec.html I think
<mdean> good lord!  check out the size of that URL!
<nickr> h
<nickr> that all correct except for the hyphen in Document-Store
<chillywilly> is that the lazy man's 'heh'?
<chillywilly> h
<nickr> http://green.zorcat.com/~nick/proj/document-store/gnue/spec/Document-Store/documentstorespec.html
<chillywilly> I know it's the unix admins 'heh'
<dtm> h
<chillywilly> shorter the command the better
<mdean> hh
<chillywilly> right?
<mdean> chillywilly: you said it!
<dtm> h&&h&&h
<dtm> while true; do h ; done
<dtm> there we go.  that sounds like fun.
<dtm> kinda like 'yes'
<chillywilly> y
<chillywilly> sheesh
<chillywilly> I would've thought you learned by now
<dtm> fyi:  itunes rules
<chillywilly> mv dtm /dev/null
<mdean> nickr: do you have a dtd or schema for your xml data?
<jamest_> nite
<mdean> or is it still being influenced by implementation? ;-)
<dtm> HEH
<dtm> jamest later
<mdean> jamest_: nite d00d
jamest_ (jamest@fh-dialup-201069.flinthills.com) left irc: "[x]chat"
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> he's suchs a hoser
<dtm> heheh
<chillywilly> ok, this time I will actually open my book
<chillywilly> there's no turning back now
<nickr> mdean: I have a preliminary dtd for ratmaze and some very ancient dtds for an old version of the docustore idea
Action: dtm hacks +o and kickbans chillywilly, to help motivate him
<nickr> mdean: If I want to merge all of this into one metadata management system, then I'll have to come up with some new stuff
<chillywilly> ummm
<nickr> mdean: http://green.zorcat.com/~nick/proj/ratmaze/ratmaze.dtd
<chillywilly> why not use that ODMG standard for metadata management
<chillywilly> wtf is it called
<chillywilly> CWM
<chillywilly> CWMI
<chillywilly> nevermind...I am stupid
<nickr> htttp://green.zorcat.com/~nick/proj/document-store/grawk/prototype2/dtd/document-store-document.dtd
<nickr> although I woret that one when I knew nothing about how to write dnds
<nickr> dtds
<nickr> chillywilly: there are several metadata standards, none suit my personal needs as far as I've seen
<nickr> for example theres 'dublin core metadata1'
<nickr> which is an XML spec
<nickr> its yucky imho though
<chillywilly> well the standard I was talking about was for EAI stuff
<chillywilly> Enterprise Apllication Intergration
<chillywilly> Enterprise Application Integration
<chillywilly> uses XMI
<chillywilly> XML Metadata Interchange
<nickr> hrm.
<chillywilly> I dunno how good it is
<chillywilly> just stumbled on it today
<mdean> nickr: funny how you say "think of documents as molecules" and then use element names like atom and nucleus ;-)
<nickr> different kind of metadata
<nickr> mdean: note that the spec and proposal was written significantly later than the dtd
<nickr> the terminology is consistant in the spec
<nickr> I think. :)
<chillywilly> well I think my main point is that CWMI standard would be good for GNU Integrator
<chillywilly> whenever that gets written
<nickr> chillywilly: yea, thats true, this is referring to object metadata, while when I talk about metadata its basically 'document metadata'
<mdean> does well formed xml include using hyphens in element names?
<mdean> I thought there was some rule about that
<nickr> mdean: it doesn't
<mdean> trying to make sure I'm not going crazy yet :)
<nickr> as I've said several times, I wrote this when I was an idiot.
<nickr> I'm no longer an idiot, I think.
<nickr> :)
<mdean> lol - alrighty then :)
<dtm> nickr: yeah you dont sound like an idiot
<dtm> thanks for that
<nickr> you'll notice the ratmaze dtd is much nicer looking :)
<dtm> nickr: here's what i wnated for doc mgmt, ok?
<dtm> <dtm>  I want fully online document mgmt _and_ editing with revision control.  I wanna have multiple people be able to edit a doc either inside their browser on the doc mgmt site, or locally in any given app, then submit it to the doc mgmt site, and have it cvs the thing.  Then when you wanna view it you go to the web site, it'll have a default html view of course in the web page, but with links to dl any other format of the doc like how
<dtm> the LyX
<dtm> <dtm>  system outputs .ps, .text, .html, etc.  As the Emperor 
<dtm> says, "Can it be done?"
<ajmitch> yo dtm, nickr, mdean, chillywilly
<dtm> ajmitch: hi
<chillywilly> hi ajmitchie
<nickr> hey
<mdean> hey ajmitch!
<nickr> dtm: my system would basically be the backend infrastructure to support that
<nickr> dtm: well, ratmaze is basically sort of that, also. :)
<dtm> nickr: so one suggestion i got in #phpgroupware for right now, is to edit all docs locally, check em each into something like cvsweb, and use another app to possibly produce multiple output formats and browsing like a plain web filemanager like something that's already in phpgroupware
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> so anyone know what the OMG core object model consists of?
<dtm> nickr: ok
<nickr> dtm: thats very, very similar to ratmaze :)
<ajmitch> nope
<ajmitch> at the moment, i don't know anything - brain has stopped functioning ;)
<dtm> nickr: which is?  the second blurb about cvsweb?  or the first one?
<nickr> the second blurb
<nickr> sort of
<nickr> I mean the blrowsing/filemanagement part
<dtm> nickr: oh   and you haven't looked at phpgroupware yet then?
<nickr> No.
<dtm> oh
<dtm> well i encourage you to do so
<nickr> but you could make the structure of ratmaze use cvs instead of rsync
<nickr> so it'd be bidirectional.
<mdean> dtm: have you looked at http://sourceforge.net/projects/cvswebclient/ ?
<dtm> and you might look at phpgwapi if you haven't
<nickr> okay,.
<mdean> dtm: he's doing the Python thang
<nickr> the docustore platform is more of a database engine for document management than a direct document management system.. something like phpgroupware or dcl or gaes or whatever would call upon it for document storage needs.
<nickr> and yea, I'm prtty into python, although I envision docustore bing in C eventually.
<nickr> well I gfuess it doesn't matter what the componants are written in because it'll use gnurpc to communicate
<nickr> but perhaps I'm just smoking it.
<dtm> nickr: i respect architectural and implementational uniquenesses, but there is also a value in collaborating rather than reinventing the wheel as much
<dtm> mdean: does phpgw have python interfaces?
<mdean> dtm: he's inventing, not reinventing
<dtm> ok
<dtm> well then in that case it would still be keen if it worked within phpgw
<mdean> no python interface
<dtm> unless phpgw can't handle it
<mdean> not needed
<mdean> there is value in sharing specification, tho
<dtm> hey i could use some hostess fruit pies
<mdean> if not the implemented lang
<dtm> but i have only ramen , chicken flavored
<nickr> I would work with php groupware or emacs or whatever you want if you wrote a bridge for it
<nickr> since its rpc based
<nickr> The Library could act just like a filesystem so you could browse it that way
<mdean> nickr: what kind of rpc you building in there?  corba?  xml?
<nickr> mdean: It was suggested since it could be part of gnue to use gnurpc wihch abstractizes rpc
<nickr> mdean: so theoreticly it'd be whatever you want
<mdean> ok
<nickr> of course my original concept was based on CORBA
<nickr> and if you look at the spec, its all IDL
<mdean> IDL, UDL, we all DL!
<nickr> har har
<chillywilly> I'd rather have ice scream
<chillywilly> you can keep you DLs
<chillywilly> :P
<nickr> so anyway, now you'r all up to date on what I haven't been working on.
<ajmitch> ah right
Action: ajmitch should scrollback & actually read it
<nickr> Now I'll go back to not working on it and working on something else entirely. :)
<chillywilly> feh
<chillywilly> what good are you?
<ajmitch> better than i
<chillywilly> da masta will hear of this! He will have your head!
<nickr> chillywilly: Heh, well I'm good at doing things that theres cohesive demand for
<nickr> anyway, heres a link for all you document people: http://dublincore.org/
Action: dtm cohesively demands the completion of nickr's project
<dtm> nickr: if you dont do it, i'm coming after you
<dtm> nickr: and you dont want that
<dtm> NOBODY wants that.
<dtm> !!
<chillywilly> I also cohesively demand for the docustore
Action: dtm just demands
<ajmitch> cohesively demands?
<nickr> Heh
<chillywilly> just shutup and demand ajmitch
<mdean> I cohesively demand that I connect docustore to DCL
<chillywilly> ;P
<nickr> maybe I shoul've said demand and motivation! :)
<ajmitch> i incoherently demand that everyone pay ajmitch $1000
<nickr> and participation
<nickr> anyway
Action: chillywilly throws grinades at nickr
<chillywilly> will that get you going?
<nickr> whats a grinade?
<dtm> hehhe
<nickr> is that like a drink made fro grins?
<dtm> lol
<chillywilly> I dunno how 2 spel
Action: nickr abuses chillywilly 
Action: chillywilly likes it
<chillywilly> I want more
<nickr> gross
<chillywilly> feh, you can't handle me big boy
<chillywilly> only my masta can satisfy my cravings
alexey (alex@techkran.vladimir.ru) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> anyway....
<nickr> everyone should send me a list of requirements and I'll work on a top-to-bottom spec
<nickr> and what kind of integration they are looking at
<dtm> nickr:  i sent you mine!
<dtm> nickr: integrated with phpgw!  :)
<nickr> huh
<nickr> heh
<nickr> yea I see your reqs
<chillywilly> geas integration plz
<nickr> hrm
<chillywilly> I want docustore to rock my world
<mdean> pluggable vc and vc for metadata
<chillywilly> also it must make coffeee
<nickr> vc?
<nickr> version control
<nickr> yea
<mdean> :)
<chillywilly> it also must whip da masta back when he gets too rough
<nickr> 'pluggable vc' is hard for me to grasp
<chillywilly> oh and of course it must "rock my socks"
<nickr> the docustore platform only enforces the concept of grouped documents with immutable subd-documents, actual versioning is a layer up I think
<mdean> nickr: you just have to abstract vc operations - ci, co, get, rm, annotate
<chillywilly> just do cvs but better ;P
<nickr> heh
<chillywilly> we want an extensible cvs
<nickr> might as well just use cvs
<chillywilly> no
<chillywilly> cvs sucks
<mdean> well, there's other vc sw out there that people may be using
<mdean> you can build for cvs specifically, but abstract the functionality you use
<mdean> then others can write plugins for other vc sw

<nickr> I still have to adapt the ideas behind ratmaze into the over all design
<nickr> I'm not sure hov to do that yet
<mdean> we'll get there ;-)
<ajmitch> yo derek
<chillywilly> masta!
<chillywilly> look out now
<chillywilly> da masta is in da house
<ajmitch> sigh

<nickr> heh.
<nickr> sigh indeed, robin.
<ajmitch> DSL is _hugely_ expensive here unless i get 128kbit
<chillywilly> :(
<nickr> you're lucky you have the ability to pay for DSL at all
<chillywilly> ajmitch: your flat mates won't split the bill with you?
<ajmitch> eg $0.20NZ/MB if i went over the paltry 400MB that i'd pay $50NZ for (per month)
<ajmitch> chillywilly: sure, but we'll only get 128k
<chillywilly> why?
<ajmitch> just checked with the telco (telecom), and i can get about 6Mbit/sec to this flat
<chillywilly> what's $50NZ in $US
<chillywilly> ?
<ajmitch> if i downloaded at that speed i could run up to $8000NZ in one *day*
<ajmitch> $20US

<nickr> I download over 400mb a week on my 56k modem.
<ajmitch> chillywilly: see the 'jetstart' in Isomer's address? that's the 128kbit plan
<chillywilly> bandwidth charging is gay
<ajmitch> hey Isomer
<ajmitch> i'm just complaining about DSL prices ;)
<chillywilly> you should demand a flat fee per month ;)
<ajmitch> chillywilly: jetstart (128kbit) is flat fee
<chillywilly> unlimited bandwidth
<chillywilly> yea, but not very fast
<Isomer> hmm
<ajmitch> telecom essentially has a nationwide monopoly
<Isomer> Telecom is evil
<ajmitch> yes
<chillywilly> indeed
<chillywilly> bastards
<Isomer> Jetstream is just a problem waiting to happen!
<nickr> blah.
<ajmitch> Isomer: just looked at the webpage, they say lower probable limit of 5.7MBit/sec for this flat
<ajmitch> Isomer: at that rate, i could get a very impressive bill :)
<Isomer> yeah
<chillywilly> that's highway robbery man
<ajmitch> worse
<nickr> free wireless
<ajmitch> nickr: we're setting that up btw :)
<chillywilly> that's like hey I'll bend over and you can cram that brick up my ass
<nickr> no no, forget the lube, I can take it
<nickr> erk.
<ajmitch> chillywilly: imagine the bill when script kids flood you
<chillywilly> yikes
<chillywilly> yea, you guys need to get your free community wireless network going
<chillywilly> ;)
<ajmitch> with jetstart, telecom will not supply a static IP
<nickr> I wish more hax0rz would attack my site, I love watching the logs when that happens
<nickr> better than TV
<ajmitch> i'd need to get a static ip over a tunnel to my isp
<chillywilly> man they really do screw ppl
<nickr> someone do a stealth portscan and os fingerprinting of svetlost.net so I have something to look at
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> chillywilly: the joys of being in the middle of the south pacific ;)
<chillywilly> yea, that's crap
<nickr> I imagine the backbones to there sorta suck
<ajmitch> nickr: nah
<chillywilly> so if you do get your own wireless network wouldn't you guys still need to connect to stinking telecom somehow or would you get a satellite link?
<nickr> share the cost of a T1

<ajmitch> nickr: they installed a fibre-optic link to the US in the last few years - went active last year iirc
<nickr> theres still lag, the speed of light isn't fast enough. Not as much lag as a sat link though.
Nick change: mdean -> mdean-[idle]
<chillywilly> there's plenty of bandwidth, it's just that telecom is greedy, right?
<ajmitch> chillywilly: it cost a lot to lay a few thousand miles of fibre
<nickr> I want some raisin cake
<nickr> or something
<ajmitch> and telecom are greedy ;)
<chillywilly> I know it does, but NZ has a nice fat pipe to the US doesn't it?
<ajmitch> not that fat
<ajmitch> a few hundred GBit i think
<nickr> I need some minions.

<chillywilly> calling all db gurus
<derek> oooo oooo
<chillywilly> wtf is ACID wrt database stuffs
Action: derek is a db guru
<derek> acid makes your database 'trip' man
<chillywilly> I have seen this acronym before
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> this is in my ODMG book and they talk about ACID and transactions
<chillywilly> and mutli-threading
<derek> Another Crappy Idiots Database
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> do you know masta?
<nickr> acid like totally dissolves the connection of your database to reality, man, farout
<chillywilly> gah
<chillywilly> http://www.odbmsfacts.com/articles/acid_properties.html
Action: chillywilly breaks out the url-fu
<derek> isnt it a 'test' of sorts for the 'robustness' of dbs?
<chillywilly> no
Action: derek remembers hearing about it when dealing with different 
<chillywilly> ACID properties are an important concept for databases. The acronym stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. The ACID properties apply to both ODBMSs and RDBMSs.
<derek> transisolation levels with in Interbase
<nickr> I've heard about it too, now that I see the expansion of the acronym
<chillywilly> he ACID properties of a DBMS allow safe sharing of data. Without these ACID properties, everyday occurrences such using computer systems to buy products would be difficult and the potential for inaccuracy would be huge. Imagine more than one person trying to buy the same size and color of a sweater at the same time -- a regular occurrence. The ACID properties make it possible for the merchant to keep these sweater purchasing trans
<chillywilly> from overlapping each other -- saving the merchant from erroneous inventory and account balances.
<derek> chillywilly: yeah thats what im saying
<derek> :)
<chillywilly> it's about locking and crap like that
<derek> in interbase there was thing about 'transisolation'
<derek> there are different types
<chillywilly> ah, yea
<chillywilly> same thing
<derek> access and most 'file system' dbs only do two types
<derek> oracle and other bigger dbs do like 3 some 4 types
<derek> interbase at the time was the only one that supported
<derek> writable reread
<derek> or something funky
<chillywilly> The amount of data that can be locked with the single instance or groups of instances defines the granularity of the lock. The types of granularity are illustrated here are:
<chillywilly> [bullet] Page locking
<chillywilly> [bullet] Cluster locking
<chillywilly> [bullet] Class or table locking
<chillywilly> [bullet] Object or instance locking
<derek> yes btw this is MAJOR flaw in mysql
<derek> TABLE level locking
<derek> where most even filesystem dbs do 'page' level locking
<derek> and highend dbs generally let you optionally move down to 'row' level locking
<chillywilly> well now I know wtf they are talking about
<nickr> filesystem dbs?
<derek> degree 0 - a transaction does not overwrite data updated by another user or process ("dirty data") of other transactions  [bullet] degree 1 - degree 0 plus a transaction does not commit any writes until it completes all its writes (until the end of transaction)  [bullet] degree 2 - degree 1 plus a transaction does not read dirty data from other transactions  [bullet] degree 3 - degree 2 plus other transactions do not dirty data read 
<derek> transaction before the transaction commits
<derek> is what i mean by 'transisolation' levels
<nickr> doesn't postgres have row locking?
<derek> dirty read
<derek> dirty reread etc etc etc ;)
<derek> filesystem dbs nickr are ones that dont 'listen'
<derek> i.e. you are constraint to accessing them via a files system
<derek> like
<nickr> oh like .db ones?
<derek> paradox, foxpro, access, etc
<derek> dbase
<nickr> hrm
<chillywilly> .mdb
<derek> at least thats what i consider a 'filesystem' db (whether thats technically correct i dont know) :)
<chillywilly> derek: you see my url on gnue-dev?
<chillywilly> mailing list
<derek> gnue-dev?
<chillywilly> yes
<derek> um no
<derek> been gone all day
<chillywilly> gnue-dev@gnu.org
<derek> now trying to fix computers :(
<chillywilly> oh
<derek> inherited k6 333mhz w/ motherboard
<derek> p200 overdrive 128mb w/ motherboard
<derek> p133mhz 48mb w/ motherboard
--- Mon Feb  4 2002
<chillywilly> nice

<chillywilly> more toys :)
<derek> was hoping to have the k6 333 replace my jacked k6 350
<nickr> sweet
<derek> but it dont fit in my case :(
<nickr> jacked?
<chillywilly> he b0rked his mobo
<derek> i have an old case was able to put the p200 in but i dont have old sytle (AT) keyboard so have to pick up adaptor
<nickr> horked
<derek> that one will go to church when it gets 'rebuilt'
<derek> need to get case for the k6 (hopefully under 30 bucks)
<derek> whoo hooo
<derek> for now have to play with the 'unstable' box to try to get it revived 
Action: derek wishes he had two nickels to rub together to fix these damn things
Action: nickr wishes he had two nickles to rub together to buy food with.
<chillywilly> what exactly happens during a db transaction? a series of db accesses/modifications? Do they commonly model a real world transaction of some kind?
<nickr> isn't a transaction anything that interacts with the data?
<derek> i like to think of it as 'complex' record locking
<derek> er file locking
<derek> i think of table level locking like normal file system locking
<derek> if nickr has the file open
<derek> chilly cant open it for write
<derek> then page level is only the segment chilly is actually playing with is locked instead of the whole file
<chillywilly> ok
<derek> etc
<nickr> normal file locking
<derek> then there are COMPLEX locking
<nickr> yea
<derek> where it doesnt reall 'lock'
<derek> but rather buffers to memory and HOPES no one dicks w/
<derek> if someone does it does a 'dirty' read/write or such
<nickr> hrm
<nickr> dirty read?
<nickr> dirty write?
<derek> yeah you know those darn pornographic dbs
<nickr> hey meeester, wanna uby some feeeelthy tables?
<chillywilly> so can all transactions be committed and rolled back?
<derek> um no
<nickr> thats the idea behind transactions isn't it?
Action: chillywilly thought a transaction was more like a series of steps
<derek> well kind of
<derek> if i do
<nickr> a transaction is an 'atomic' operation that does complex manipulations
<chillywilly> select this...update this...etc.
<derek> UPDATE myTable set foo='fooey';
<derek> i cant 'roll' that back
<derek> but ISOLATION levels still exist
<derek> iirc
<derek> then you have TRANSACTIONS
<derek> where you can say somethign like 
<derek> START TRANSACTION
<derek> then you can do 
<derek> UPDATE myTable set foo='fooey';
<derek> UPDATE myTable set sloo='fooey';
<derek> UPDATE myTable set doo='fooey';
<derek> COMMIT
<derek> or
<derek> ROLLBACK
<derek> and those 'updates' dont 'really' take effect until that COMMIT
<chillywilly> yea
<derek> thats where they were getting into
<nickr> locking is less important in that sort of inteaction, no?
<derek> when you smack COMMIT
<derek> does update a really happen
<derek> if update c fails
Action: chillywilly looks at the degrees of isolation
<derek> sigh that was fruitless that machine really is dead :(

<chillywilly> ok

<ajmitch> hrmm, we've got plans for 802.11b here as well derek
<derek> it was igal
<derek> can tell by the header :)
<chillywilly> ok
<nickr> you have to edit the .index_template.html to link it to other pages though
<nickr> or wahtevr
<nickr> which is mildly annoying but not too bad
<nickr> I wrote a script to do it
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> I wonder where I cna get my hands on the XA spec
<derek> nickr: submit it to author as patch
<derek> if its mildly annoying to you its probably annoying to others as well :)
<nickr> well they chose simplicyt and flexibility over overfeaturedness
<chillywilly> hrrm, authors seems to be the Open Group
<chillywilly> probably means shelling out some dough
<chillywilly> :(
<nickr> XA?
<chillywilly> yea

<derek> or can you
Action: derek is too lazy to read man pages right now :)
<nickr> you can't
<nickr> thats what I mean
<nickr> its simplistic
<nickr> it does one directory at a time
<derek> can you 'tie' the directories together?
<derek> sigh this looked too good to be true
<chillywilly> write a script
<nickr> yea, just write a shell script to do it
<derek> i wanted to upload and do something 'quickly'
<nickr> when you do igal it makes some .files
<nickr> one of them is the template it'll use to generate the index next time you run it
<nickr> you add links to the other directories to it
<nickr> and run igal again
<nickr> and then do that down the tree as deep as you want
<nickr> thats what I did
<chillywilly> whddaya know
<chillywilly> Java uses this same model for transactions
<chillywilly> J2EE that is
<derek> nickr cool
Action: derek will have to rewrite igal in python someday
<derek> and add -r feature :)
<nickr> way ahead of you.
<Mr_You> what ya'll think about Miguels comments?

<zoyd> hi .. i was trying to install GNUe-Forms and GNUe-Designer ...
<zoyd> but it needs wxPython ... I'm running Slackware 8 and i can't find that package.
<zoyd> I'm not able to run gfdesigner, please help.
<jamest> um
<jamest> slackware does packages?
Action: jamest is not a slackware user
<zoyd> yes it does they're simply binary tarballs.
<zoyd> 'ImportError: No module named wxPython.wx'
<drochaid> WOO life :)
<drochaid> zoyd: is it still using pkgtool?
<drochaid> or whatever it was '_
<zoyd> yes.
<zoyd> :)
<drochaid> do you have pyton installed, or is that where the problem is?
<zoyd> yes, i have python installed and running.
<drochaid> apologise, not typing properly ... same question, but subsitute python with wxPython
<zoyd> that i don't have.
<drochaid> hmm .. I see what you mean, I can only find .rpm bins for it
<drochaid> the source looks fairly easy to compile if you're okay with that tho?
<zoyd> where's the source ?
<drochaid> http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#sources
<zoyd> i wonder what's that -> http://www.linuxpackages.net/details.php?name=wxGTK
<drochaid> and the build instructions are just a little down the page from there
<drochaid> you need gtk and wxgtk to build wxpython

Action: drochaid stays quiet
<zoyd> hehe
<zoyd> drochaid: what does GNUe recommend ?
<drochaid> for that I'll defer to jamest, but I *think* your version of python is ok for it
<zoyd> I'll give it a shot then :)
<drochaid> and I'm sure he'll confirm it/attack me with a claymore in a minute ;)
<zoyd> drochaid: btw, would i need the python sources to build wxpython ?
<drochaid> uhm, err, uhm .. I honestly don't know
<drochaid> if it doesn't mention it in the wxPython build docs .. I'd give it a go without the python source
<zoyd> fine, i'll do the same then.

<jamest> there may be header files you require

<drochaid> heh, wb jamest :)
<jcater> I ran python 2.0 + wxPython both from source on Slackware 8
<jcater> both built no problem
<zoyd> jcater: that sounded nice :D
<zoyd> jamest: thanks for the confirmation.
<jcater> you found a packaged python for slack 8?
<jcater> cool
<jcater> and yet weird
<zoyd> it's there on the first install cd.
<zoyd> 2.0.1
<zoyd> jcater: 'weird', why ?
<jcater> ah, included with the slack distro?
<zoyd> yes.
<jcater> oops, I missed that
<zoyd> jcater: do you have wxpython running ?
<jcater> I've since replaced that machine w/debian
<jcater> but I did
<zoyd> oh. guess what, i moved from debian back to slack8 recently.
<zoyd> So, are there any serious users of GNUe ?
<zoyd> some nice applications developed using all these beautiful tools.
<jcater> yes, but inhouse stuff
<zoyd> 'inhouse' as in ?
<dneighbo> not availalbe under gpl :)
<dneighbo> i.e. custom solutions
<zoyd> custom solutions could be gpl'ed too, isn't it ?
<jcater> well, they "could" be, but gpl covers redistribution and inhouse solutions typically aren't redistributed
<jcater> not would there be must advantage to that
<jcater> if its an app written around a single business' idiosyncracies
<drochaid> also the aspect of businesses using ERP for a 'competitive edge' ... if they then make their solutions available to all, they're effectively paying for their competitors to have that competitive edge
<zoyd> hmmmm

<drochaid_> I was referring to the overall system rather than a single app
Nick change: drochaid_ -> drochaid
<jcater> e.g., we are a magazine fundraising company... our magazine clearinghouse code is irrelevant to anyone else
<zoyd> drochaid: but making the soltution available would still remain in the hands of the businesses using this ERP.
<jcater> so that is what I meant wrt "inhouse" 
sjc (~sjc@modem-858.aardvark.dialup.pol.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> but like a custom contact system, or custom payables system, or custom supply/inventory system
<jcater> wouldn't make much sense
<zoyd> jcater: fine i understand the thing with an application usefull for general use.
<jcater> zoyd: I was primarily disagreeing w/ drochaid's ERP example :)
<zoyd> heh
<jcater> unfortunately, aside from our samples/ directory, all the real-world uses of forms right now are in-house stuff
<jcater> this is of course not the way we want it
<jcater> of course, early adopters are a GOOD thing :)
<zoyd> there are going to be industry specific components, isn't it ?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> I have not played much in the packages area, but
<zoyd> and i think the samples would significantly influence those components.
<drochaid> jcater: indeed, but what having the apps available would do, would be to allow your competitors to see how you do it and potentially modify there own system with some improvements gained from knowledge of yours
<jcater> our goal is to have a set of comprehensive base packages
<jcater> and then have industry-specific "templates" that extend the functionality
<jcater> of these base packages
<jcater> drochaid: true enough... of course, I wouldn't put out my inhouse stuff because I'd also be afraid of our competitors seeing it
<jcater> HOWEVER
<jcater> I'd be afraid they'd laugh at our system
<jcater> ;

<drochaid> lol

<ICJ> I am Jens Mueller
<ICJ> I am Jens Mueller
<drochaid> hey ICJ
<ICJ> I wrote a few mails on the lists recently
<dneighbo> hmmm you related to reinhard mueller :)
<ICJ> no ... ;-)
<ICJ> args ...
<dneighbo> ok we will let you stay then :)
<ICJ> My X-Chat does not support umlauts ...
<dneighbo> neither does mine
<ICJ> who is that?
<dneighbo> reinhard uses .. umlauts as well
<zwiskle> an austrian
<dneighbo> yip
<dneighbo> btw: re releasing code
<dneighbo> like ERP stuff
<ICJ> well ...
<ICJ> a bug in the IRC protocol ...
<dneighbo> i see most people will take the 'base'
<dneighbo> then extend and not give back
<ICJ> should support MIME ;-)
<dneighbo> which is fine, though over time i think they will realize the computer system is only a small advantage
<ICJ> I yesterday filed a bug against the Debian package gead
<ICJ> geas, of course
<dneighbo> that really the 'logistics' and such will be more important
<ICJ> what is really important are different tax laws in diff. countries
<ICJ> they have an heavy impact on accounting
<ICJ> You have to be able to say write-off according to article xy, and the system should do it
<ICJ> am I talking to much?
<dneighbo> no
<ICJ> ok :-)
<dneighbo> i agree but am not too worried
<dneighbo> i see us 'templating' things by region/location
<dneighbo> to handle tax specifics and such
<dneighbo> one goal of gnue is to avoid the SAP idea of
<dneighbo> you get shipped with 80,000 tables
<ICJ> *g*
<dneighbo> of which 60,000 of them you have to go 'configure' (ie. populate remove etc)
<dneighbo> but rather you get a small base
<ICJ> and modules, yes
<dneighbo> then 'apply' things based on 'country, tax laws, etc etc etc)
<ICJ> together with a goog package management, that would be fine
<dneighbo> so you might get base accounting package
<dneighbo> gl module
<dneighbo> then apply austrian tax template
<dneighbo> or what not
<ICJ> anyone using Debian package of geas?
<drochaid> just to confirm ... do you want more or less than 80,000 tables? [no, not my usual, uhm, humour, serious question]
<ICJ> depends ...
<zoyd> it's way past midnight here .. goodnight, c ya folks later.
<ICJ> more than 80,000 possible tables with less than 1,000 normally in active use?
zoyd (zoyd@202.9.130.97) left #gnuenterprise ("bye").
<dneighbo> um
<dneighbo> drochaid: i want to avoid as ICJ says
<dneighbo> 80,000 tables of which only 1000 have ANYTHING to do with your system
<drochaid> ahh .. hmm
<drochaid> yes, I missed the 'but only need 1000' before
<dneighbo> instead i see gnue having the 80,000 in 'concept'
<dneighbo> but it installs like 100 to start
<dneighbo> and you 'apply' the others as you need them
<dneighbo> think of how 'apache' on debian works
<dneighbo> you get
<dneighbo> apt-get install apache
<dneighbo> then you can 
<dneighbo> apg-get install php4
<dneighbo> apt-get install php4-pgsql
<dneighbo> etc etc
<drochaid> yep ... makes sense
<dneighbo> so you might have
<dneighbo> apt-get gnue-accounting
<dneighbo> apt-get gnue-accounting-austrian-tax
<dneighbo> apt-get gnue-accounting-euro-conversions
<dneighbo> or soemthing
<dneighbo> only wont be apt-get
<dneighbo> probably gnue-get
<dneighbo> or something similar
<ICJ> debian:~# apt-get gnue-accounting
<ICJ> E: Invalid operation gnue-accounting

<ICJ> *g*
<drochaid> lol
<dneighbo> rofl
<ICJ> well, .debs are ok
<dneighbo> um you have to have your sources.list set to
<ICJ> Debian will then have a Gnue policy
<dneighbo> deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian im_a_fscking_idiot main contrib non-free
<dneighbo> then you can get gnue-accounting ;)

reinhard (rm@62.47.45.2) left irc: "All things being equal, fat people use more soap"
<ICJ> In Germany, a common method is to read the account number and bank routing number from the Eurocheque card, let the customer sign a direct debit agreement and then give the collected debits electronically (with formats like EDIFACT) to the company's bank.
<ICJ> The payment is not guaranteed, so the company has to store the data in its system if the debit is being returned

<dtm> sudo sh -c "su -l postgres -c \"/usr/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/pgsql/data -p /usr/bin/postmaster start\" "
<dtm> which is directly from the rc script
<chillywilly> that starts the server
<dtm> pg_ctl: Can't find /var/lib/pgsql/data/postmaster.opts.default
<dtm> that's what it says
<dtm> in response
<dtm> oh wait
<dtm> hold up
<chillywilly> just isntall the packages
Nick change: rdean -> rdean-[rtcw]
<chillywilly> shouldn't be hard
<chillywilly> then you can copy the data if you need to
<dtm> [dtm@Datums /]$ sudo sh -c "su -l postgres -c \"/usr/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/pgsql/data -p /usr/bin/postmaster start\" "
<dtm> that's waht it says after i simply copied /var/lib/pgsql
<dtm> both hosts were running pgsql 7
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> you copied the data?
<mdean> dtm: you're best bet is to 1) pg_dumpall the source server, 2) initdb the new system, 3) psql -e < dump.sql
<mdean> s/you're/your/
<chillywilly> yea
<dtm> mdean: so how come what i did, didn't work?
Action: chillywilly new there was a sane way
<dtm> what else is there to my db's
<chillywilly> er, knew
<dtm> how else are the db's represented on the filesystem
<mdean> I don't know enough of pgsql internals to give you an answer ;-)
<dtm> goll durnint
<chillywilly> you need da masta
<mdean> just that if you need to move data, use pg_dump dbname or pg_dumpall
<dtm> mdean knows all!
<chillywilly> or jcater might know
<dtm> mdean: and that results in a simple delimited text file, right?
<chillywilly> masta is postgres expert
Action: jcater is da oracle man, not da postgres man
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> well derek would know
<mdean> dtm: no, it is a sql dump
<chillywilly> masta!!!
<mdean> pg_dumpall > dump.sql
<dtm> mdean: what type of data is that
<mdean> pgsql creates new OIDs whenever you do initdb or add anything (which is why you never use OID for a fk ;-)
<mdean> it is a sql text file
<chillywilly> mmmm, steak
<dtm> mdean: what is "FK"
<chillywilly> fk?
<mdean> foreign key
<chillywilly> ah
<dtm> mdean: ok i have no idea what that is, or the significance of it!
<dtm> :)
<chillywilly> or you just use a nice object abstraction ;P
<mdean> everything in pg has a OID (object ID)
<chillywilly> OIDs shouldn't be done in the db, imho
<mdean> pg is an object db ;-)
<jcater> chillywilly: that only means you are putting your faith in the designer of the abstraction level
<chillywilly> not really
<dtm> i gotchur objects right here
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> plz
<dtm> DONT HURT EM CHILLY.
<chillywilly> why do you use python is objects are so evil?
<chillywilly> s/is/if
<mdean> dtm: a fk is a relationship between two tables - usually based of the primary key of one of the tables, so it creates a "lookup"
<jcater> chillywilly: well, I like python's objects
<chillywilly> E/R bs mostly :P
<nickr> hurt me chilly!
<jcater> and using a scripting language's objects are different than storing your data as objects
<mdean> chillywilly: bah!
Action: chillywilly beats nickr with a whale
Action: jcater can't imagine how slowly an object database must perform
<chillywilly> it's not that slow
Action: jcater hugs his pure relational play
<chillywilly> well I prefer object-relational mappings
<mdean> I prefer !mysql
<chillywilly> that too

<chillywilly> you sick bastard
<dtm> me, i've had my heart broken too many times
<jcater> o2r scares me
<nickr> I like r2o
Action: jcater likes h2o, though
<chillywilly> what the difference it is essentially the same thing bu objects, you define schema to store ht eobjects and then you put that schema in the tables of the relational db
<chillywilly> you want to add a new object you just add to the "repository"
<chillywilly> ODL == DDL + OO stuff
<chillywilly> the point being you write it once and forget about the damn db and just use objects
<chillywilly> doe sit take longer to design such a thing, you bet....but not if you just use an already made standard ;)

<ajmitch> yo jcater
<jcater> howdy
<slamb> Hmm. So I think I've run into a bug.
<slamb> When a commit fails (a referential integrity violation), it pops up a dialog box as expected.
<slamb> but apparently doesn't tell the database server to rollback
<slamb> because anything in the future (whether I hit "commit" or "rollback" next
<slamb> says this
<slamb> libpq.Warning: NOTICE:  current transaction is aborted, queries ignored until end of transaction block
<slamb> and that transaction block never ends
<jamest> what db?
<slamb> pypgsql
<jamest> what ver of forms/common?
<slamb> latest cvs
<slamb> (on Linux)
<jamest> ack!
<jamest> ok
<jamest> just a sec
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> is this a custom form?
<jamest> or one of the samples
<slamb> custom
<jamest> any chance you have the zipcode sample installed?
<slamb> I could install it now
<jamest> well
<jamest> i tried to reproduce
<jamest> with samples/zipcode.gfd
<jamest> queried all existin records
<jamest> added one w/ a duplicate zip
<jamest> comited, got error
<jamest> changed zip
<jamest> commited without error
<slamb> Hmm. What I did was change a foreign key reference to an ID that wasn't valid.
<jamest> so I'm trying to figure out how it's getting tripped on your form
<slamb> okay.
<slamb> I took zipcode.gfd
<slamb> and removed the style="dropdown" attribute from the state field
<slamb> so I could point it to something invalid
<slamb> the commit fails, of course.
<jamest> same error?
<slamb> I change it to something valid and it still fails.
<slamb> yeah, same errors
<jamest> ok
<jamest> lemme test
<slamb> I'd guess removing a state from the db after the "validator" data source is populated would give the same error
<jamest> ok
<jamest> i can reproduce
<slamb> cool
<chillywilly_> nick chillywilly
Nick change: chillywilly_ -> chillywilly
<chillywilly> doh
<chillywilly> that's the scary part jamest, that you can reproduce ;P
<slamb> ooh, ouch
Action: jcater acts as a proxy jamest and troutslaps chillywilly
<chillywilly> heh, what's a matta no witty come backs?
Action: chillywilly smacks jcater with a crappie
<nickr> crappy?
<chillywilly> gah
<chillywilly> get of the city some day ;P
<nickr> you are crappy
<chillywilly> a crappie is a type of pan fish
<nickr> I've almost never lived in the city
<nickr> I lived for 1 year in portland, and 2 years here
<nickr> Portland isn't really a 'city'
<chillywilly> you should know what a crappie is then
Action: chillywilly was in portland when he was very littlw
<chillywilly> er, little
<nickr> i've heard the name, but maybe its just a midwest crazyfish
<chillywilly>   Crappie \Crap"pie\ (kr?p"p?), n. (Zo["o]l.)
<chillywilly>      A kind of fresh-water bass of the genus {Pomoxys}, found in
<chillywilly>      the rivers of the Southern United States and Mississippi
<chillywilly>      valley. There are several species. [Written also {croppie}.]
<nickr> yea
<nickr> midwest crazyfish
<chillywilly>  crappie
<chillywilly>        n 1: small sunfishes of the genus Pomoxis of central United
<chillywilly>             States rivers
<chillywilly>        2: small sunfishes of central United States rivers
<jcater> it's a very mild-tasking, tender fish
<jcater> err, tasting
<jcater> my favorite freshwater fish
<nickr> tasking
<nickr> hehe
Action: jcater has an excellent recipe for deep-fried battered crappie
<jcater> and beer hushpuppies
<jcater> it's a local favorite
<chillywilly> well being a hick does have its advantages
<chillywilly> ;P
<jcater> yip
<nickr> Yea,
<nickr> you get to merry that sexy sister

<jcater> nah, dude
<jcater> not past the first cousin

<chillywilly> wouldn't like the first humans have to inbreed to spread the species?

<chillywilly> gah
<chillywilly> evolution is the biggest joke
<chillywilly> (the mail software too ;P)
<nickr> I don't want to get into it because its a really irritating argument.
<jcater> aren't all chillywilly-induced arguments irritating?
<nickr> yes.
<nickr> I avoid them.
<nickr> Always.
Action: mdean pets his Evolution 1.0.1 window...
<chillywilly> fuck off
<nickr> yeesh, touchy there
<jcater> chillywilly: wrong window

<nickr> oooh yea
<jamest> dude
<jamest> argh!
<nickr> what?
<jamest> that commit bug is pypgsql dependent
<nickr> oh
<slamb> do you not normally use pypgql, out of curiosity?
<jamest> um
<jamest> it's our primary windows driver
<jamest> however
<jamest> if you run it thru and duplicate a zip
<jamest> she'll recover
<jamest> unique key error
<slamb> *nod*
<jamest> do a ref integ violation
<jamest> she'll not recove
<jamest> they call the exact same error routines
<jamest> on our end
<jamest> in fact
<jamest> all our postgresql drivers use the same base class
<jamest> so that psycopg works w/ same code that pypgsql dies on
<slamb> heh. yeah, I downloaded psycopg...it works.
<stbain> so jamest
<stbain> now that I know python
<stbain> how can I help?
Action: slamb should learn Python, too.
<jamest> bwahahahaha
<jamest> er, i mean
<jamest> you want to help....that's wonderfull.
<stbain> I still have the project assignment docs
<stbain> I guess I should actually sign them and mail them back
<jamest> yip
<jamest> that's a prereq. to getting cvs write
<chillywilly> don't do it, it is a trap ;P
<chillywilly> masta will own you then
<jamest> stbain: what you interested in?
<stbain> well...
<stbain> hrmmm
<stbain> ok
<stbain> I don't know if you remember my background or not
<stbain> I've been programming for quite some time
<jamest> i can't remember if i are supper
<stbain> mostly small stuff
<jamest> ate
<stbain> some scripts here and there
<stbain> a little gui
<stbain> however, I am now finishing up my CS degree at accis.edu
<stbain> I wanted to contribute a while back to GNUe, but didn't know Python
<stbain> now I do
<derek>  we dont discuss java here.
[23:23] Last message repeated 2 time(s).
<derek> sorry
<stbain> uhhh
<stbain> ok
<derek> hit wrong button
<nickr> java is satan!
<stbain> what's the current status of the project?
<chillywilly> everything is satan!
Action: derek is back (gone 20:53:54)
<stbain> I mean, can I walk into my new job and replace QAD w/ GNUe?
<ajmitch> sure, but it might not remain your job for long ;)
Action: ajmitch ducks
<nickr> haha
<nickr> ajmitch: better put on your anti-crappie sheild
<stbain> that's what I thought
<ajmitch> stbain: but i know nothing
<stbain> I've been trying to read the mailing list
<stbain> from what I gather, the parts are all there, but they don't fit together very well right now
<ajmitch> stbain: i'm not a GNUe-affiliated coder or anythin
<derek> stbain: depends on what QAD is :)
<derek> the architecture is highly usable
<stbain> www.qad.com
<derek> in 2 tier mode
<stbain> heh
<derek> n tier doesnt play nicely yet
<stbain> forms on top of a database?
<derek> and applications arent 'shrinkwrapped'
<derek> but several people use for production stuff
<stbain> so you don't have... say... a base accounting module ready for download?
<derek> correct
<stbain> QAD is manufacturing ERP on steroids
<nickr> funny
<derek> but if you wanted to use gnue to write a base accounting module
<derek> you could probably do so
<nickr> they use a buzzword mission statement right on their frontpage
<stbain> "QAD Delivers Customer Value Through Collaborative Commerce for Manufacturers"
<nickr> 'qad delivers customer value'
<stbain> LOL
<nickr> blah
<stbain> hehe
<nickr> I hate that
<nickr> hehe
<stbain> hrmmm
<stbain> is it GEAS that needs work or the hooks?
<stbain> or both
<derek> both
<stbain> :/
<derek> the hooks were being worked on
<derek> and there was a hurdle jamest ran into with corba that needs fixing
<derek> and of course as we put it to more and more use we see more and more inadequecies :)
<stbain> doh
<derek> as one always finds in course of such things
<derek> stbain: you could use GEAS today
<jamest> inadequecies?!?!?!
<derek> if you wanted to write your own front ends to it
<stbain> just not with the latest forms
<stbain> right
<derek> but its not 'production' quality
<jamest> we should call them incomplete feature sets
<jamest> :)
<stbain> LOL
<derek> i just want to make sure im not saying geas doesnt do anything
<derek> as it does
<stbain> jamest is jamest!billg@llama.microsoft.com
<stbain> j/k
<nickr> It runs
<stbain> but it does sound like something slick willy would say
<stbain> heh
Action: chillywilly pets poor geas
<nickr> i don't see it do anything though
<stbain> hrmmm
<chillywilly> I still love you
<chillywilly> don't listen to them
<chillywilly> geas juts needs more lovin'
<stbain> probably a bit more codin' too
<chillywilly> ummm, that's how it likes it
Action: nickr listens to chillywilly sing 'lovin you' to GEAS
Action: derek jaunts off for a bit
<stbain> so...
<stbain> the question is
<stbain> what needs the most work?
<jamest> wow
<jamest> um
<jamest> all of it
<stbain> what is in the most need of an entry-to-mid level programmer?
<jamest> i'd say pick your poison
<chillywilly> loooooovin yooooooou
<jamest> that's a weak answer I know
<chillywilly> oo oo o o oo o ooooooooooo
<nickr> is easy cause your beautiful
<chillywilly> la la la laaaa alaaaaaa
<jamest> if I were beautifull like you
<jamest> stbain: you more interested in tools, apps?
<chillywilly> la la la laaaa laaaaaaaaa
<chillywilly> oo oo o o oo o ooooooooooo
<nickr> stbain: I've got some minion job openings..
<stbain> well... in the long run, I'm interested in making millions installing this to replace every ERP package in my region
<stbain> but...
<nickr> sounds like a plan
<chillywilly> money is evil
<chillywilly> give all your money to the poor
<stbain> for the mean time, it would be nice to have a system I can look at and say, "You know what? I can replace that monster AIX box w/ one little Linux PC that will run your entire operation."
<chillywilly> ;P
<nickr> I need money to support this eating habit I have
<stbain> or three boxes
<stbain> ;)
<nickr> Its horrible I know, but food is so addictive
<stbain> DB, GEAS, Terminal Server
<chillywilly> bah
<stbain> so nickr,
<stbain> what are your minion tasks?
<jamest> stbain: but are you more into final apps made w/ the tools
<jamest> or working on the tools themselves
<stbain> jamest: apps
<stbain> but I want to know the ins and outs of the tools to
<stbain> tools == means to end(apps)
<jamest> yeeeeehaw!
<jamest> that was a bug in our system
<chillywilly> raid kill bugs dead
<chillywilly> kills
<nickr> stbain: well there appears to be a demand for this document management system that I was working on
<stbain> hehe
<chillywilly> slaughter the goat!
<nickr> stbain: I need several minions to help me design and build it
<stbain> that's funny... I work for a company that offers document management systems
<chillywilly> heheh
<stbain> I'd love to help you so that after I quit I can shove it up their arse
<stbain> whoops... did I say that outloud?
<chillywilly> hehe
<stbain> getting late
<nickr> hahaha
<stbain> groggy ;)
<stbain> so... document management system
<stbain> build w/ 2-tier Forms/Database?
<nickr> No
<jamest> there's that
<stbain> or is this a different projecT?
<jamest> forms wouldn't work good for it
<nickr> you could use forms as a sort of front end to various parts of it
<stbain> web frontend to GEAS w/ GEAS providing the workflow?
<nickr> No
<stbain> ok... gimme the punchline, because I'm running out of ideas here
<jamest> we could use some good demo apps of forms
<stbain> Zope?
<jamest> showing the various features
<jamest> that are more realistic than we have now
<nickr> jamest: In the near future I'm doing a little personnel app thing
<jamest> and these forms could be useful in real life things
<nickr> as a test of various things
<nickr> stbain: Hah. Zope. Haha.
<nickr> stbain: http://green.zorcat.com/~nick/proj/document-store/gnue/spec/Document-Store/documentstorespec.html
<jamest> um
<nickr> la
<stbain> nickr: I take it you don't like Zope
<nickr> I have nothing against zope.
<stbain> hrmmm
<stbain> looks interesting
<nickr> well this is the lowest layer, I need minions to help update this design and develope the other layers.
<nickr> Or motivation. :)
<jamest> stbain: if you could help nickr that'd be cool
<stbain> sounds like a plan
<jamest> IIRC nickr you were going to do under GNUe anyway is that right?
<stbain> I'll sign the assignment forms tonight and get them in the mail (so I can get my cool GNU stickers)
<nickr> jamest: tThat was the plan
<stbain> nickr: you considered an imaging interface to go w/ that?
<stbain> that way you can have a document imaging and management architecture under one roof
<nickr> stbain: I had envisioned having any 'object' able to be managed under the same storegae system
<nickr> stbain: if my imaging you mean simply scanning things
<nickr> stbain: if yoeu mean OCR that'd be fine, another input method.
<stbain> combination of both
<nickr> you could use the instances with special identifiers to have both the scanned document and the OCR'd result
<stbain> yah
<nickr> or we can work on overloading instances with different mime types with the same identifier
<stbain> well, I'm thinking about the end-game here... many of the doc imaging/doc mgmt systems we install are for HR departments
<nickr> yea
<stbain> they are simply document repositories for the immense amount of paperwork companies have to process to keep up w/ their hundreds of employees
<stbain> if they want to look up my docs, they punch in my SSN and scroll through the descriptions
<stbain> they would _love_ to have it integrated right into their ERP software
<stbain> alas... no dice
<nickr> Well, that'd be a metadata extension, witha  library interface.
<stbain> right
<nickr> The Library that is
<stbain> and all good document management systems have that extension
<stbain> at least, the ones we sell do
<nickr> yea.
<nickr> Its pretty trivial, really.
<nickr> the key is making it abstract
<stbain> right
<stbain> we sell lexign products where I work now
<stbain> info @ www.lexign.com
<stbain> pretty slick stuff, but stuck in a Windows world
<nickr> yea
<nickr> my general plan for DocuSTore and whatever it mutates into wrt management is platform nutrality through RPC
<stbain> XML-RPC?
<stbain> >:)
<nickr> no, the plan is to use gnurpc (whatever its called) which is a wrapper for any rpc system you want to use
<nickr> the original design uses CORBA
<stbain> any code yet?
<nickr> No
<stbain> hehe
<nickr> Still design stage
<stbain> ok
<stbain> sounds like fun
<jamest> um
<stbain> something to cut my teeth on
<nickr> there are some early rough stabs at stuff in the document-store/grawk directory
<jamest> you might be able to use a fair amout of common
<nickr> jamest: this has been recommended to me
<nickr> particlularly database abstraction stuff
