<chillywilly> more toys :)
<derek> was hoping to have the k6 333 replace my jacked k6 350
<nickr> sweet
<derek> but it dont fit in my case :(
<nickr> jacked?
<chillywilly> he b0rked his mobo
<derek> i have an old case was able to put the p200 in but i dont have old sytle (AT) keyboard so have to pick up adaptor
<nickr> horked
<derek> that one will go to church when it gets 'rebuilt'
<derek> need to get case for the k6 (hopefully under 30 bucks)
<derek> whoo hooo
<derek> for now have to play with the 'unstable' box to try to get it revived 
Action: derek wishes he had two nickels to rub together to fix these damn things
Action: nickr wishes he had two nickles to rub together to buy food with.
<chillywilly> what exactly happens during a db transaction? a series of db accesses/modifications? Do they commonly model a real world transaction of some kind?
<nickr> isn't a transaction anything that interacts with the data?
<derek> i like to think of it as 'complex' record locking
<derek> er file locking
<derek> i think of table level locking like normal file system locking
<derek> if nickr has the file open
<derek> chilly cant open it for write
<derek> then page level is only the segment chilly is actually playing with is locked instead of the whole file
<chillywilly> ok
<derek> etc
<nickr> normal file locking
<derek> then there are COMPLEX locking
<nickr> yea
<derek> where it doesnt reall 'lock'
<derek> but rather buffers to memory and HOPES no one dicks w/
<derek> if someone does it does a 'dirty' read/write or such
<nickr> hrm
<nickr> dirty read?
<nickr> dirty write?
<derek> yeah you know those darn pornographic dbs
<nickr> hey meeester, wanna uby some feeeelthy tables?
<chillywilly> so can all transactions be committed and rolled back?
<derek> um no
<nickr> thats the idea behind transactions isn't it?
Action: chillywilly thought a transaction was more like a series of steps
<derek> well kind of
<derek> if i do
<nickr> a transaction is an 'atomic' operation that does complex manipulations
<chillywilly> select this...update this...etc.
<derek> UPDATE myTable set foo='fooey';
<derek> i cant 'roll' that back
<derek> but ISOLATION levels still exist
<derek> iirc
<derek> then you have TRANSACTIONS
<derek> where you can say somethign like 
<derek> START TRANSACTION
<derek> then you can do 
<derek> UPDATE myTable set foo='fooey';
<derek> UPDATE myTable set sloo='fooey';
<derek> UPDATE myTable set doo='fooey';
<derek> COMMIT
<derek> or
<derek> ROLLBACK
<derek> and those 'updates' dont 'really' take effect until that COMMIT
<chillywilly> yea
<derek> thats where they were getting into
<nickr> locking is less important in that sort of inteaction, no?
<derek> when you smack COMMIT
<derek> does update a really happen
<derek> if update c fails
Action: chillywilly looks at the degrees of isolation
<derek> sigh that was fruitless that machine really is dead :(

<chillywilly> oh bummer

<chillywilly> you ever hear of ISO XA standard for distributed transactions?
<derek> would love to see them move to 802.11b and for starters have 'intranet' for gilbert businesses and govt to use
Action: chillywilly is going to have to check that out

<derek> hey on debian i had found a real tight little application for doing foto album

<derek> my debian box is dead
<derek> can someone do a cache search for me and give me hint at what it might have been ?
<derek> :(
<derek> maybe
<derek> apt-cache search photo album
<derek> and paste results here?

<chillywilly> which one?
<derek> maybe
<chillywilly> gallery?
<derek> apt-cache gallery
<derek> instead
<chillywilly> ok
<nickr> I use igal
<derek> er
<derek> apt-cache search gallery
<derek> nickr: that might be it
Action: ajmitch wonders why derek wants to index his pr0n collection
<nickr> igal is cool
<derek> it wsa REALLY simple
<nickr> yeua
<nickr> you go to the directory, type igal and it does it
<derek> yet produced good formed html pages
<chillywilly> danielb@obfuscation:~$ apt-cache search gallery

<nickr> http://green.zorcat.com/~nick/data/pictures is igal output
<ajmitch> hrmm, we've got plans for 802.11b here as well derek
<derek> it was igal
<derek> can tell by the header :)
<chillywilly> ok
<nickr> you have to edit the .index_template.html to link it to other pages though
<nickr> or wahtevr
<nickr> which is mildly annoying but not too bad
<nickr> I wrote a script to do it
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> I wonder where I cna get my hands on the XA spec
<derek> nickr: submit it to author as patch
<derek> if its mildly annoying to you its probably annoying to others as well :)
<nickr> well they chose simplicyt and flexibility over overfeaturedness
<chillywilly> hrrm, authors seems to be the Open Group
<chillywilly> probably means shelling out some dough
<chillywilly> :(
<nickr> XA?
<chillywilly> yea

<derek> nickr: how do you make igal do recursion?
<derek> or can you
Action: derek is too lazy to read man pages right now :)
<nickr> you can't
<nickr> thats what I mean
<nickr> its simplistic
<nickr> it does one directory at a time
<derek> can you 'tie' the directories together?
<derek> sigh this looked too good to be true
<chillywilly> write a script
<nickr> yea, just write a shell script to do it
<derek> i wanted to upload and do something 'quickly'
<nickr> when you do igal it makes some .files
<nickr> one of them is the template it'll use to generate the index next time you run it
<nickr> you add links to the other directories to it
<nickr> and run igal again
<nickr> and then do that down the tree as deep as you want
<nickr> thats what I did
<chillywilly> whddaya know
<chillywilly> Java uses this same model for transactions
<chillywilly> J2EE that is
<derek> nickr cool
Action: derek will have to rewrite igal in python someday
<derek> and add -r feature :)
<nickr> way ahead of you.
<Mr_You> what ya'll think about Miguels comments?

<zoyd> I'm not able to run gfdesigner, please help.
<jamest> um
<jamest> slackware does packages?
Action: jamest is not a slackware user
<zoyd> yes it does they're simply binary tarballs.
<zoyd> 'ImportError: No module named wxPython.wx'
<drochaid> WOO life :)
<drochaid> zoyd: is it still using pkgtool?
<drochaid> or whatever it was '_
<zoyd> yes.

<drochaid> do you have pyton installed, or is that where the problem is?
<zoyd> yes, i have python installed and running.
<drochaid> apologise, not typing properly ... same question, but subsitute python with wxPython
<zoyd> that i don't have.
<drochaid> hmm .. I see what you mean, I can only find .rpm bins for it
<drochaid> the source looks fairly easy to compile if you're okay with that tho?
<zoyd> where's the source ?

<zoyd> i wonder what's that -> http://www.linuxpackages.net/details.php?name=wxGTK

<jcater> I ran python 2.0 + wxPython both from source on Slackware 8

<zoyd> jamest: thanks for the confirmation.
<jcater> you found a packaged python for slack 8?
<jcater> cool
<jcater> and yet weird
<zoyd> it's there on the first install cd.
<zoyd> 2.0.1
<zoyd> jcater: 'weird', why ?
<jcater> ah, included with the slack distro?
<zoyd> yes.
<jcater> oops, I missed that
<zoyd> jcater: do you have wxpython running ?
<jcater> I've since replaced that machine w/debian
<jcater> but I did
<zoyd> oh. guess what, i moved from debian back to slack8 recently.
<zoyd> So, are there any serious users of GNUe ?
<zoyd> some nice applications developed using all these beautiful tools.
<jcater> yes, but inhouse stuff
<zoyd> 'inhouse' as in ?
<dneighbo> not availalbe under gpl :)
<dneighbo> i.e. custom solutions
<zoyd> custom solutions could be gpl'ed too, isn't it ?
<jcater> well, they "could" be, but gpl covers redistribution and inhouse solutions typically aren't redistributed
<jcater> not would there be must advantage to that
<jcater> if its an app written around a single business' idiosyncracies
<drochaid> also the aspect of businesses using ERP for a 'competitive edge' ... if they then make their solutions available to all, they're effectively paying for their competitors to have that competitive edge

Nick change: drochaid_ -> drochaid
<jcater> e.g., we are a magazine fundraising company... our magazine clearinghouse code is irrelevant to anyone else
<zoyd> drochaid: but making the soltution available would still remain in the hands of the businesses using this ERP.
<jcater> so that is what I meant wrt "inhouse" 
sjc (~sjc@modem-858.aardvark.dialup.pol.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> but like a custom contact system, or custom payables system, or custom supply/inventory system
<jcater> wouldn't make much sense
<zoyd> jcater: fine i understand the thing with an application usefull for general use.
<jcater> zoyd: I was primarily disagreeing w/ drochaid's ERP example :)
<zoyd> heh
<jcater> unfortunately, aside from our samples/ directory, all the real-world uses of forms right now are in-house stuff
<jcater> this is of course not the way we want it
<jcater> of course, early adopters are a GOOD thing :)
<zoyd> there are going to be industry specific components, isn't it ?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> I have not played much in the packages area, but
<zoyd> and i think the samples would significantly influence those components.
<drochaid> jcater: indeed, but what having the apps available would do, would be to allow your competitors to see how you do it and potentially modify there own system with some improvements gained from knowledge of yours
<jcater> our goal is to have a set of comprehensive base packages
<jcater> and then have industry-specific "templates" that extend the functionality
<jcater> of these base packages
<jcater> drochaid: true enough... of course, I wouldn't put out my inhouse stuff because I'd also be afraid of our competitors seeing it
<jcater> HOWEVER
<jcater> I'd be afraid they'd laugh at our system

<dneighbo> which is fine, though over time i think they will realize the computer system is only a small advantage
<ICJ> I yesterday filed a bug against the Debian package gead
<ICJ> geas, of course
<dneighbo> that really the 'logistics' and such will be more important
<ICJ> what is really important are different tax laws in diff. countries
<ICJ> they have an heavy impact on accounting
<ICJ> You have to be able to say write-off according to article xy, and the system should do it
<ICJ> am I talking to much?
<dneighbo> no
<ICJ> ok :-)
<dneighbo> i agree but am not too worried
<dneighbo> i see us 'templating' things by region/location
<dneighbo> to handle tax specifics and such
<dneighbo> one goal of gnue is to avoid the SAP idea of
<dneighbo> you get shipped with 80,000 tables
<ICJ> *g*
<dneighbo> of which 60,000 of them you have to go 'configure' (ie. populate remove etc)
<dneighbo> but rather you get a small base
<ICJ> and modules, yes
<dneighbo> then 'apply' things based on 'country, tax laws, etc etc etc)
<ICJ> together with a goog package management, that would be fine
<dneighbo> so you might get base accounting package
<dneighbo> gl module
<dneighbo> then apply austrian tax template
<dneighbo> or what not
<ICJ> anyone using Debian package of geas?
<drochaid> just to confirm ... do you want more or less than 80,000 tables? [no, not my usual, uhm, humour, serious question]
<ICJ> depends ...
<zoyd> it's way past midnight here .. goodnight, c ya folks later.
<ICJ> more than 80,000 possible tables with less than 1,000 normally in active use?
zoyd (zoyd@202.9.130.97) left #gnuenterprise ("bye").
<dneighbo> um
<dneighbo> drochaid: i want to avoid as ICJ says
<dneighbo> 80,000 tables of which only 1000 have ANYTHING to do with your system
<drochaid> ahh .. hmm
<drochaid> yes, I missed the 'but only need 1000' before
<dneighbo> instead i see gnue having the 80,000 in 'concept'
<dneighbo> but it installs like 100 to start
<dneighbo> and you 'apply' the others as you need them
<dneighbo> think of how 'apache' on debian works
<dneighbo> you get
<dneighbo> apt-get install apache
<dneighbo> then you can 
<dneighbo> apg-get install php4
<dneighbo> apt-get install php4-pgsql
<dneighbo> etc etc
<drochaid> yep ... makes sense
<dneighbo> so you might have
<dneighbo> apt-get gnue-accounting
<dneighbo> apt-get gnue-accounting-austrian-tax
<dneighbo> apt-get gnue-accounting-euro-conversions
<dneighbo> or soemthing
<dneighbo> only wont be apt-get
<dneighbo> probably gnue-get
<dneighbo> or something similar

<dneighbo> rofl
<ICJ> well, .debs are ok
<dneighbo> um you have to have your sources.list set to
<ICJ> Debian will then have a Gnue policy
<dneighbo> deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian im_a_fscking_idiot main contrib non-free

<ICJ> certainly, often a card reader is integrated into the terminal
reinhard (rm@62.47.45.2) left irc: "All things being equal, fat people use more soap"
<ICJ> In Germany, a common method is to read the account number and bank routing number from the Eurocheque card, let the customer sign a direct debit agreement and then give the collected debits electronically (with formats like EDIFACT) to the company's bank.
<ICJ> The payment is not guaranteed, so the company has to store the data in its system if the debit is being returned

<jcater> chillywilly: what d'ya expect with objects? something simple????
<chillywilly> plz
<chillywilly> objects rock
<chillywilly> it's not that complicated 
<chillywilly> I dun figured it out
<dtm> yay cheeleywheeley
<chillywilly> the whole point is that I don't have to design this hairy shit, but just write a Free implementation
<chillywilly> fun part will be converting all those gcds and doing a proper design there ;P
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I don't want to be around when you tell reinhard his gcd lexer is shit
<chillywilly> it's not
<chillywilly> the lexer will provide a good base

<dtm> who here knows basic pgsql setup?
<chillywilly> like eveyone
<dtm> ok
<chillywilly> practically

<chillywilly> except I haven't done it in eons
<chillywilly> just install the cleint package
<chillywilly> you build it form source?
<chillywilly> er, from
<dtm> no i installed from rpms from ydl
<chillywilly> install postgresql-client or whatever they call it
<dtm> oh , there's a client?  :}  i installed postgresql and postgresql-server   stand by
rdean (~rdean@chcgil2-ar2-053-033.chcgil2.dsl.gtei.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> first one is probably the client
<dtm> there's nothing called "client"
<dtm> rdean: hi
<chillywilly> psql is athe client
<dtm> chillywilly: that's what i thought.
<chillywilly> psql -h <host> <database>, iirc
<dtm> i did this:
<dtm> sudo sh -c "su -l postgres -c \"/usr/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/pgsql/data -p /usr/bin/postmaster start\" "
<dtm> which is directly from the rc script
<chillywilly> that starts the server
<dtm> pg_ctl: Can't find /var/lib/pgsql/data/postmaster.opts.default
<dtm> that's what it says
<dtm> in response
<dtm> oh wait
<dtm> hold up
<chillywilly> just isntall the packages
Nick change: rdean -> rdean-[rtcw]
<chillywilly> shouldn't be hard
<chillywilly> then you can copy the data if you need to
<dtm> [dtm@Datums /]$ sudo sh -c "su -l postgres -c \"/usr/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/pgsql/data -p /usr/bin/postmaster start\" "
<dtm> that's waht it says after i simply copied /var/lib/pgsql
<dtm> both hosts were running pgsql 7
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> you copied the data?
<mdean> dtm: you're best bet is to 1) pg_dumpall the source server, 2) initdb the new system, 3) psql -e < dump.sql
<mdean> s/you're/your/
<chillywilly> yea
<dtm> mdean: so how come what i did, didn't work?
Action: chillywilly new there was a sane way
<dtm> what else is there to my db's
<chillywilly> er, knew
<dtm> how else are the db's represented on the filesystem
<mdean> I don't know enough of pgsql internals to give you an answer ;-)
<dtm> goll durnint
<chillywilly> you need da masta
<mdean> just that if you need to move data, use pg_dump dbname or pg_dumpall
<dtm> mdean knows all!
<chillywilly> or jcater might know
<dtm> mdean: and that results in a simple delimited text file, right?
<chillywilly> masta is postgres expert
Action: jcater is da oracle man, not da postgres man
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> well derek would know
<mdean> dtm: no, it is a sql dump
<chillywilly> masta!!!
<mdean> pg_dumpall > dump.sql
<dtm> mdean: what type of data is that
<mdean> pgsql creates new OIDs whenever you do initdb or add anything (which is why you never use OID for a fk ;-)
<mdean> it is a sql text file
<chillywilly> mmmm, steak
<dtm> mdean: what is "FK"
<chillywilly> fk?
<mdean> foreign key
<chillywilly> ah
<dtm> mdean: ok i have no idea what that is, or the significance of it!
<dtm> :)
<chillywilly> or you just use a nice object abstraction ;P
<mdean> everything in pg has a OID (object ID)
<chillywilly> OIDs shouldn't be done in the db, imho
<mdean> pg is an object db ;-)
<jcater> chillywilly: that only means you are putting your faith in the designer of the abstraction level
<chillywilly> not really
<dtm> i gotchur objects right here
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> plz
<dtm> DONT HURT EM CHILLY.
<chillywilly> why do you use python is objects are so evil?
<chillywilly> s/is/if
<mdean> dtm: a fk is a relationship between two tables - usually based of the primary key of one of the tables, so it creates a "lookup"
<jcater> chillywilly: well, I like python's objects
<chillywilly> E/R bs mostly :P
<nickr> hurt me chilly!
<jcater> and using a scripting language's objects are different than storing your data as objects
<mdean> chillywilly: bah!
Action: chillywilly beats nickr with a whale
Action: jcater can't imagine how slowly an object database must perform
<chillywilly> it's not that slow
Action: jcater hugs his pure relational play
<chillywilly> well I prefer object-relational mappings

<slamb> Hmm. So I think I've run into a bug.
<slamb> When a commit fails (a referential integrity violation), it pops up a dialog box as expected.
<slamb> but apparently doesn't tell the database server to rollback
<slamb> because anything in the future (whether I hit "commit" or "rollback" next
<slamb> says this
<slamb> libpq.Warning: NOTICE:  current transaction is aborted, queries ignored until end of transaction block

<jamest> is this a custom form?
<jamest> or one of the samples

<jamest> any chance you have the zipcode sample installed?
<slamb> I could install it now
<jamest> well
<jamest> i tried to reproduce

<jamest> queried all existin records
<jamest> added one w/ a duplicate zip
<jamest> comited, got error
<jamest> changed zip
<jamest> commited without error
<slamb> Hmm. What I did was change a foreign key reference to an ID that wasn't valid.
<jamest> so I'm trying to figure out how it's getting tripped on your form
<slamb> okay.
<slamb> I took zipcode.gfd
<slamb> and removed the style="dropdown" attribute from the state field
<slamb> so I could point it to something invalid
<slamb> the commit fails, of course.
<jamest> same error?
<slamb> I change it to something valid and it still fails.
<slamb> yeah, same errors
<jamest> ok
<jamest> lemme test
<slamb> I'd guess removing a state from the db after the "validator" data source is populated would give the same error

<jamest> that commit bug is pypgsql dependent
<nickr> oh
<slamb> do you not normally use pypgql, out of curiosity?
<jamest> um
<jamest> it's our primary windows driver
<jamest> however
<jamest> if you run it thru and duplicate a zip
<jamest> she'll recover
<jamest> unique key error
<slamb> *nod*
<jamest> do a ref integ violation
<jamest> she'll not recove
<jamest> they call the exact same error routines
<jamest> on our end
<jamest> in fact
<jamest> all our postgresql drivers use the same base class
<jamest> so that psycopg works w/ same code that pypgsql dies on
<slamb> heh. yeah, I downloaded psycopg...it works.
<stbain> so jamest
<stbain> now that I know python
<stbain> how can I help?
Action: slamb should learn Python, too.
<jamest> bwahahahaha
<jamest> er, i mean
<jamest> you want to help....that's wonderfull.
<stbain> I still have the project assignment docs
<stbain> I guess I should actually sign them and mail them back
<jamest> yip
<jamest> that's a prereq. to getting cvs write
<chillywilly> don't do it, it is a trap ;P
<chillywilly> masta will own you then
<jamest> stbain: what you interested in?
<stbain> well...
<stbain> hrmmm
<stbain> ok
<stbain> I don't know if you remember my background or not
<stbain> I've been programming for quite some time
<jamest> i can't remember if i are supper
<stbain> mostly small stuff
<jamest> ate
<stbain> some scripts here and there
<stbain> a little gui
<stbain> however, I am now finishing up my CS degree at accis.edu
<stbain> I wanted to contribute a while back to GNUe, but didn't know Python
<stbain> now I do
<derek>  we dont discuss java here.
[23:23] Last message repeated 2 time(s).
<derek> sorry
<stbain> uhhh
<stbain> ok
<derek> hit wrong button
<nickr> java is satan!
<stbain> what's the current status of the project?
<chillywilly> everything is satan!
Action: derek is back (gone 20:53:54)
<stbain> I mean, can I walk into my new job and replace QAD w/ GNUe?
<ajmitch> sure, but it might not remain your job for long ;)
Action: ajmitch ducks
<nickr> haha
<nickr> ajmitch: better put on your anti-crappie sheild
<stbain> that's what I thought
<ajmitch> stbain: but i know nothing
<stbain> I've been trying to read the mailing list
<stbain> from what I gather, the parts are all there, but they don't fit together very well right now
<ajmitch> stbain: i'm not a GNUe-affiliated coder or anythin
<derek> stbain: depends on what QAD is :)
<derek> the architecture is highly usable
<stbain> www.qad.com
<derek> in 2 tier mode
<stbain> heh
<derek> n tier doesnt play nicely yet
<stbain> forms on top of a database?
<derek> and applications arent 'shrinkwrapped'
<derek> but several people use for production stuff
<stbain> so you don't have... say... a base accounting module ready for download?
<derek> correct
<stbain> QAD is manufacturing ERP on steroids
<nickr> funny
<derek> but if you wanted to use gnue to write a base accounting module
<derek> you could probably do so
<nickr> they use a buzzword mission statement right on their frontpage
<stbain> "QAD Delivers Customer Value Through Collaborative Commerce for Manufacturers"
<nickr> 'qad delivers customer value'
<stbain> LOL
<nickr> blah
<stbain> hehe
<nickr> I hate that
<nickr> hehe
<stbain> hrmmm
<stbain> is it GEAS that needs work or the hooks?
<stbain> or both
<derek> both
<stbain> :/
<derek> the hooks were being worked on
<derek> and there was a hurdle jamest ran into with corba that needs fixing
<derek> and of course as we put it to more and more use we see more and more inadequecies :)
<stbain> doh
<derek> as one always finds in course of such things
<derek> stbain: you could use GEAS today
<jamest> inadequecies?!?!?!
<derek> if you wanted to write your own front ends to it
<stbain> just not with the latest forms
<stbain> right
<derek> but its not 'production' quality
<jamest> we should call them incomplete feature sets
<jamest> :)
<stbain> LOL
<derek> i just want to make sure im not saying geas doesnt do anything
<derek> as it does
<stbain> jamest is jamest!billg@llama.microsoft.com
<stbain> j/k
<nickr> It runs
<stbain> but it does sound like something slick willy would say
<stbain> heh
Action: chillywilly pets poor geas
<nickr> i don't see it do anything though
<stbain> hrmmm
<chillywilly> I still love you
<chillywilly> don't listen to them
<chillywilly> geas juts needs more lovin'
<stbain> probably a bit more codin' too
<chillywilly> ummm, that's how it likes it
Action: nickr listens to chillywilly sing 'lovin you' to GEAS
Action: derek jaunts off for a bit
<stbain> so...
<stbain> the question is
<stbain> what needs the most work?
<jamest> wow
<jamest> um
<jamest> all of it
<stbain> what is in the most need of an entry-to-mid level programmer?
<jamest> i'd say pick your poison
<chillywilly> loooooovin yooooooou
<jamest> that's a weak answer I know
<chillywilly> oo oo o o oo o ooooooooooo
<nickr> is easy cause your beautiful
<chillywilly> la la la laaaa alaaaaaa
<jamest> if I were beautifull like you
<jamest> stbain: you more interested in tools, apps?
<chillywilly> la la la laaaa laaaaaaaaa
<chillywilly> oo oo o o oo o ooooooooooo
<nickr> stbain: I've got some minion job openings..
<stbain> well... in the long run, I'm interested in making millions installing this to replace every ERP package in my region
<stbain> but...
<nickr> sounds like a plan
<chillywilly> money is evil
<chillywilly> give all your money to the poor
<stbain> for the mean time, it would be nice to have a system I can look at and say, "You know what? I can replace that monster AIX box w/ one little Linux PC that will run your entire operation."
<chillywilly> ;P
<nickr> I need money to support this eating habit I have
<stbain> or three boxes
<stbain> ;)
<nickr> Its horrible I know, but food is so addictive
<stbain> DB, GEAS, Terminal Server
<chillywilly> bah
<stbain> so nickr,
<stbain> what are your minion tasks?
<jamest> stbain: but are you more into final apps made w/ the tools
<jamest> or working on the tools themselves
<stbain> jamest: apps
<stbain> but I want to know the ins and outs of the tools to
<stbain> tools == means to end(apps)
<jamest> yeeeeehaw!
<jamest> that was a bug in our system
<chillywilly> raid kill bugs dead
<chillywilly> kills
<nickr> stbain: well there appears to be a demand for this document management system that I was working on
<stbain> hehe
<chillywilly> slaughter the goat!
<nickr> stbain: I need several minions to help me design and build it
<stbain> that's funny... I work for a company that offers document management systems
<chillywilly> heheh
<stbain> I'd love to help you so that after I quit I can shove it up their arse
<stbain> whoops... did I say that outloud?
<chillywilly> hehe
<stbain> getting late
<nickr> hahaha
<stbain> groggy ;)
<stbain> so... document management system
<stbain> build w/ 2-tier Forms/Database?
<nickr> No
<jamest> there's that
<stbain> or is this a different projecT?
<jamest> forms wouldn't work good for it
<nickr> you could use forms as a sort of front end to various parts of it
<stbain> web frontend to GEAS w/ GEAS providing the workflow?
<nickr> No
<stbain> ok... gimme the punchline, because I'm running out of ideas here
<jamest> we could use some good demo apps of forms
<stbain> Zope?
<jamest> showing the various features
<jamest> that are more realistic than we have now
<nickr> jamest: In the near future I'm doing a little personnel app thing
<jamest> and these forms could be useful in real life things
<nickr> as a test of various things
<nickr> stbain: Hah. Zope. Haha.
<nickr> stbain: http://green.zorcat.com/~nick/proj/document-store/gnue/spec/Document-Store/documentstorespec.html
<jamest> um
<nickr> la
<stbain> nickr: I take it you don't like Zope
<nickr> I have nothing against zope.
<stbain> hrmmm
<stbain> looks interesting
<nickr> well this is the lowest layer, I need minions to help update this design and develope the other layers.
<nickr> Or motivation. :)
<jamest> stbain: if you could help nickr that'd be cool
<stbain> sounds like a plan
<jamest> IIRC nickr you were going to do under GNUe anyway is that right?
<stbain> I'll sign the assignment forms tonight and get them in the mail (so I can get my cool GNU stickers)
<nickr> jamest: tThat was the plan
<stbain> nickr: you considered an imaging interface to go w/ that?
<stbain> that way you can have a document imaging and management architecture under one roof
<nickr> stbain: I had envisioned having any 'object' able to be managed under the same storegae system
<nickr> stbain: if my imaging you mean simply scanning things
<nickr> stbain: if yoeu mean OCR that'd be fine, another input method.
<stbain> combination of both
<nickr> you could use the instances with special identifiers to have both the scanned document and the OCR'd result
<stbain> yah
<nickr> or we can work on overloading instances with different mime types with the same identifier
<stbain> well, I'm thinking about the end-game here... many of the doc imaging/doc mgmt systems we install are for HR departments
<nickr> yea
<stbain> they are simply document repositories for the immense amount of paperwork companies have to process to keep up w/ their hundreds of employees
<stbain> if they want to look up my docs, they punch in my SSN and scroll through the descriptions
<stbain> they would _love_ to have it integrated right into their ERP software
<stbain> alas... no dice
<nickr> Well, that'd be a metadata extension, witha  library interface.
<stbain> right
<nickr> The Library that is
<stbain> and all good document management systems have that extension
<stbain> at least, the ones we sell do
<nickr> yea.
<nickr> Its pretty trivial, really.
<nickr> the key is making it abstract
<stbain> right
<stbain> we sell lexign products where I work now
<stbain> info @ www.lexign.com
<stbain> pretty slick stuff, but stuck in a Windows world
<nickr> yea
<nickr> my general plan for DocuSTore and whatever it mutates into wrt management is platform nutrality through RPC
<stbain> XML-RPC?
<stbain> >:)
<nickr> no, the plan is to use gnurpc (whatever its called) which is a wrapper for any rpc system you want to use
<nickr> the original design uses CORBA
<stbain> any code yet?
<nickr> No
<stbain> hehe
<nickr> Still design stage
<stbain> ok
<stbain> sounds like fun
<jamest> um
<stbain> something to cut my teeth on
<nickr> there are some early rough stabs at stuff in the document-store/grawk directory
<jamest> you might be able to use a fair amout of common
<nickr> jamest: this has been recommended to me
<nickr> particlularly database abstraction stuff
