<jcater> one of my guys here just used his credit union's new online account
<jcater> they have it set up where you use part of your last name + social security number + birthday
<jcater> as your initial login
<jcater> it brought up someone else's account
<jcater> is that not scary?
Action: jcater is away: lunch
<jamest> lol
<dneighbo> ok jamest
<dneighbo> main isssue is
<dneighbo> a. not 'commercial' product they 'paid for'
<dneighbo> b. its unamerican ;) (seriously its not M$ so its not american)
<dneighbo> those are 'primary' issues
<dneighbo> that and its 'read' only interface
<dneighbo> as my team doesnt have TIME to go to training on the financial system
<dneighbo> get bureaucratic approval for access etc
<dneighbo> so its easier to whip up a form that looks identical to the financial system
<dneighbo> for us to use :)
<dneighbo> btw: there is MAJOR techno phobia here
<dneighbo> because 5 or so years ago they moved to 'shrink' wrap only philosphy of software
<dneighbo> so most of the 'tech' people here know NOTHING about development
<dneighbo> so anything that sounds vaguely like it is SCARY
<jamest> it's unamerican?
Action: jamest was joking
<dneighbo> well its not the 'in' thing to do
<dneighbo> buying 'shrink wrap', 'web apps' and 'outsourcing' are the 'things' to do
<dneighbo> basically if you can let a vendor control your life thats where to be
<dneighbo> why? you ask?
<dneighbo> simple if i give ALL the control to the vendor when the shit hits the fan i can put ALL the blame on him
<dneighbo> nevermind it costs 10x more or that we cant do 90% of what we want
<dneighbo> those business pukes are too dumb to know the difference and by the time they realize it we are so locked in 'monetarily' it wont matter
<dneighbo> muhahahaha
<jamest> lol
<dneighbo> its really not funny its sad

<jcater> 4 billion simultanous transactions?
<jcater> or 4 billion cumulative
<jcater> I thought it had to do w/non-recycling of transaction ids
<ICJ> ic
[15:29] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<ICJ> that is then really bad, I agree
<drochaid> but oids looped back to the start when they hit the max value
<ICJ> args
<jcater> fyi
<jcater> PostgreSQL's MVCC transaction semantics depend on being able to compare transaction ID (XID) numbers: a tuple with an insertion XID newer than the current transaction's XID is "in the future" and should not be visible to the current transaction. But since transaction IDs have limited size (32 bits at this writing) an installation that runs for a long time (more than 4 billion transactions) will suffer transaction ID wraparound: the 
<jcater> unter wraps around to zero, and all of a sudden transactions that were in the past appear to be in the future --- which means their outputs become invisible. In short, catastrophic data loss. (Actually the data is still there, but that's cold comfort if you can't get at it.) 
<jcater> so it was number of transactions since the last vacuum or database init
<jamest> so it would have been hard core to hit it
<jamest> as the lack of vacuming would slowly kill performance
<jamest> unless you were doing _lots_ of little inserts w/ few updates
<drochaid> doh
<drochaid> well, at least I was right about the wrap around :D

<chillywilly> Havoc
<dneighbo> jamest i figured if ANYONE would get that poor grammer it would be you :)
<jamest> :)
Action: dneighbo needs to sucker jcater into looking into that ssh improvement he hinted to before
Action: dneighbo is TICKLED pink that i can use xchat now from here w/ port forwarding and remote X
<dneighbo> but jcater hinted there was another level to his madness that might make things even quicker :)
<dneighbo> i think that anyone who uses pcanyhow and friends
<dneighbo> that uses unix and x and ssh and things
<dneighbo> would not use windows for long
<dneighbo> the remote capabilities still just blow me away
<dneighbo> cvs, ssh, x, rsync etc etc etc
<dneighbo> i mean the idea of a switch box in the unix world is almost obscene
<dneighbo> at home i created an account for wife
<dneighbo> and login on console 1 as me and startx
<chillywilly> a "switch box"?
<dneighbo> login on console 2 as wife and startx 
<dneighbo> and use ctl-alt-f7(f8)
<dneighbo> to switch between them
<dneighbo> its a beautiful thing
<chillywilly> indeed
<chillywilly> multi-user systems tend to be cool like that
<dneighbo> yes cool because dont ahve to 'logout'
<dneighbo> and we can share a system
<dneighbo> and have our own SETTINGS
<dneighbo> as she would get ticked if i used her windows box as i would shut stuff down she had open and vice versa
<dneighbo> i think w/ new machine (faster) she will come to love linux
<dneighbo> since put her on my laptop (p3 128mb) have had no complaints
<dneighbo> she is using mozilla, galeon and ghostview like a champ
<dneighbo> it amazes at some stuff she does and im like how did you do that?
<dneighbo> or better yet how did you know how to do that
<dneighbo> most of its just stupid stuff i missed
Action: chillywilly thinks that brazilian site is lagged now because of the regoster article
<dneighbo> like she has it now set to open pdf's with ghostview automagically
<chillywilly> using nautilus?
<dneighbo> and she is a ghostview masta
<dneighbo> no using galeon
<chillywilly> ah
<dneighbo> or mozilla mail
Action: chillywilly only lets nautilus draw his desktop
<chillywilly> it's sucks for anything else
<chillywilly> imho
<dneighbo> im afraid to give her nautilus :)
<dneighbo> maybe midnight commander
<dneighbo> i like concept of nautilus for the kids and wife
<dneighbo> i personally dont see large value in it
<chillywilly> gnome-terminal has "value" :P
<dneighbo> i used to like 'a files system explorer' and thought cli was shit for such things
<dneighbo> UNTIL
<dneighbo> i moved to unix
<dneighbo> and found TAB complete
<dneighbo> and
<dneighbo> grep
<jamest> and
<dneighbo> now i cant imagine using anything else and being productive

<jan> I'm serious, but I dont know what you wanna change, that is so big, that it breaks my stuff.
<chillywilly> easily installing lyx would require me to add the non-free section to sources.list, something I am not willing to do....but anyway I'm not going to go make an ass of myself again ;P I'll just beg jamest to make a different format ;P

<jan> I m no MASTER OF THE JAVASCRIPT, so if anybody knows how to submit a form with an image button, ...
<jan> and tell the server that it is submit  button no. 1 and not submit button no. 2, in a way IE, konq, netscape 4.x and mozilla understand,...
<jamest> that is cool
<jan> please tell me.
Action: jcater knows nothing about javascript
<jamest> same here
<jan> ok, so use mozilla.
<mdean> jan: you working on forms php driver?
<jan> yeah. I try to.
<mdean> sweet
<mdean> you need some js help?
<jan> yes, because the docu is so bad.
<mdean> I can help you with that
<jan> I've try to catch an key event like "page down", but it dont work. 
<jan> Just "ALT-P" and "ALT-N" are working now.
<jan> mdean: this is great.
<mdean> key events aren't available for all keys :-(
<jan> Is "PAGE-UP/DN" available under MS IE?
<mdean> not sure - I can find out tho
<slamb> Hmm. It may not be necessary to use javascript to do your graphical submit buttons.
<slamb> I'm looking at W3C spec. You can have multiple submit buttons and you can have graphical ones.
<slamb> It says "If a form contains more than one submit button, only the activated submit button is successful." Which I think means only its values are submitted, so you can know which was clicked.
<slamb> Give me a second and I'll actually try it.
<mdean> ja - but if you need to change form data or the action based on which button, you probably need it
<slamb> If you need to do any sort of validation, yeah. but the action based on which button, I _think_ you don't need it.
<jan> Send a 
<jan> s/Send a//
<mdean> jan: as of IE 5.0, you can catch pg dn/up for onkeydown and onkeyup, but not onkeypress
<jan> This is great, so just for onkeydown, and it should work. 
<mdean> if you're just wanting to catch when the press a key, you should use onkeyup
<mdean> onkeydown will fire constantly while they hold the key down
<dtm> mdean: hi
<dtm> !
<mdean> dtm!
<dtm> mdean: are you pleased that i sent you mass feedback on DCL last night, or is that extra hassle for you at this point?  :)
<dtm> dont wanna bug ya
<mdean> dtm: pleased as punch
<mdean> dtm: quite a bit of that has been rectified/implemented
<dtm> grate
<dtm> ok well that's all i need to know
<dtm> :)
<ajmitch> heh
<dtm> i'd like to clean up my view of the status
<dtm> of dcl's development
<dtm> mdean: i filled my configs in last night, got it working.  it's VERY NICE
<dtm> mdean: it's come a long way, baby
<jan> slamb: now i know how to cach the image button.  I just name it and then i get an name_x and a name_y instead of x, y
<dtm> mdean: it's all growed up now
<slamb> jan: that's with js or just plain html?
<mdean> that would be html

<mdean> dtm: oh, that would be because there isn't any news on it ;-)

<mdean> dtm: you can now create links between objects in DCL via URLs
<dtm> wow
<dtm> i'll like to see that
<dtm> does that support dependancies?
<dtm> between tickets?
<mdean> dtm: i.e., dcl://workorders/7832-2 would bring up wo# 7832 seq 2
<dtm> ohhhh
<mdean> no depends
<mdean> yet
<dtm> ok
<dtm> great
<mdean> tickets and projects work the same way
<mdean> the links are available in work order notes/description, time card description, and ticket issue/resolution fields

Action: dtm dcc's mdean some peach punch
<jan> slamb: switch off javascript and try again.... (just the page tabs are not converted)
<slamb> jan: hmm. save doesn't work with no js. or is that just disabled?
<jan> slamb: which save do you mean?  if you mean commit,.... commit is not working now.
<slamb> jan: yeah, that's what I meant. very impressive. :)
<jan> Thanks for your idea. Just lynx and links won't work...
<jan> ;)
<slamb> no lynx? that's terrible! ;)
<slamb> actually, what is it about lynx that makes it not work? I'm curious now.
<jan> yeah. Although not working, lynx is not to bad: links tells me: [Submit] [Submit] [Submit], but the wonderful lynx is very informativ : [tb_save.png]-Submit [tb_new.png]-Submit ...
<slamb> *nod* I saw that. (which alt="" attributes would fix, plus give tooltip hints on graphical browsers)
<jan> Ithat means, php should read out the browser id and then send a normal submit button with an name.
<slamb> oh, I see. alt="" isn't valid for <input> elements?
<jan> slamb: i think lynx doesnt like to send x,y arguments for an image he cannot display...... so if you can click on the image in lynx, it definitly will send the values ;) 
<jan> slamb: is there a possibility to give tooltip hints for input type=text fields?
<slamb> jan: not in plain html

<jan> what is the name="" tag? submita or a?
<slamb> submita
<jan> ok, i keep trying
<jan> Dont know why, but using gfc.php. lynx isnt submitting anything.
<slamb> jan: lynx doesn't like your enctype="text/plain"
<slamb> jan: http://www.slamb.org/test2.html is identical in every other way, but the submitted stuff from lynx is very different

<jan> slamb: Thanks, i will never trust any SELF written HTML course anymore.
<jan> now it should working with lynx.
<jan> and with links too. (a little bit ugly, but who wann use links or lynx if there is an python curses client ;)
<slamb> jan: cool. :)
<slamb> jan: yeah, most of the info on the web about html is pretty misleading. why I just go to the official W3 specs.
<chillywilly> sup peeps
<chillywilly> use the specs!
<chillywilly> weeeeee
<jan> Some time ago I look into the w3 docs for XML and XPATH, and it was a little bit confusing, so I didnt use it.
<jan> But looking on the HTML 4.0 spec. ... GREAT. I ve never heard about LABELS in forms etc.
<chillywilly> satan laughing spreads his wiiiings
<slamb> *nod* small catch, though: several of the things on the W3 specs aren't really done by any browser.
<slamb> so you do need to check to make sure they are.
<slamb> a lot of the stuff with tables is like that. they have headers and footers...which nothing actually uses.
<jan> I will check the "accesskey="U"
<jan> to make ALT-N  Alt-P work without javascript.
<jan> working.
<slamb> jan: works here. cool.
<jan> :)
<mdean> heh - html form labels rock - don't make checkboxes or radio buttons without 'em ;-)
<jan> whats about the rest of the UI, any ideas? In the beginning I had planned to make just the actual row in the actual block editing and now everything visible is editable. What do you think is better?
<jan> s/editing/editable
<slamb> like only the top row of that state form would have been editable before?
<jan> yes, and this method would make server side triggers possible.
<slamb> Hmm...I would probably say minimizing the number of times you have to submit/wait for the server to respond would be good
<slamb> so from that perspective, the way you have it now is much better
<jan> mdean: I never made very complicated html forms. Just buttons, and text fields. ;( But when forms is supporting checkboxes .. ;)
<jan> slamb: good. But whats about an cursor? Without cursor, how do I know which row to delete (if i don't use javascript)
<slamb> jan: I think how you have it now is probably the best you can do. No way you can know that w/o JS, so it'll always be a bit confusing to newbies. I like the way you highlight the deleted row in red.
<slamb> actually, you could have a seperate delete button for each row. but that would require a change to the form definition.
<slamb> hey, any forms people around/non-idle?
<jamest> sorta
<jamest> will be back full time in about 5 min
<jamest> back
<slamb> jamest: so I've got weirdness with a dropdown box.
<jamest> oh yeah
<slamb> there are two on a page...one works, the other isn't ever populated. I can't figure out what's different.
<slamb> or rather, what difference is important. I've tried changing the non-working one to be more like the working one in a few ways, nothing seems to help.
<jamest> you have both datatsources set to prequery=""
<slamb> yes
<jamest> that they link to
<jamest> dang, that was the easy one
<jamest> :)
<slamb> heh :)
<slamb> this may or may not be related...
<slamb> but the schema navigator is slightly wrong about the type of the id field for both.
<slamb> the non-working one has "id char primary key"
<slamb> (this is pypgsql again)
<slamb> but the schema navigator shows it as a bpchar of size 5
<jamest> ?
<jan> slamb: the cursor is working now.
<jamest> hmmm
<slamb> jamest: okay, here's the table the broken one is coming from
<slamb> create table charge_periods (
<slamb>         id              char(1) primary key,
<slamb>         description     varchar(20) not null,
<slamb>         length          interval not null
<slamb> );
<slamb> actually, it was just "char primary key" earlier. I changed it to see if that'd make a difference.
<jamest> hmmm
<slamb> jan: I like :)
<jamest> is this stuff private?
<jamest> or can you tar it up and send to me?
<slamb> jamest: sure, I can do that.
<jamest> I'd be happy to take a look
<slamb> (I've now learned my IRC NAT module actually works)
<chillywilly> mine does too ;P
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> my database is messed up

<jamest> monthly
<jamest> quarterly
<jamest> yearly
<slamb> *nod* that's what should be there
<jamest> are you positive that your db structure matches the create*.sql you sent
Action: jamest seems to recall dropdowns aren't real friendly about reporting problems, they tend to fail silent
<slamb> yep. got nothing in there on this machine, so I can just drop everything and run that script.
<jamest> so you are dumping and rerunning?
<slamb> yeah
<jamest> anyone know of a way from command line
<jamest> so that if i have a string "This is a fooX_24k widgulator"
<jamest> i could pull only the words that start w/  fooX
<jamest> and dump the rest
<jamest> I'm sure egrep could do this somehow
<slamb> perl -ne '/\b(fooX_.*?)\b/ and print "$&\n"' <file1> <file2> ... <filen>
<jamest> hmmm
<jcater> um, a quick python script??
<jamest> the output is from glimpse
<slamb> er, throw a g after that regexp
<slamb> if you're piping into it, just don't put on the files. it'll read from stdin.
<jamest> rock
<jamest> that's perfect
<slamb> Yeah, my Perl is much better than my Python :)
<nickr> perl is good for one liners like that
<nickr> Actually its exceptional
<nickr> except awk is faster. :)
<jcater> :)
<slamb> whatever ;)
Action: jcater was about to type an awk command before the perl got posted :)
<jcater> but, whatever works :)
<slamb> I haven't used awk since I started learning perl.
<nickr> I go for perl for the multiline solution that needs a little more magic
<nickr> awk is good for the one line simple parsing
<slamb> and since perl5 wasn't out then, it's been a while.
<nickr> Its best to know all the tools.
<nickr> Then you can use whatevers best ofc htde nihuahiot
<chillywilly> uh, yea
<chillywilly> what he said
<nickr> er
<nickr> then you can use whatever is best for the situation :)
<nickr> Line noise :)
<slamb> situation, nihuahiot...yeah, those are pretty close.
<chillywilly> very ;)
<slamb> *shrug* I've found Perl can do anything awk can just about as easily.
<slamb> I once knew awk decently well, but have since forgotten anything about it.
<nickr> I usually just use it to pick feilds out of a stream. :)
<nickr> I guess sed can do that also.
<nickr> but its more arkane.
<dsmith> nickr: You can use 
<fitzix> awk can be damned tricky
<dsmith> cut
<fitzix> nickr: awk is better because of support for columns
<nickr> cut is great if you don't have to add other stuff too
<slamb> Well, Perl has regexps, split, and unpack. Between the three, you can parse most text well.
<dsmith> nickr: You can use "cut" also, but I find the awk syntax easier to remember.
<nickr> yea
<slamb> unpack is good for fixed-width files.
<nickr> awk.
<nickr> perl would be better if each feature was a separate binary :)
<nickr> then you could use shell as the infrastructure with all the power of perl ;)
<slamb> No fork/exec necessary. which is why perl is much faster than shell.
<jamest> slamb: did dump fix issue?
<slamb> jamest: nope. same deal.
<nickr> It'd still be useful.
<jamest> wow
<jamest> thats nuts
<nickr> Not for the crazy things people use perl for, but for actual perl stuff
<slamb> jamest: yeah, I know. I had a feeling this would be a stubborn one...it was working at one point, and I don't really know what changed.
<jamest> can you run forms w/ a -d 5 
<jamest> and see what the queries look like
<jamest> or a -d 10 
<jamest> which IIRC will give you the values it's pulling from the DB
<slamb> ooh, I didn't know that flag existed.
<jamest> :)
<jamest> gfclient --help
<jamest> there's a profiling switch in there too :)
<slamb> hmm.

<slamb> *nod* I get something like that for the countries one (but much longer; I'll save the cut'n'pasting ;)
<jamest> lol
<jamest> thanks
<jamest> hmmmm

<jamest> this does not make sense
<slamb> hmm. do you also get in designer the schema view that isn't quite right?
<slamb> ie, it says charge_periods.id is a bpchar of size 5
<jamest> yes
<jamest> i get that
<slamb> it seems to be consistently four too high actually. a2_code is 6, a3_code is 7.
<jamest> what database version and what pypgsql driver?
<jamest> and have you tried against psycopg?
<slamb> ooh, I should try psycopg.
<slamb> database is 7.1.3, I might have also tried against 7.2rc2 at some point.
<slamb> pypgsql is 2.0
<slamb> okay, it works with psycopg
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> and it works for me
<jan> Im going to sleep. Bye
<jamest> l8r
<jamest> cool work 
<slamb> see ya
<jan> exit

<chillywilly> and the wiiiind screeeams maaary
<slamb> I can try pypgsql 1.6, actually.
<jamest> i'm at 2.0
<slamb> hmm. that's what didn't work for me.
<slamb> 1.6 doesn't work either
<slamb> (toggling by commenting out lines in common/src/dbdrivers/pypgsql/DBdriver.py)
<slamb> oh! you know, I'm using the 7.2rc2 PostgreSQL libraries, and the pypgsql driver was linked against 7.1.3. *slaps forehead*
<slamb> I upgraded the RPM and didn't even think about it.
<jamest> lol
<slamb> wow, I'm stupid.
<chillywilly> doh!
<slamb> *red face*
<slamb> Hmm. Amazingly enough, I don't think that's the problem.
<slamb> Downgrading to the original 7.1.3 rpms I linked against and it still doesn't work.
<chillywilly> g'night
chillywilly (danielb@d144.as26.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) left irc: "night"
<slamb> hmm. and recompile against that for good measure, still doesn't work.
<slamb> conclusion: it doesn't like me. *shrug*
<jamest> :(
<jamest> i don't get it
<jamest> as it's working perfectly for me
<slamb> hmm. well, I really appreciate all your time looking.
<slamb> seems like it must be something weird about my computer.
<jamest> but psycopg works?
<slamb> yeah
<jamest> sigh
