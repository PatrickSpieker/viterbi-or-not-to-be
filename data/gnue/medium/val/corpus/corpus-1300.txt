<reinhard> i would say
<reinhard> the little hobbit
<reinhard> or the silmarillion
<reinhard> the little hobbit is softcore tolkien
<reinhard> the silmarillion is pure hardcore so to speak
<reinhard> :)
<ra3vat> then i choose the silmarillion
<ra3vat> reinhard: thanks
<dneighbo> actually i think hobbit is only tolkien that is actually worth anything
<dneighbo> from literary sense
<dneighbo> for the most part i think his works are rather lacking, not sure i see the 'appeal' in book form
<dneighbo> only way i made it through his works was on premise people said they were great, so i kept reading hoping to find the 'greatness'
<dneighbo> dont get me wrong they are not horrible or even 'bad'
<dneighbo> but they are FAR from books that you 'cant put down''
<dneighbo> but maybe i am spoiled 
<jcater> tomorrow's slashdot headline "free software advocate says Tolkien 'bad'"
<jcater> dneighbo: can you think of some polls for our homepage?
<jcater> the current one is a little outdated
<ra3vat> :)
<jcater> perhaps, "
<jcater> some object vs relational vs flatfile database usage poll?
<jcater> or, what is your preferred DB backend?
Action: jcater is just shooting out ideas here
<jcater> or, what sector do you think free software solutions will grow quickest in (Education, Government, Non-profit, Commercial)
<jcater> any other ideas, anyone?
<dneighbo> jcater i like db backend one
<jcater> or, "what fish is best for slapping chillywilly around with?"
<jcater> and provide, trout, whale, crappie, pirranha
<dneighbo> what database do you currently use the most?
<dneighbo>   - MSSQL
<dneighbo>   - MySQL
<dneighbo>   - Interbase
<dneighbo>   - SAP DB
<dneighbo>   - Postgres
<dneighbo>   - Oracle
<dneighbo>   - Informix
<dneighbo>   - DB2
<dneighbo>   - others you can think of
<jcater> I would qualify that with "for your business processes" or "business data", etc
<dneighbo>   - Object Based
<dneighbo>   - None
<dneighbo>   - Other
<dneighbo> hmmm i had that then removed it
<jcater> as a backend for a dynamic website is irrelevent to us, imho
<dneighbo> but maybe that would be good to ask
<dneighbo> also i had
<dneighbo> do you PLAN to use with gnue
<jcater> hmm
Action: jcater is wondering if we should do a "business size" poll to get a feel for the class of enterprises mostly viewing our web page
<jcater> Home-based business
<jcater> < 20 employees
<jcater> 21-100 employees
<jcater> etc
<jcater> or something to that effect
<jcater> maybe that can wait until after the DB question

<dtm> i'm currently thinking of making criteria for the act of granting a portal site to each major small group
<dtm> and giving them a themed phpnuke/phpgw type deployment off of crosswindschurch.org/...
<dtm> they all need calendars, mailing lists, some news posting, and maybe some discussino

<dneighbo> tell me why oh why do i EVER try #debian for help
<dneighbo> anyone here know ANYTHING about http_proxy variable
<dneighbo> or about using debian's apt with a proxy?
Action: drochaid apologises for knowing nothing
<dneighbo> anyone know how to url encode a \
<drochaid> uhm ...
<jcater> um
<jcater> I do
<jcater> $ http_proxy=http://thumper:3128/ apt-get update
<jcater> (my machine is thumper w/squid running on port 3128)
<jcater> s/my machine/my proxy machine/
<dneighbo> o
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> it gets better than that :)
<dneighbo> i USED to use:
<dneighbo> http://proxy.maricopa.gov:8080
<dneighbo> then yesterday they switched to AUTHENTICATING proxy (NT Authentication)
<dneighbo> i have found that they did so ONLY for port 80
<dneighbo> i was worried i would be screwed as its NT auth
<dneighbo> HOWEVER i found a trick
<dneighbo> if you prefix your name by a valid domain it 'psyches' out NT
<dneighbo> in galeon/mozilla i put
<dneighbo> user name
<dneighbo> itatc\dneighbo
<dneighbo> password
<dneighbo> mypassword
<dneighbo> and it works
<dneighbo> as itatc is the domain im using (nt domain)
<dneighbo> however 
<dneighbo> http://itatc\domain:mypass@proxy.maricopa.gov:8080 doesnt work
<dneighbo> i used \\ to get the 
<dneighbo>  \ to show up at all
<dneighbo> so then i just tried to urlencode and no dice
<dneighbo> HOWEVER if i dont set username password
<dneighbo> lynx will 'prompt' me like galeon did
<dneighbo> and if i enter it by hand it works
<dneighbo> this would be ok by me but debian dont ask :)
<dneighbo> it just fails
<dneighbo> anyone have 'ideas' ?
<dneighbo> btw: i could probably go and cry and get them to bypass this for me
<dneighbo> BUT it comes with a SEVERE price
<dneighbo> they would classify it as a DEFICIENCY in linux
<jcater> try %5C
<dneighbo> never mind its their damn program that is causing the problems
<dneighbo> um i tried %5c
<jcater> ouch
<dneighbo> is there a diff between lower and upper case c in that?
Action: jcater will shut up then
<dneighbo> i.e. i assumed that was urlencode for \
<jcater> not to my knowledge
<dneighbo> yee haw its working its working
<jcater> what did you do?
<dneighbo> export http_proxy=http://itatc\\dneighbo:mypass@proxy.mydomain.gov:8080
<dneighbo> owrks
<dneighbo> it DOES NOT work for lynx
<dneighbo> but it does for apt
<dneighbo> i was dumb and doing my testing on lynx
<dneighbo> lynx bitches about invalid header stuff 
<dneighbo> and then prompts for username and password

<ajmitch> HI DTM!!
<dtm> ajmitch+++
Action: dtm increments ajmitch _several_ times over.
<dtm> jcater: wow, you just spontaneously eliminated all SCO OS's in favor of ibcs?
<dtm> jcater: that's pretty freaky
<dtm> i had a roommate in about 1997 who did ibcs with the SCO binary of the Powerchute UPS daemon
<jcater> dtm: it was a single SCO box
<jcater> and running old Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports binaries
<jcater> at one point, we had the complete Oracle RDBMS server on it
<jcater> but that got moved to a Solaris box a few years back
<jcater> unfortunately, Oracle desupported our set of tools
<jcater> so I've desparately hung on to the SCO version of those tools
<jcater> eventually, GNUe will replace that setup completely
<jcater> but that'll take a complete rewrite of our production system
<Isomer> :)
<jcater> I also had the problem of: we had a set number of "login" licenses to SCO
<jcater> well, we maxed out those licenses a few months back
<jcater> and are getting ready to add more people
<dtm> wow
<jcater> but, SCO is out of business
<dtm> hehe poor guys
<jcater> well, Caldera bought them
<jcater> but then discontinued the line
<dtm> same thing
<jcater> so I was caught between a rock and a hard spot
<jcater> until I got this working
<dtm> they're opensourcing the PDP unix code  heheh
<dtm> jcater: wow
<dtm> jcater: so your only license restriction was on the OS itself, eh?
<jcater> I'm fine as long as Debian doesn't limit the number of logins :)
<dtm> HAHAH!)@$
<dtm> so this ibcs setup is stable, huh?
<jcater> afaik, yes
<jcater> we've had those Oracle tools for so long that we were actually able to buy an "unlimited site license" 
<jcater> you can't do that nowadays!
<dtm> heheh
<dtm> cool
<dtm> and they're not obsolete, eh?  still making the same use of it, huh?
<jcater> I won't go into depth wrt that, but
<dtm> HEh
<jcater> Oracle went GUI only after this set of tools
<jcater> and I had a hundred or so Wyse 60's
<dtm> yeah there's a trend for that in enterprise tools, isn't there
<dtm> like Veritas vxfs tools
<jcater> yes, and it sucks
<dtm> and i've heard that in the case of vxfs the cli is far superior
<dtm> and that the GUI is not only ugly but very confusing and unintuitive
<dtm> Motif or something of course
