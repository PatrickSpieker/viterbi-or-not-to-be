Keith_jgrs (jorgre@63.74.24.9) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Keith_jgrs> is GNUe Reports better than Reportlab?
<jbailey> Probably not.  What's a reportlab? =)
<jamest> GNUe Reports is better than everything
<jamest> yeah!
<Keith_jgrs> :D
<Keith_jgrs> http://www.reportlab.com/toolkit/index.html
<Keith_jgrs> A library for PDF reports
<jcater> reportlab is a PDF library mostly
<jcater> not really a reporting application
<jcater> it is the pdf library for their non-free reporting tool
<jcater> gnue reports will most likely use that pdf library, as a matter of fact
<Keith_jgrs> seems very mature
<jcater> at least, initially
<jbailey> jcater: For generating PDFs?
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> that's what it is
<jcater> a PDF abstraction library
<jcater> the actual "ReportLab" reporting product is non-free
<Keith_jgrs> hmm yeah
<jcater> but the GPL'd pdf toolkit is very nice
<jcater> at least, iirc it's gpl
<Keith_jgrs> which one?
<jcater> the reportlab pdf toolkit is free
<jcater> the reportlab reporting tool is not
<jcater> but the pdf toolkit is very good, from what I gather
<jbailey> Failing that, use whatever gnome uses.
<Keith_jgrs> yeah i see
<jbailey> libgnomeprint generates PDFs.
<jamest> libgnomeprint requires gnome libs
<jcater> my first goal will to output very robust postscript
<jcater> from there many things could be generated via 3rd party stuff
<jbailey> jamest: I thought they were trying to limit how much gnome libs each component needs.
<jamest> they may now
<jamest> it's been a few years
<jbailey> And libgnomeprint is likely to get win32'd soon, IIRC.
<Keith_jgrs> hmmm
<Keith_jgrs> so you'd choose it over reportlab's ?
<jamest> i'd choose whichever gave me the greatest portability
<jcater> and works well within python
<Keith_jgrs> course
<jamest> (of course :)
<Keith_jgrs> any plans to output reports in MS Word or Ms Excel?
<Keith_jgrs> or RTF
<jcater> well, the way reports is structured, there's no reason we can't have a "gnomeprint" printer driver
<jcater> Keith_jgrs: absolutely
<jcater> well, likely RTF insteado f DOC, but definitely
<jcater> s/insteado f/instead of/
<Keith_jgrs> yeah, something editable

<jbailey> My 60gb is 2gb for nt2k, 1gb swap, 1gb * 10 for Hurd, everything else in one big ext2 for GNU/Linux
<chillywilly> making partitions helps in backing things up imho

Action: chillywilly prefers xfs file system
<jbailey> Vee2d2: It's a mistype, sorry.
<Vee2d2> sure, but the migration to ext3 is much easier, chillywilly
<ajmitch> chillywilly: didn't you get major toastage with xfs one time? :)

<ajmitch> ugh
<ajmitch> chillywilly: your laptop?
<chillywilly> toastage?

<chillywilly> I am curious
<chillywilly> cause for me I don't get any real icons
<lex> exactly
<jbailey> nautilus is fine for me.
<lex> jbailey: what version?
<jbailey> to get the icons, you have to install a the icons theme.
<jbailey> ii  nautilus       2.2.0.2-1      File manager and graphical shell (GNOME2)
<ajmitch> hey people, what sort of capabilities does GNUe reports have? can it do graphs & the like?
<jcater> not yet
<ajmitch> ok, are there plans/ideas for doing so?
<jcater> yes
<ajmitch> excellent
Action: ajmitch had someone asking about it, and it's something i'd like too :)
<lex> Ive an icons theme....the snow apple theme.....and it still doesnt run....can you do me a favor and check what the /gnome/interfaces/icon_theme field in your gconf-editor says?
<jcater> my brain dump is in gnue/reports/doc/report-notes.txt
<ajmitch> k
<chillywilly> I have icon themes
<jcater> but note that's my notepad
<chillywilly> still no real icons
<jcater> so may or may not make complete sense :)
<jbailey> chillywilly: Which package?
<jbailey> and what version?
<chillywilly> but I haven't ran Gnome is a while so I don't care
<jbailey> Ah, I like gnome.
<chillywilly> in fact I am thinking of ripping it out to save some space
<lex> I like gnome..... jbailey ive the ICON-SnowApple theme 
<chillywilly> jbailey: the gnome from debian sid
<ajmitch> jcater: it makes a little bit of sense :)
Action: jamest blinks
<jbailey> Dunno.  When I loaded gnome-icon-theme it all started working fine.
<jamest> chillywilly?  without gnome?
<lex> Cant get gnome-theme-manager to work either
<ajmitch> jamest: want some pills for that  heart condition? :)
<chillywilly> apt-hey install gnome-icon-theme?
<lex> AHA
<chillywilly> well I'd like to have both installed...just because I like to change based on my mood :P
<lex> I wish apt was smarter than that....its a brand new package
<chillywilly> but nautilus is b0rked
<chillywilly> so I don't want to look at it
<lex> IT WORKS NOW

<chillywilly> what package did you install?

<chillywilly> aaah, Gnome
<chillywilly> I did miss her a little bit
<chillywilly> it just seems nautils is misson some config stuff
<chillywilly> missing
<chillywilly> like how the hell do I turn make my home dir as my desktop off...I can't find anything to change it back
<jbailey> Hmm  Looks like that's one of the preferences they took away.  Probably have to touch it in gconf.
<chillywilly> why
<jbailey> Or just rm the .nautilus files
<chillywilly> why did they do that?
<jbailey> Because having preferences like that is a bad UI.
<chillywilly> that's fsking annoying
<jbailey> Your grandmother shouldn't ever see that option.
<chillywilly> gah
<jbailey> You, me, and other geeks can fire up gconf and tweak to our hearts content.
<chillywilly> see that's fsjcing rediculous
<jbailey> So they accomidate both.
<jbailey> It's not at all.
<chillywilly> piss on that
<chillywilly> I want to be able to cusomtize like a mofo
<jbailey> I find that where I install gnome, people take to it *faster* than they take to win32.
<jbailey> then do it.
<jbailey> Use gconf.
<jbailey> It's designed for you.
<chillywilly> using gconf is not frelling an easy thing
<jbailey> Have you actually tried recently?
<chillywilly> the gui editor or the command line thing?
<jbailey> It's nice.  No more hunting through which application to change a setting in.  It's all there.
<jamest> they target gconf at unstable people w/ trout fetishes?
Action: jamest is glad he's using kde
<jbailey> gui
<chillywilly> whatever man kde has nothing up on Gnome...except maybe it is a little less resource intensive although if I can find the option to change the way nautilus draws the desktop (to the less resource intensive way) then that will solve my big gripe with it
<jbailey> I haven't tried kde it a year, but I found it more resource intesive than gnome.
<chillywilly> kde makes it easy to find shit though
<chillywilly> well jbailey  that is false
Action: ajmitch yawns
<jbailey> On my P3 750mhz it was slow.
<chillywilly> I hate the way meta city delays in minimizing windows
<jbailey> chillywilly: Take a logic class.  Anecdotal evidence can never be false.
<chillywilly> 3.x?
<chillywilly> wtf?
<jbailey> It's an impression.  A person's perception of the world is always correct from their point of view.
<chillywilly> I think it's probably faster cause of gcc 3.2.x
<jcater> true dat
<jcater> consider another example of anecdotal evidence....
<jcater> I had 30 ppl on a dual 450Mhz running KDE 3.0
<jcater> with nar a complaint
<jcater> but we both are right :)
<chillywilly> well my impression has been the ther way around witha machine that has less then what you used
<chillywilly> less resources
<jbailey> jcater: Wow.  30 people on a dual 450 is impressive on its own. =)

<dsmith> We use openoffice all the time.

<revDeke> jbailey: i do read logs (sorry for not popping in yesterday)
<revDeke> getting pimpslapped at work hard past week and shows no signs of letting up
<revDeke> i have not tested, but have barely had time to read email much less do something usefull :(
<revDeke> i have a board meeting for local non profit tonight and when i get home i will try to take a look see
Suit (~alala@zeilers.demon.nl) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> mr Jagrs: i use .rtf file creation daily in production with GNUe Reports (a version from 05/2002 even)
<revDeke> jcater / jamest i agree 100% at this time libgnomeprint is not path of least resistance
<revDeke> .ps file is probably best bet
<revDeke> and looking at reportlab might be a good thing a bit later
<revDeke> project coming up has me needing to abuse reports so jcater better start shuddering now :)
<revDeke> hi Suit 
<Suit> evenin
<revDeke> btw: nautilus is evil
<ajmitch> yeah, i need to have a simple way of getting repots up
<revDeke> everytime i upgrade all of sid is breaks in a horrid way
<revDeke> when i log into gnome again
<revDeke> it starts like a million instances of nautilus
<revDeke> no matter what i do
<jcater> revDeke: what's they joke?
<revDeke> i have to pump out to the vt
<jcater> "Hey, Doctor, everytime I do xxxxx, it hurts"
<revDeke> and killall nautilus
<jcater> "Doctor: Well, don't do xxx then!"
<revDeke> then uninstall nautilus
<revDeke> jcater: the sick thing
<revDeke> i i keep uninstalling the fscking thing
<revDeke> i dont use it
<revDeke> but when i do an upgrade
<revDeke> some damn gnome package thinks it needs it
<revDeke> and installs it again
Action: revDeke is almost ready to ditch gnome again
Action: revDeke ditched it completely for about a year and went to fluxbox
<revDeke> but wifey was using gnome and liked it
<revDeke> so i started using again to test gnome2 before upgrading her
<Vee2d2> it's a love/hate relationship right now.. =)
<revDeke> now that kde 3.1 is out maybe i will change to that
<revDeke> and if i get it comfy i will change her
<revDeke> the problem is we use no kde apps
<revDeke> she liked the desktop
<Vee2d2> I swear if gnome-terminal dies on me one more time I just might try kde again just to spite it.. =/
<revDeke> but hated that there was no integration :(
<revDeke> to all the gnome apps
<jcater> revDeke: one word
<jcater> Geramil
<jcater> err
<jcater> Geramik
<jcater> w/KDE 3.1
<revDeke> what is geramik?
<jcater> gnome and kde apps look identical
<revDeke> its not a look thing
<Vee2d2> identical, meaning everything looks gnomeish?
<jcater> lol
<jcater> no, seriously
<jcater> it's pretty
<jcater> like kde
<revDeke> for example if she konq and tried to drag a picture into evolution it wont work
<jcater> ah, yeah
<revDeke> but if she uses nautilus and evolution it does
<revDeke> those are the kind of things that kill it integration wise for her
dyfet (~dyfet@pool-141-153-147-83.mad.east.verizon.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> i would switch her to kmail, BUT
<revDeke> she has been going on evolution for a year or so now and not complaining
<revDeke> and well
<revDeke> you married guys can understand a "leave a good thing alone" 
<Suit> Even unmarried ones do
Action: Suit goes nback lurking
<revDeke> dyfet: saw your email
<revDeke> im freaking on tony 
<revDeke> has he gone insane?
<dyfet> lol that was quick
<revDeke> what the heck is up with him inviting M$ to talk on "shared source" at an "Open Source" convention?
<revDeke> its one thing for m$ to be paid exhibitor at a linux event
<revDeke> but its another to invite them to speak at a conference in which they have no products fitting the bill
<dyfet> Does OSI hold a valid trademark on the term?  I heard not, so I suppose anything could call itself "Open Source"
<revDeke> no
<revDeke> i wish they did
<ajmitch> hi dyfet
<revDeke> btw: this is why rms is right and OSI is wrong
<ajmitch> what's up?
<revDeke> open source is all well and good, but it leaves huge gap
<revDeke> as i can get SAP source code for R/3 if i have enough money
<revDeke> but it doesnt meet any of the freedoms
<dyfet> I had that discussion in brief with Don Marti at LW in regards to the awarding of an "Open Source excellance award" to Microsoft...
<revDeke> of free software
<dyfet> (in regard to trademark and use of the term "Open Source")
Action: ajmitch is guessing this is about mr stanco - i saw an invitation on the FD list to an conference thing
<revDeke> dyfet: i guess my piss and moan is linuxworld is a commerical event
<revDeke> driven by dollars and cents
<ajmitch> i could be wrong :)
<revDeke> so i EXPECT them to cave to people with cash
<revDeke> BUT
<revDeke> and i repeat BUT
<revDeke> eGovOS should not have ANY dollar and cents motivation
<revDeke> furthermore Tony Stanco is the chair
<revDeke> he at one point claimed to be a free software champion and tried to do Free Developers
<revDeke> even employing the help of dyfet and rms
<revDeke> so im utterly shocked by this
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> i was involved with FD remember
<revDeke> i.e. they can do what they like
<dyfet> Tony has a conference that is also cheap with speakers...I guess they offered to pay for theirs :)
<revDeke> i just want to be on record i called a rat a rat 3 years ago :)
<revDeke> or however long ago the FD stuff was
<ajmitch> can you believe he actually mailed the FD list to invite FreeDevelopers people along? :)
Action: revDeke hates to admit that
Action: jbailey is back (gone 00:38:00)
<ajmitch> wb jeff
<revDeke> anyhow thats my rant for the day... must get back to less important things
<ajmitch> heh

<reinhard> eh
<Chipaca> hi all
<reinhard> what about now?
<reinhard> :)
<chillywilly> whatcha talkin' about?
<jcater> reinhard: has any progress been made on what the actual business object "definitions" are going to look like?
<chillywilly> k, well I have to go get food and a new HD and stuff like that
Mr_You (~rouzer@gso167-138-145.triad.rr.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<chillywilly> there's this neat xml markup that this one guy made...
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<reinhard> jcater: we have very much decided to have those "definitions" in the database
<reinhard> for various reasons
<jcater> is a schema in place for those?
<reinhard> this is just what i am currently working on
<reinhard> s/am/would be if i had time/
<reinhard> currently i'm planning to have it quite simple in the start and to grow it as we see what we need
<jcater> ok
<reinhard> but as you might have noticed siesel hasn't been seen for quite a long time here
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> where is he?
<reinhard> so i'm acutally lacking contradiction
<ajmitch> busy with family? busy with work?
<reinhard> well at least constructive contradiction
<reinhard> ;-)
<reinhard> i think quite busy with work
<ajmitch> ok
<reinhard> probably and/or study
<Suit> But how do you see these objects, are they SQL statements? Or code? (/me is a bit new at (implementing) such concepts)
<reinhard> think of a simple database table
<reinhard> then add some "calculated fields"
<reinhard> that are accessible as if they were stored in the database but calculated by a given formula
<reinhard> then further add some "methods" that is code to operate on the data
<reinhard> the combination of those 3 we call a "business object"
<jcater> reinhard: have y'all done any coding on these "calculated fields" ??
<reinhard> not yet
<jcater> as I'm doing a "formula" class for reports
<jcater> that I'm putting in common
<reinhard> unfortunately we've been very slow
<reinhard> um
<jcater> that sounds exactly the same
<reinhard> in that case s/unfortunately/fortunately/ :-)

<reinhard> sounds good
<Suit> Ok, thanks for the insight into (future) functionality. Gonna quit since I am on dial-up for another few weeks
<reinhard> you're welcome
<Chipaca> do you think these business objects can be purely virtual?
Suit (~alala@zeilers.demon.nl) left irc: "gone"
<Chipaca> I mean
<Chipaca> err
<Chipaca> something like a view
<reinhard> we have discussed such a thing
<reinhard> but we aren't sure yet how exactly to do it
<reinhard> we want different "views" on the same objects depending on permissions

<Hugues> Is someone can give me information about your project ?
<Hugues> For example : Is there already customers who use the financials package ?
<Hugues> I tried to install something, but no works correctly !...
<Hugues> Is it possible, I am alone in this channel ?
<Hugues> I see many nicknames, but it's possible all are robots
<Hugues> Bye, bye everybody

<Hugues> Hello chillywilly
<Hugues> Is possible you give me informations about this projetc ?
<chillywilly> yea, sure
<chillywilly> have you read the web site? what do you want to know?
<Hugues> For example : Is there already customers who use the financials package ?
<chillywilly> the financials package does not exist currently
<chillywilly> mainly the tools exist
<chillywilly> and this has beent he current focus
<Hugues> OK, it's only a project
<chillywilly> we have started a new project though and other companies are looking to contribute to that -> http://sv.gnu.org/projects/gnue-sb/
<chillywilly> only contact management stuff there
<chillywilly> in cvs
<chillywilly> not much else
<Hugues> I search a new financial software
<chillywilly> sorry, we don't have a "solution" for you right now
<Hugues> Excuse me for my bad english
<Hugues> but I am french
<chillywilly> unless you want to contribute to GNUe Small Busines :)
<chillywilly> no one would object...we do have a nice development environment, IMHO
<chillywilly> but no shrink wrapped solutions
<chillywilly> *yet*
<Hugues> The problem is to develop accountig programs is long
<chillywilly> well yea
<chillywilly> that seems to be the problem with most things in life
<chillywilly> not enough time ;)
<Hugues> Yes
<Hugues> For the moment I'm a resseller of  an accounting software
<chillywilly> ok
<Hugues> But this soft is not complete
<Hugues> This soft is too expensive for our customers
<chillywilly> you were hoping to resell gnue financials?
<Hugues> Not ressell a gnu software !
<Hugues> But ressell prestations of installation of a software
<chillywilly> ?
<chillywilly> you can sell gnu software
<Hugues> Yes ?
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> you have that freedom
<Hugues> It's not what I want
<chillywilly> it is probably better to sell support contracts or warranties
<Hugues> The problem is for the moment my customers are not reach
<jamest> Huges: is the current software database based?
<Hugues> No jamest, Indexed files
<chillywilly> :-o
<Hugues> It's one of the reasons I want to change software
<Hugues> I hope a free software
<Hugues> I hope just sell installation of the software
<chillywilly> I see
<chillywilly> one time installation and setup fee?
<Hugues> installation and contracts of maintenance
<Hugues> My customers have not programmers
<Hugues> Have you a date for the end of the developpment of financials package ?
<Hugues> I have tried to install your tools in my Mandrake 8.1, but nothing work correctly
<chillywilly> sorry, we have no such hard "dates" this is a Free software project
<chillywilly> ummm
<chillywilly> we can help you with that
<Hugues> I want to know if you are at the begining or near the end ?
<chillywilly> as far as the tools development goes?
<Hugues> Sorry, but it's time I come back home
<Hugues> But I'll come back in this channel an other time
<chillywilly> ok
<Hugues> In France it's 08:25 PM
<chillywilly> heh, long day at the office?

<ajmitch> hi psu
<psu> good morning ajmitch
<jcater> howdy psu
<jcater> lots of activity on the mailing lists
<jcater> nothing like a good flame war to start a day off
<ajmitch> hehe, nice & tasty
<jcater> and I didn't even have to start this one!
<ajmitch> i bet i could add some fuel if i wsa tempted... :)
<psu> heh
<psu> looks as if it's crossposted 
<psu> not sure if that means I should cover it at all
<psu> as people posting may not be aware they are liable to KC-quoting ;-)
<jamest> there was mail today?
<psu> well, let's just say that 
<psu> although I usually have 50+ mails in that mailbox daily 
<psu> they usually have the words "sex", "viagra" or "Nigeria" in them somewhere
<jcater> dang, psu
<jcater> what kind of alternative lifestyle you into?
<jbailey> jcater: You might be kind and at least disable channel logging before asking that.
<ajmitch> heheh
<jamest> seriously
<jamest> mail today on what list?
<psu> jcater: I follow #gnuenterprise. Isn't that "alternative" enough?
<jcater> true dat
<jcater> jamest: gnue@gnu.org
<jcater> only one today
<jcater> but lots yesterday
<jcater> 25 or so
<jbailey> chillywilly: You giving up on swearwordS?
<chillywilly> I try not to say them as they are bad, imho
<jbailey> 'bad'?
<jcater> jbailey: they do bad things
<chillywilly> little ears are keen
<chillywilly> they pick it all up
<ajmitch> yeah
<jbailey> jcater: Hmm.  My cat does bad things.  It woke me up by throwing up in the livingroom this morning.
<ajmitch> don't want little chillywilly to have a potty mouth :)
<chillywilly> gah
<jbailey> swearing seemed mild in comparison.
<jbailey> expected, even.
<jcater> jbailey: better than throwing up on you to wake you up
<jbailey> jcater: No, the cats have generally learned to throw up only on the hardwood.
<jcater> lovely
<jcater> dude
<jcater> see what forcing them onto a vegan diet does?
<jcater> now think about your body
<chillywilly> rofl
Action: jcater hides
<jbailey> They're not vegan yet. =)
<jbailey> But I thought about it again this morning.
<jbailey> It's *got* to smell better than vommited bird.
<chillywilly> oh
<jbailey> and whatever "animal byproducts" means.
<ajmitch> hehe
<jbailey> entrails.
<jbailey> lips & assholes. =)
<jcater> lol
<chillywilly> what do you think a wild cat would eat jeff?
<jcater> reminds me of Water Boy
<chillywilly> grass?
<jbailey> lips & assholes? =)
<jcater> "We be having lizard"
<jcater> ...
<jcater> err, "Snake"
<jcater> "What part of the snake am I eating"
<jcater> "Well, you see... snakes don't have parts... but if they did, I suppose you'd be eating the knee"
<chillywilly> one of my cats likes to catch mice
<jbailey> jcater: Is waterboy a good movie?
<chillywilly> it's pretty funny
<jbailey> I've avoided it because I tend to dislike Adam Sandler's acting.
<chillywilly> "that is the devil!"
<jbailey> errr.
<jbailey> "acting"
<jcater> I find it quite funny
<jcater> esp. for Adam Sandler
<jcater> generally, I think his humor is dumb
<jbailey> Huh, maybe I'll give it a try.
<jbailey> I inflicted Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure on Angie a couple nights ago.  She had never seen it.
<jbailey> She said high school makes so much more sense now.
<chillywilly> heh
<jcater> Kathy Bates was awesome in her comedic role in Waterboy
<chillywilly> I highly enjoyed the bombastic nature of hte film, it was exhilirating
Action: chillywilly falls over
<chillywilly> those big words get heavy
Action: chillywilly smacks jcater about with a large crappie
<jbailey> I'm trying to figure out what bombastic means.
<jbailey> dict's definition is not useful
<jcater> pretentiously overinflated language
<jcater> example use:
<jcater> chillywilly's bombastic description of the Waterboy left much to be desired

<Vee2d2> not running debian, I guess?

<psu> btami: it's a "known bug"
<psu> basically, the web site is currently a bit of a hybrid
<psu> most of it is generated from some nifty python scripts that generate static html
<psu> but the downloads pages are still using php as the code to do the file listings in python is currently in "pre-alpha"
<psu> (i.e. doesn't work)
<psu> the <? tabs () > is a tag for the python which php can't grok
<psu> I have taken an executive decision that this is less of a problem than having a broken downloads listing ;-)
<psu> I probably won't have time to fix it this weekend, as I have the chuch year end accounts to get finished
<psu> If anyone has nothing better to do, and can stand the sight of my baby-python coding style
<psu> you could always send me a patch
<psu> it's the def filelist (directory) function that's b()rked

<psu> BTW, I don't think we've had a gratitous rant about how good python is for a while, so here goes
<psu> I found doing the site in python so much easier than with php
<psu> What the man said about python being "the most powerful computer language you can still read" is spot on
<psu> And bear in mind that php is actually designed as a web apps lang, unlike python
<psu> (I know I could/should have used Zope, but that would have involved persuading FSF to install Zope on www.gnu.org
<psu> which they probably would have done, but we would have been stuck maintaining it)
<psu> Of course, I guess "GNU Enterprise supporter says python is great" is up there with other non-stories like
<psu> "Pope condemns sin" or "Trouble in Middle East"
<psu> or "chillywilly seen with trout"

<ajmitch> and in cvs, there are a few
<ajmitch> right
<ekeko> how can i to get some example?
<ekeko> every i do is one row form
<ajmitch> yes, you are using designer to build these forms?

<ajmitch> in the block properties, there's a 'rows' attribute, iirc
<ekeko> where is this documented?, or not?
<ajmitch> there's the forms developer's guide
<ekeko> i read a very incomplete document from www.gnue.org
<ajmitch> are you using forms & designer 0.4.3?
<ekeko> 0.4.1

<ekeko> 2002/11
<ajmitch> ok, debian packages i guess

<Vee2d2> I'm not familiar with the RPMs.. but there should be some samples you can play with

<Vee2d2> I've been lost the last week or so trying to recover from a dead hard drive
<kac> ouch!
dsmith (dsmith@oh-strongsvillecadent1-1c-203.clvhoh.adelphia.net) left irc: "later.."
<Vee2d2> anyhow, I know if you were to grab the tarballs there should be sample directories contained within with some example forms and such to play with.. I would imagine they would be installed somewhere by the RPM, in debian they'd probably end up somewhere in /usr/share/doc/gnue*/examples
<Vee2d2> the forms will have extension of .gfd and you can run them with the forms client, gnue-forms.. some of the examples may require a db, though I'm not completely sure of that. 
<kac> hmm - needs mxDateTime ...
<kac> how do i find what version of python i have installed?
<kac> ok - im on V2.2.1
<Vee2d2> python 
<Vee2d2> python -V actually
<kac> Error: no forms definition file specified ...
<kac> im looking for one ...
<Vee2d2> it's been a long time since I've used rpm, isnt there a way to list the package contents?
<Vee2d2> might grep such a command for samples.. or .gfd
<Vee2d2> to see where they might be
<kac> im a linux newbie so please have patience ... im looking for *.gfd right? (apologies for Window$ terminology)
<kac> some of the stuff installs to /usr/gnue
<kac> found some ... in "/usr/share/doc/GNUe-Samples-0.4.0/...
<Vee2d2> there ya go
<kac> hmm...
<Vee2d2> that's what you're looking for
<kac> does this need a database running?
<kac> there seems to be a script to set up PostgreSQL...
<Vee2d2> might, might not.. I dont recall.. 
<Vee2d2> I had a mysql db running when I first played with it so I used that.. 
<Vee2d2> postgres seems to be the db of choice at the moment
<kac> WHOA - back to old DOS-look-alike screens ...
<kac> i tried the helloworld sample "gnue-forms helloworld2.gfd" and i got a screen asking for name & address
<Vee2d2> =)
<kac> no GUI stuff here - atually i'm not sure that's a drawback ...
<Vee2d2> it depends on which client ya use
<kac> there's a GUI client then?
<kac> my GOD this need more user docs ... maybe I could volunteer for some of the work, if the project guys don't mind having dorks around them ...
<Vee2d2> right now, I think there's a text client, and gui client done with wxpython, a gtk2 client is in the works but I havent seen it, and I think a native windows client is also in the works but I maybe mistaken.. 
<kac> wxpython? ... mmmm ....
<Vee2d2> a qt client is also planned in the not so distant future
<Vee2d2> have you loaded designer yet?
<Vee2d2> there's some docs, but they're incomplete.. 
<kac> I actually had the wxPython RPM running around and i've installed that...
<kac> now what do i do to fire that up?
<Vee2d2> gnue-designer
<kac> ok 1 sec
<Vee2d2> the one in cvs looks a lot spiffier.. 
<kac> YAY - actually this keeps getting better ...
<kac> hmm ...
<kac> now the ugly question ...
<kac> I've never used CVS :( ...
<Vee2d2> it's not too painful
<Vee2d2> do you have it installed?
<kac> yeah ...
<kac> i've tried mucking around but no mojo ...
<Vee2d2> actually, I dont know if I should suggest cvs.. =)
<kac> hmm ... maybe I sould shate my intentions ...
<Vee2d2> I'm but a gnue-newbie myself, btw. 
<kac> <shake> then
<kac> you actually use it to any extent?
<Vee2d2> well.. I first bumped into the project a year or two ago.. but was too tied up with other things to really spend much time, and it really looked like things were still much in the planning stages anyway. recently I checked it out again and found they had these neat tools to play with and so I spent a couple days reading as much as I could (the web docs, kernel cousins (<-real good reads), etc..) then played with the samples and stuf
<kac> i tried to fire up gnue-appserver but no dice ...

<kac> and I had just finished installing the latest RPM for XML-RPC ...
<Vee2d2> I have a small embroidery business and have made a couple attempts to make systems using php, but they've ended up being 'clunky' and hard to maintain.. I was about half way through my latest attempt when I decided to redo it, in a more gnue friendly manner..
<Vee2d2> so before my drive crashed, I was working on an inventory management system.. luckily I think I was able to recover that work from the dead drive
<Vee2d2> I havent played with appserver at all
<Vee2d2> just forms
<ddttmm> hi guys
<kac> hi
<Vee2d2> heya ddttmm
<ddttmm> kac: xmlrpc for what?
<kac> i tried to fire up gnue-appserver...
<Vee2d2> what drew your interest into gnue, kac?
<kac> good question
<kac> like this...
<kac> I'm involved with a small but growing company that needs some integrated software to handle its affairs...
<kac> and commercial apps either do too little or too much or at too much cost or with giving you escape routes ...
<kac> err without ...
<Vee2d2> hear that
<kac> so I started looking at linux as a desktop replacement (RedHat specifically)
<kac> desktop-wise it's all ok ...
<kac> e-mail client, which we are mega-dependent on is FINE with evolution ...
<kac> now we lack an accounting package and a repair-job-logging system - and they need to be integrated ...
<kac> and if a local coding enterprise is going to take forever to do it & keep it for himself, it's more sensible to look around and use what's publically avaliable...
<kac> or assist in changing some of that and allowing others to use / reuse / contribute ...
<kac> (sorry for ranting on...)
<kac> the rest sould be obvious
<Vee2d2> sounds like a good fit to me
<kac> comments ddttmm ?
<kac> the only coding environment I can seem to get to grips with is the Anjuta/Glade combination, but i'm willing to try my hand at anything if it will help ...
<ddttmm> hmm
<ddttmm> kac: so you say a "repair job logging" system... are you talking about ticketing and helpdesk type stuff?
<ddttmm> coz if so, then you need http://dcl.sf.net
<ddttmm> which is part of gnue
<ddttmm> part of the metaproject
<kac> hmmm
<kac> we repair photopiers ...
<kac> our own and our clients
<kac> so I need to log jobs, send out guys to fix, and bill clients based on time and parts consumed ...
<kac> gimme 30 secs so I can give my toddler some milk ...
<Vee2d2> mine are both sleeping.. *sigh*
<kac> where are you in the world?
<Vee2d2> hopefully for another 5 or 6 hours too.. =)
<Vee2d2> Fort Worth, Texas here.. 
<Vee2d2> you?
<kac> Malta here - and its 8am ...
<Vee2d2> 1am here
<kac> hehe - 7hrs time gap
<Vee2d2> people all over the world here.. =)
<ddttmm> kac: hehe i'm in Mountain View, CA
<ddttmm> california
<ddttmm> kac: yeah so it sounds like you need DCL
<kac> im looking at the demo as we speak (talk? type? chat? - boq!) ...
<ddttmm> hehe
<ddttmm> the demo is good
<kac> hmmm ...
<kac> interesting ...
<kac> how would i know what Version of PHP i have (if at all?) ...
<ddttmm> you need to make a file named phpinfo.php which contains this:
<ddttmm> <?php phpinfo(); ?>
<ddttmm> and load it in your browser, served bythe server in question
<ddttmm> and you'll get ALL info
<ddttmm> dont make that public :)
<kac> if i do NOT have httpd as a service it means i do NOT have Apache - correct?
<kac> (maybe a should call it a daemon in linux-speak) ...
<ddttmm> correct
<ddttmm> heh
<ddttmm> well it means it's not turned on (running)
<ddttmm> it may be installed
<ddttmm> although i dont know what you're consulting in order to obtain that info :)
<kac> i consult the service list in RH8 "Start Here/Server Settings/Services" ...
<ddttmm> oic
<kac> and non-running services are listed 
<ddttmm> never seen that
<ddttmm> well it's probably installed then.
<ddttmm> rpm -qi apache
<ddttmm> that would tell ya
<kac> 1 sec ...
<kac> nope - don't have it
<kac> which version should i use 1.x or 2.x ?
<ddttmm> 1.3.27
<kac> vanilla ? or do i need to do much tweaking ?
Yurik (~yrashk@as5300.kharkov.ukrtel.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Vee2d2> hello Yurik
<ddttmm> at the worst, you'll need to enable the mod_php and you'll need to make sure that you've got the related RPMs
<ddttmm> kac: like for your database and such
<Yurik> Vee2d2: hello
<kac> i've already got MySQL up and running
<ajmitch> evening lads & ladies
<ddttmm> kac: yes but you must connect php to it
<kac> hi there
<Vee2d2> heya ajmitch
<kac> ddttmm: i'll give it a go and see where I end up
<ddttmm> kac: you must install the php-to-mysql RPMs and you must enable mysql support in php.ini
<ddttmm> kac: look for any package with 'php' and 'mysql' in the name
<ddttmm> kac: and if you can at all help it, you should use postgresql instead of mysql
<kac> why?
<ddttmm> because it's better!
<ddttmm> the simplest two answers are that because the developers prefer it and hence it has less potential issues, and because mysql is known for data corruption under high volume concurrent writes
<ddttmm> either mysql itself, or the way people tend to use it
<ddttmm> in their apps
<kac> hmmm...
<ajmitch> and because mysql isn't a full relational database
<ajmitch> it is but a shadow! :)
<ddttmm> yeah it's essentially a glorified SQL wrapper around a filesystem
<ddttmm> not that there's anything specifically wrong with it; it's just not an enterprise app
<ddttmm> i haven't heard of any other way to corrupt its data other than high volume concurrent writes to the same table
<ddttmm> insufficient granularity
<ddttmm> and the locking it does support is way too big and hence not used much
<ajmitch> can't recall if it does record locking or not
<ddttmm> last i knew, it didn't
<ajmitch> possibly is just table locking
<ddttmm> it was either table or row
<ddttmm> i think table
<kac> V3 did table locking
<ddttmm> but i barely know what a database is.  :)
<ddttmm> so i wont discuss much more ;>
<kac> V4 does record locking
<ajmitch> referential integrity, actually having relations declared between tables - fat chance :)
<ajmitch> yeah, they have finally caught up with the developing world :)

<mdupont> hey guys
<mdupont> is gnue gpl or lgpl?
<ajmitch> GPL
<mdupont> ok, so if i were to write a statistical package for a gnue module
<mdupont> that does graphs and reporting on it
<mdupont> would that also have to be gpl?
<ajmitch> ooooh, i really really need stats & graphs this next week or two ;)
<mdupont> well, i need your support on this
<ajmitch> well, you'd have to ask derek that one :)
<ajmitch> i think possibly yes
<ajmitch> not sure tho
<mdupont> the guy, tim perdue told me to go to hell and he would see me in court!
<ajmitch> oh lovely!
<ajmitch> what were you suggesting/asking?
<mdupont> i said that he should review if he is in violation of the gpl
<mdupont> that usage of internal data structures, and having to redistribute the gpled software with his
<mdupont> could be considered a derived work
<mdupont> and that i have asked debian-legal about this
<ajmitch> hmmm
<ajmitch> nasty
<ajmitch> what could he be violating?
<mdupont> the same thing that a user of mysql would be violating if they make non-free clients ;)
<ajmitch> hmm
<ajmitch> emailed GNU about it?
<mdupont> the same thing that a gcc developer would be violating if they make a non-free gcc frontend
Action: ajmitch thinks you're being a bit vague :)
<mdupont> ok, the argument is,
<mdupont> even if you use the sql-database, or link php modules together
<mdupont> you might be making a derived product
<ajmitch> right
<mdupont> if you put your compiler structures into a sql table, does that make the GPL useless?
Action: ajmitch doesn't even want to think about that :)
<mdupont> ajmitch: it is the same question
<mdupont> if this guy can get away with the debian-sf module
<mdupont> then all i have to do is put the gcc structs into a sql table
<mdupont> and viola, no more gpl
<ajmitch> worrying
<mdupont> it is

<ra3vat> hello all
<derek> if mdupont comes back you can tell him that he is walking in grey areas
<derek> in principle the GPL should make illegal the things he is saying

<jbailey> derek!
<jbailey> How's the dcl testing?
Action: jbailey pokes Derek with a stick.
<derek> A study performed by an outside team appears to indicate a rough parity in performance between Java and a common implementation of another OO language called Python (see IEEE Computing, October 2000, "An Empirical Comparison of Seven Programming Languages" by Lutz Prechelt of the University of Karlsruhe). Both platforms are Object Oriented, support web applications, serialization, internet connections and native interfaces. The ke
<derek> ence is that Python is a scripting language. This means there is no compilation to byte code so the Python runtime environment has to do two things in addition to what the Java runtime environment does. It has to perform syntax checks and it must parse the ascii text provided by the programmer. Both of those tasks are performed at compile time by Java and so that capability does not have to be in the JRE.
<derek> Given this data, it appears that the JRE can actually be simpler than the Python RE since Java does at least some of this work at compile time. The example above of "Hello World" is a good method for getting an idea of the minimum support code required at runtime. This support code includes garbage collector, byte code interpreter, exception processor and the like. Hello World written in Java2 requires 9M for this most basic suppo
<derek> structure. By comparison, this is slightly larger than automountd on Solaris8. The Python runtime required to execute Hello World is roughly 1.6M.

<derek> thats for jamest
<derek> jbailey: hopefully i can get to it today
<derek> life has been hell :(
<jbailey> Bah!
<derek> i apologize for not getting to test it yet
<derek> really
<jbailey> =)
<derek> i do
<derek> jamest: the above blurbs are from internal SUN memo you can find more on slashdot
<jbailey> derek: Stop reading slashdot and test my deb. =)
<derek> rofl
<derek> i actually have a minute i htink i will do so

<derek> doh seems i never tested the last one

<jbailey> ./templates?  Hmmm
<derek> well its worse than that
<derek> the query fails
<jbailey> Oh, I see.
<derek> seems users is www-data
<derek> and if i login as that user
<derek> i dont have rights
<derek> but i just changed config.php to something else
<jbailey> And the templates//login.tpl just indicates that you never setup your config.php right.
<derek> and still get errors
<derek> right
<derek> well no
<derek> it indicates that it couldnt read the dcl_config table
<derek> which in this case indicates that you have issues :)
<derek> hmmm
<derek> i changed /etc/dcl/config.php to have a user that does have rights
<derek> but still get same error
<derek> most odd
<derek> running grant.sh
<derek> and changing back
<derek> will see what that does
<derek> bingo
<derek> yeah ok your old package works great :)
<jbailey> The old package?  =)
<jbailey> That's funny.
<derek> all you have to do is setup up a db called dcl
<jbailey> There's several missing pages. =)
<derek> well could be
<derek> but the basic sa login works :)
<jbailey> The new version should fix that, though.
<derek> going to try to upgrade now
<derek> dcl_0.9.2-1_all.deb
<derek> is what i am testing right?
<jbailey> Yes, please.
<derek> what is best way to install that from command line to upgrade package?
<derek> dpkg --install foo.deb
<derek> ?
<jbailey> dpkg -i dcl_0.9.2-1_all.deb
<jbailey> Yes.
<derek> ok
<jbailey> dpkg doesn't suck like RPM that way.
<derek> didnt know if it was diff for upgrades (only install debs i cant get with apt rarely)

<derek> what the hell happened to the fonts?
<jbailey> In what?
<derek> everything shrunk
<derek> in dcl
<derek> it was all normal size

<derek> after upgrade
<derek> and all fonts and stuff are much smaller

<derek> as there are boxes that didnt exist and such

<jbailey> Ah lovely. =)
<derek> as i had 0.9.x ready to go months ago
<derek> and we never released
<jbailey> So I'll have at least one person using my debs? =)
<derek> mdean add some new goodies and released
<derek> ok looks like
<derek> you didnt execute the upgrade scripts?
<jbailey> No.  Are there upgrade scripts to be run? =)
<jbailey> And do these upgrade scripts determine the database version correctly?
<jbailey> (Like, if they get run multiple times, do bad things happen?)
<derek> jbailey: dbNames="dcl"       # Database names where DCL's stuff resides

<derek> seems that grantTo should be www-data not nobody on debian?
<derek> yes there is scripts/ugprades/
<derek> tehre is a shell file 'createupgrades'
<derek> that will look at your current version and build an upgrade file
<jbailey> Cool.
<derek> what is really whacked
<derek> is the version shows as  20010923

<jbailey> Don't file bug reports on a non-uploaded version.
<derek> i can try to really do more than 'kick the tires'
<jbailey> If there're showstoppers let me know before tuesday.
<jbailey> Otherwise I will upload it then.
<derek> and 'test drive it' later today
<jbailey> Cool.  Just send me emails.
<derek> but at this point it looks like its worthy of taking a spin around the block in :)
<jbailey> Cool, thanks.
<jbailey> Happy church'ing.
<derek> thanks

<dsmith> Did you guys see that /. article about Sun not using Java?
<dsmith> http://www.internalmemos.com/memos/memodetails.php?memo_id=1321
<dsmith> They do a few comparisons to Python.
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> and some of the reader's comments make me realize ppl don't really understand python
<jcater> "it's a scripting language... you can't write applications with that... how can you possibly compare the two!"
<jcater> :)
<jcater> or my favorite towards the end "anyone who's used both languages will tell you java is much faster because of its optimizations"
<jcater> *snicker*
<dsmith> I didn't actually read all the /. drivel, just the memo.

<ajmitch> hey derek
<derek> hey
<derek> so ajmitch you buy your 'america cup' gift card at your local grocery store
<derek> to support the kiwi national team?
<ajmitch> heh, no
Action: derek read in the paper today that local supermarkets there have 'donation cards' for 1, 2 and 3 dollars where you can donate to the national kiwi team 
<derek> what cracked me up was they used the term kiwi ;)
Action: ajmitch thinks americans are odd :)
<derek> well i tend to agree with taht
<IsoosI> jbailey: psyco is an attempt to make python faster than c
<IsoosI> also remember -O
<ajmitch> hey IsoosI
Nick change: IsoosI -> Isomer
Action: Isomer is back: gone camping
<ajmitch> :)
<Isomer> :)
<ajmitch> 'camp'ing, eh? ;)
<jbailey> Isomer: faster than C?  Hmm.  I wouldn't have that it would be possible to make a language with a garbage collector faster than a language without one.

<Isomer> they're talking about doing JIT
Nick change: ajmitch_ -> ajmitch
<Isomer> and making use of things such as lists/dicts can be implemented in ways that can be faster than the common C approaches
Mr_You (~rouzer@gso167-138-145.triad.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Mr_You> hi
<Mr_You> Curious if anyone has thought about a method of syncing disconnected clients?  know what I mean?
<Mr_You> well I guess I'm getting ahead of myself hehe
<Mr_You> I should be asking, is there a method being consider to provide disconnected clients.  Many apps do this.  Lets use a sales tool for example.
<Mr_You> Salesman is out on the road and needs to input data.  Salesman connects to the Internet or corporate network to sync this data with the main databases.
<Mr_You> Sales person! ;-)
<chillywilly> yo
<derek> um when we have talked about it in the past we called it 'briefcase' mode
<derek> and we have talked about it, but not done anythign with it
<Mr_You> any progress on web interface?
<chillywilly> hey I need an exim expert as mails have been bouncing since reviving gandalf and now I have a shit load of them stuck in /var/spool/exim/input and I want to know how to make exim deliver them...it told me it refused to deliver them cause there were over 100 messages :(
<Mr_You> haven't managed a exim server
<chillywilly> I had perms fscked apparently
Action: chillywilly needs to learn to use proper flags with cp next time (hopefully there won't be a next time)
Action: chillywilly should've used -p
<derek> Mr_You: i would say most core developers are not 'itching' for a web based interface
<derek> so until someone nuts up and goes to town on one
<derek> the answer will be the same 
<derek> i.e. it is possible if someone took the time to write one, if they did it in python with the pluggable UI system it would be fairly easy
<derek> most regrettably webmonkeys read this as
<derek> 'rewrite the entire forms client in php'
<derek> and they suffer in pain trying to do so and quickly give up
Action: derek is away: I'm busy
<chillywilly> HEH
<chillywilly> so Jan is a "web monkey" now?
<chillywilly> is tha an official title?
<chillywilly> and if so what can I do to ascertain the "trout boy" title?

<chillywilly> I get along fine with him :)
<dyfet> i think i applied the term that he can have the insticts of a poleaxe :).  but yes, once you get past the blades he has a number of interesting points
<ajmitch> hey dudes
<chillywilly> his spelling sucks
<ajmitch> seems like i will need to use GNUe 
<chillywilly> can't he do M-x ispell ;)
<jcater> any email that contains "I <insert whatever attribute here> more than anyone on this list" is someone I automatically stop listening to
<chillywilly> hmmm, he's getting pretty nasty now
<jcater> I'm sure he has an outstanding resume
<ajmitch> it's come down to a pissing match now
<ajmitch> now we get to see the real side of politics :)
<chillywilly> I agree jcater 
<chillywilly> he's looking like a fool now
<ajmitch> i gotta get this inventory thing done ASAP, will need to have printable reports (using template for purchase orders, etc)
<ajmitch> i also need to import a fair chunk of csv data, so i'd best get out my csv parser :)
<chillywilly> gnue reports? :)
<chillywilly> Ruben is dead spot on about Tony, imho
<Mr_You> sounds like code talk
<ajmitch> chillywilly: yes, i need printable reports on windows :)
<ajmitch> might have to do a hack & use reportlab to create pdfs, then start acroread :)
<ajmitch> chillywilly: still playing with exim?
<chillywilly> no
<chillywilly> mails all flooding in
<chillywilly> erm

<chillywilly> is that the option I want?
<chillywilly> dyfet: yes :)
<chillywilly> dyfet: that is the thread I am on
<ajmitch> dunno, it gets run by /etc/ppp/ip-up.d here
<chillywilly> well -M is supposed to free up soem messages

<jcater> you're not missing much
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> so Tony is giving GNU ppl that shaft now?
<chillywilly> WHAT A SURPRISE
<ajmitch> depends if you decide to interpret events that way
Action: chillywilly keels over...the mere shock overtaking him
<ajmitch> so when is the gnue list going to be moderated to stop this argument? :)
<chillywilly> lol
<jbailey> ajmitch: C'mon.  You gotta leave Australia *one* day. =)
<chillywilly> man...the mails never end
<jbailey> NZ, sorry
<jbailey> Bah.
<chillywilly> nah
<ajmitch> yeah, but do you think it'd be safe to visit the US? :)
<chillywilly> he has his own little island
<chillywilly> what more could a hacker want?

<chillywilly> ajmitch: it's safe in WI ;)
<ajmitch> someone to deliver pizza
<jbailey> ajmitch: No.  That's my biggest worry about having to go there in a couple weeks.
<jbailey> ajmitch: It's tempting to cancel the trip.
<ajmitch> chillywilly: 'safe' in what way?
<chillywilly> safe as in no terrorist activities
<ajmitch> safe from crime, or safe from government (same thing, really)
<chillywilly> no one cares about WI
<jbailey> ajmitch: I certainly expect it will be my last visit to the US for hopefully a year or two.
<jcater> that's the truth
<jcater> what a worhtless state
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> um, no
<jcater> well, except for the beer and cheese production
<chillywilly> whatever
<chillywilly> I am itching to go see the country music hall of fame man....

<chillywilly> I CAN HARDLY CONTAIN MYSELF
<chillywilly> l;shalekkfjhhfk
<chillywilly> go TN!
<jbailey> ajmitch: Entering the US these days is supposed to be entertaining.  Fingerprints and pictures. =(
<jcater> rock and roll hall of fame is here too
<ajmitch> jbailey: everyone's a terrorist until proven innocent :)

<ajmitch> wb derek o grand mata
<dyfet> hi derek
<ajmitch> s/mata/masta/
<jbailey> Heya derek.  How's the deb testing going? =)
<ajmitch> jbailey: deb testing? what debs? dcl?
<jbailey> ajmitch: Yeah.
Action: ajmitch has gnue 0.4.3 debs for you, but you want a patch... :)
<jbailey> Derek's going to make sure they work first. =)
<ajmitch> hehe
<jbailey> ajmitch: Should be easy.  I imagine you didn't change the rules file any.  So I need to know where you fetched the upstream tarball from, and then diffs to the files in debian/patches
<derek> rofl
<derek> jbailey: havent gotten back to computer to test
<derek> at computer in 2 minute intervals to burn cd's
<derek> every 10 minutes or so
<derek> wife gave me pile of aerobics cd's she has been bugging to burn for ages before tehy get so ruined they are not worthy of backing up
Action: derek delights that i have a very valid and real reason to back up music (though i hate the pain of doing it)
<derek> i.e. wife has to take cds to work for aerobic classes she teaches and giong club to club etc they get 'beat up'
<derek> if didnt make backups would be buying new cd's way too much
<derek> on that not anyone know if there is a tool to mess with beats per minute on linux?
<derek> so i dont have to shell out big cash
<derek> currently i pay 20 for a 2 cd set for her :(
<derek> that is nothing but compilation cd's remixed at higher beat per minute
<ajmitch> jbailey: i changed one line in the rules file - tarball name
<derek> its sick as i own most of the stuff already just not at right beats per minute :(
<derek> dyfet: hey
<ajmitch> also changed debian/control a little, for dependencies on wxpython
<derek> re: the list, ruben is well, interesting
<derek> i didnt mean to start a big hoopla
Action: derek was just responding to you saying i agreed and might be best for GNU Enterprise to avoid eGovOS altogether
<dyfet> lol
<jbailey> ajmitch: Oh yeah, that's right.  I forgot that dbs doesn't autodetect that.
<derek> didnt realize it went to gnu and other lists and then bam
<derek> huge flame fest
Action: derek STILL didnt realize it was on gnu list
<derek> until i got the 'you have mail to approve' emails
<jbailey> derek: Look at dbmix, it might do what you need.
<derek> jbailey: thanks
<dyfet> i dont think its anywhere near died down yet...
<jbailey> derek: I use it at parties for turning radio mixes into dancable songs. =)

rdean (~rdean@12-221-229-125.client.insightBB.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> kac: how brief?
<jcater> I can do it in 3 words: "Hasn't happened yet"
<derek> hey now one question at a time (though you did ask in separate channels) :)
<kac> jcater: i'm looking at dcl & it looks interesting - i need dcl (in an ideal world) to dump billing records into an accounting system...
<jcater> next level up in briefness: "... but the details are being worked out"
<jcater> ah
<jcater> what accounting package are you using?
<jcater> dcl's database schema is fairly straight forward
<jcater> I don't even think it'd be hard to get dcl to dump that data as a CSV file
<jcater> (if that was an option with your accounting package)
<kac> jcater: does gnue have an accounting package available or in the works?
<derek> i can answer.. me me me ;)
<derek> pretty much what jcater said
<derek> with 1.0 of dcl (dont ask for a date)
<derek> contact management will be able to handled in gnue
<derek> right now config tables can be handled in gnue
<jcater> kac: gnue's accounting stuff is in the works... it woulnd't be usable for anyone looking for an accounting package to use today
<jcater> :(
<jcater> someday I won't have to say that anymore
Action: jcater waits for that day :)
<kac> jcater: can that part of the project use some help?
<derek> and basic service requests had forms
<derek> but its not fully integrated at this point
<derek> as to the billing stuff
<derek> best bet is to dump data out (hours/accounts)
<derek> but ULTIMATELY i have plans for dcl to be used for service based billing
Action: derek does evil laugh
Action: derek needs junkfood
<derek> bbiam
<kac> jcater: can the financials part of the project use some help?
Action: kac yawns
<jcater> kac: absolutely
<jcater> sorry...was grabbing some food
<kac> jcater: how much progress has been done to now?
<jcater> much of the focus has been on the tools to date
<jcater> the financials are mainly in the proposal state
<jcater> but the bulk of the work is in getting the underlying tools in shape
dyfet (~dyfet@pool-141-153-147-83.mad.east.verizon.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jcater> so I expect to see stuff really takeoff with actual modules soon
<kac> my background is:
<ajmitch> quick, chain him to the channel! he's volunteering! :)
<kac> hehehe....
<kac> Accounts executive for some years now, some experience coding using (mainly) M$ Access, playing around with gnome/gtk/glade
<kac> pi**ed off with commercial stuff & looking for open-source alternatives ...
<jcater> ajmitch: do you know if subversions.gnu.org actually runs subversions, or is that just a clever name?
<jcater> kac: we can relate
<jcater> unfortunately, there isn't a lot to see in the free/open source world right now :(
<jcater> wrt accounting, I mean
<ajmitch> jcater: name was chosen before subversion was started as a project :)
<kac> jcater: that's exactly what I would like to change ...
<jcater> ajmitch: so that's a no?
<ajmitch> that's a no
<jcater> kac: then we'd like to see you stick around with us :)
<ajmitch> it was thought about, but they found that it would be too  much work to get subversion running properly for all people
<kac> ajmitch: handcuffs are closing on me ...
<kac> :)
<ajmitch> things like requireing apache2 
<ajmitch> hehehe
Action: ajmitch is going to be immersed in gnue for the next 2 weeks - i might need a stable forms in cvs :)
<ajmitch> any idea on what jamest is up to at the moment?

<ajmitch> would be cleaner
<jcater> but hasn't been done afaik
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> shouldn't be hard
<ajmitch> i'll do it then :)
<jcater> but I have no examples to show you
<ajmitch> i need to do a number of simple reports that have to be viewable on the screen
<ajmitch> might hack around with report lab & opening a pdf viewer
<ajmitch> would give me printing
<jcater> or output html, depending on the complexity of the reports
<ajmitch> don't think that'd be appreciated 
<ajmitch> clients are picky :/
<jcater> ok
<derek> <jcater> <derek> no
<derek> <jcater> <jcater> no?
<derek> <jcater> <ajmitch> nope
<derek> <jcater> so that's the question we were asking?
<derek> my no was an answer to
<derek> <ajmitch> any idea on what jamest is up to at the moment? and <ajmitch> any inclination to tell me? :)
<ajmitch> :)
<jcater> well, I won't say publicly, because I don't think he wants everyone to know about the pet goats and what he's been up to
<jcater> oops

<ajmitch> jamest_: you're planning to break HEAD?
<jamest_> i want to
<ajmitch> ok, i'll just grab what's in cvs at the moment & stick with that
<jamest_> actually, i'm not crazy about it but I know others are wanting to work on the UI drivers
<ajmitch> yeah, i do
<jamest_> then you want me to break head
<jamest_> it's no where near the same 
<ajmitch> i have a project that needs done within 2-3 weeks :)
<jamest_> in wx? or other?
<ajmitch> i may have to go back to 0.4.3
<ajmitch> gtk2
<jamest_> dude
<jamest_> i think the new ui drivers will be easier to implement
<jamest_> than the old
<ajmitch> yeah
<jamest_> take a look at www.gnuenterprise.org/~jamest/forms.tgz 
<jamest_> IIRC
<jamest_> it's the tarball of the new setup
<ajmitch> i want to catch up with jbailey on that gtk2 stuff
<ajmitch> yeah, i got that tarball
<jamest_> he's wanting to work on it this week which is why I'm wanting to check it in

<jamest_> you got it alreay?
<jamest_> already
<jamest_> did someone post that previously?
<ajmitch> jamest_: i'm wanting to work on it this week
Action: ajmitch blames jcater
<ajmitch> he didn't post in channel :)
Action: jcater_ looks around
<jcater_> who, me?
<ajmitch> yes you
Action: jamest_ thwaps jcater around with a day old donut
<jamest_> you feel this will be harder to work w/ than 0.4.x ui drivers?
Action: jamest_ thought the new layout was easier to follow
<ajmitch> i feel that i'll need something stable to work on :)
<ajmitch> but i also need gtk2 drivers
<jamest_> well, honestly stability wize we're about the same I imagine
<ajmitch> at the moment
<jamest_> it's missing features that kills head
<ajmitch> yep
<jamest_> as all the pop-ups are getting reimplemented as <dialog>
<jamest_> even login box :)
Action: ajmitch must hunt down jbailey
<jamest_> please do, the only reason I've not commited yet is lack of jbailey
<ajmitch> the only reason i haven't started work yet is lack of talking to him about it
<jcater_> for the record, this commit will break designer's support of forms
<jcater_> for a little while
<ajmitch> yeah, i realise that
Action: jcater_ is making that public for psu's KCs :)
<ajmitch> what do you mean by 'support of forms'?
<ajmitch> designer will be unusable completely?
<jcater_> as in, you load a form
<jcater_> designer will segfault
<psu> use emacs or vi for .gfds, like in the old days
<ajmitch> oh, that's no problem :)
<psu> pre-jcater
Action: ajmitch wonders what the difference is there ;)
<jamest_> it's the improved driver performance
<jamest_> you segfault instantly instead of after 1/2 hour of unsaved work
<ajmitch> lol
Action: ajmitch wants to work on this stuff today :(
<jamest_> If you are going to work from the cvs as it sits I'd say go ahead
<jamest_> as I thought jbailey wanted to work from the new drivers
<jamest_> and we can just port your stuff up
<jamest_> (i hope)
<ajmitch> but then i'll be duplicating work :)
<jamest_> yeah
<jamest_> or work from the tarball and I'll get this in cvs tonight
<ajmitch> has jbailey started on his hacking?
<jamest_> no clue
<ajmitch> gar
Action: ajmitch ponders what to do
<jamest_> i say get started :)
<jamest_> what I would do is get the new drivers gtk'ized
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> and then beat jbailey up
<jamest_> if you have that much complete then you're really close to being functional now
<jamest_> in a pinch we could reactivate the old style dialogs
<ajmitch> heh
<jamest_> but I prefer not too
<ajmitch> so work on the gtk2 driver in your tarball?
<jamest_> I don't think the designer breakage is too bad
<jamest_> i think I would
<jamest_> i removed the gtk dir from the tarball to make it smaller
<jamest_> and reduce my glimpse file hits :)
<jamest_> but it's still the same basic structure
<jamest_> wrt widget construction
<jamest_> only now they are split out into a widgets dir
<ajmitch> heh ok
<ajmitch> might as well start from scratch then (copying the wx driver across)
Action: ajmitch clears room on desk for 2nd monitor
<jamest_> dude
<ajmitch> yes?
<jamest_> almost everything should be cut n paste from the main driver
<ajmitch> yup
<jamest_> with a little tweaking
<jamest_> ok
Action: jamest_ did not want you starting from complete scratch
<jamest_> what time is it in the land of kiwis?
<ajmitch> i said from scratch (copy wx stuff)
<ajmitch> Tue Feb 11 10:03:44 NZDT 2003
<jamest_> ah, mid morning
<jamest_> ok, i'll make it a point to be on tonight
<ajmitch> i really wish this other monitor did more than 640x480 :)
<ajmitch> ok
<jamest_> i really with a had a 2nd monitor
Action: jamest_ mumbles something about lucky no good rotten...... :)
<jcater_> ya need to get that lithp taken care of too
<ajmitch> heheh
<ajmitch> it was off an old 386 box :)
<jamest_> lol
<psu> ordinary lithp or emacs-lithp?
<jcater_> visual lithp
<jamest_> ajmitch: our strategy for today is to fsck up designer soooooo bad that jcater can't stand to sit back and watch
<jamest_> ajmitch: at which point he'll jump in and fix it up for us
<jamest_> whoops forgot the /msg 
<ajmitch> jamest_: think we can do something to reports as well?
<jcater_> don't worry... I'm fscking up reports on my own
Action: jcater_ is working on formula support
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> excellent, i need to do stats in reports (calculate depreciation based on purchase dat, price, and depreciation value..)
<jamest_> oooo, an output formatting
<ajmitch> btw, you want me to brush off my csv db driver?
<jamest_> s/an/and
<ajmitch> oh nice
<jcater_> yeah
<jcater_> and output formatting
<jamest_> oooo, and barcode output
<ajmitch> i've got a small 900k cvs file to import
<jcater_> yes
<jcater_> and barcode support
<jcater_> see
<ajmitch> barcode output! yay!
<jamest_> sigh, he's agreeing too easily
Action: jcater_ has the driver for barcode support almost done
<jcater_> it's a python wrapper around gnu barcode
<jamest_> this must not be the jcater we know and lothe^H^H^Hve
<ajmitch> we have to generate barcodes frim this inventory app to stick on everything ;)
<jcater_> ajmitch: well, not to worry... I've swigged gnu barcode :)
<ajmitch> hehe, cool
<jcater_> but I can't decide if this should be a separate project (pybarcode)
<ajmitch> the barcode reader that will be used is a simple keyboard entry one
<jcater_> or if I should send as patches to gnubarcode
<jcater_> and have them do like postgresql does
<jcater_> and have their bindings in their cvs tree
<jcater_> my only problem is they seem to move slowly
Action: jcater_ thinks I'm going to do a separate project from them
<ajmitch> ok
Action: jcater_ is looking for opinions here......
<jcater_> :)
<jamest_> um
<jamest_> an opinion
<jamest_> hmmmm
<jamest_> you should spend more time gnue'n
<ajmitch> :)
<jcater_> um
<jamest_> oooo
<jcater_> this will give you barcode support in python
<jcater_> this is gnue'n
<jamest_> and make that a seperate project too
<jcater_> :)
<jamest_> i mean in general
<jamest_> i'm excited about the barcoding
<jamest_> and the less real life you have the more cool toys gnue gets
<jcater_> my next biggie to come up soon
<jcater_> is a graphing library for python
<jcater_> I can't decide if that should be done in gnue common
<jcater_> or externally
<ajmitch> jamest_: does jeff have your forms tarball?
<jcater_> as python doesn't have a good graphing package
<jamest_> ajmitch: no
<jamest_> ajmitch: at least I don't think so
<ajmitch> ok, harassing jeff by email
<chillywilly> is 0.5.0 going t contain this ui rewrite?
<chillywilly> s/t/to/
<jcater_> yes
<psu> chillywilly: looks like it
<jcater_> 0.5.0 is shaping up to be a really major release
<ajmitch> yay
<psu> from a practical point of view, "upgrade to 0.5.0, it breaks all your old forms" is a less attractive msg than
<ajmitch> the feature plan been updated to match?
<chillywilly> but no native win32 driver?
<jcater_> chillywilly: possibly
<psu> "upgrad to 0.5.0 it breaks all your old forms but has radikool new UI drivers"
<jcater_> or at least one of the 0.5.x releases
<chillywilly> well I was thinking of writing one
<ajmitch> depends if someone is willing to submit themselves to writing a win32 driver
<chillywilly> maybe start with kde first
<ajmitch> ok
<chillywilly> ;P
<psu> ajmitch: iirc, the feature plans don't split by point release
<ajmitch> psu: they should ;)
<psu> so things are planned for 0.5.x, not for 0.5.0 or 0.5.1
<chillywilly> but if things keep changing that would make it hard
<ajmitch> chillywilly: big change landing tonight
<ajmitch> don't know what else is planned to change
<jamest_> i've started a qt driver
<jamest_> the format changed
<chillywilly> the gtk2 driver looks like they copied the wx one is that the way to go?
<chillywilly> ok
<jamest_> the ui drivers are *hopefully* cleaner
<ajmitch> chillywilly: that's what i'm doing now - starting a new gtk2 driver :)
<jamest_> <dialog> support
<chillywilly> ok
<jamest_> i'd love to see a win32 dirver
<jamest_> um
<jcater_> chillywilly: all this stuff is in line with our feature plan of 2 months ago, iirc
<jamest_> it is, i verified it last week
<chillywilly> sorry, I try to keep up but well life happens
<psu> in effect, all that has happened is that we are skipping the planned 0.5.0 
<chillywilly> I need to get rid f my life
<chillywilly> s/f/of/
<ajmitch> jamest_: i see the gtk2 driver is in the tarball
<psu> as no-one seemed to need/want the gfd breakage w/o the new UI
<ajmitch> is that an untouched one?
<psu> so what would have been 0.5.1 will now be 0.5.0
<jamest_> it is?
<jcater_> psu: the issue was that once we release 0.5.0, people expect the 0.5.x series to kind of stabilize (at least based on 0.4.0 experience)
<chillywilly> what is this tarball that you guys are talking about?
<jcater_> but we weren't at that point :(
Action: jamest_ swore he removed all drivers except wx  from that tarball on my page 
<ajmitch> chillywilly: s3kr3t k0d3
<jamest_> www.gnuenterprise.org/~jamest/forms.tgz
<chillywilly> ui rewrite?
<ajmitch> yeah
<chillywilly> ok
<psu> jcater: to me, 0.4 remains stable unless & until the code mastas (j*) say otherwise
<jcater_> I think we've been pretty good at keeping 0.4.x stable
<ajmitch> well i have 0.4.3 debs for jbailey to process
<psu> doesn;t Linux do stable=even, unstable=odd
<jcater_> that's the most point releases we've done since 0.0.x
<jcater_> (which didn't count)
<ajmitch> yeah, i think that 0.4.x is pretty good
<jcater_> psu: yeah... that's a debate much akin to the documentation format debates
<ajmitch> when do you want to drop ongoing support/patches for 0.4.x?
<psu> If I was starting a project using gnue today, I'd use 0.4.x
<jcater_> after this 0.5.0 ordeal, I really am leaning towards odd/even again
<psu> and just keep an eye on things that are know to break the gfd conversion script 
<chillywilly> so ajmitch are you starting with code fromt he tarball or from CVS HEAD?
<psu> (e.g. complex triggers that go poking around in internals that they shouldn't)
<psu> and avoid them
<ajmitch> chillywilly: tarball
<jamest_> cvs head won't be broken till tonight
<jamest_> it's still the 0.4.x driver style
<chillywilly> you're syncing it up tonight?
<ajmitch> psu: well i'm being stupid & doing stuff with CVS
<jamest_> i plan to as no one screamed NO when I said I wanted to
<chillywilly> what
<chillywilly> blah
<chillywilly> oopsie
<ajmitch> chillywilly: yes, you've not started on a ui driver, right?
<chillywilly> nope, just looked at the code some
<ajmitch> ok
<psu> jamest_ : are the project papo boys still using 0.4.x or equivalent? 
<ajmitch> jamest_ says driver writing will be easier now
<chillywilly> couple days ago I did
<psu> They are they only people who might have an issue w/broke CVS
<jcater_> psu: they are using 0.3.x or so last I checked
<jcater_> :0
<psu> ok
<chillywilly> yeek
<ajmitch> ouch
<jamest_> yeah
<jamest_> they are older version
<psu> I know they are trying to get caught up - wasn;t aa_ looking at helping StyXman re-synch?
<chillywilly> win32 driver is a pretty big deal imho, while M$ still has the desktop
<jamest_> it's a huge deal
<jamest_> however I start getting mental whenever I try and gnue on wifes win98 box
<psu> time for bed 
<chillywilly> I see...
<chillywilly> I might have similar issues
<chillywilly> wonder if wine could work...

<chillywilly> would be nice to be able to develop on gnu/linux
Action: chillywilly pictures himself running up and downt he stairs to test it ;P
<jamest_> vnc
<chillywilly> ah
<chillywilly> duh
<chillywilly> good idea
<chillywilly> would give me a chance to play with it
<chillywilly> what vnc software would you install on winders?
<jcater_> vnc
<ajmitch> i've got a spare box here, i might dump windows on it
<ajmitch> will need to for gtk2 driver
<ajmitch> "I've done nothing.  jamest told me to wait until he had done the commit

<ajmitch> ok, jamest, seems like we had a deadlock situation ;)
<chillywilly> hmm, I think I need to add setup vnc to my TODO list for the day
<jamest_> ack!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<jamest_> that's because he's not been in here and has been msg'ing me at my home login
<ajmitch> heh
Action: ajmitch emailed him
<jamest_> I'm jamest with a _
<chillywilly> is the HOWTO a good document?
<ajmitch> yup, i figured that
<chillywilly> aw crap my konq is b0rked

<chillywilly> hi dsmith 
<dsmith> chillywilly: Greetings from the land of FreeBSD 5.0!
<chillywilly> ack ;)
<dsmith> chillywilly: I might actually have a working acpi now.
Action: dsmith kicks freebsd ports for building all of gtk just because I did a make install of gkrellm2
<chillywilly> who needs that? real men get a laptop that has both ACPI and APM ;)
<dsmith> chillywilly: But I'm very geeky and want to see my cpu temp.
<chillywilly> HEH
<chillywilly> acpi is supposed to be greatly improved in kernel 2.5.x
<dsmith> chillywilly: I've never gotten acpi to work right in Linux
<dsmith> And I don't think I'll run a 2.5 kernel either.  But I'm glas to hear it's improving.
<dsmith> s/glas/glad/
<chillywilly> 2.6.0 is probably just around the corner
<dsmith> !!
<chillywilly> dsmith: wimp
Action: dsmith admits it.
<dsmith> But I usually run Debian unstable
<chillywilly>  actually I did compile a 2.5.x kernel and I thought it was borked but you have to pgrade modutils
<chillywilly> upgrade*
<ajmitch> i compiled one but it never booted
Action: chillywilly runs debian unstable as a development machine
<ajmitch> got to "Ok, booting the kernel..." and hung there
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> mine booted bt complain about modules
<chillywilly> then I found out I needed a newer modutils, etc.
<chillywilly> and I have not bothered with it since then
<ajmitch> nah, you need a new package
<chillywilly> it was very broken though
Action: ajmitch wonders if building with gcc 2.95.4 would make any difference
<ajmitch> they totally changed the module loading & unloading code a couple of releases ago ;)
<chillywilly> yea well I didn't know there's now way I am going to subscribe to lkml
<chillywilly> I don't need to read that much crap
Action: ajmitch is not subscribed to it
<chillywilly> I thoght there was a vnc howto?
<chillywilly> thought*
<ajmitch> dunno
<ajmitch> vnc is simple anyway
<chillywilly> do you do it over ssh?
<chillywilly> well that doesn't matter for me anyway inside my own network :P
<chillywilly> don't I need some kind of vnc server running on winders if I wish to view it on this box?
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<chillywilly> hmmm, I should set it up both ways
<ajmitch> yeah
<jamest_> you need vnc on client 
<ajmitch> i usually run over ssh
<jamest_> and a web browser on the linux box
<jamest_> you'd prefer the linux viewer though
<jamest_> but it's not needed
<ajmitch> i prefer the client, rather than the java applet
<jcater_> I have never tried the java client
<jcater_> the thought of it scares me :)
<ajmitch> hhe
<jamest_> it works
<jamest_> but I prefer the client
dsmith (~dsmith@borg.altus.cc) left irc: "Client Exiting"

<ajmitch> how disappointing
<chillywilly> :(
<jcater_> "Mr Wakefield says Windows won out when support and management costs, migration timeframes and costs, and remote support options were factored in..." 
<jcater_> loosely translated, that means
<jcater_> "After Mr Wakefield returns from his Microsoft-sponsored vacation in the Caymans, he announced that Windows won out when support and management costs, migration timeframes and costs, and remote support options were factored in..."
<chillywilly> vnc is so cool
Action: chillywilly can see the winders box
<jcater_> I can understand the migration timeframes and costs argument
<ajmitch> heh
<chillywilly> woop woop
<jcater_> as that's a valid argument
<jcater_> but remote administration?
<jcater_> he's on crack
<ajmitch> jcater_: this is why GNUe needs a POS :)

<jamest> no

<ajmitch> interesting changes to the driver that you've done, splitting everything out
<jamest> the idea is further down the road, like after I quit, the dynamic loading will lead to people being able to add new widget types for their local install
<jamest> this will mean a std api to the drivers and widgets which isn't completed yet
<jamest> the dialogs will work the same way
<jamest> you put a file or dir in uidrivers/_base/dialogs at it'll be loaded at form startup as part of the base set of dialogs
<ajmitch> excellent
<ajmitch> like custom graphical parts, eg embedding a graph into a form? :)
<jamest> you bet, just add that to part of the feature set for jcater's upcoming graphing lib
<jamest> he won't mind
<jamest> I'm starting to worry about jcater
<jamest> he didn't even whimper on that one
<jamest> you think we finally broke his spirit?

<ajmitch> he's doing a graphing lib?
<jcater> you just wait, buddy!
<jcater> I've gotten you hooked on reports now!
Action: ajmitch pays homage to jcater

<chillywilly> I just wanna be able to go the other way too

<chillywilly> I thought the kde 3.x in sid was not fully done
<ajmitch> stop complaining!
<jamest> that's what I run
<chillywilly> shutup
<chillywilly> why the heck doesn't it want to upgrade to these debs then?
<jamest> it may not be done but everything i've tried works for me
<chillywilly> hmm hmm hmm
<jamest> you have to manually dpkg -r some things 
<chillywilly> all of these kde debs depend on one metapackage
<jamest> at least I did when going from the KL debs to the sid debs
<chillywilly> so I can pull the whole thing out
<chillywilly> apt-get --purge remove kde-cvs-snapshot
<chillywilly> ok, I'll give sid a try...always better to have the official stuff anyway, imho

<jamest> that's what I was just thinking
<jamest> the mirrors were definately beind

<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> it is in sid
<jamest> i know it is

<KeithJagr> jcater: I read in the last KC that work is going ro change the win32 interface...
<KeithJagr> how are things going?
<KeithJagr> in that issue
<jamest> it's still in progress
<jamest> according to cvsweb a new ui driver model was commited 8 minutes ago
<jamest> this does not have a win32 module yet
<jamest> but it will hopefully be a step in making one easier to create
<KeithJagr> hopefully
<KeithJagr> so are you discarding wx?
<jamest> yes and no
<KeithJagr> in favour of gtk ?
<jamest> it's still the first implementation in the new setup
<jamest> ajmitch and jbailey are working on a gtk2 driver 
<jcater>  I don't foresee us dropping wx support
<jamest> I'm working on the wx and I've started a qt driver
<jcater> we'll just offer additional native models
<jamest> i'm hoping that by the weekend the widget and ui driver interfaces will be will defined
<KeithJagr> what is the porpuse of using 3 GUI builders at a time?
<jcater> depending on your platform, of course
<jamest> i'm doing it becase it will help keep the driver system more ui independent
<jamest> they are working on it as I think gtk is the company std where they are
<jamest> i think
<jamest> designer will remain wx based 
<KeithJagr> good, but I would think that at this point, more energy is required on sharpen Tools, rather than working in giving support to all those GUIs
<KeithJagr> just a thought though
<jamest> the ui changes are part of new functionality being built into the forms client
<jamest> as well as a cleanup of the designer/forms interaction
<KeithJagr> I see
<jamest> the tools are still receiving effort as well
derek (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)
<KeithJagr> so, talking about the win32 GUI, when do you think the improved version will be ready to test ?
<jamest> hmmmmm
<jamest> i'm hoping to have the new drivers done this week or next
<KeithJagr> I agree that the current one tends to suck a bit
<jamest> if the win32 widgets are not radically different in design I would hope it wouldn't take long at all
chillywilly (danielb@mke-24-167-199-83.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> if we can someone willing to step up to the plate to do it
<chillywilly> what really suck is no kmix or krecord
<chillywilly> :(
<jamest> from what I've read though the gtk2 and qt drivers are supposed to run on win32
<jamest> i think qt is supposed to look native IIRC
<KeithJagr> will that imply Forms wrking out-of -the-box in gtk2?
<chillywilly> I wanted to record some guitar and throw some tracks together
<jamest> that is the goal
<KeithJagr> I've never tryed gtk2
<jamest> it was donated but incomplete
<KeithJagr> have you tested FLTK?
<KeithJagr> it seems very nice
SachaS_ (~Sacha@dialup-196-44.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> if you'd like a fltk driver would hopefully be easy to add
<jamest> the wx driver in cvs is the new model 
<jamest> it's still in flux as the interface isn't fully defined
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-44.wasp.net.au) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<KeithJagr> I see
<jamest> but you sould just have to write a wrapper UIdriver.py and 1 py file for each widget
<jamest> http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/gnue/forms/src/uidrivers/wx/widgets/label.py?rev=1.1&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup
<jamest> is an example
<jamest> sigh, i have to go now
<KeithJagr> how many widgets are there used currently?
<KeithJagr> ok
<jamest> box, button, entry, label, page, scrollbar (?)
<jamest> with various styles that implement variations like checkboxes, dropdowns, readonly entries
<jamest> l8r

<ajmitch> curses, just got back... i wanted to ask jamest about stuff :(
<SachaS_> hi ajmitch
<ajmitch> hi
<ajmitch> jcater: do you know much about the rtf template->pdf reports filter that jamest talked about at one stage?
<jcater> he and I both use it in production
<ajmitch> excellent
<jcater> you basically create an RTF file, and everywhere you want a field inserted fomr the database
<jcater> denote it as ::myfield1::
<jcater> e.g., Invoice # ::invoiceno::
<ajmitch> it seems like the quickest way for me to get printable & viewable reports on windows
ToyMan (~stuq@glvv-dsl3-188.citlink.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<KeithJagr> jcater: where is that reports template?
<KeithJagr> ?
<chillywilly> quick way to remove kde
<chillywilly> COLUMNS=200 dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep kde | awk '{print $2}' | xargs apt-get -y remove
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> oh and

<ajmitch> well so does dpkg -l :)
<ajmitch> dpkg --get-selections |grep -v deinstall
<chillywilly> yea but I used grep and awk to get all kde packages
<ajmitch> i know that
<chillywilly> so wtf is your point then?
<ajmitch> fine, i'll leave it
<chillywilly> did you have a better way to do it?
<chillywilly> oh nm
<chillywilly> use --get-selections
<chillywilly> same difference

<havoc> I am doing something potentially very silly right now
<havoc> FTP upgrade from mandrake cooker
<havoc> hmmm, this will be interesting
<chillywilly> what I did was try to run a program that wasn't installed
<dsmith> chillywilly: I knew kde was trying to be too much like windows.
<havoc> dsmith: still much better than gnome2
<havoc> better meaning stability, usability and polish
<havoc> and also much better design
<havoc> gnome is a mess
<dsmith> I agree that kde is more "together"
<Vee2d2> them's fightin words
<havoc> as a professional developer who takes engineering very seriously, gnome "offends" me
<havoc> gnome2 rather
<dsmith> I actually just use fluxbox.  None of that "desktop" spooge for me.

<havoc> dsmith: mope, but check freshmeat

<treinar> I would kindly ask you: which is the correct channel to contact GNU Enterprise for questions regarding my participation in the project?
<ajmitch> here
<ajmitch> hopefully there are some people around :)
<treinar> OK. I'm a student at Ostfold University College in Norway. I'm doing a project, and the objective of it is to develop a system which makes it easy to create dynamic web sites, more specificly the forms part of them. My initial sketch of a design was very close to yours. So, the egoistic part of me thinks "bugger - I'm not as inventive as I thought I was", but my second thought was that I might use the project to contribute to yours. I won
<treinar> derek: how far have you come on the HTML interface and the Java interface?
<ajmitch> they haven't been worked on much, afaik
<ajmitch> and the forms file format has changed a fair bit for 0.5.0, so they'd have to be updated for that anyway
<treinar> I'm a decent Java programmer, and I'm catching up on Python and XML (it's part of one of my classes this spring). I also have quite a lot of experience on forms design with PHP/HTML, so I guess I'll manage the Python/HTML combination fairly well. Who should I contact to get more detail on the status of the HTML and Java interfaces?
<ajmitch> probably a good idea to talk to jcater or jamest
<treinar> This is my first IRC session ever. Could you please tell me how to get in touch with them? (I'm using X-Chat).

einer (~andrew@216.229.19.254) joined #gnuenterprise.
<einer> hello everyone.  I just have a quick question that may not actually be related to GNUe at all...
<chillywilly> ask away
<einer> I'm using a software package called Database Schema Designer (it's a sourceforge project)
<einer> One of the neato whiz bang things that this package does is allow you to design a database schema and export it to xml
<einer> Unfortunately, it doesn't allow you to export it to sql.  :)
<chillywilly> HEH
<einer> There is (supposedly) an xsl file that allows a transform into sql from xml
<chillywilly> our designer was supposed to let you design schemas in our xml format and that could be exported to sql
<chillywilly> I dunno if that works right now
<einer> this xsl file is named pgsql.xsl and I found it listed in GNUe from google.
<chillywilly> their xml is probably different than ours
<chillywilly> jcater: does the schema thing in designer work?
<einer> I figured as much.
<chillywilly> hmmm, I need some lunch
<chillywilly> omg, they are still talking about the eGovOS conference
<chillywilly> ok, I am now sick of it
<chillywilly> officially
<einer> So, the pgsql.xsl that you guys use is not compatible with the designer 
<chillywilly> with their format I doubt it
<chillywilly> it is with our xml (gsd) format
<einer> I wonder how he did it then, because he mentioned that file name... He could have written his program to output conformant xml and planned the translation functionality later... it's just a command line away when you ahve the right xsl file...
<einer> Well... If that file doesn't exist, is there another schema design tool you would recommend that exports as sql?
<einer> alright then.  
einer (~andrew@216.229.19.254) left irc: "Client Exiting"

<chillywilly> http://www.libertyetech.com/take2-new.ogg
<ajmitch> lol
<chillywilly> I fucked p at the end though and if you listen close you can hear my yell ;P

Action: ajmitch wonders why it's at such high bitrate, for your not-so-great recording equipment
<ajmitch> sounds pretty good still

<ajmitch> hmmmm
<chillywilly> that was _Simon sing some prop. app

<ajmitch> probably my arch-nemesis chillywilly
<esands> away log doesn't lie.  Looks like your auto-complete on the wrong guy.  8)
<ajmitch> yep :)
<ajmitch> i complained about xchat's autocomplete ;)
<ajmitch> was pointing out to chillywilly & others that krdc isn't in sid
<ajmitch> how've you been?
<esands> anyway the ktown src is pretty good. They guy is contacted to provide the germany govt the debs
<esands> sid debs took at while because of gcc 3.2 and libstdc++ in sid
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> and because it's debian
<esands> me? I've been busy.  Working on a cashflow projection until March 2004 at the moment.   Black magic voodoo stuff
<ajmitch> ugh
Action: ajmitch shudders at the thought
<esands> Actually the 3.1 'stable' debs where out almost the same day as the release
<chillywilly> ajmitch: what did you think of my little solo?
<ajmitch> was good stuff
<chillywilly> thanks
<ajmitch> esands: yeah, gotta add overrides manually for every new package into the archive tho
<chillywilly> I am going to record a couple songs I think
<chillywilly> one I am writing for SynrG and Ariannah's midnight moca show (it's anexotic little chord progression and some soloing)
<esands> The ktown guy talks about that in his README. At the install part
<chillywilly> and then I have that other song that includes the solo you heard
<ajmitch> cool
<chillywilly>  but I need to find a better program to use

<SachaS_> good morning
<jamest> howdy
<ajmitch> i dislike mysql
<ajmitch> mysql is evil
<jamest> but gtk2 drivers under forms are the bomb right?
<jamest> ;)
<ajmitch> they will be
Action: jamest is enjoying given ajmitch crap
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> pygtk has approximately nil docs :)
<jamest> yeah, i looked once
<SachaS_> lol
<jamest> it wasn't pretty
<ajmitch> i go off the C docs
<jcater> ajmitch: if it makes you feel any better
<jcater> win32all and pyqt are the exact same way
<ajmitch> :)
<jcater> they expect you to use the C docs
<ajmitch> excellent
<jamest> nope!!!!!!!!!
<jcater> or c++, whichever
<jcater> nope?
<jamest> that's 1reason i grabbed qt as my 2nd test
<jcater> you found real docs?
<jamest> http://www.opendocspublishing.com/pyqt/
Action: jcater tried 6 months ago and couldn't
<jcater> well, kick ass
<jamest> yip
<jamest> i've started a qt driver already
<jamest> and some year I'll finish it
<jcater> are you going to keep the curses working
<jcater> or let someone else fix it?
<jamest> sigh
Action: jcater searches for a bat
<jamest> i'm going to try to keep it working
<jamest> but that thing scares me
<jcater> I'm just curious... no big deal
Action: jcater eyes the bat in the corner
<jamest> i need it to work
<jcater> why scare you?
<jamest> I lack the m4d sk1lz of the kurses koder
<jamest> the event model
<jcater> heh
<jcater> truth be known, UIcurses overrides the cursing event model
<jamest> last I looked was a bit, um, convoluted
<jamest> yeah, it looked like another kwalitee kater koding kreation
<jcater> hey, now
<jamest> i'm still in therapy over some of the things I've seen in datasources
<jamest> :)
<ajmitch> wait until you see the gtk2 driver
<jamest> gack!
<jamest> not 2 of you guys
<ajmitch> no
<jcater> anyone know the url-friendly %?? code for semicolon?
<ajmitch> jcater's code is pure elegance compared to mine
<jcater> hey!
<jamest> why can't you code to my fscked up coding style instead of your own
<jcater> my code is pure elegance!
<jcater> period
Action: jcater waits for everyone to agree
Action: jcater is still waiting
<jcater> hrm
Action: ajmitch snickers quietly in the corner

<jamest> isn't there a python lib that'll htmlize any string
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> urlencode() or something
<jcater> %3B
<jamest> fsck
<jamest> i need a working designer to make my dialogs
<ajmitch> ooh
<ajmitch> is it be nice to jcater time?
<jcater> ooooo
<jcater> that reminds me
<jamest> um, no
Action: ajmitch slips jcater some fresh donuts
<jcater> I need to merge my desigenr branch
<jamest> why start now?
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> what's in your branch?
<jamest> i just had to get my 0.4 branch running again :)
<jcater> changes to desigenr to match jamest's tarballs from a few nights ago
Action: jamest blinks
<jcater> iow, starting to get designer to work with new model
<jamest> you fixed designer already?
<ajmitch> impressive
<jcater> <jcater> iow, starting to get designer to work with new model
<ajmitch> jamest: you didn't break forms enough!
<jcater>                 ^---- notice that word "starting"
<jamest> good as I wanted to get with you and make a real interface between the 2
<jcater> ajmitch: oh, no
<jcater> it's broken
<jcater> ajmitch: when I merge the branch
<jcater> you'll see
<ajmitch> heh ok
<jcater> desigenr segfaults immediately when loading a form
<ajmitch> yay!
<jcater> no traceback
Action: ajmitch likes segfaults
<jcater> just a good old-fashioned segfault
<ajmitch> compiled a debug wxpython?
<jcater> beats me
<jcater> whatever's in sid
<ajmitch> 2.4?
<jcater> whatever's in sid
<jcater> do I need to repeat that?
<chillywilly> jcater: pyqt has an entire book how to use it
<jcater> whatever's in sid
<ajmitch> sid has 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4, iirc
<jcater> chillywilly: yeah, I gathered that from jamest's url paste
<ajmitch> so just saying 'whatevers in sid' doesn't help much :)
<jcater> I think I upgraded to 2.4 to get designer 0.4.3 tested and released
<chillywilly> sorry I probably didn't get down the back log that far
<ajmitch> alright
<ajmitch> jcater: want me to try & build you a debug version of wxpython & wxwindows?
