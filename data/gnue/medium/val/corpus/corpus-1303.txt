Keith_jgrs (jorgre@63.74.24.9) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Keith_jgrs> is GNUe Reports better than Reportlab?
<jbailey> Probably not.  What's a reportlab? =)
<jamest> GNUe Reports is better than everything
<jamest> yeah!
<Keith_jgrs> :D
<Keith_jgrs> http://www.reportlab.com/toolkit/index.html
<Keith_jgrs> A library for PDF reports
<jcater> reportlab is a PDF library mostly
<jcater> not really a reporting application
<jcater> it is the pdf library for their non-free reporting tool
<jcater> gnue reports will most likely use that pdf library, as a matter of fact
<Keith_jgrs> seems very mature
<jcater> at least, initially
<jbailey> jcater: For generating PDFs?
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> that's what it is
<jcater> a PDF abstraction library
<jcater> the actual "ReportLab" reporting product is non-free
<Keith_jgrs> hmm yeah
<jcater> but the GPL'd pdf toolkit is very nice
<jcater> at least, iirc it's gpl
<Keith_jgrs> which one?
<jcater> the reportlab pdf toolkit is free
<jcater> the reportlab reporting tool is not
<jcater> but the pdf toolkit is very good, from what I gather
<jbailey> Failing that, use whatever gnome uses.
<Keith_jgrs> yeah i see
<jbailey> libgnomeprint generates PDFs.
<jamest> libgnomeprint requires gnome libs
<jcater> my first goal will to output very robust postscript
<jcater> from there many things could be generated via 3rd party stuff
<jbailey> jamest: I thought they were trying to limit how much gnome libs each component needs.
<jamest> they may now
<jamest> it's been a few years
<jbailey> And libgnomeprint is likely to get win32'd soon, IIRC.
<Keith_jgrs> hmmm
<Keith_jgrs> so you'd choose it over reportlab's ?
<jamest> i'd choose whichever gave me the greatest portability
<jcater> and works well within python
<Keith_jgrs> course
<jamest> (of course :)
<Keith_jgrs> any plans to output reports in MS Word or Ms Excel?
<Keith_jgrs> or RTF
<jcater> well, the way reports is structured, there's no reason we can't have a "gnomeprint" printer driver
<jcater> Keith_jgrs: absolutely
<jcater> well, likely RTF insteado f DOC, but definitely
<jcater> s/insteado f/instead of/
<Keith_jgrs> yeah, something editable

<jbailey> My 60gb is 2gb for nt2k, 1gb swap, 1gb * 10 for Hurd, everything else in one big ext2 for GNU/Linux
<chillywilly> making partitions helps in backing things up imho

Action: chillywilly prefers xfs file system
<jbailey> Vee2d2: It's a mistype, sorry.
<Vee2d2> sure, but the migration to ext3 is much easier, chillywilly
<ajmitch> chillywilly: didn't you get major toastage with xfs one time? :)

<ajmitch> ugh
<ajmitch> chillywilly: your laptop?
<chillywilly> toastage?

<chillywilly> I am curious
<chillywilly> cause for me I don't get any real icons
<lex> exactly
<jbailey> nautilus is fine for me.
<lex> jbailey: what version?
<jbailey> to get the icons, you have to install a the icons theme.
<jbailey> ii  nautilus       2.2.0.2-1      File manager and graphical shell (GNOME2)
<ajmitch> hey people, what sort of capabilities does GNUe reports have? can it do graphs & the like?
<jcater> not yet
<ajmitch> ok, are there plans/ideas for doing so?
<jcater> yes
<ajmitch> excellent
Action: ajmitch had someone asking about it, and it's something i'd like too :)
<lex> Ive an icons theme....the snow apple theme.....and it still doesnt run....can you do me a favor and check what the /gnome/interfaces/icon_theme field in your gconf-editor says?
<jcater> my brain dump is in gnue/reports/doc/report-notes.txt
<ajmitch> k
<chillywilly> I have icon themes
<jcater> but note that's my notepad
<chillywilly> still no real icons
<jcater> so may or may not make complete sense :)
<jbailey> chillywilly: Which package?
<jbailey> and what version?
<chillywilly> but I haven't ran Gnome is a while so I don't care
<jbailey> Ah, I like gnome.
<chillywilly> in fact I am thinking of ripping it out to save some space
<lex> I like gnome..... jbailey ive the ICON-SnowApple theme 
<chillywilly> jbailey: the gnome from debian sid
<ajmitch> jcater: it makes a little bit of sense :)
Action: jamest blinks
<jbailey> Dunno.  When I loaded gnome-icon-theme it all started working fine.
<jamest> chillywilly?  without gnome?
<lex> Cant get gnome-theme-manager to work either
<ajmitch> jamest: want some pills for that  heart condition? :)
<chillywilly> apt-hey install gnome-icon-theme?
<lex> AHA
<chillywilly> well I'd like to have both installed...just because I like to change based on my mood :P
<lex> I wish apt was smarter than that....its a brand new package
<chillywilly> but nautilus is b0rked
<chillywilly> so I don't want to look at it
<lex> IT WORKS NOW

<chillywilly> what package did you install?

<chillywilly> aaah, Gnome
<chillywilly> I did miss her a little bit
<chillywilly> it just seems nautils is misson some config stuff
<chillywilly> missing
<chillywilly> like how the hell do I turn make my home dir as my desktop off...I can't find anything to change it back
<jbailey> Hmm  Looks like that's one of the preferences they took away.  Probably have to touch it in gconf.
<chillywilly> why
<jbailey> Or just rm the .nautilus files
<chillywilly> why did they do that?
<jbailey> Because having preferences like that is a bad UI.
<chillywilly> that's fsking annoying
<jbailey> Your grandmother shouldn't ever see that option.
<chillywilly> gah
<jbailey> You, me, and other geeks can fire up gconf and tweak to our hearts content.
<chillywilly> see that's fsjcing rediculous
<jbailey> So they accomidate both.
<jbailey> It's not at all.
<chillywilly> piss on that
<chillywilly> I want to be able to cusomtize like a mofo
<jbailey> I find that where I install gnome, people take to it *faster* than they take to win32.
<jbailey> then do it.
<jbailey> Use gconf.
<jbailey> It's designed for you.
<chillywilly> using gconf is not frelling an easy thing
<jbailey> Have you actually tried recently?
<chillywilly> the gui editor or the command line thing?
<jbailey> It's nice.  No more hunting through which application to change a setting in.  It's all there.
<jamest> they target gconf at unstable people w/ trout fetishes?
Action: jamest is glad he's using kde
<jbailey> gui
<chillywilly> whatever man kde has nothing up on Gnome...except maybe it is a little less resource intensive although if I can find the option to change the way nautilus draws the desktop (to the less resource intensive way) then that will solve my big gripe with it
<jbailey> I haven't tried kde it a year, but I found it more resource intesive than gnome.
<chillywilly> kde makes it easy to find shit though
<chillywilly> well jbailey  that is false
Action: ajmitch yawns
<jbailey> On my P3 750mhz it was slow.
<chillywilly> I hate the way meta city delays in minimizing windows
<jbailey> chillywilly: Take a logic class.  Anecdotal evidence can never be false.
<chillywilly> 3.x?
<chillywilly> wtf?
<jbailey> It's an impression.  A person's perception of the world is always correct from their point of view.
<chillywilly> I think it's probably faster cause of gcc 3.2.x
<jcater> true dat
<jcater> consider another example of anecdotal evidence....
<jcater> I had 30 ppl on a dual 450Mhz running KDE 3.0
<jcater> with nar a complaint
<jcater> but we both are right :)
<chillywilly> well my impression has been the ther way around witha machine that has less then what you used
<chillywilly> less resources
<jbailey> jcater: Wow.  30 people on a dual 450 is impressive on its own. =)

<dsmith> We use openoffice all the time.

<revDeke> jbailey: i do read logs (sorry for not popping in yesterday)
<revDeke> getting pimpslapped at work hard past week and shows no signs of letting up
<revDeke> i have not tested, but have barely had time to read email much less do something usefull :(
<revDeke> i have a board meeting for local non profit tonight and when i get home i will try to take a look see
Suit (~alala@zeilers.demon.nl) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> mr Jagrs: i use .rtf file creation daily in production with GNUe Reports (a version from 05/2002 even)
<revDeke> jcater / jamest i agree 100% at this time libgnomeprint is not path of least resistance
<revDeke> .ps file is probably best bet
<revDeke> and looking at reportlab might be a good thing a bit later
<revDeke> project coming up has me needing to abuse reports so jcater better start shuddering now :)
<revDeke> hi Suit 
<Suit> evenin
<revDeke> btw: nautilus is evil
<ajmitch> yeah, i need to have a simple way of getting repots up
<revDeke> everytime i upgrade all of sid is breaks in a horrid way
<revDeke> when i log into gnome again
<revDeke> it starts like a million instances of nautilus
<revDeke> no matter what i do
<jcater> revDeke: what's they joke?
<revDeke> i have to pump out to the vt
<jcater> "Hey, Doctor, everytime I do xxxxx, it hurts"
<revDeke> and killall nautilus
<jcater> "Doctor: Well, don't do xxx then!"
<revDeke> then uninstall nautilus
<revDeke> jcater: the sick thing
<revDeke> i i keep uninstalling the fscking thing
<revDeke> i dont use it
<revDeke> but when i do an upgrade
<revDeke> some damn gnome package thinks it needs it
<revDeke> and installs it again
Action: revDeke is almost ready to ditch gnome again
Action: revDeke ditched it completely for about a year and went to fluxbox
<revDeke> but wifey was using gnome and liked it
<revDeke> so i started using again to test gnome2 before upgrading her
<Vee2d2> it's a love/hate relationship right now.. =)
<revDeke> now that kde 3.1 is out maybe i will change to that
<revDeke> and if i get it comfy i will change her
<revDeke> the problem is we use no kde apps
<revDeke> she liked the desktop
<Vee2d2> I swear if gnome-terminal dies on me one more time I just might try kde again just to spite it.. =/
<revDeke> but hated that there was no integration :(
<revDeke> to all the gnome apps
<jcater> revDeke: one word
<jcater> Geramil
<jcater> err
<jcater> Geramik
<jcater> w/KDE 3.1
<revDeke> what is geramik?
<jcater> gnome and kde apps look identical
<revDeke> its not a look thing
<Vee2d2> identical, meaning everything looks gnomeish?
<jcater> lol
<jcater> no, seriously
<jcater> it's pretty
<jcater> like kde
<revDeke> for example if she konq and tried to drag a picture into evolution it wont work
<jcater> ah, yeah
<revDeke> but if she uses nautilus and evolution it does
<revDeke> those are the kind of things that kill it integration wise for her
dyfet (~dyfet@pool-141-153-147-83.mad.east.verizon.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> i would switch her to kmail, BUT
<revDeke> she has been going on evolution for a year or so now and not complaining
<revDeke> and well
<revDeke> you married guys can understand a "leave a good thing alone" 
<Suit> Even unmarried ones do
Action: Suit goes nback lurking
<revDeke> dyfet: saw your email
<revDeke> im freaking on tony 
<revDeke> has he gone insane?
<dyfet> lol that was quick
<revDeke> what the heck is up with him inviting M$ to talk on "shared source" at an "Open Source" convention?
<revDeke> its one thing for m$ to be paid exhibitor at a linux event
<revDeke> but its another to invite them to speak at a conference in which they have no products fitting the bill
<dyfet> Does OSI hold a valid trademark on the term?  I heard not, so I suppose anything could call itself "Open Source"
<revDeke> no
<revDeke> i wish they did
<ajmitch> hi dyfet
<revDeke> btw: this is why rms is right and OSI is wrong
<ajmitch> what's up?
<revDeke> open source is all well and good, but it leaves huge gap
<revDeke> as i can get SAP source code for R/3 if i have enough money
<revDeke> but it doesnt meet any of the freedoms
<dyfet> I had that discussion in brief with Don Marti at LW in regards to the awarding of an "Open Source excellance award" to Microsoft...
<revDeke> of free software
<dyfet> (in regard to trademark and use of the term "Open Source")
Action: ajmitch is guessing this is about mr stanco - i saw an invitation on the FD list to an conference thing
<revDeke> dyfet: i guess my piss and moan is linuxworld is a commerical event
<revDeke> driven by dollars and cents
<ajmitch> i could be wrong :)
<revDeke> so i EXPECT them to cave to people with cash
<revDeke> BUT
<revDeke> and i repeat BUT
<revDeke> eGovOS should not have ANY dollar and cents motivation
<revDeke> furthermore Tony Stanco is the chair
<revDeke> he at one point claimed to be a free software champion and tried to do Free Developers
<revDeke> even employing the help of dyfet and rms
<revDeke> so im utterly shocked by this
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> i was involved with FD remember
<revDeke> i.e. they can do what they like
<dyfet> Tony has a conference that is also cheap with speakers...I guess they offered to pay for theirs :)
<revDeke> i just want to be on record i called a rat a rat 3 years ago :)
<revDeke> or however long ago the FD stuff was
<ajmitch> can you believe he actually mailed the FD list to invite FreeDevelopers people along? :)
Action: revDeke hates to admit that
Action: jbailey is back (gone 00:38:00)
<ajmitch> wb jeff
<revDeke> anyhow thats my rant for the day... must get back to less important things
<ajmitch> heh
<revDeke> see ya all later tonight
<jbailey> Wow.  Derek *and* David at the same time.

<Suit> Question: About app server, web site states: "user-defineable business objects". Is that user as in user or user as in "not core gnue developer" ?
<reinhard> that is

<reinhard> i would say

<reinhard> much like not every secretary does set up excel macros but it's a "user" thing
<jcater> someday when you have time
<jcater> and I have time too :)
<reinhard> eh
<Chipaca> hi all
<reinhard> what about now?
<reinhard> :)
<chillywilly> whatcha talkin' about?
<jcater> reinhard: has any progress been made on what the actual business object "definitions" are going to look like?
<chillywilly> k, well I have to go get food and a new HD and stuff like that
Mr_You (~rouzer@gso167-138-145.triad.rr.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<chillywilly> there's this neat xml markup that this one guy made...
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<reinhard> jcater: we have very much decided to have those "definitions" in the database
<reinhard> for various reasons
<jcater> is a schema in place for those?
<reinhard> this is just what i am currently working on
<reinhard> s/am/would be if i had time/
<reinhard> currently i'm planning to have it quite simple in the start and to grow it as we see what we need
<jcater> ok
<reinhard> but as you might have noticed siesel hasn't been seen for quite a long time here
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> where is he?
<reinhard> so i'm acutally lacking contradiction
<ajmitch> busy with family? busy with work?
<reinhard> well at least constructive contradiction
<reinhard> ;-)
<reinhard> i think quite busy with work
<ajmitch> ok
<reinhard> probably and/or study
<Suit> But how do you see these objects, are they SQL statements? Or code? (/me is a bit new at (implementing) such concepts)
<reinhard> think of a simple database table
<reinhard> then add some "calculated fields"
<reinhard> that are accessible as if they were stored in the database but calculated by a given formula
<reinhard> then further add some "methods" that is code to operate on the data
<reinhard> the combination of those 3 we call a "business object"
<jcater> reinhard: have y'all done any coding on these "calculated fields" ??
<reinhard> not yet
<jcater> as I'm doing a "formula" class for reports
<jcater> that I'm putting in common
<reinhard> unfortunately we've been very slow
<reinhard> um
<jcater> that sounds exactly the same
<reinhard> in that case s/unfortunately/fortunately/ :-)
dsmith (~dsmith@borg.altus.cc) left irc: "later.."
Action: jcater is hoping we can collaborate to get double use out of them
<reinhard> sounds good
<Suit> Ok, thanks for the insight into (future) functionality. Gonna quit since I am on dial-up for another few weeks
<reinhard> you're welcome
<Chipaca> do you think these business objects can be purely virtual?
Suit (~alala@zeilers.demon.nl) left irc: "gone"
<Chipaca> I mean
<Chipaca> err
<Chipaca> something like a view
<reinhard> we have discussed such a thing
<reinhard> but we aren't sure yet how exactly to do it
<reinhard> we want different "views" on the same objects depending on permissions
