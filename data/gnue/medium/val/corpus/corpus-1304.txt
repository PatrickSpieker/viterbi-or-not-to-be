<Vee2d2> mornin psu
<psu> good morning
<aaron___> forms depends on a called mx.DateTime it looks like, the site mentioned to download it doesn't seem to be functioning, is there somewhere else to get this? 
<Vee2d2> not running debian, I guess? 
<psu> i must admin i though we had removed that dependency
<psu> which version are you using? CVS, 0.4.x?

<btami> hello
<ra3vat> hello
<btami> there is a "<$ tabs () >" appears in some places in our web site
<btami> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/depends.php
<btami> youe see this too ?
<ra3vat> yes
<btami> ok:)

<psu> btami: it's a "known bug"
<psu> basically, the web site is currently a bit of a hybrid
<psu> most of it is generated from some nifty python scripts that generate static html
<psu> but the downloads pages are still using php as the code to do the file listings in python is currently in "pre-alpha"
<psu> (i.e. doesn't work)
<psu> the <? tabs () > is a tag for the python which php can't grok
<psu> I have taken an executive decision that this is less of a problem than having a broken downloads listing ;-)
<psu> I probably won't have time to fix it this weekend, as I have the chuch year end accounts to get finished
<psu> If anyone has nothing better to do, and can stand the sight of my baby-python coding style
<psu> you could always send me a patch
<psu> it's the def filelist (directory) function that's b()rked

<psu> BTW, I don't think we've had a gratitous rant about how good python is for a while, so here goes
<psu> I found doing the site in python so much easier than with php
<psu> What the man said about python being "the most powerful computer language you can still read" is spot on
<psu> And bear in mind that php is actually designed as a web apps lang, unlike python
<psu> (I know I could/should have used Zope, but that would have involved persuading FSF to install Zope on www.gnu.org
<psu> which they probably would have done, but we would have been stuck maintaining it)
<psu> Of course, I guess "GNU Enterprise supporter says python is great" is up there with other non-stories like
<psu> "Pope condemns sin" or "Trouble in Middle East"
<psu> or "chillywilly seen with trout"

<ajmitch> that's not good
<ajmitch> ah well, he'll find out soon enough ;
<chillywilly> HEH
Action: ajmitch did paste your comment to him
<aaron___> i was trying to get gnue-designer to work yesterday i keep getting - No module named forms.GFConfig
<aaron___> i don't know python so i'm kinda lost
<ajmitch> installed gnue forms?
<SachaS> chillywilly: how can i listen to freenode radio ???
<ajmitch> [17:22:10] <ajmitch> [17:20:36] <chillywilly> cause a lot of time sshd doesn't start back up for and I have to smack it around some
<ajmitch> [17:22:33] <skwashd> yeah .... i can drive on site if i really need to
<chillywilly> SachaS: http://stream.us.wopn.org:10000/{broadband,modem}.ogg
<chillywilly> erm, maybe you wannt try the .au sevrers
<dsmith> ajmitch: I don't think I would ever upgrade a box non-localy. Especially going to unstable.
<chillywilly> nm sounds like the show is ending
<chillywilly> :(
<SachaS> chillywilly thats http://stream.au.wopn.org ?
<ajmitch> dsmith: depends on atmospheric crack levels
