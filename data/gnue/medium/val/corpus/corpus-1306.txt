<jamest_> I'm debating on breaking cvs or just syncing tarballs with him
<jamest_> breakage in this case means forms barely works only in wx mode, designer is toast

<ajmitch> jamest_: you're planning to break HEAD?
<jamest_> i want to
<ajmitch> ok, i'll just grab what's in cvs at the moment & stick with that
<jamest_> actually, i'm not crazy about it but I know others are wanting to work on the UI drivers
<ajmitch> yeah, i do
<jamest_> then you want me to break head
<jamest_> it's no where near the same 
<ajmitch> i have a project that needs done within 2-3 weeks :)
<jamest_> in wx? or other?
<ajmitch> i may have to go back to 0.4.3
<ajmitch> gtk2
<jamest_> dude
<jamest_> i think the new ui drivers will be easier to implement
<jamest_> than the old
<ajmitch> yeah
<jamest_> take a look at www.gnuenterprise.org/~jamest/forms.tgz 
<jamest_> IIRC
<jamest_> it's the tarball of the new setup
<ajmitch> i want to catch up with jbailey on that gtk2 stuff
<ajmitch> yeah, i got that tarball
<jamest_> he's wanting to work on it this week which is why I'm wanting to check it in
psu (psu@public1-wear2-3-cust32.midd.broadband.ntl.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest_> you got it alreay?
<jamest_> already
<jamest_> did someone post that previously?
<ajmitch> jamest_: i'm wanting to work on it this week
Action: ajmitch blames jcater
<ajmitch> he didn't post in channel :)
Action: jcater_ looks around
<jcater_> who, me?
<ajmitch> yes you
Action: jamest_ thwaps jcater around with a day old donut
<jamest_> you feel this will be harder to work w/ than 0.4.x ui drivers?
Action: jamest_ thought the new layout was easier to follow
<ajmitch> i feel that i'll need something stable to work on :)
<ajmitch> but i also need gtk2 drivers
<jamest_> well, honestly stability wize we're about the same I imagine
<ajmitch> at the moment
<jamest_> it's missing features that kills head
<ajmitch> yep
<jamest_> as all the pop-ups are getting reimplemented as <dialog>
<jamest_> even login box :)
Action: ajmitch must hunt down jbailey
<jamest_> please do, the only reason I've not commited yet is lack of jbailey
<ajmitch> the only reason i haven't started work yet is lack of talking to him about it
<jcater_> for the record, this commit will break designer's support of forms
<jcater_> for a little while
<ajmitch> yeah, i realise that
Action: jcater_ is making that public for psu's KCs :)
<ajmitch> what do you mean by 'support of forms'?
<ajmitch> designer will be unusable completely?
<jcater_> as in, you load a form
<jcater_> designer will segfault
<psu> use emacs or vi for .gfds, like in the old days
<ajmitch> oh, that's no problem :)
<psu> pre-jcater
Action: ajmitch wonders what the difference is there ;)
<jamest_> it's the improved driver performance
<jamest_> you segfault instantly instead of after 1/2 hour of unsaved work
<ajmitch> lol
Action: ajmitch wants to work on this stuff today :(
<jamest_> If you are going to work from the cvs as it sits I'd say go ahead
<jamest_> as I thought jbailey wanted to work from the new drivers
<jamest_> and we can just port your stuff up
<jamest_> (i hope)
<ajmitch> but then i'll be duplicating work :)
<jamest_> yeah
<jamest_> or work from the tarball and I'll get this in cvs tonight
<ajmitch> has jbailey started on his hacking?
<jamest_> no clue
<ajmitch> gar
Action: ajmitch ponders what to do
<jamest_> i say get started :)
<jamest_> what I would do is get the new drivers gtk'ized
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> and then beat jbailey up
<jamest_> if you have that much complete then you're really close to being functional now
<jamest_> in a pinch we could reactivate the old style dialogs
<ajmitch> heh
<jamest_> but I prefer not too
<ajmitch> so work on the gtk2 driver in your tarball?
<jamest_> I don't think the designer breakage is too bad
<jamest_> i think I would
<jamest_> i removed the gtk dir from the tarball to make it smaller
<jamest_> and reduce my glimpse file hits :)
<jamest_> but it's still the same basic structure
<jamest_> wrt widget construction
<jamest_> only now they are split out into a widgets dir
<ajmitch> heh ok
<ajmitch> might as well start from scratch then (copying the wx driver across)
Action: ajmitch clears room on desk for 2nd monitor
<jamest_> dude
<ajmitch> yes?
<jamest_> almost everything should be cut n paste from the main driver
<ajmitch> yup
<jamest_> with a little tweaking
<jamest_> ok
Action: jamest_ did not want you starting from complete scratch
<jamest_> what time is it in the land of kiwis?
<ajmitch> i said from scratch (copy wx stuff)
<ajmitch> Tue Feb 11 10:03:44 NZDT 2003
<jamest_> ah, mid morning
<jamest_> ok, i'll make it a point to be on tonight
<ajmitch> i really wish this other monitor did more than 640x480 :)
<ajmitch> ok
<jamest_> i really with a had a 2nd monitor
Action: jamest_ mumbles something about lucky no good rotten...... :)
<jcater_> ya need to get that lithp taken care of too
<ajmitch> heheh
<ajmitch> it was off an old 386 box :)
<jamest_> lol
<psu> ordinary lithp or emacs-lithp?
<jcater_> visual lithp
<jamest_> ajmitch: our strategy for today is to fsck up designer soooooo bad that jcater can't stand to sit back and watch
<jamest_> ajmitch: at which point he'll jump in and fix it up for us
<jamest_> whoops forgot the /msg 
<ajmitch> jamest_: think we can do something to reports as well?
<jcater_> don't worry... I'm fscking up reports on my own
Action: jcater_ is working on formula support
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> excellent, i need to do stats in reports (calculate depreciation based on purchase dat, price, and depreciation value..)
<jamest_> oooo, an output formatting
<ajmitch> btw, you want me to brush off my csv db driver?
<jamest_> s/an/and
<ajmitch> oh nice
<jcater_> yeah
<jcater_> and output formatting
<jamest_> oooo, and barcode output
<ajmitch> i've got a small 900k cvs file to import
<jcater_> yes
<jcater_> and barcode support
<jcater_> see
<ajmitch> barcode output! yay!
<jamest_> sigh, he's agreeing too easily
Action: jcater_ has the driver for barcode support almost done
<jcater_> it's a python wrapper around gnu barcode
<jamest_> this must not be the jcater we know and lothe^H^H^Hve
<ajmitch> we have to generate barcodes frim this inventory app to stick on everything ;)
<jcater_> ajmitch: well, not to worry... I've swigged gnu barcode :)
<ajmitch> hehe, cool
<jcater_> but I can't decide if this should be a separate project (pybarcode)
<ajmitch> the barcode reader that will be used is a simple keyboard entry one
<jcater_> or if I should send as patches to gnubarcode
<jcater_> and have them do like postgresql does
<jcater_> and have their bindings in their cvs tree
<jcater_> my only problem is they seem to move slowly
Action: jcater_ thinks I'm going to do a separate project from them
<ajmitch> ok
Action: jcater_ is looking for opinions here......
<jcater_> :)
<jamest_> um
<jamest_> an opinion
<jamest_> hmmmm
<jamest_> you should spend more time gnue'n
<ajmitch> :)
<jcater_> um
<jamest_> oooo
<jcater_> this will give you barcode support in python
<jcater_> this is gnue'n
<jamest_> and make that a seperate project too
<jcater_> :)
<jamest_> i mean in general
<jamest_> i'm excited about the barcoding
<jamest_> and the less real life you have the more cool toys gnue gets
<jcater_> my next biggie to come up soon
<jcater_> is a graphing library for python
<jcater_> I can't decide if that should be done in gnue common
<jcater_> or externally
<ajmitch> jamest_: does jeff have your forms tarball?
<jcater_> as python doesn't have a good graphing package
<jamest_> ajmitch: no
<jamest_> ajmitch: at least I don't think so
<ajmitch> ok, harassing jeff by email
<chillywilly> is 0.5.0 going t contain this ui rewrite?
<chillywilly> s/t/to/
<jcater_> yes
<psu> chillywilly: looks like it
<jcater_> 0.5.0 is shaping up to be a really major release
<ajmitch> yay
<psu> from a practical point of view, "upgrade to 0.5.0, it breaks all your old forms" is a less attractive msg than
<ajmitch> the feature plan been updated to match?
<chillywilly> but no native win32 driver?
<jcater_> chillywilly: possibly
<psu> "upgrad to 0.5.0 it breaks all your old forms but has radikool new UI drivers"
<jcater_> or at least one of the 0.5.x releases
<chillywilly> well I was thinking of writing one
<ajmitch> depends if someone is willing to submit themselves to writing a win32 driver
<chillywilly> maybe start with kde first
<ajmitch> ok
<chillywilly> ;P
<psu> ajmitch: iirc, the feature plans don't split by point release
<ajmitch> psu: they should ;)
<psu> so things are planned for 0.5.x, not for 0.5.0 or 0.5.1
<chillywilly> but if things keep changing that would make it hard
<ajmitch> chillywilly: big change landing tonight
<ajmitch> don't know what else is planned to change
<jamest_> i've started a qt driver
<jamest_> the format changed
<chillywilly> the gtk2 driver looks like they copied the wx one is that the way to go?
<chillywilly> ok
<jamest_> the ui drivers are *hopefully* cleaner
<ajmitch> chillywilly: that's what i'm doing now - starting a new gtk2 driver :)
<jamest_> <dialog> support
<chillywilly> ok
<jamest_> i'd love to see a win32 dirver
<jamest_> um
<jcater_> chillywilly: all this stuff is in line with our feature plan of 2 months ago, iirc
<jamest_> it is, i verified it last week
<chillywilly> sorry, I try to keep up but well life happens
<psu> in effect, all that has happened is that we are skipping the planned 0.5.0 
<chillywilly> I need to get rid f my life
<chillywilly> s/f/of/
<ajmitch> jamest_: i see the gtk2 driver is in the tarball
<psu> as no-one seemed to need/want the gfd breakage w/o the new UI
<ajmitch> is that an untouched one?
<psu> so what would have been 0.5.1 will now be 0.5.0
<jamest_> it is?
<jcater_> psu: the issue was that once we release 0.5.0, people expect the 0.5.x series to kind of stabilize (at least based on 0.4.0 experience)
<chillywilly> what is this tarball that you guys are talking about?
<jcater_> but we weren't at that point :(
Action: jamest_ swore he removed all drivers except wx  from that tarball on my page 
<ajmitch> chillywilly: s3kr3t k0d3
<jamest_> www.gnuenterprise.org/~jamest/forms.tgz
<chillywilly> ui rewrite?
<ajmitch> yeah
<chillywilly> ok
<psu> jcater: to me, 0.4 remains stable unless & until the code mastas (j*) say otherwise
<jcater_> I think we've been pretty good at keeping 0.4.x stable
<ajmitch> well i have 0.4.3 debs for jbailey to process
<psu> doesn;t Linux do stable=even, unstable=odd
<jcater_> that's the most point releases we've done since 0.0.x
<jcater_> (which didn't count)
<ajmitch> yeah, i think that 0.4.x is pretty good
<jcater_> psu: yeah... that's a debate much akin to the documentation format debates
<ajmitch> when do you want to drop ongoing support/patches for 0.4.x?
<psu> If I was starting a project using gnue today, I'd use 0.4.x
<jcater_> after this 0.5.0 ordeal, I really am leaning towards odd/even again
<psu> and just keep an eye on things that are know to break the gfd conversion script 
<chillywilly> so ajmitch are you starting with code fromt he tarball or from CVS HEAD?
<psu> (e.g. complex triggers that go poking around in internals that they shouldn't)
<psu> and avoid them
<ajmitch> chillywilly: tarball
<jamest_> cvs head won't be broken till tonight
<jamest_> it's still the 0.4.x driver style
<chillywilly> you're syncing it up tonight?
<ajmitch> psu: well i'm being stupid & doing stuff with CVS
<jamest_> i plan to as no one screamed NO when I said I wanted to
<chillywilly> what
<chillywilly> blah
<chillywilly> oopsie
<ajmitch> chillywilly: yes, you've not started on a ui driver, right?
<chillywilly> nope, just looked at the code some
<ajmitch> ok
<psu> jamest_ : are the project papo boys still using 0.4.x or equivalent? 
<ajmitch> jamest_ says driver writing will be easier now
<chillywilly> couple days ago I did
<psu> They are they only people who might have an issue w/broke CVS
<jcater_> psu: they are using 0.3.x or so last I checked
<jcater_> :0
<psu> ok
<chillywilly> yeek
<ajmitch> ouch

<chillywilly> win32 driver is a pretty big deal imho, while M$ still has the desktop
<jamest_> it's a huge deal
<jamest_> however I start getting mental whenever I try and gnue on wifes win98 box
<psu> time for bed 
<chillywilly> I see...
<chillywilly> I might have similar issues
<chillywilly> wonder if wine could work...

<chillywilly> would be nice to be able to develop on gnu/linux
Action: chillywilly pictures himself running up and downt he stairs to test it ;P
<jamest_> vnc
<chillywilly> ah
<chillywilly> duh
<chillywilly> good idea
<chillywilly> would give me a chance to play with it
<chillywilly> what vnc software would you install on winders?
<jcater_> vnc
<ajmitch> i've got a spare box here, i might dump windows on it
<ajmitch> will need to for gtk2 driver
<ajmitch> "I've done nothing.  jamest told me to wait until he had done the commit

<ajmitch> ok, jamest, seems like we had a deadlock situation ;)
<chillywilly> hmm, I think I need to add setup vnc to my TODO list for the day
<jamest_> ack!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<jamest_> that's because he's not been in here and has been msg'ing me at my home login
<ajmitch> heh
Action: ajmitch emailed him
<jamest_> I'm jamest with a _
<chillywilly> is the HOWTO a good document?
<ajmitch> yup, i figured that
<chillywilly> aw crap my konq is b0rked

<chillywilly> hi dsmith 
<dsmith> chillywilly: Greetings from the land of FreeBSD 5.0!
<chillywilly> ack ;)
<dsmith> chillywilly: I might actually have a working acpi now.
Action: dsmith kicks freebsd ports for building all of gtk just because I did a make install of gkrellm2
<chillywilly> who needs that? real men get a laptop that has both ACPI and APM ;)
<dsmith> chillywilly: But I'm very geeky and want to see my cpu temp.
<chillywilly> HEH
<chillywilly> acpi is supposed to be greatly improved in kernel 2.5.x
<dsmith> chillywilly: I've never gotten acpi to work right in Linux
<dsmith> And I don't think I'll run a 2.5 kernel either.  But I'm glas to hear it's improving.
<dsmith> s/glas/glad/
<chillywilly> 2.6.0 is probably just around the corner
<dsmith> !!
<chillywilly> dsmith: wimp
Action: dsmith admits it.
<dsmith> But I usually run Debian unstable
<chillywilly>  actually I did compile a 2.5.x kernel and I thought it was borked but you have to pgrade modutils
<chillywilly> upgrade*
<ajmitch> i compiled one but it never booted
Action: chillywilly runs debian unstable as a development machine
<ajmitch> got to "Ok, booting the kernel..." and hung there
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> mine booted bt complain about modules
<chillywilly> then I found out I needed a newer modutils, etc.
<chillywilly> and I have not bothered with it since then
<ajmitch> nah, you need a new package
<chillywilly> it was very broken though
Action: ajmitch wonders if building with gcc 2.95.4 would make any difference
<ajmitch> they totally changed the module loading & unloading code a couple of releases ago ;)
<chillywilly> yea well I didn't know there's now way I am going to subscribe to lkml
<chillywilly> I don't need to read that much crap
Action: ajmitch is not subscribed to it
<chillywilly> I thoght there was a vnc howto?
<chillywilly> thought*
<ajmitch> dunno
<ajmitch> vnc is simple anyway
<chillywilly> do you do it over ssh?
<chillywilly> well that doesn't matter for me anyway inside my own network :P
<chillywilly> don't I need some kind of vnc server running on winders if I wish to view it on this box?
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<chillywilly> hmmm, I should set it up both ways
<ajmitch> yeah
<jamest_> you need vnc on client 
<ajmitch> i usually run over ssh
<jamest_> and a web browser on the linux box
<jamest_> you'd prefer the linux viewer though
<jamest_> but it's not needed
<ajmitch> i prefer the client, rather than the java applet
<jcater_> I have never tried the java client
<jcater_> the thought of it scares me :)
<ajmitch> hhe
<jamest_> it works
<jamest_> but I prefer the client

<ajmitch> how disappointing
<chillywilly> :(
<jcater_> "Mr Wakefield says Windows won out when support and management costs, migration timeframes and costs, and remote support options were factored in..." 
<jcater_> loosely translated, that means
<jcater_> "After Mr Wakefield returns from his Microsoft-sponsored vacation in the Caymans, he announced that Windows won out when support and management costs, migration timeframes and costs, and remote support options were factored in..."
<chillywilly> vnc is so cool
Action: chillywilly can see the winders box
<jcater_> I can understand the migration timeframes and costs argument
<ajmitch> heh
<chillywilly> woop woop
<jcater_> as that's a valid argument
<jcater_> but remote administration?
<jcater_> he's on crack
<ajmitch> jcater_: this is why GNUe needs a POS :)

<ajmitch> i can check, given a few min
<jamest> i swore the tarball was functional

<ajmitch> i presume i need to install it 
<jamest> no
<jamest> you can run from cvs
<ajmitch> you've committed?

<ajmitch> interesting changes to the driver that you've done, splitting everything out
<jamest> the idea is further down the road, like after I quit, the dynamic loading will lead to people being able to add new widget types for their local install
<jamest> this will mean a std api to the drivers and widgets which isn't completed yet
<jamest> the dialogs will work the same way
<jamest> you put a file or dir in uidrivers/_base/dialogs at it'll be loaded at form startup as part of the base set of dialogs
<ajmitch> excellent
<ajmitch> like custom graphical parts, eg embedding a graph into a form? :)
<jamest> you bet, just add that to part of the feature set for jcater's upcoming graphing lib
<jamest> he won't mind
<jamest> I'm starting to worry about jcater
<jamest> he didn't even whimper on that one
<jamest> you think we finally broke his spirit?
Action: jcater is knee-deep in zope and interchange land
<ajmitch> he's doing a graphing lib?
<jcater> you just wait, buddy!
<jcater> I've gotten you hooked on reports now!
Action: ajmitch pays homage to jcater
Action: chillywilly kicks kde
<chillywilly> I can't start krfb to save my life
<jcater> careful... kde's been known to kick back
<jamest> they don't call the panel "kicker" for nothing
Action: chillywilly cowers in fear...NOT
<jcater> of course not
<jcater> 'cause you kower in fear
<jcater> fewl
<jamest> chillywilly: i'd just grab the vnc client binary
<chillywilly> I suppose
<chillywilly> I can use the viewer though

<jamest> i've not had a chance to try the new kde vnc tools
<jamest> so I can't really be much help
<chillywilly> well it's pretty straight forward when it works
<chillywilly> I can see the winders desktop
<chillywilly> I just wanna be able to go the other way too
<ajmitch> oh, that
<ajmitch> that's fairly simple :)
<chillywilly> I know use the real vnc tools

<ajmitch> chillywilly: so fix it!
<chillywilly> I thought the kde 3.x in sid was not fully done
<ajmitch> stop complaining!
<jamest> that's what I run
<chillywilly> shutup
<chillywilly> why the heck doesn't it want to upgrade to these debs then?
<jamest> it may not be done but everything i've tried works for me
<chillywilly> hmm hmm hmm
<jamest> you have to manually dpkg -r some things 
<chillywilly> all of these kde debs depend on one metapackage
<jamest> at least I did when going from the KL debs to the sid debs
<chillywilly> so I can pull the whole thing out
<chillywilly> apt-get --purge remove kde-cvs-snapshot
<chillywilly> ok, I'll give sid a try...always better to have the official stuff anyway, imho
<chillywilly> is psi in sid?
<Vee2d2> psi - Jabber client using Qt

<chillywilly> hopefully
Action: chillywilly is forced to use dselect and is hating it
<jamest> why dselect?
<jamest> apt-get install konqueror
<jamest> will get a huge part of kde on your system
<ajmitch> because chillywilly likes the pain
<jamest> ah
<chillywilly> I want to make sure I get it all
<jamest> you know you could probably get paid good money for that

<Vee2d2> I dont think it's all there yet, is it?

<Vee2d2> when jcater told me it was in sid, I sucked it down and turned it on, but the splash said 2.2.. I noted the next day comments on debianplanet that said some of the packages were lagging behind
<jamest> that's what I was just thinking
<jamest> the mirrors were definately beind

<jamest> chillywilly: 3.1 is in sid
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> it is in sid
<jamest> i know it is
<chillywilly> I'll take your word for it

<havoc> chillywilly: but I'm sure you mean multiplayer
<chillywilly> yea but that's not multiplayer! ;P
<chillywilly> right

<derek> sigh slow internet too painful bbl
<chillywilly> havoc: yahoo pool is pretty fun
<jamest> ok, commited for real this time
<chillywilly> kde is almost at the same version as gcc
<jamest> anyone care to cvs up and try intro.gfd?
<jamest> or dialog.gfd
<chillywilly> my system is installing debs right now...
<jamest> here victim, victim, victim
<chillywilly> have ajmitch do it ;)
<jamest> ajmitch: you really don't want that stable (sort of) cvs head do you?

<KeithJagr> jcater: I read in the last KC that work is going ro change the win32 interface...
<KeithJagr> how are things going?
<KeithJagr> in that issue
<jamest> it's still in progress
<jamest> according to cvsweb a new ui driver model was commited 8 minutes ago
<jamest> this does not have a win32 module yet
<jamest> but it will hopefully be a step in making one easier to create
<KeithJagr> hopefully
<KeithJagr> so are you discarding wx?
<jamest> yes and no
<KeithJagr> in favour of gtk ?
<jamest> it's still the first implementation in the new setup
<jamest> ajmitch and jbailey are working on a gtk2 driver 
<jcater>  I don't foresee us dropping wx support
<jamest> I'm working on the wx and I've started a qt driver
<jcater> we'll just offer additional native models
<jamest> i'm hoping that by the weekend the widget and ui driver interfaces will be will defined
<KeithJagr> what is the porpuse of using 3 GUI builders at a time?
<jcater> depending on your platform, of course
<jamest> i'm doing it becase it will help keep the driver system more ui independent
<jamest> they are working on it as I think gtk is the company std where they are
<jamest> i think
<jamest> designer will remain wx based 
<KeithJagr> good, but I would think that at this point, more energy is required on sharpen Tools, rather than working in giving support to all those GUIs
<KeithJagr> just a thought though
<jamest> the ui changes are part of new functionality being built into the forms client
<jamest> as well as a cleanup of the designer/forms interaction
<KeithJagr> I see
<jamest> the tools are still receiving effort as well
derek (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)
<KeithJagr> so, talking about the win32 GUI, when do you think the improved version will be ready to test ?
<jamest> hmmmmm
<jamest> i'm hoping to have the new drivers done this week or next
<KeithJagr> I agree that the current one tends to suck a bit
<jamest> if the win32 widgets are not radically different in design I would hope it wouldn't take long at all
chillywilly (danielb@mke-24-167-199-83.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> if we can someone willing to step up to the plate to do it
<chillywilly> what really suck is no kmix or krecord
<chillywilly> :(
<jamest> from what I've read though the gtk2 and qt drivers are supposed to run on win32
<jamest> i think qt is supposed to look native IIRC
<KeithJagr> will that imply Forms wrking out-of -the-box in gtk2?
<chillywilly> I wanted to record some guitar and throw some tracks together
<jamest> that is the goal
<KeithJagr> I've never tryed gtk2
<jamest> it was donated but incomplete
<KeithJagr> have you tested FLTK?
<KeithJagr> it seems very nice
SachaS_ (~Sacha@dialup-196-44.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> if you'd like a fltk driver would hopefully be easy to add
<jamest> the wx driver in cvs is the new model 
<jamest> it's still in flux as the interface isn't fully defined
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-44.wasp.net.au) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<KeithJagr> I see
<jamest> but you sould just have to write a wrapper UIdriver.py and 1 py file for each widget
<jamest> http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/gnue/forms/src/uidrivers/wx/widgets/label.py?rev=1.1&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup
<jamest> is an example
<jamest> sigh, i have to go now
<KeithJagr> how many widgets are there used currently?
<KeithJagr> ok
<jamest> box, button, entry, label, page, scrollbar (?)
<jamest> with various styles that implement variations like checkboxes, dropdowns, readonly entries
<jamest> l8r
jamest (~jamest@adsl-65-71-168-170.dsl.tpkaks.swbell.net) left #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> curses, just got back... i wanted to ask jamest about stuff :(
<SachaS_> hi ajmitch
<ajmitch> hi
<ajmitch> jcater: do you know much about the rtf template->pdf reports filter that jamest talked about at one stage?
<jcater> he and I both use it in production
<ajmitch> excellent
<jcater> you basically create an RTF file, and everywhere you want a field inserted fomr the database
<jcater> denote it as ::myfield1::
<jcater> e.g., Invoice # ::invoiceno::
<ajmitch> it seems like the quickest way for me to get printable & viewable reports on windows
ToyMan (~stuq@glvv-dsl3-188.citlink.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<KeithJagr> jcater: where is that reports template?
<KeithJagr> ?
<chillywilly> quick way to remove kde
<chillywilly> COLUMNS=200 dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep kde | awk '{print $2}' | xargs apt-get -y remove
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> oh and
<chillywilly> COLUMNS=200 dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep arts | awk '{print $2}' | xargs apt-get -y remove

<ajmitch> wouldn't dpkg --get-selections be easier?
<chillywilly> that would give you everything wouldn't it?
<ajmitch> well so does dpkg -l :)
<ajmitch> dpkg --get-selections |grep -v deinstall
<chillywilly> yea but I used grep and awk to get all kde packages
<ajmitch> i know that
<chillywilly> so wtf is your point then?
<ajmitch> fine, i'll leave it
<chillywilly> did you have a better way to do it?
<chillywilly> oh nm
<chillywilly> use --get-selections
<chillywilly> same difference
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> yours is longer ;)
<chillywilly> erm...
<chillywilly> man that can be taken our of context
<chillywilly> ot
<chillywilly> out
<chillywilly> lol
Action: ajmitch tries to recall the key sequence for vertical split frames
<chillywilly> in konq?
<ajmitch> emacs
<chillywilly> oh
<ajmitch> horizontal split is easy
<chillywilly> ja, but I can't remember that one either
KeithJagr (trilluser@63.74.24.9) left irc: "later"
Action: ajmitch looks on the emacs refcard.ps
<chillywilly> you hacking gtk2 driver?
<ajmitch> argh, it's upside down :)
<ajmitch> yeah
<chillywilly> I am gonna start on win32 I think
<ajmitch> i want to have old & new ones beside each other
<ajmitch> alright
<chillywilly> if I ever get my environment back in shape
Action: ajmitch pats ggv
<chillywilly> it's safe to copy the current cvs HEAD wx driver?
<ajmitch> probably not
<chillywilly> man
<ajmitch> hmm, i tried C-x 3...
<chillywilly> this needs to hurry the frell up
<ajmitch> it's probably breaking everything

<chillywilly> X crashed
<chillywilly> ;P
<dsmith> chillywilly: That's what you get for running 2.5 kernels. ;^)
<chillywilly> I'm not running 2.5
<chillywilly> it's a knowsn kde bug apparently
<chillywilly> if you mistype something int he run dialog you can get X to crash
<havoc> I am doing something potentially very silly right now
<havoc> FTP upgrade from mandrake cooker
<havoc> hmmm, this will be interesting
<chillywilly> what I did was try to run a program that wasn't installed
<dsmith> chillywilly: I knew kde was trying to be too much like windows.
<havoc> dsmith: still much better than gnome2
<havoc> better meaning stability, usability and polish
<havoc> and also much better design
<havoc> gnome is a mess
<dsmith> I agree that kde is more "together"
<Vee2d2> them's fightin words
<havoc> as a professional developer who takes engineering very seriously, gnome "offends" me
<havoc> gnome2 rather
<dsmith> I actually just use fluxbox.  None of that "desktop" spooge for me.
<havoc> to me programming is half engineering, and half art, gnome2 is neither
<chillywilly> gnome2 sucks
<havoc> big time
<havoc> unbelievably, KDE actually outperforms Gnome2 now

<dsmith> Not yet.  Broken pakages right now.
<havoc> dsmith: ah
<havoc> chillywilly: I need to use the crap I recomend
<chillywilly> havoc: wtf does what *I* use have to do with that?
<havoc> chillywilly: it also helps me provide better support
<dsmith> havoc: Sylpheed does *exactly* what I want.  And it's very fast.
<havoc> chillywilly: how can you know what to set clueless users up with if you don't use the stuff?
<dsmith> havoc: But I need to keep up on stuff for other people.
<havoc> dsmith: yes, I used it

<dsmith> I used to have my kids using wordperfect, but it stopped working for some reason, so now I have them use kword.
<havoc> chillywilly: it's easier for me to have a program setup the same way I'd set it up for a client so that when they call I am basically looking at the same thing they are
<chillywilly> and how many customer do you have on a "Linux" desktop?
<havoc> chillywilly: customers or users?
<chillywilly> what's the difference?

<havoc> dsmith: a mix
<havoc> dsmith: but mostly samba
<havoc> and ftp/sftp
<havoc> KDE makes it easy

<havoc> I haven't figured out lisa yet though :(

<dsmith> for smaba
<havoc> dsmith: lisa did?
<havoc> ah
<dsmith> konq
<dsmith> smb://yada
<havoc> lisa would be cool if I could get it to work
Action: dsmith doesn't know what lisa is
<havoc> it's a network discover daemon using TCP only to create a kind of "network neighborhood" that works w/ konq
<dsmith> havoc: DO you know of any nfs "browsers"?
<havoc> dsmith: mope, but check freshmeat
<dsmith> havoc: I've been thinking about "trim" clients for schools.  Aps are on the local disk, but home dirs are on the fileserver.  Any box can be remade with a network boot/install.
<havoc> dsmith: I'll be doing an LSTP based system very soon
<havoc> diskless clients
<chillywilly> jcater is the master at that
<chillywilly> he runs an entire call center on a couple LTSp boxen, IIRC
<chillywilly> LTSP
