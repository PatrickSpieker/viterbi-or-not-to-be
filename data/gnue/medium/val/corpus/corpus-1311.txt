<psu> mornin' all
<ajmitch> hey psu
<ajmitch> what's up?
<reinhard> moring
<psu> me, for a start
<ajmitch> psu: always a good sign ;)
<ajmitch> hmm, lag not too bad while downloading...
<psu> who was it who said, "I always get up in the morning, read the obituaries in the paper
<psu> and if I'm not in it, I leave and go to work."
<ajmitch> lol
<Isomer> hmm
<ajmitch> hi Isomer
<ajmitch> what's up?
<Isomer> excuse the flood:
<Isomer> I get up each morning, gather my wits.
<Isomer> Pick up the paper, read the obits.
<Isomer> If I'm not there I know I'm not dead.
<Isomer> So I eat a good breakfast and go back to bed.
<Isomer> Oh, how do I know my youth is all spent?
<Isomer> My get-up-and-go has got-up-and-went.
<Isomer> But in spite of it all, I'm able to grin,
<Isomer> And think of the places my get-up has been.

<Isomer> Excellent
<Isomer> ah
Action: Isomer using a 3com HomeConnect
<ajmitch> nice units, those
<ajmitch> that's the one that can do pppoa or pppoe?
<ajmitch> with the alcatel, i get the ip on ppp0, so i do all the NAT, etc with iptables
<Isomer> yah
<Isomer> ditto with the 3com
<Isomer> comes in over PPTP
<ajmitch> useful
<Isomer> so I also get the nice ppp0
<ajmitch> i use the userspace pppoa drivers for the alcatel
<ajmitch> works nicely

<jbailey> Yeah, but your winter is like the hotest days in Vancouver. =)
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> yeah, we get a bit of snow, but not too much
<Isomer> hmm
<jbailey> I hadn't realized (though it makes sense) that you guys would move the opposite direction for time change...

<jbailey> Makes sense.

<ajmitch> whois andrew miller?
<Isomer> ajmitch: I can't remember where he is, but he's not in Hamilton, but he's in NZ
<Isomer> he's a ircd coder
<ajmitch> ok ;)
<jbailey> Isomer: I'd probably prefer to bring a library. =)  I'd be worried about someone stealing the laptop while I was asleep.
<ajmitch> why mention him?
<Isomer> ajmitch: you said that there were several andrews in dunlug IIRC

<drochaid> ok, this is well OT and I'm guessing a long shot :)
<drochaid> any know some really good stationers or light card manufacturers?
<nickr> 'stationers'? 'ligcht card'?
<jcater> not in your part of the world :(
<drochaid> jcater: a lot of yours ship over here as well ...
<jcater> what are you looking for?
<drochaid> basically I'm trying to find a dark blue card with a linen finish on one side and matt on the reverse .. around 120 to 160gsm
<drochaid> I've got exactly that, but at 250gsm ... and it's too thick for my needs :(
<jcater> too thick? are you planning running these through a laser printer or something? or is the look just not right with that thickness?
<drochaid> combination of the two
dneighbo (~dneighbo@tmp-200253.flinthills.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<drochaid> I need it in A4 size, intended to be folded to A5 for a brochure cover
<drochaid> the 250gsm one goes through my laser ok, but the spine cracks when folded
<jcater> yeah, I'd imagine so
<jcater> I'll look thru my sources and see if they have anything similar
<drochaid> thanks
<drochaid> I'm going to talk to some local printers in a couple of days if I don't have any luck

<dneighbo> jcater jamest how hard is it to make linux accept ssh on port 23?
<drochaid> that should be really easy dneighbo
<drochaid> sorry, i'm having an identity crisis ... don't know if I'm jcater or jamest yet tho ...
<dneighbo> drochaid if you know the answer thats great
<drochaid> gimmie a mo ..
<dneighbo> i just asked them specifically as i know they have set it up before :)
<drochaid> if I'm right it's a single file entry in /etc
<drochaid> just can't remeber which file off hand
<dneighbo> i thought you had to have a recent kernel
<dneighbo> or compile in something special
<dneighbo> im on 2.2.19pre17 on the box i want to ssh into
<jamest> if you don't need it listening on port 22 anymore
<jamest> then just change the port number in your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file
<jamest> and restart it
<dneighbo> and if i want it on both ports?
<dneighbo> btw: probably having just on the one port probably will be ok for me (just curious)
<drochaid> jamest: do you not need to alter the /etc/services file to point ssh to port 23 ?
<dneighbo> if i change /etc/ssh/sshd_config via ssh
<dneighbo> how can i restart it?
<drochaid> as in ...
<dneighbo> i.e. if i do i a restart will it just logme off
<drochaid> ssh 23/udp
<drochaid> ssh 23/tcp
<drochaid> dneighbo: you just need to restart network services [inetd?]
<jamest> dneighbo: /etc/init.d/ssh restart
<jamest> you have to port forward to run on both IIRC
<jamest> lunch!
<jamest> drochaid: you shouldn't have to touch that file
<drochaid> port forward? :o
<dneighbo> jamest: i know how to restart ssh
<drochaid> I've always just used /etc/services
<dneighbo> my question is can i restart it
^chewie (~chewie@flemingi.dsl.visi.com) joined #gnuenterprise.

Arturas (~arturas@gsk.vtu.lt) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> hi :)
<ra3vat> hello
<Arturas> i have a question about GNUe directory structure
<Arturas> maybe it would be better to assign for i18n one directory
<Arturas> put there translations (maybe in subdirectories)
<Arturas> some kind of readme
<Arturas> (what i18n is, in what ways it's going to be realised and etc.)
<Arturas> and that everyone could put his ideas/corrections there
<Arturas> maybe directory like /gnue/common/i18n would go
<Arturas> or do you think all this stuff should be put somewhere else?
<Arturas> (some module that will be needed for i18n will probably go in /gnue/common/src)
<jcater> what kind of files?
<Arturas> for now there would be only readme :)
<Arturas> but later there would be translations
Action: jcater would think maybe gnue/common/etc/lang/
<jcater> which would get installed as /usr/local/gnue/etc/lang/
<Arturas> ok, and what about country-specific data
<Arturas> like time
<Arturas> $
<jcater> or should that be etc/locale ?
<Arturas> what do you mean?
<jcater> I was just suggesting a directory :)
<jcater> and maybe have subdirectories under that for each supported locale
<Arturas> => /gnue/common/etc/locale ?
<jcater> that's my opinion
<jcater> but I may not be qualified to make that decision :)
<Arturas> that's the decision we all have to make :)
<Arturas> and where do i put readme then?
<jcater> what's in the README ?
<Arturas> (it should be named not readme, but i18n-readme)
<dsmith> Anyone here know how to do cvs through a web proxy?
<Arturas> dsmith: no
<Arturas> jcater: what is i18n
<jcater> is it a generic "how to do i18n?"  
<Arturas> how it will be put into practice
<Arturas> hm, no, it's "how we do i18n in GNUe"
<Arturas> what ideas
<jcater> ok
<Arturas> tools
<jcater> I think that goes in gnue/common/docs
<Arturas> under what file name?
<Arturas> i18n?
<dneighbo> if stuff is only docs
<dneighbo> it belongs in the doc directory
<dneighbo> imho
<jcater> i18n.txt
<Arturas> ok :)
<Arturas> thank you :)
<Arturas> and some good news from i18n world
<jcater> dneighbo: what do you think about language mappings being in gnue/common/etc/locale/*
<jcater> or etc/lang/* (either one)
Action: jcater thinks those would make sense under etc
<jcater> but not docs of course :)
<Arturas> i & Dmitry (ok, it was Dmitry on the whole :) managed to get i18n (=> Russian) symbols in wxForm
<dneighbo> um
<Arturas> under win
<dneighbo> i think documentation of what we are doing for all of i18n probably belongs in docbook/
<dneighbo> with proposals and other docs
<Arturas> source still looks awfully, but it works
<dneighbo> docs specifically for i18n implementation for a specific tool belongs under the doc/ dir of that tool
<dneighbo> as to teh 'mappings'
<dneighbo> hmmmm
<dneighbo> i suppose we will need that by tool
<dneighbo> but i dont have  good answer
<dneighbo> should they all go in common
<dneighbo>  etc/tool/local
<jcater> well, our current etc/ setup is whack
<dneighbo> or should they go in a directory for each tool?
<jcater> as every tool's config files/images are in common/etc
<dneighbo> i dont know enough about what is teh 'right' way
<jcater> so to continue w/our current model, they should all go into common/etc
<dneighbo> i agree
<jcater> not saying that's right
<dneighbo> i agree :)
<dneighbo> that was my question i guess (or answer)
<dneighbo> is that currently to follow suit it should go in common/etc
<jcater> in that case, let's follow suite
<dneighbo> but whether thats best i dont know :)
<jcater> and worry about cleaning up when we clean it ALL up :)
<dneighbo> works for me
<dneighbo> let Arturas check it in so we can blame him later when people complain ;)
<jcater> sounds good to me
<Arturas> hey!
<Arturas> that's NOT fair!!! :)
<jcater> Arturas: don't worry.. we do that to derek ALL the time :)
<jcater> <derek> Um, can I do this?
<jcater> <us> Sure
<jcater> ... two days later ...
<jcater> <us> Derek: wtf were you thinking!!!! that's all wrong
<jamest> !@#!@# derek!  why'd he do that?
<jamest> btw it's normally /msg derek sure!
<jamest> so we don't leave a log of it
<jcater> <us> Derek: we were only joking!!! we didn't ACTUALLY expect you to code!!!
Action: jcater ducks
<jamest> lol
Action: Arturas thinks whether he is in the right world with the right guys :0
<Arturas> :)
<dneighbo> its an american custom you see
<dneighbo>  /msg jcater think we can get him to fall for its 'cool' in america to get the blame
<jcater> well, see, we use a "Goat" theme here in GNUe
<jcater> everything is some-how goat-related
<jcater> we currently are lacking the "Scape" goat
<jcater> it's a special symbol for us
<ajmitch> chillywilly?
<Arturas> hm, one more question
<Arturas> do we transalate error, debug messages?
<jcater> I wouldn't worry about debug messages at this point
<jcater> but I suppose error messages would be like any other string
<jcater> we usually do them in the style "Unable to open file %s" 
<jcater> so I guess the %s would stay wherever it needed to be
<jcater> and the rest translated
Action: jcater is guessing
<jamest> i think the msg_blah stuff in gnue.conf needs to come out of there 
<Arturas> yes, it will have to be taken into separate file (there is no need to translate gnue.conf :)
<jamest> Arturas: so what are you commiting?
<nickr> does python support gettext?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> _("my string")
<Arturas> jamest: i18n.txt
<Arturas> jamest: at least i hope so :\
<jcater> unfortunately, we have to be careful in implementing that
<nickr> you should use gettext then :)
<jcater> as that adds a lot of overhead
<jcater> nickr: I think we are
<jcater> that's what Arturas was doing iirc
<Arturas> what is overhead?
<jcater> processing time
<dneighbo> overhead = is where you dont want a bird that has bowel problems
<nickr> yes
<nickr> true
<jamest> um
<ajmitch> yeah
<Arturas> mh, then i don't get the point??
<jamest> if we're really worried about that
<jamest> is there anyway we can embed this in GBaseApp.py
<Arturas> what adds a lot of processing time?
<jamest> so that it goes thru a dict or list of _() everything in it
<jcater> print _("my text")
<jcater> vs print "my text"
<jcater> causes a python method call
<jcater> which of all of python
<jcater> has the most overhead
<jamest> then the apps only reference the var that holds the output of the original _() call
<jcater> so we need to be careful "when" and "how" we do that
<nickr> probably maps to a C call no?
<jcater> nickr: yes, but the stack operations in python are heavy
<nickr> yea
<nickr> true
<nickr> just use it for messages that actually need to be translated.
<dneighbo> nickr that was the debate :)
<dneighbo> what needs translatin
Action: ajmitch smacks wxPython.lib.printout around
<dneighbo> my original comment was if its a message that is useful to teh END USER
<dneighbo> it shoudl be translated
<dneighbo> if its more a 'developer' message
<dneighbo> it should be in english only
<nickr> anything that is shown to an end user
<dneighbo> as we already are assuming all 'developers' will speak english at least enough to code in english :)
<jcater> yes, this is the whole debate :)
<dneighbo> the problem i think lies in that our lower level debug statements
<jcater> incidentally, for anyone not completely following
<dneighbo> some of the stuff is actuall 'user messages'
<dneighbo> but not all of it
<jcater> I wasn't saying "don't use _() [gettext]"
<jcater> but we need to be careful "how" we use it :)
<jcater> and like jamest said, we should look at somehow caching the results of _() for any messages that are used more than once
<nickr> yea
<nickr> or define abstract 'messages' that you reference by handle, that you load from gettex when the app starts
<Arturas> somewhere in gettext docs i read that it's possible to active translation of all strings in project with one command
<Arturas> i think we could wait a bit for that command
<Arturas> and as i imagine
<Arturas> all strings later will be 'changed' from some cache
<Arturas> (on the run)
<Arturas> about what to translate
<Arturas> question was: do we translate debug messages and error messages
<Arturas> because these are mainly designed for developer
<Arturas> end user should not see any of them
<Arturas> because all other strings (that end user can see) will be translated
<Arturas> bye :)

<dneighbo> then i heard geddy lee vocals and was so sad that the song was ruined
<jcater> dneighbo: I'm looking at this XSLT stuff
<jcater> who in their right mind likes this stuff
<jcater> it's hell
<jcater> unless you're doing some xml to someother xml transform
<dneighbo> ?
<dneighbo> you are supposed to let me play with it
<dneighbo> you are supposed to just make the xml :)
<dneighbo> otherwise i will be back to having nothing to do
<nickr> bah
<nickr> geddy lee rules
<jcater> dneighbo: you planning on doing more w/the test.xsl soon?
<jcater> like column padding, justification, page numbering?
<dneighbo> yip
<jcater> cool
<dneighbo> was going to write  some 'functions'
<jcater> I'll leave you alone then
<dneighbo> so col width="" is respected

<jcater> what's your timeline on that?

<dneighbo> what do you want for 'pages' in the .txt version
<dneighbo> will a 'form feed' char work?

<nickr> sounds like some sort of porn statistics
<jcater> well, if you can get the text.xsl up to speed
<jcater> then that'll free me up to make the datasources respect those passed parameters
<jcater> this is gonna be one helluva 0.0.1 release
<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> we really need all the items released
<jcater> ?
<dneighbo> forms, designer, reports etc
<dneighbo> its been a while on all of them
<jcater> we are releasing all at the same time
<dneighbo> i know
<jcater> hopefully this weekend or next week
<dneighbo> just saying we really need to do it :)
<dneighbo> have you heard from FSF at all?
<jcater> me?
<jcater> regarding what?
<dneighbo> i sent lots of mail and asked thigns be setup and i havent heard doink since
<jcater> not to my knowledge
<dneighbo> ok
<jcater> unless spamassassin is catching them
<dneighbo> just making sure my email wasnt going to ether or something
<jcater> then I don't think I've gotten anything
<dneighbo> i need spamassassin
<dneighbo> sigh but then i have to setup a mali server i guess
<dneighbo> or fetchmail or the likes
<jcater> lol
<dneighbo> two downsides to GNUe
<dneighbo> a. every time you need info you are your own best reference (according to google)
<dneighbo> b. spam increases exponentially by month
<jcater> no kidding
<jcater> I searched for 
<jcater> xslt postscript
<jcater> yesterday
<jcater> and guess what was at the top spot?
<jcater> gnue reports

<dneighbo> jcater you gonna post a mandy,candy,sandy sample txt :)
<jcater> in a few
<dneighbo> nickr i went and started hacking a gkrellm them to suit my red fetish
<dneighbo> its kind of cool how the themeing stuff works
<nickr> I never touched gkrellm myself
<dneighbo> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/gkrellm.jpg
<dneighbo> dont know why image quality is so poor
<dneighbo> just wanted to let you know you encouraged me to 'expirement' with themes ;)
<dneighbo> to help my red addiction along, for that i am greatful
<nickr> ah no problem :)
<nickr> you seem to be a fan of gatoraid or koolaid
<dneighbo> ?
<nickr> by the colors you choose
<nickr> koolaid colors
<dneighbo> bright colors :)
<dneighbo> its just red
<dneighbo> i like what i have at the house now
<nickr> bugjuice color
<dneighbo> pretty much white with red
<dneighbo> hint of black here and there
<dneighbo> its clean yet different
<nickr> I'm a huge fan of low contrast purples and reds
<dneighbo> i like dark themes a lot too, they just arent as functional for me
<nickr> and blues
<nickr> because I use yellow text, its very visible on dark blue-grey
<dneighbo> i just have a red fetish alright
<dneighbo> does that make you happy
<dneighbo> now that you ahve made me admit it
<nickr> yes
<dneighbo> i am completely powerless over the color red
Action: nickr updates his file
<nickr> indeed
Action: dneighbo wonders if this explains the pizza fetish (Re: red tomato sauce)
<nickr> oh interesting
<nickr> No, I think food fetishes are based on smell and taste
<nickr> theres a certain shade of blue that makes me feel really nice
<nickr> my current background's blue is just a bit too saturated, not quite red enough
<nickr> I also like the color of the ocean in the tropics, the really deep, transparent blue

<jcater> note that I changed Date's width to 22 and Name's width to 30
<jcater> to make it more balanced :)
<jcater> btw, is there any way in XSLT to store arrays?
<dneighbo> um not really
<dneighbo> its morelike a functional language
<dneighbo> than a procedurual one
<jcater> yeah, I gathered that

<dneighbo> ah
<jcater> it seems SO wasteful to have to repeat those for each row
<jcater> but
<dneighbo> thats fine

<dyfet> just a wee bit
<chillywilly> I just don;t get why my program stopped working
<dyfet> none of mine stopped ;)
<chillywilly> you use debian unstable at all?

<dneighbo> hi dyfet im here
<dneighbo> wassup
<dneighbo> one time i thought nickr wasnt here

<dneighbo> um i think i got an email w/ yoru releasestuff
<dneighbo> if you could post a story to main site i will publish it
<dyfet> Yes, I am getting ready to release 0.8 this Friday

<return_this> hello ....
<return_this> I found GNUe yesterday and it peaked my interest...
<return_this> so I am kind of looking for a starting point I guess... as a developer
<return_this> so everything is done in python?
jbailey (~jbailey@HSE-Toronto-ppp287198.sympatico.ca) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<return_this> ok... well the reason I ask is I am thinking about mozilla and jabber (my main points of experience)
<return_this> does it make sense to integrate GNUe into these platforms? or is it too divergant?
<nickr> Hi
<return_this> hi
<nickr> Currently most of it is in python.
<return_this> hmm... ok. I know C++ and a tiny bit of perl...
<nickr> Python is dead easy
<nickr> you already know python, basically, if you know C++
<return_this> heh... well.. tyring to get 2.2.1 installed.. the bin doesn't have a --version
<return_this> does GNU autotools support python?
<nickr> I'm not sure what you mean by that.
<return_this> can I just hack up a bunch of python files.. list it in x_SOURCES and have it automagically work?
<nickr> x_SOURCES?
<return_this> program_name_SOURCES <-- in the Makefile.am
<nickr> python has a library management system similar to perl's
<nickr> you do'nt need to compile it or anything
<nickr> GNUe uses python's disttools which is like automake sort of
<return_this> hmm... ok
<nickr> you give it a really simple definition file and it can "build"/install/etc
<nickr> although for most things
<nickr> like simple scripts
<nickr> its just write and run
<return_this> bother... maybe perl has tainted my outlook... but scripts and I do not get along at all
<nickr> hmm
<nickr> how do you mean?
<return_this> and to have something that will grow as large as GNUe will... to have it sit on scripts seems... ummm unstable
<nickr> Ahh
<nickr> I see where perl would give you a bad impression of interpreted lanuages
<return_this> just trying to figure out if I want to move over to the GNUe platform
<nickr> Python is by nature object oriented
<nickr> its not like perl umm package wise
<nickr> hmm
<jcater> return_this: what are you looking for in GNUe ?
<jcater> what kinds of needs are you trying to solve?
<return_this> several things: a POS, Accounting for bother Retail and Service oriented biz
<return_this> I am looking for a base to build off of for these types of apps... GNUe seems almost perfect
<nickr> oh it is
<return_this> has anyone used mozilla with GNUe yet?
<nickr> that concept confuses me
<nickr> 'used mozilla with gnue'
<nickr> hmm
<return_this> ok I might be missing something then...
<return_this> isn't GNUe a collection of objects that work together? both on client  and backend?
<jcater> how are you envisioning either mozilla or jabber working with business software?
<nickr> I could see jabber for a distributed sort of business object network
<return_this> mozilla for the UI and jabber for getting it out remotely... 
<jcater> return_this: we are a collection of tools that work together
<nickr> you could use mozilla with a web-based forms client
<nickr> but I don' see why it'dhave to be specificly mozilla
<return_this> mozilla for the XUL and XPCOM... 
<nickr> ah now thats just silly.
<return_this> heh... ok
<nickr> although theres nothing stopping you from writing a XUL forms client
<jcater> hang on a second...

<jcater> we even have a "Why Python? Why not Java, ..."
<jcater> :)
<return_this> well... I KNOW that I don't like Java
<return_this> but since I haven't ever touched python... suppose I should give it a try
<nickr> python goes like this "you use whitespace for what!?" then "okay, its not so bad" then "Wow, this is easy" then "I love python!"
<nickr> Python: More an addiction than a language
<jcater> with fewer side effects than heroin
<nickr> Well
<nickr> Yea
<nickr> You get fat from all the donuts.

<jcater> it won't take long to get over those two concerns :)
<return_this> whats an "indent" a tab, a space?

<dnWork> i missed most of back log
Nick change: dnWork -> derek
<derek> return_this: items
<derek> jabber: i see this as a component in two ways
<derek> a. as an option for asyncronous messaging in gnurpc (i.e. just one more rpc choice)
<derek> b. as a integral part of the groupware/workflow components
<derek> part (a) is not much explored in the jabber world part (b) woudl very much use jabber as it sits today
<derek> mozilla:
<derek> a. i see someone could make an 'alternative' forms client with XUL model and java script
<nickr> thats how I use jabber
<derek> i dont see much 'value' upfront in mozilla/gnue collaboration 
<derek> i.e. the amount of work for the return probably isnt that high
<derek> but i do see promise in jabber/gnue and some jabber developers at one point showed interest
<derek> i dont think its what core gnue developers should be focusing on
<derek> but certainly those familiar with jabber protocol could be put to good use :)
<derek> with that i will be quiet (for a bit anyhow) ;)
