<psu> mornin' all
<ajmitch> hey psu
<ajmitch> what's up?
<reinhard> moring
<psu> me, for a start
<ajmitch> psu: always a good sign ;)
<ajmitch> hmm, lag not too bad while downloading...
<psu> who was it who said, "I always get up in the morning, read the obituaries in the paper
<psu> and if I'm not in it, I leave and go to work."
<ajmitch> lol
<Isomer> hmm
<ajmitch> hi Isomer
<ajmitch> what's up?
<Isomer> excuse the flood:
<Isomer> I get up each morning, gather my wits.
<Isomer> Pick up the paper, read the obits.
<Isomer> If I'm not there I know I'm not dead.
<Isomer> So I eat a good breakfast and go back to bed.
<Isomer> Oh, how do I know my youth is all spent?
<Isomer> My get-up-and-go has got-up-and-went.
<Isomer> But in spite of it all, I'm able to grin,
<Isomer> And think of the places my get-up has been.

<Isomer> Excellent
<Isomer> ah
Action: Isomer using a 3com HomeConnect
<ajmitch> nice units, those
<ajmitch> that's the one that can do pppoa or pppoe?
<ajmitch> with the alcatel, i get the ip on ppp0, so i do all the NAT, etc with iptables
<Isomer> yah
<Isomer> ditto with the 3com
<Isomer> comes in over PPTP
<ajmitch> useful
<Isomer> so I also get the nice ppp0
<ajmitch> i use the userspace pppoa drivers for the alcatel
<ajmitch> works nicely

<jbailey> Yeah, but your winter is like the hotest days in Vancouver. =)
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> yeah, we get a bit of snow, but not too much
<Isomer> hmm
<jbailey> I hadn't realized (though it makes sense) that you guys would move the opposite direction for time change...

<jbailey> Makes sense.

<ajmitch> whois andrew miller?
<Isomer> ajmitch: I can't remember where he is, but he's not in Hamilton, but he's in NZ
<Isomer> he's a ircd coder
<ajmitch> ok ;)
<jbailey> Isomer: I'd probably prefer to bring a library. =)  I'd be worried about someone stealing the laptop while I was asleep.
<ajmitch> why mention him?
<Isomer> ajmitch: you said that there were several andrews in dunlug IIRC

<drochaid> ok, this is well OT and I'm guessing a long shot :)
<drochaid> any know some really good stationers or light card manufacturers?
<nickr> 'stationers'? 'ligcht card'?
<jcater> not in your part of the world :(
<drochaid> jcater: a lot of yours ship over here as well ...
<jcater> what are you looking for?
<drochaid> basically I'm trying to find a dark blue card with a linen finish on one side and matt on the reverse .. around 120 to 160gsm
<drochaid> I've got exactly that, but at 250gsm ... and it's too thick for my needs :(
<jcater> too thick? are you planning running these through a laser printer or something? or is the look just not right with that thickness?
<drochaid> combination of the two
dneighbo (~dneighbo@tmp-200253.flinthills.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<drochaid> I need it in A4 size, intended to be folded to A5 for a brochure cover
<drochaid> the 250gsm one goes through my laser ok, but the spine cracks when folded
<jcater> yeah, I'd imagine so
<jcater> I'll look thru my sources and see if they have anything similar
<drochaid> thanks
<drochaid> I'm going to talk to some local printers in a couple of days if I don't have any luck

<dneighbo> jcater jamest how hard is it to make linux accept ssh on port 23?
<drochaid> that should be really easy dneighbo
<drochaid> sorry, i'm having an identity crisis ... don't know if I'm jcater or jamest yet tho ...
<dneighbo> drochaid if you know the answer thats great
<drochaid> gimmie a mo ..
<dneighbo> i just asked them specifically as i know they have set it up before :)
<drochaid> if I'm right it's a single file entry in /etc
<drochaid> just can't remeber which file off hand
<dneighbo> i thought you had to have a recent kernel
<dneighbo> or compile in something special
<dneighbo> im on 2.2.19pre17 on the box i want to ssh into
<jamest> if you don't need it listening on port 22 anymore
<jamest> then just change the port number in your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file
<jamest> and restart it
<dneighbo> and if i want it on both ports?
<dneighbo> btw: probably having just on the one port probably will be ok for me (just curious)
<drochaid> jamest: do you not need to alter the /etc/services file to point ssh to port 23 ?
<dneighbo> if i change /etc/ssh/sshd_config via ssh
<dneighbo> how can i restart it?
<drochaid> as in ...
<dneighbo> i.e. if i do i a restart will it just logme off
<drochaid> ssh 23/udp
<drochaid> ssh 23/tcp
<drochaid> dneighbo: you just need to restart network services [inetd?]
<jamest> dneighbo: /etc/init.d/ssh restart
<jamest> you have to port forward to run on both IIRC
<jamest> lunch!
<jamest> drochaid: you shouldn't have to touch that file
<drochaid> port forward? :o
<dneighbo> jamest: i know how to restart ssh
<drochaid> I've always just used /etc/services
<dneighbo> my question is can i restart it
^chewie (~chewie@flemingi.dsl.visi.com) joined #gnuenterprise.

Arturas (~arturas@gsk.vtu.lt) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> hi :)
<ra3vat> hello
<Arturas> i have a question about GNUe directory structure
<Arturas> maybe it would be better to assign for i18n one directory
<Arturas> put there translations (maybe in subdirectories)
<Arturas> some kind of readme
<Arturas> (what i18n is, in what ways it's going to be realised and etc.)
<Arturas> and that everyone could put his ideas/corrections there
<Arturas> maybe directory like /gnue/common/i18n would go
<Arturas> or do you think all this stuff should be put somewhere else?
<Arturas> (some module that will be needed for i18n will probably go in /gnue/common/src)
<jcater> what kind of files?
<Arturas> for now there would be only readme :)
<Arturas> but later there would be translations
Action: jcater would think maybe gnue/common/etc/lang/
<jcater> which would get installed as /usr/local/gnue/etc/lang/
<Arturas> ok, and what about country-specific data
<Arturas> like time
<Arturas> $
<jcater> or should that be etc/locale ?
<Arturas> what do you mean?
<jcater> I was just suggesting a directory :)
<jcater> and maybe have subdirectories under that for each supported locale
<Arturas> => /gnue/common/etc/locale ?
<jcater> that's my opinion
<jcater> but I may not be qualified to make that decision :)
<Arturas> that's the decision we all have to make :)
<Arturas> and where do i put readme then?
<jcater> what's in the README ?
<Arturas> (it should be named not readme, but i18n-readme)
<dsmith> Anyone here know how to do cvs through a web proxy?
<Arturas> dsmith: no
<Arturas> jcater: what is i18n
<jcater> is it a generic "how to do i18n?"  
<Arturas> how it will be put into practice
<Arturas> hm, no, it's "how we do i18n in GNUe"
<Arturas> what ideas
<jcater> ok
<Arturas> tools
<jcater> I think that goes in gnue/common/docs
<Arturas> under what file name?
<Arturas> i18n?
<dneighbo> if stuff is only docs
<dneighbo> it belongs in the doc directory
<dneighbo> imho
<jcater> i18n.txt
<Arturas> ok :)
<Arturas> thank you :)
<Arturas> and some good news from i18n world
<jcater> dneighbo: what do you think about language mappings being in gnue/common/etc/locale/*
<jcater> or etc/lang/* (either one)
Action: jcater thinks those would make sense under etc
<jcater> but not docs of course :)
<Arturas> i & Dmitry (ok, it was Dmitry on the whole :) managed to get i18n (=> Russian) symbols in wxForm
<dneighbo> um
<Arturas> under win
<dneighbo> i think documentation of what we are doing for all of i18n probably belongs in docbook/
<dneighbo> with proposals and other docs
<Arturas> source still looks awfully, but it works
<dneighbo> docs specifically for i18n implementation for a specific tool belongs under the doc/ dir of that tool
<dneighbo> as to teh 'mappings'
<dneighbo> hmmmm
<dneighbo> i suppose we will need that by tool
<dneighbo> but i dont have  good answer
<dneighbo> should they all go in common
<dneighbo>  etc/tool/local
<jcater> well, our current etc/ setup is whack
<dneighbo> or should they go in a directory for each tool?
<jcater> as every tool's config files/images are in common/etc
<dneighbo> i dont know enough about what is teh 'right' way
<jcater> so to continue w/our current model, they should all go into common/etc
<dneighbo> i agree
<jcater> not saying that's right
<dneighbo> i agree :)
<dneighbo> that was my question i guess (or answer)
<dneighbo> is that currently to follow suit it should go in common/etc
<jcater> in that case, let's follow suite
<dneighbo> but whether thats best i dont know :)
<jcater> and worry about cleaning up when we clean it ALL up :)
<dneighbo> works for me
<dneighbo> let Arturas check it in so we can blame him later when people complain ;)
<jcater> sounds good to me
<Arturas> hey!
<Arturas> that's NOT fair!!! :)
<jcater> Arturas: don't worry.. we do that to derek ALL the time :)
<jcater> <derek> Um, can I do this?
<jcater> <us> Sure
<jcater> ... two days later ...
<jcater> <us> Derek: wtf were you thinking!!!! that's all wrong
<jamest> !@#!@# derek!  why'd he do that?
<jamest> btw it's normally /msg derek sure!
<jamest> so we don't leave a log of it
<jcater> <us> Derek: we were only joking!!! we didn't ACTUALLY expect you to code!!!
Action: jcater ducks
<jamest> lol
Action: Arturas thinks whether he is in the right world with the right guys :0
<Arturas> :)
<dneighbo> its an american custom you see
<dneighbo>  /msg jcater think we can get him to fall for its 'cool' in america to get the blame
<jcater> well, see, we use a "Goat" theme here in GNUe
<jcater> everything is some-how goat-related
<jcater> we currently are lacking the "Scape" goat
<jcater> it's a special symbol for us
<ajmitch> chillywilly?
<Arturas> hm, one more question
<Arturas> do we transalate error, debug messages?
<jcater> I wouldn't worry about debug messages at this point
<jcater> but I suppose error messages would be like any other string
<jcater> we usually do them in the style "Unable to open file %s" 
<jcater> so I guess the %s would stay wherever it needed to be
<jcater> and the rest translated
Action: jcater is guessing
<jamest> i think the msg_blah stuff in gnue.conf needs to come out of there 
<Arturas> yes, it will have to be taken into separate file (there is no need to translate gnue.conf :)
<jamest> Arturas: so what are you commiting?
<nickr> does python support gettext?
<jcater> yes
<jcater> _("my string")
<Arturas> jamest: i18n.txt
<Arturas> jamest: at least i hope so :\
<jcater> unfortunately, we have to be careful in implementing that
<nickr> you should use gettext then :)
<jcater> as that adds a lot of overhead
<jcater> nickr: I think we are
<jcater> that's what Arturas was doing iirc
<Arturas> what is overhead?
<jcater> processing time
<dneighbo> overhead = is where you dont want a bird that has bowel problems
<nickr> yes
<nickr> true
<jamest> um
<ajmitch> yeah
<Arturas> mh, then i don't get the point??
<jamest> if we're really worried about that
<jamest> is there anyway we can embed this in GBaseApp.py
<Arturas> what adds a lot of processing time?
<jamest> so that it goes thru a dict or list of _() everything in it
<jcater> print _("my text")
<jcater> vs print "my text"
<jcater> causes a python method call
<jcater> which of all of python
<jcater> has the most overhead
<jamest> then the apps only reference the var that holds the output of the original _() call
<jcater> so we need to be careful "when" and "how" we do that
<nickr> probably maps to a C call no?
<jcater> nickr: yes, but the stack operations in python are heavy
<nickr> yea
<nickr> true
<nickr> just use it for messages that actually need to be translated.
<dneighbo> nickr that was the debate :)
<dneighbo> what needs translatin
Action: ajmitch smacks wxPython.lib.printout around
<dneighbo> my original comment was if its a message that is useful to teh END USER
<dneighbo> it shoudl be translated
<dneighbo> if its more a 'developer' message
<dneighbo> it should be in english only
<nickr> anything that is shown to an end user
<dneighbo> as we already are assuming all 'developers' will speak english at least enough to code in english :)
<jcater> yes, this is the whole debate :)
<dneighbo> the problem i think lies in that our lower level debug statements
<jcater> incidentally, for anyone not completely following
<dneighbo> some of the stuff is actuall 'user messages'
<dneighbo> but not all of it
<jcater> I wasn't saying "don't use _() [gettext]"
<jcater> but we need to be careful "how" we use it :)
<jcater> and like jamest said, we should look at somehow caching the results of _() for any messages that are used more than once
<nickr> yea
<nickr> or define abstract 'messages' that you reference by handle, that you load from gettex when the app starts
<Arturas> somewhere in gettext docs i read that it's possible to active translation of all strings in project with one command
<Arturas> i think we could wait a bit for that command
<Arturas> and as i imagine
<Arturas> all strings later will be 'changed' from some cache
<Arturas> (on the run)
<Arturas> about what to translate
<Arturas> question was: do we translate debug messages and error messages
<Arturas> because these are mainly designed for developer
<Arturas> end user should not see any of them
<Arturas> because all other strings (that end user can see) will be translated
<Arturas> bye :)

<dneighbo> then i heard geddy lee vocals and was so sad that the song was ruined
<jcater> dneighbo: I'm looking at this XSLT stuff
<jcater> who in their right mind likes this stuff
<jcater> it's hell
<jcater> unless you're doing some xml to someother xml transform
<dneighbo> ?
<dneighbo> you are supposed to let me play with it
<dneighbo> you are supposed to just make the xml :)
<dneighbo> otherwise i will be back to having nothing to do
<nickr> bah
<nickr> geddy lee rules
<jcater> dneighbo: you planning on doing more w/the test.xsl soon?
<jcater> like column padding, justification, page numbering?
<dneighbo> yip
<jcater> cool
<dneighbo> was going to write  some 'functions'
<jcater> I'll leave you alone then
<dneighbo> so col width="" is respected

<jcater> what's your timeline on that?

<dneighbo> what do you want for 'pages' in the .txt version
<dneighbo> will a 'form feed' char work?

<nickr> sounds like some sort of porn statistics
<jcater> well, if you can get the text.xsl up to speed
<jcater> then that'll free me up to make the datasources respect those passed parameters
<jcater> this is gonna be one helluva 0.0.1 release
<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> we really need all the items released
<jcater> ?
<dneighbo> forms, designer, reports etc
<dneighbo> its been a while on all of them
<jcater> we are releasing all at the same time
<dneighbo> i know
<jcater> hopefully this weekend or next week
<dneighbo> just saying we really need to do it :)
<dneighbo> have you heard from FSF at all?
<jcater> me?
<jcater> regarding what?
<dneighbo> i sent lots of mail and asked thigns be setup and i havent heard doink since
<jcater> not to my knowledge
<dneighbo> ok
<jcater> unless spamassassin is catching them
<dneighbo> just making sure my email wasnt going to ether or something
<jcater> then I don't think I've gotten anything
<dneighbo> i need spamassassin
<dneighbo> sigh but then i have to setup a mali server i guess
<dneighbo> or fetchmail or the likes
<jcater> lol
<dneighbo> two downsides to GNUe
<dneighbo> a. every time you need info you are your own best reference (according to google)
<dneighbo> b. spam increases exponentially by month
<jcater> no kidding
<jcater> I searched for 
<jcater> xslt postscript
<jcater> yesterday
<jcater> and guess what was at the top spot?
<jcater> gnue reports

<dneighbo> jcater you gonna post a mandy,candy,sandy sample txt :)
<jcater> in a few
<dneighbo> nickr i went and started hacking a gkrellm them to suit my red fetish
<dneighbo> its kind of cool how the themeing stuff works
<nickr> I never touched gkrellm myself
<dneighbo> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/gkrellm.jpg
<dneighbo> dont know why image quality is so poor
<dneighbo> just wanted to let you know you encouraged me to 'expirement' with themes ;)
<dneighbo> to help my red addiction along, for that i am greatful
<nickr> ah no problem :)
<nickr> you seem to be a fan of gatoraid or koolaid
<dneighbo> ?
<nickr> by the colors you choose
<nickr> koolaid colors
<dneighbo> bright colors :)
<dneighbo> its just red
<dneighbo> i like what i have at the house now
<nickr> bugjuice color
<dneighbo> pretty much white with red
<dneighbo> hint of black here and there
<dneighbo> its clean yet different
<nickr> I'm a huge fan of low contrast purples and reds
<dneighbo> i like dark themes a lot too, they just arent as functional for me
<nickr> and blues
<nickr> because I use yellow text, its very visible on dark blue-grey
<dneighbo> i just have a red fetish alright
<dneighbo> does that make you happy
<dneighbo> now that you ahve made me admit it
<nickr> yes
<dneighbo> i am completely powerless over the color red
Action: nickr updates his file
<nickr> indeed
Action: dneighbo wonders if this explains the pizza fetish (Re: red tomato sauce)
<nickr> oh interesting
<nickr> No, I think food fetishes are based on smell and taste
<nickr> theres a certain shade of blue that makes me feel really nice
<nickr> my current background's blue is just a bit too saturated, not quite red enough
<nickr> I also like the color of the ocean in the tropics, the really deep, transparent blue

<jcater> note that I changed Date's width to 22 and Name's width to 30
<jcater> to make it more balanced :)
<jcater> btw, is there any way in XSLT to store arrays?
<dneighbo> um not really
<dneighbo> its morelike a functional language
<dneighbo> than a procedurual one
<jcater> yeah, I gathered that

<dneighbo> ah
<jcater> it seems SO wasteful to have to repeat those for each row
<jcater> but
<dneighbo> thats fine

<dyfet> just a wee bit
<chillywilly> I just don;t get why my program stopped working
<dyfet> none of mine stopped ;)
<chillywilly> you use debian unstable at all?

<dneighbo> hi dyfet im here
<dneighbo> wassup
<dneighbo> one time i thought nickr wasnt here

<dneighbo> um i think i got an email w/ yoru releasestuff
<dneighbo> if you could post a story to main site i will publish it
<dyfet> Yes, I am getting ready to release 0.8 this Friday

<return_this> hello ....
<return_this> I found GNUe yesterday and it peaked my interest...
<return_this> so I am kind of looking for a starting point I guess... as a developer
<return_this> so everything is done in python?
jbailey (~jbailey@HSE-Toronto-ppp287198.sympatico.ca) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<return_this> ok... well the reason I ask is I am thinking about mozilla and jabber (my main points of experience)
<return_this> does it make sense to integrate GNUe into these platforms? or is it too divergant?
<nickr> Hi
<return_this> hi
<nickr> Currently most of it is in python.
<return_this> hmm... ok. I know C++ and a tiny bit of perl...
<nickr> Python is dead easy
<nickr> you already know python, basically, if you know C++
<return_this> heh... well.. tyring to get 2.2.1 installed.. the bin doesn't have a --version
<return_this> does GNU autotools support python?
<nickr> I'm not sure what you mean by that.
<return_this> can I just hack up a bunch of python files.. list it in x_SOURCES and have it automagically work?
<nickr> x_SOURCES?
<return_this> program_name_SOURCES <-- in the Makefile.am
<nickr> python has a library management system similar to perl's
<nickr> you do'nt need to compile it or anything
<nickr> GNUe uses python's disttools which is like automake sort of
<return_this> hmm... ok
<nickr> you give it a really simple definition file and it can "build"/install/etc
<nickr> although for most things
<nickr> like simple scripts
<nickr> its just write and run
<return_this> bother... maybe perl has tainted my outlook... but scripts and I do not get along at all
<nickr> hmm
<nickr> how do you mean?
<return_this> and to have something that will grow as large as GNUe will... to have it sit on scripts seems... ummm unstable
<nickr> Ahh
<nickr> I see where perl would give you a bad impression of interpreted lanuages
<return_this> just trying to figure out if I want to move over to the GNUe platform
<nickr> Python is by nature object oriented
<nickr> its not like perl umm package wise
<nickr> hmm
<jcater> return_this: what are you looking for in GNUe ?
<jcater> what kinds of needs are you trying to solve?
<return_this> several things: a POS, Accounting for bother Retail and Service oriented biz
<return_this> I am looking for a base to build off of for these types of apps... GNUe seems almost perfect
<nickr> oh it is
<return_this> has anyone used mozilla with GNUe yet?
<nickr> that concept confuses me
<nickr> 'used mozilla with gnue'
<nickr> hmm
<return_this> ok I might be missing something then...
<return_this> isn't GNUe a collection of objects that work together? both on client  and backend?
<jcater> how are you envisioning either mozilla or jabber working with business software?
<nickr> I could see jabber for a distributed sort of business object network
<return_this> mozilla for the UI and jabber for getting it out remotely... 
<jcater> return_this: we are a collection of tools that work together
<nickr> you could use mozilla with a web-based forms client
<nickr> but I don' see why it'dhave to be specificly mozilla
<return_this> mozilla for the XUL and XPCOM... 
<nickr> ah now thats just silly.
<return_this> heh... ok
<nickr> although theres nothing stopping you from writing a XUL forms client
<jcater> hang on a second...

<jcater> we even have a "Why Python? Why not Java, ..."
<jcater> :)
<return_this> well... I KNOW that I don't like Java
<return_this> but since I haven't ever touched python... suppose I should give it a try
<nickr> python goes like this "you use whitespace for what!?" then "okay, its not so bad" then "Wow, this is easy" then "I love python!"
<nickr> Python: More an addiction than a language
<jcater> with fewer side effects than heroin
<nickr> Well
<nickr> Yea
<nickr> You get fat from all the donuts.

<jcater> it won't take long to get over those two concerns :)
<return_this> whats an "indent" a tab, a space?

<derek> jabber: i see this as a component in two ways
<derek> a. as an option for asyncronous messaging in gnurpc (i.e. just one more rpc choice)
<derek> b. as a integral part of the groupware/workflow components
<derek> part (a) is not much explored in the jabber world part (b) woudl very much use jabber as it sits today
<derek> mozilla:
<derek> a. i see someone could make an 'alternative' forms client with XUL model and java script
<nickr> thats how I use jabber
<derek> i dont see much 'value' upfront in mozilla/gnue collaboration 
<derek> i.e. the amount of work for the return probably isnt that high
<derek> but i do see promise in jabber/gnue and some jabber developers at one point showed interest
<derek> i dont think its what core gnue developers should be focusing on
<derek> but certainly those familiar with jabber protocol could be put to good use :)
<derek> with that i will be quiet (for a bit anyhow) ;)

<return_this> ack ... sorry been away
<return_this> the reason I want to utilize mozilla is purely selfish...
<return_this> I have invested a lot of time playing with xul and xpcom ... and I would like to utilize that as much as possible

<nickr> thats a lot

<derek> i.e. if food and room was covered
<derek> a part time grocery bagging job at 10 hours a week would cover what little social life they might have

<psu> derek: all that working with accountants has rubbed off on you, I see
<ajmitch> hi psu
<nickr> I do too sleep 8 hours a day :P
<derek> psu: not quite, if that were the case i would ask for last year worth of his webcam files for auditing purposes
<derek> or actually since i work for OMB
<derek> you have 168 hours
<derek> we will budget 6 hours a day (42) for sleep
<derek> leaving us 122, budget 2 hours a day for eating, personal hygiene (14)
<derek> leaving us 108 so we budget 100 for computer time 
<derek> leaving us 2 for contigency
<derek> and from nickr is saying
<jcater> 2 hrs/day for eating and hygiene??????
<derek> our 'actuals to budget' seems to be within acceptable variance
<jcater> you must be a few degrees out of the hacker culture :)

<reinhard> lol
<jcater> as hours go up, the latter approached 0
<jcater> s/ed/es
<nickr> you could do a 3d plot vs. sleep
<jcater> sleep? or sleeping alone?
<reinhard> actually free software projects sometimes like to get new names for old things
<reinhard> like gnome uses "druid" instead of "wizard"
<nickr> sleep in general
<reinhard> so for charting we should rename the "pie chart" to "donut chart"
<reinhard> :)
<jcater> roflmao
<nickr> so you correlate increasing sleep with increasing intercourse to a point, wheruppon they are inverse
<nickr> donut chart.
<nickr> hah

<deem0N> hi all
<deem0N> could anybody tell if subforms (master/detail) are working in Forms under windows ?
<ajmitch> not sure, sorry, i don't follow forms that closely
<deem0N> also I red that HTML driver is under way (2 projects active), but where are they in CVS tree ?
<ajmitch> don't know, sorry
<reinhard> deem0N: AFAIK
<reinhard> master/detail is working
<reinhard> on all platforms
<reinhard> and there is no "html" driver
<deem0N> any downloadable example ?
<reinhard> there was a java implementation of forms
<reinhard> but that development has stopped long ago due to lack of time
<reinhard> i'm not sure about an example
<reinhard> i think the samples dir of forms should contain one
<ajmitch> there was work done on a UIwebware driver, dunno what happened to it
<deem0N> I was unable to connect to MySQL server from Windows box 
<deem0N> only Post=gres
<reinhard> deem0N: most developers use postgres
<reinhard> so it _might_ be that mysql support is temporarly broken
<reinhard> however they will be happy if you report your problems
<reinhard> because most developers can't even _test_ mysql
<reinhard> forms developers are from the u.s. mainly
<reinhard> their irc names are jcater and jamest
<reinhard> so you might want to return here in about 6 hours
<reinhard> or you might want to write a mail to gnue-dev@gnu.org
<deem0N> basically I liked Forms XML lang, as I need something to base my development on.
<reinhard> sorry that i can't help you more here
<reinhard> cool
<deem0N> I gonna have HTML Forms implementation done for my company need
<deem0N> but I am not sure if it will be 100% implementation of all features
<deem0N> also question is support on Web server side - Java funs gonna be upset, as I like Perl :-)
<reinhard> no java fans are allowed in this channel anyway
<deem0N> for now Im installing gnue on FreeBSD to test it well
<reinhard> :)
<deem0N> thanks to all who respond
<deem0N> also for now I have a bit messed my brain with HTML,JavaScript,XUL,SOAP
<deem0N> it is hard to choose right tool for Web implementation of Forms :-)
<derek> deem0N: i believe the php implementation is in cvs
<derek> or is in process of getting there
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue/phpforms$ ls
<derek> CVS  connection.php  gnue-forms.php
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue/phpforms$ 
<deem0N> For me it is very important to put maximum logic on the browser - i.e. to code Forms in JavaScript and reduce HTTP traffic
<deem0N> will check php if they do some JS as well

<ra3vat> hi C00ler
<deem0N> Execute query helps
<deem0N> any idea how to run in it automatically on form open ?
<ra3vat> it better ask jamest or jcater couple hours later, I think it's possible but can't help myself

<ra3vat> btami: i got it into my maibox :)
<btami> :9

<btami> ra3vat: what do you think about i18n and unicode in GNUe ?
<btami> win9x doesn't support unicode

<btami> i think
<btami> but with last bugfix i'v sended, my texts in forms are all correct now
<btami> labels, gnue.conf msgs, input, all ok
<ra3vat> btami: and input into entry box also?
<btami> yes
<btami> i found your old fix in 0.1.1 forms, and it helps

<ra3vat> ok
<ra3vat> i think we will not switch to unicode in one day

<C00ler> this is 'enter query' and 'execute query' (by pressing F8, F9)
<btami> and cache="5" or something, i think:)
<C00ler> Is it possible to done this automaticity ?
<btami> minute, i'm trying too
<C00ler> sure 
Action: dsmith is back (gone 00:25:56)

<C00ler> prequery=""/>
<C00ler> I see that prequery is empty everywhere

<jamest_> what parts of gnue common should get documented first to be of the most use to the GEAS conversion?
<dneighbo> db access
<dneighbo> trigger calls
<dneighbo> rpc abstraction
<dneighbo> not necessarily in that order
<nickr> la.
<reinhard> jamest_: db access
<reinhard> that's the most important imho
<dneighbo> i think rpc has to be pretty high up there too
<dneighbo> db allows geas to look at harvesting data
<dneighbo> but without rpc no one can use it :)
<jcater> dneighbo: not entirely sure I agree
Action: jcater is back (gone 01:07:14)
<jcater> I agree w/reinhard that db is at top
<jcater> but we could consider doing the same thing I'm doing w/reports
<jcater> i.e., I'm getting the engine working
<jcater> and a command line version of it running
<jcater> so ppl can develop reports and see what it's gonna be like
<jcater> w/o actually running in a client/server setup
<jcater> if that makes sense
<jcater> of course, the goal is to get a reports server
<jcater> and report clients
<jcater> but it's still usable this early on :)
<jcater> I'm thinking the same thing could happen w/GEAS and Forms
<jcater> that would allow ppl to start using the abstraction-qualities of geas
<jcater> even before we get a solid/stable server/rpc setup
<jcater> iow, start developing apps sooner
<jcater> but that's just my $0.02
^chewie (~chewie@flemingi.dsl.visi.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> i only half agree
<dneighbo> unlike reports geas is not usefull w/o client/server other than testing
<dneighbo> imho
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> i do think db access is top on the list
<jcater> my point was to get app development started asap
<jamest_> just to confuse you all :) I'm starting with GClientApp and GServerApp
<dneighbo> im just saying that to be useful the other things will need to follow
<jcater> and whether ppl would like to admit it or not, this would still be usable :)
<jcater> but that wasn't my point
<jcater> my point was to get app development started asap
<jamest_> so you can see simple sample before I dive into db access
<jamest_> in either case
<jamest_> its possible to figure out common by using it
<jamest_> so the docs aren't stopping anything from being developed
<jamest_> :)
<reinhard> jcater: i tend to agree with you
<dneighbo> sigh
Action: dneighbo hates when the point is totally missed, irc communication sucks
<reinhard> jamest_: the most difficult point in figuring out common by using at the code
<reinhard> um
<reinhard> looking at the code and using it
<reinhard> is
<reinhard> that python doesn't do "encapsulation"
<reinhard> i.e. it isn't defined which routines are considered "public"
<reinhard> and which ones "private"
<jcater> reinhard: he's taken off work today to actually start documenting common
<jcater> so I don't think he was saying "I won't document it" :)
<jamest_> oh I'll document things alright.
<jamest_> Chapter 1: usinging GClientApp
<jamest_> 1.1 Intro
<reinhard> jcater: i didn't understand it that way
<jamest_> Use this class to build your apps from.   See GClientApp.py for details.
<jamest_> Chapter 2......
<jamest_> :)
<reinhard> :)
<jcater> reinhard: ok :)
<jamest_> I'm documenting
<jamest_> I'm just asking what's holding people back for utilizing common
<reinhard> just for the record
<jamest_> i'm starting w/ GClientApp as it's simple
<jamest_> then I'll do DB as it's a bitch
<reinhard> it's _not_ the lack of documentation that keeps me from writing geas :(
<jamest_> then i'll probably need some heavy drugs to recover from actually understanding the db code
<jamest_> then maybe I'll get to rpc
<jamest_> since rpc is very much a work in progress it'll be a bitch to document
<jamest_> hmmm
<jamest_> our base app class includes a --conections command line arg

<reinhard> and
<reinhard> XF86Config-4
<jamest_> that's ok
<jamest_> the first is for 3.x xfree
<reinhard> thanks
<jamest_> the latter is 4.x xfree
<jamest_> you have it working now?
<reinhard> so this is probably because i updated from potato to woody?
<reinhard> not yet
<reinhard> dpgk-reconf asks so many questions...

<reinhard> oops
<jamest_> oooo
<jamest_> you have video working?
<reinhard> ok now
<reinhard> X starts
<reinhard> and shows me the login dialog

<reinhard> and the keyboard is dead too
<jamest_> you didn't disconnect mouse/keyboard did you?
<jamest_> what am I saying
<jamest_> sigh
<jamest_> what kind of mouse you have?
<reinhard> huh?
<jamest_> what brand?
<reinhard> compaq
<reinhard> was packed with the computer
<jamest_> with a scrollwheel?
<reinhard> no
<reinhard> rather old one i think
<jamest_> ps/2?
<reinhard> yes

<jamest_> ctrl-alt-backspace if nothing else works
<jamest_> then 
<reinhard> just a sec
<reinhard> not even ctrl-alt-backspace did work
<reinhard> machine is rebooting and doing fsck
<jamest_> sigh
<jamest_> ok
<jamest_> btw - the new docs are being held up do to docbook issues
Action: jamest_ hugs docbook
<reinhard> lol
Action: jamest_ uses his fingers to hug it
Action: jamest_ hugs very, very tightly
<reinhard> ok i am logged in as root
<jamest_> vi /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
<jamest_> then
<jamest_>  /Mouse
<reinhard> i have a "Generic Mouse" and a "Configured Mouse"
<jamest_> on Configured 
<jamest_> you have device set to /dev/psaux?
<jamest_> and protocol set to ?
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> protocol = "PS/2"
<jamest_> try 
<jamest_> ImPS/2
<jamest_> or
<jamest_> Auto
<jamest_> i think the first may work better
<reinhard> ok
<jamest_> other option I've had luck with is Microsoft on older mice
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> the not so nice thing is that the machine is completely dead when X starts
<reinhard> so i have to reset it every time :(
<jamest_> ouch
<reinhard> in "ServerLayout"
<reinhard> bout "Configured Mouse" and "Generic Mouse" are mentioned
<reinhard> s/bout/both/
<reinhard> is that correct?
<jamest_> yeah
<jamest_> it tries one then the other
<reinhard> ah
<jamest_> if you had keyboard support you could run startx from the console
<reinhard> i'm 100% positive i broke something on accident
<jamest_> ctrl-alt-f1 back to the console
<jamest_> then see what mouse it's actually using
<reinhard> how would i see that?
<reinhard> i have other system from where i can telnet
<jamest_> that's on the console when you startx
<reinhard> oh ah
<jamest_> if you're not using xdm like setup
<reinhard> half an hour ago the mouse didn't work either
<reinhard> but at least it didn't hang
<reinhard> and i could use the keyboard
<reinhard> i guess i must have broken something w/ my first reconfigure
Annik (trilluser@D576875B.kabel.telenet.be) left #gnuenterprise.
<jamest_> then I'd rerun dpkg-reconfigure
<jamest_> i let it manage my x setup
<reinhard> i did that 3 times
<jamest_> but I don't let it put the defaults in
<jamest_> (the last 2 questions IIRC)
<reinhard> and answered every question to my best knowledge
<reinhard> (where my knowledge is not very much anyway)
<jamest_> did you rerun it?
<reinhard> just a sec
<reinhard> i have to wait for the fsck each time
<nickr> c-a-backspace doesn't work?
<reinhard> i think in 2 minutes i will present you the solution

<reinhard> do i have to get source?

<jamest_> I'm adding the start of the common-techref

<reinhard> what's the debian package name for wxPython?
<jamest_> libwxgtk2.2-python
<jamest_> ok
<jamest_> in common/doc there is a common-techref.lyx file
<reinhard> jamest_: thanks
<jamest_> it won't print worth a damn because something in the newest docbook stuff messed up
Action: reinhard found out the "dpkg -l" command meanwhile :)
<jamest_> but chapter 2 is what I'm thinking about doing 
<jamest_> with maybe an apendix toward the end showing everthing for each class....maybe
<jamest_> if I can get feedback on this I'd appreciate it
<jamest_> btw - i'm not a writer
<jamest_> and I don't take offense at people saying this sucks you need to do something like <foo>
<jcater> jamest_: this sucks... you need to do something like <foo>
<drochaid> jamest_: it sucks ... should I look at whatever doc you're talking about now? ;)
<drochaid> damn .. beaten by jcater
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> jamest_: not sure if i may dare to ask you this
<reinhard> could you save as text somewhere on ash
<reinhard> i don't have lyx installed
<reinhard> and have had enough fight w/ installing stuff today ;)
<reinhard> not to even mention docbook :)
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> got gfcvs to run
<jamest_> reinhard you have decent net connection?
<jamest_> apt-get install lyx
<jamest_> and you're done
<jamest_> :)
<reinhard> ok let me try
<reinhard> Sorry, but the following packages have unmet dependencies:
<reinhard>   lyx: Depends: libforms0.89 but it is not installable
<reinhard> E: Sorry, broken packages
<jamest_> ooooo
<jamest_> you don't run non-free then do you?
<reinhard> not sure
<reinhard> probably not
<jamest_> if you're not against it
<jamest_> then just add non-free in your apt-sources lines
<jamest_> example from mine
<jamest_> deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ woody main contrib non-free
<jamest_> reinhard: something else you might want to do
<jamest_> apt-get install netselect
<jamest_> then
<dneighbo> btw: pyxml shouldnt be necessary anymore
<jamest_> netselect-apt woody
<jamest_> which will make a sample sources.list file for you based upon best performing debian mirrors in your area
<jamest_> is there a wysiwyg editor for docbook yet?
<jamest_> or some doc system that doesn't seem to enjoy licking the bag
<reinhard> texin..
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> didn't want to say
<reinhard> that
<jamest_> lol
<jamest_> i want something where I don't have to program my docs anymore
chillywilly (~danielb@d186.as6.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest_> lyx is fine but my using the docbook document class is kicking my ass as docbook is as stable as derek at an M$ Developers conference
<dneighbo> um
<reinhard> lol
<dneighbo> lyx is just wrong
<dneighbo> i would go texinfo if you cant get docbook to work
<jamest_> and docbook is just shit
<jamest_> :)
<reinhard> huh
Action: reinhard wonders if this is the real dneighbo
<reinhard> ;)
<dneighbo> reinhard i never have had issue with texinfo
<jamest_> docbook tools will not work on solaris after hours of trying
<dneighbo> i offerred to use it over docbook in the very beginning
<jamest_> recent changes in docbook somethings broke the packages docs on ash
<dneighbo> the number one reason i dont like lyx
<dneighbo> is its gui only
<jamest_> and have rendered all my lyx docs based upon docbook useless
<dneighbo> unless of course you are a badass with tex
<dneighbo> there are the issues of non free and using xforms etc but my big gripe is gui only :)
Action: jamest_ is about to use openoffice 
<jamest_> just gots to buy that 512MB of RAM and I'm there
<dneighbo> jamest_ at one time i considered that :)
<dneighbo> its just too hefty a requirement
<dneighbo> im honestly leaning towards going back to texinfo
<dneighbo> it would make fsf very pleased
<dneighbo> and honestly i think it better probably than lyx
<jamest_> i just want wyswyg
<jamest_> that's all 
<dneighbo> and docbook has gotten wierd of late
<jamest_> i don't care what it is as long as I don't have to code it
<dneighbo> i.e. they are changing the style sheets WAY toomuch
<jamest_> i've got more than enough on my plate as it is
<dneighbo> jamest_ honestly i fight like hell to use lyx
<dneighbo> it maybe wysiwyg
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> its like m$ frontpage
<dneighbo> it dont do what the hell you tell it to do
<nickr> the problem is frontpage suckers you into thinking you can make html do exactly what you tell
<dneighbo> one day i spent an hour trying to split bullet list in half w/ new headings
<nickr> it
<nickr> LaTeX is similar
<dneighbo> nickr that is what lyx is
<jamest_> lyx does what I tell it
<nickr> I'm saying its the output formta not the editor
<dneighbo> it tries to SUCKER you into think you can make LaTeX do what you tell it :)
<jamest_> it's docbook support is just broken now
<dneighbo> as long as you are writing docs i wont complain what you do them in :)
<nickr> Lyx does a pretty good job in my experience. Its as WYSIWYG is as you can get wy LaTeX
<jamest_> honestly
<jamest_> i dont' care
Action: jamest_ is just venting at docbook at the moment as all my docs are now broken
<jamest_> i'm about 1/2 tempted to switch the document class to something else in lyx and move on
<jamest_> but i know people wanted docbook (i did original docs in texinfo)
<jamest_> so now I'm asking for a docbook wysiwyg editor
<reinhard> lyx tells me that the document uses the unknown class "docbook-"
<reinhard> something
<jamest_> sigh
<reinhard> but the window ends there in the middle of the word
<jamest_> apt-get install sgmltools-lite docbook-xml
<jamest_> and welcome to hell :)
<chillywilly> hi
<reinhard> actually it's not funny
<reinhard> but at least it's amusing that there are less dependencies to run gnuef than to read it's docs :)
<jamest_> i can convert to text but it's a far from complete document w/ lots of cruft in it
<jamest_> i basically took the forms techref and started hacking
<chillywilly> hmmm, docbook is working here
<chillywilly> but I think I am lucky
<chillywilly> and I agree with dneighbo the style sheet changes lick balls yo

<dneighbo> of stuff i like but dont have
<drochaid> dneighbo: what sorta stuff?
<dneighbo> i was suprised to see some 80s stuff on there 
<nickr> Heh
<nickr> Yea
<dneighbo> well today the one that caught my eye was mexican radio
<dneighbo> i think yesterday was rock me amadeus
<nickr> been hitting the Low-Fidelity Allstars pretty heavily lately
<nickr> yea
<nickr> I like falco :)
<dneighbo> generally what is interesting to me is that his playlist is 50/50
<dneighbo> 50 stuff i like
<dneighbo> 50 stuff i havent heard of

<nickr> heh
<dneighbo> if it were 50 i like 50 i dont like etc it would be different story :)
<nickr> most of it is stuff I've never heard of but isn't new
<nickr> just been listening to a lot of random stuff lately
<dneighbo> nickr right
<nickr> I was rather pleased to discover LFA though
<dneighbo> i like to 'expirement' with music

chillywilly (~danielb@169.207.132.166) joined #gnuenterprise.
<nickr> I have a thing in xmms, the songchange plugin, which runs a script
<dneighbo> the volume xx/xx
<dneighbo> should be a status bar visual
<nickr> each time the song changes, it prepends the songname to the list
<nickr> and chops the list to the rigcht length
<nickr> i then hawe a wholly separate script that runs from cron
<nickr> and it gets the data from the XMMS infopipe plugin
<dneighbo> that does the time
<nickr> fro the 'live' info
<dneighbo> etc
<dneighbo> well its pretty cool
<nickr> Okay
<dneighbo> put it in debian so i get off my butt and set it up 
<nickr> both of these scripts write to a directory that I rsync every minute to my website
<nickr> this also takes care of my webcam and other things that are 'live'
<drochaid> cool playlist nickr ... I like the quote at the bottom :)

<chillywilly> is this a GNUe approved slogan that I may use without people getting their panties into a bunch?
<nickr> I liked your old slogan
<chillywilly> yea, but people complained
<nickr> "BUY MY SOFTWEH!"
<chillywilly> they made me renig on it
<drochaid> lol
<chillywilly> they claimed it property of GNUe
<chillywilly> so I am being the nice guy and trying to find something else
<chillywilly> nickr: that was never my slogan it was more like "Buy My Software Bitch!"
<chillywilly> as that's more my style
<drochaid> chillywilly: you could always borrow my slogan ... "Scotlands most inovative consultancy" ... but you may need to alter it a bit :)
<nickr> I prefer the 'EAT IT BITCH!' slogan
<chillywilly> eh...
<drochaid> nickr: surely "SUCK IT BITCH!" ?
<drochaid> eat sounds a little ... final
<chillywilly> "buy my services or be damned to the eternal fires of hell"
<nickr> I don't think it refers to quite the same thing
<drochaid> ah
<chillywilly> that should be an eye opener
<chillywilly> what do yall think?
<chillywilly> btw, I am changing up my logo once again

<dtm> Bah!!!!  Don't you all want your sauce to go with that?!?!  HUH!?  QUITTERS!!!
<dtm> ok well it looks like i'll be the only one holding vigil...  ALL NIGHT.
<ajmitch> :)
<nickr> hehe
<ajmitch> don't worry dtm, we'll be thinking of you
<nickr> I'm not going for a bit
<nickr> but I tell you what, I'm not going to think of dtm when I do go
<dtm> it would be cool if i had a magic wand to turn you all into honeybees and then you'd make a lot of honey and then i'd cast a spell and put you to sleep and eat it.
Action: ajmitch goes for dinner then
<dtm> mmmmmmmm    magic wands..........

<dtm> GOOD EVENING GENTLEMEN <i>!!</i>
Action: dtm plays GPL quake1
<dtm> <<<opengl and in stereo>>>
<dtm> ajmitch nickr:  take care guys.  thanks for indulging me ..  i blow off steam now and then.
<dtm> you're good sports!
<nickr> I enjoy abuse

<psu> dtm: frag one for us ;-)
<dtm> hey i played that just before Quake came out
<dtm> psu: o/~   ... and many mooooooooore!!!
<dtm> you f00lz will be wlecome to a multiplayer game once i ascertain that my firewall forwards that port inward
<nickr> I wonder if dtm could beat quake in 5 minutes
<dtm> so that i may hostificate it
<nickr> I could host it on my server
<dtm> nickr: sure...  i can....   watch QdQ beat it in 5 min
<dtm> .....
<dtm> http://planetquake.com/QdQ/
<nickr> heh
<nickr> I knew it was you!
<dtm> ^---  OBSERVE
<nickr> yea I know.
<nickr> thats what I was referring to
<dtm> nickr: isn't that utterly elite?
<dtm> i can see htat they do it almost faster than i can even think of it, yet i know that it could be done faster
<dtm> i dont know by WHO.. 
<nickr> quite elite yes
<dtm> maybe not MUCH faster
<dtm> nickr: espeically in the upper levels
<nickr> I thought the world record was like 3 something minutes
<dtm> they're firing before seeing the targets
<dtm> nickr: i can hardly bear the thought
<nickr> I imagine it takes a lot of practice and basically memorizing the whole game
<dtm> oh my goodness yes
<dtm> and a type of cognition
<nickr> I can almost picture how the thought process would work
<dtm> to be able to memorize 3d space in a game is not yet my bag, baby
<nickr> I'm more glacial in my processing
<dtm> i used to get sick playing Descent
<dtm> me too
<dtm> i strategize in that environment.  the only way i'm mostly reflexes is in a 2d side scroller like on 8bit NES
<dtm> like Super Mario Bros
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise ("off to work...").
<dtm> but i memorized those levels
<nickr> Ahh I loved Descent
<nickr> I was so good at it
<dtm> i couldn't play it worth crap
<dtm> i have the registered macos cd of it here
<dtm> we played Descent in DOSemu back in 1997
<dtm> or 1996
<nickr> hehe
<dtm> with pc speaker sound
<nickr> I played Descent in 1996 a Lot
<nickr> I played two player over a serial cable cooperative
<dtm> haha i had friends who did that
<dtm> iplayed Doom2 over modem
<dtm> until the upper levels -- too slow on a 486 dx 33 and 14400 bps
<dtm> litearlly too slow
<dtm> like 3 fps or < 1 fps
<nickr> I really liked descent because I like 0 G environments and being able to think in real 3d with no up or down
<dtm> hehe
<dtm> that made me ill :)
<nickr> hehe
<nickr> it'd probably make me ill now a days
<dtm> well ok i'm going to now try hooking up quake1 on my tv and stereo speakers
<nickr> hehe
<nickr> I wonder if I have quake1 data
<dtm> yeah i WONDER where a fella could obtain such data...  ;)
<nickr> oh wait I do have it
<dtm> which happens to be 14MB under bzip2
<dtm> ok i'm gonna hook it up   brb   
<dtm> nickr: we can play that and/or q3a
<dtm> i have no quake2 game data at all
<nickr> I like quake2 better
<dtm> never played it
<nickr> I'll uhh
<dtm> DONT SAY IT
<dtm> NOT IN PUBLIC
<nickr> 'sell' you a 'copy' when I have the bandwidth to do it
<dtm> SSSHHHHH
<dtm> bbl
<nickr> it will be a completely 'legal' transfer of 'property'
Action: ajmitch back
<dtm> nickr: ok
<dtm> nickr: well, in that case...
Action: dtm notes with dismay that quake1 and q3a will not display properly on ntsc by defualt
<dtm> it's just wron
<dtm> g
<dtm> it's not fair!
<dtm> i just watched QdQ episode1
<dtm> i have nehahra but i haven't played it
<dtm> i oughtta watch the movie
<dtm> i started learning quake1 last weekend, and i played the first episode , e1m1 to e1m4, plus e1m8
<dtm> i then realized that i'd accidentally selected the 'hard' level.
<dtm> i died a ton of times from the abominable electric snowman in e1m1
<ajmitch> ok
<dtm> so i think i'll restart it with the 'easy' level :}
Action: ajmitch has not played quake for many a long while
<dtm> coz i have no idea what to expect
<dtm> i can say though that from watching QdQ, the nightmare level doesn't look much harder than the 'hard' level.  in fact much of the game looks a lot less hard than Doom was.
<dtm> especially nightmare
<dtm> doom in nightmare mode had about 820375270 concurrent characters.
<dtm> bbl, playing!@#(*)
<nickr> I sleep now.
<ajmitch> night
<dtm> yay i just beat e1m1-e1m4
<dtm> at 'normal' level
<dtm> it's _way_ easier
<dtm> didn't die once
<dtm> ajmitch: so what are you upto?

<Harald1> hi
<jamest> hey Harald1
<jamest> you know the cr/lf vs lf issue
<jamest> something extreme odd is going on on win32
<jamest> the widget is ok being passed strings with just \n in them
<jamest> however it must autoconvert to \r\n
<jamest> which throws the cursor placement off
<Harald1> jamest: ah, that explains why I hadn't problems, when I tested it in a small wypython app
<Harald1> did you change anything, or are there still problems?
<jamest> I've just been playing
<jamest> i haven't applied the latest patches you sent yet
<Harald1> jamest: well it isn't complete. It just an example of what I think has to be done to convert to \n when storing in the db. but I'm not sure that making a conversion in _tosqlString is enough
<Harald1> but as the widget does autoconvert \n -> \r\n, it could work

<dtm> http://home.smuckola.org/robot_insurance.mov -- check it out if you can play quicktime
<dtm> old quicktime, that is
<dneighbo> jcater any reason you started a lyx doc
<dneighbo> opposed to using existing docbook doc in cvs?
<dneighbo> for reports
<jcater> I'm 99.8% sure they cover different parts of reports
<psu> without setting any hares running, do we need to re-think our docs policy?
<psu> at the moment we seem to have a de facto and a de jure policy
<psu> as people understandably want to use a wysiwyg editor
<psu> We could always standardise on straight HTML, and use something like HTMLDOC 
<psu> to produce pdf & ps from this 
Action: jamest just wants docs that
<nickr> I think docbook is the best choice
<jamest> 1) don't require me to program them
<psu> and then people can use the wysigwig HTML ediotr of their choice
<jamest> 2) have tools that actually don't suck
<jamest> i was ok with docbook until i figured out that 
<jamest> 1) the tools work anywhere as long as it's linux
<jamest> 2) the tools work on linux 50% of the time
<nickr> the tools are based on open standards that could be applied to apps on any platform, not that that helps much
<jamest> i lost a good hour yesterday fucking with docbook (yet again) without any success it getting it working on my systems
<jamest> s/it getting it/trying to get it
<psu> does the docbook xslt work with sablatron? XML rather than SGML docbook
<nickr> it sohuld
<nickr> I tdhink standardizing on the XML docbook would be a positive move
<jamest> and I have spent a good day with the jade and openjade and never got them to compile on solaris
<dneighbo> jcater i disagree
<psu> nickr: it *should* work as non-XML for jamest but it don't ;-)
<dneighbo> if the name is reporting concepts
<nickr> jade is NARSTY
<dneighbo> i think it belongs in report proposal
<dneighbo> i.e. the report proposal was meant to build on
<psu> if even jamest can't hack something into working, I fear it
<dneighbo> if its a users guide
<jcater> I AM NOT GETTING INTO THIS ARGUMENT AT THIS POINT IN TIME
<dneighbo> then i agree it should be separate
<dneighbo> btw: im not arguing lyx vs docbook here
<dneighbo> im arguing fragmented vs non fragmented documentation
<jcater> the only existing reports documentation I've seen
<jcater> deals w/corba and communications
<jcater> nothing more
Action: psu will shut up, as this isn;t a useful; discussion on what may be a release weekend 
<jamest> psu: docs are a huge problem for us
<dsmith> I know you guys don't like it, but texinfo is a really nice format.  I used to use it on dos/win systems!  It's easy on the eyes (looks good without formatting).  Has outstanding printed output.  Can be converted into pdf, info, html.  
<psu> jamest: agreed
<dsmith> And it's the standard GNU format, besides.
<jamest> dsmith: yes, we did docs in texinfo at one time
<dsmith> There is also great support in emacs for texinfo.
Action: psu really will shit up this time
<dneighbo> um i still dont know where 'we dont like texinfo' comes from
<psu> s/shit/shut
<jcater> I'm trying my damnest to get some useful docs generated for the upcoming release
<psu> one of my worst irc typos ever...
<jcater> so please let me be
<jcater> we can discuss afterwards :)
<dneighbo> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/reporter/
<dneighbo> is what im talking about
<jamest> people wanted docbook so derek went to the trouble of converting everything to docbook
Action: drochaid is back (gone 04:26:16)
<jamest> my biggest issue with any docs is they must be easy to write
<dneighbo> this was a big picture overview
<jcater> dneighbo: that addresses nothing that I'm addressing
<dneighbo> but was meant to be filled with more detail
<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> your missing the point
<dneighbo> this is an INCOMPLETE document
<jamest> texinfo and docbook have me spending time programming the docs
<dneighbo> what you are doing now (the details) were to go in it
<jamest> instead of programming GNUe
<dneighbo> dont argue that, you fight losing battle stick with the tools suck its valid
<dsmith> jamest: Really!.  Hmm.  I find that using a wisiwig kind of word-processor thingy does that to me.
<dneighbo> i.e.
<dneighbo> doing 
<dneighbo> <para>blah</para>
<dneighbo> is no more difficult
<nickr> I thought abiword could export docbook
<dneighbo> than selecting Paragraph in lyx and typing
<jcater> dneighbo: ok, we'll use docbook
<jcater> HOWEVER
<dsmith> jamest: I guess I'm just used to it.
<dneighbo> im not ADOVCATING docbook
<jcater> docbook tools don't work for me
<dneighbo> seriously
<nickr> if it doesn't you could use an xslt to convert the abiword xml format
<jcater> so someone else can write them
<dneighbo> docbook doesnt work on ash anymore?
<jamest> dneighbo: paragraph typing is far easier than looking for the error <tag>Something about tags/tag>
<dsmith> jamest: Exactly!
<jamest> dneighbo: it might
<jamest> honestly I don't know
<jamest> it's by the week
<jamest> last I knew it works
<psu> IMHO this discussion (which I apologise for starting) really belongs next week
<nickr> use a standardized text format, and I'll write a perl script to convert them to docbook :)
<psu> once the release is out the door
<jamest> however docbook at home does not
<psu> IMHO this discussion (which I apologise for starting) really belongs next week
<jcater> nickr: I wouldn't be opposed to that
<jamest> docbook at work does not
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> as I prefer writing text
<jcater> but it's hard to get text into other formats :)
<nickr> just put to cr between each paragraph /italic/ *bold* _underline_
<nickr> you don't really exploit the logical markup that way
<nickr> but
<dneighbo> sigh i dont mind arguing about what format to use
<nickr> whatever :)
<jcater> I was trying to be nice and use a structured/standard format that can be converted
<dneighbo> but that really wasnt my point
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> we really need chapters, sections, etc
<jamest> IMHO
<dneighbo> im more concerned that we are now going to have two documents that have a reports overview
<dneighbo> that will probably 'conflict'
<jcater> dneighbo: COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TOPICS
<jamest> if there was any editor that let me easily write docbook
<jcater> I've already said that
<dneighbo> jcater: i think it should all be one document
<jamest> and if I never have to build the docs
<jamest> then I'm ok with docbook
<nickr> I coulda sworn abiword supported docbook
<dneighbo> nickr it does
<nickr> it does!
<nickr> wtf
<dneighbo> its not worth it, you must pry lyx from their cold dead hands
<nickr> use fuckin abiword
<dneighbo> which is why its not worth arguing about
<jamest> huh?
<jcater> wtf?
<jamest> lyx sucks too
<nickr> abiword isn't crusty like lyx
<jamest> it just sucks less than doing it by hand
<dneighbo> again my point was not to bring up the what format is best war
<jamest> abiword is cool if it works
<dneighbo> jamest: i think 99% of our docbook issues are that of staleness
<dneighbo> we didnt keep up with the times
<nickr> I don't know how well abiword would do uhh the logical formatting of docbook though
<dneighbo> our docs are written to use sgml and jade(dssl)
<jamest> we don't have time to keep up with the times is my point
<dneighbo> which is all but dead
<jamest> i don't want to program docs
<dneighbo> so when you get the docbook tools that are now
<dneighbo> xml and xsl 
<dneighbo> there are 'issues'
<jamest> lyx/docbook is dead now too
<nickr> jamest: you should write in plaintext and let someone else 'program' them
<jamest> they change things as often as the wind changes direction
<dneighbo> jamest: probably for the smae reasons
<nickr> its much easier for someone to take a doc and convert it
<dneighbo> nickr thats the idea behind docbook really
<jcater> dneighbo: that link you gave me is for a reports infrastructure proposal
<jamest> nickr: we have tons of .txt docs
<dneighbo> i mean we only use like 5 tags
<jamest> no one has steped up to convert them
<dneighbo> so this 'programming docs' argument is a joke to me
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise ("probably not back till Mon - busy weekend").
<jamest> so I started on common and jcater is (trying) to start on reports
<jamest> i hate writing docs if the truth be know
<jamest> i don't need them
<jcater> as do I
<dneighbo> problem with the .txt docs is they are too incohesive and scattered
<dneighbo> and often conflicting
<reinhard> i feel the need to get into this discussion
<dneighbo> so when someone tries to consolodate them and format them
<reinhard> as i suspect one of the reasons for j* to write docs is to make me happy
<reinhard> happy == able to start with geas 
<dneighbo> its nearly impossible w/o getting the original authors involved
<reinhard> so i have to say
<reinhard> i am happy with every doc you write
<reinhard> and i appreciate your work
<dneighbo> i will say since we have doc/ dirs in each tool dir etc it has gotten much better
<reinhard> as i know what writing docs means for a programmer
<reinhard> no matter how and with which tool you write it
<reinhard> thank you anyway :)
<reinhard> --
<dneighbo> but on at least 5 occassions i tried to consolidate geas docs to no avail
<jamest> lol
<jcater> one large doc is much worse than 5 targeted docs imho
<dneighbo> for the programmer yes
<dneighbo> for the end user no
<jcater> No
[14:27] Last message repeated 2 time(s).
<dneighbo> becaues FINDING the docs is the problem
<dneighbo> the idea originally
<jcater> Each one has a different audience
<dneighbo> was to have as many small docs as you want
<dneighbo> and then create books from them
<dneighbo> so users had a choice to search for a targeted doc
jcater (~jason@w202.z065105010.mem-tn.dsl.cnc.net) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<dneighbo> or get a broader picture on a topic and garner all the docs for it
<nickr> should take the whole bodice of documentation and treat it as one book
<nickr> in separate files
<nickr> 'the gnue book'
<nickr> group all the docs for ecah module in a section
<dneighbo> nickr it was done that way at one time
<dneighbo> there was developers guide
<dneighbo> and a something else
<dneighbo> and a module guide 
<dneighbo> and they all made up the Definitive Guide
<nickr> at first you could do it just as an index, and then slowly migrate all the formats to docbook xml, so it could be an actual book
<nickr> actually you could look at the sections as books in a book colloction, and each doc as an article
<nickr> that way you could have chapters under each article

<dneighbo> could be interesting
<dneighbo> we could always use debian-doc
<dneighbo> which is like a skinny version of docbook :)
<chillywilly> sup folks
<dneighbo> http://www.w3.org/Amaya/
<dneighbo> could be very interesting as well
<chillywilly> still discussing docs formats?
<nickr> and I can feel the music tear, tear through my bones.
<nickr> debian-doc is being abandoned
<nickr> in favor of docbook
<jamest> really?
<jamest> wow
<dneighbo> nickr yeah im a part of that
<dneighbo> so blame me there :)
Action: jamest gets a rope
<dneighbo> as i seemed to ahve 'refan that flame' a few months ago
<nickr> heh
<dneighbo> when i wrote docs for debian jr
<dneighbo> i downloaded debian doc
<nickr> I'm on the DDP list and they talk about it all the time
<dneighbo> and said um this is basically docbook
<nickr> blah blah blah
<dneighbo> why not just use docbook
<nickr> debian lists are pointless, I'm quite bored of them
<nickr> I think docbook xml is probably the best choice in this day and age, just need some tools and infrastructure
<dneighbo> and so then debian-jr maintainer asked that on the ddp list
<dneighbo> and came back and told me thanks for making him open a can of worms ther e:)
<nickr> hehe
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> aren't there tools for docbook xml?
<jamest> sure
<nickr> yep
<jamest> emacs
<nickr> no really good frontends though
Action: chillywilly doesn't know as he's only usign sgml rigt now
<chillywilly> s/rigt/right
<nickr> for silly folks who want wysiwyg
<chillywilly> oh, you mean like guis and shit?
<nickr> yea
<chillywilly> who needs that crap
<nickr> abiwword should be fine though
<chillywilly> I have emacs
<chillywilly> :P
<dneighbo> amaya really might be interesting
<dneighbo> it looks like wysiwyg 
<nickr> amaya is only html though
<dneighbo> nickr it says its any markup
<nickr> hm.
<dneighbo> including mathML, svg etc
<dneighbo> you only need to provide it an DTD
<nickr> also you can't really do mysiwyg with logial markups
<dneighbo> which docbook has
<dneighbo> hmm
<chillywilly> well they use style sheets for presentation right?
<dneighbo> KDE and FreeBSD just moved to docbook for all docs
<nickr> yep.
<dneighbo> gnome alredy did
<nickr> yep
<dneighbo> and sounds like debian will be
<chillywilly> xsl....presentation for your data and more!
<dneighbo> makes me wonder why on earth
<nickr> Debian is also a member of OASIS
<dneighbo> the suite is still such a kludge
<nickr> actually I could join any of the OASIS groups if I want to
<dneighbo> and more importantly there are no good visual editors for it
<chillywilly> does gnome use docbook xml now?
<nickr> stop complaining and write one
<nickr> if they don't they should :P
<chillywilly> dneighbo: we have emacs though
<chillywilly> ;)
<nickr> it'd be nice if emacs knew about docbook and gave you a nice sidebar for manafging the chapters/books/etc
Action: dneighbo gulps
<dneighbo> it sounds like ther eis a good tool
<nickr> emacs is a great editor but they don't give you enough convenience tools
<dneighbo> http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xeena
<dneighbo> but it uses java
<nickr> yea
<chillywilly> yea, the emacs thingy could be better
<jamest> i'll take java for a good editor
<chillywilly> "mode"
<chillywilly> I should say
Action: chillywilly thwaps jamest
<dneighbo> jamest: well if i made a dtd for forms or reports etc
<dneighbo> it could be used for them too
<chillywilly> I thought schemas were the better thing
Action: chillywilly is a bit xml illiterate
<nickr> you can convert dtds to schemas
<nickr> schemas imho are way overcomplex though
<chillywilly> *sigh 14MB now to upgrade debian
<chillywilly> I need to get a cable modem
<nickr> I just don't track unstable
<nickr> it takes too long to even do an update
<chillywilly> what you running then?
<chillywilly> it doesn't take too long
<chillywilly> I just go to bed
<chillywilly> when I wake up
<chillywilly> it's usually done
<nickr> unstable
<chillywilly> ;P
<nickr> unstable circa march 15
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> this time I started it in the morning and went to work
<chillywilly> it hs been going all day
<chillywilly> but it timed out probably when my stupid modem hung up
<nickr> I'd have to download 217 megs if I were to upgrade right now
<chillywilly> then I had to do an update again to fix some broken shit
<chillywilly> and I need 14MB now instead of 200MB
<chillywilly> Need to get 13.1MB/234MB of archives. After unpacking 11.8MB will be used.
<chillywilly> ah crap mozilla is brokem
<chillywilly> woddy will be released May 1st eh?
<chillywilly> er, woody
<nickr> supposedly
<chillywilly> you don't sound so convinced
<chillywilly> that's still pretty fucking fast for debian
<chillywilly> wouldn't you say?
<nickr> I'm not convinced
<nickr> but I've never been a release manager so I don't know
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> ok, so maybe they will do it in Aug ;)
<nickr> heh
<nickr> I think things are going well mostly
<chillywilly> then whyt he pessimism?
<chillywilly> why the
<nickr> I just don't think they'll make may 1st
<chillywilly> middle of may? june?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> maybe june1

<jamest> amaya
<dneighbo> amaya?
<nickr> zeros pure vision
<jamest> <dneighbo> jamest: you try amaya or xeena?
<jamest> amaya
<jcater> I've used amaya and xeena
<jamest> deb package seemed very html based and unstable
<chillywilly> why you installing the jdk?
<jamest> xeena is java based
<jamest> jcater: do either of them achieve the status of "sucks less"?
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> just curious
<jcater> for what?
<chillywilly> you have to add the non-free section to sources.list?
<jcater> one is a tree-based xml editor
<jcater> the other is an html editor
<jcater> amaya shows promise as an html editor
<jcater> I couldn't imagine us doing docs in html, if that's what this is about
<chillywilly> texinfo!
<chillywilly> docbook!
<chillywilly> texinfo!
<chillywilly> docbook!
<chillywilly> lyx!
<chillywilly> stone tablets!
<jamest> .doc!
<chillywilly> uh, yea when pigs fly
<chillywilly> :P
<chillywilly> and hell freezes over
<nickr> I prefer clay tablets with canaeoform writing
<jcater> I prefer .py files
<chillywilly> code that documents itself
<chillywilly> that would be cool
<nickr> python has the infrastructure for thatn
<chillywilly> fuck docs
<chillywilly> yea, I know it has little doc strings
<chillywilly> but I don't think that would be enough
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> __doc__ right?
<nickr> afaik the whole ref manual is generated from the doc strings
<chillywilly> or whatever it's called
<chillywilly> heheh
<reinhard> anybody know how i can write a cpp macro
<reinhard> using #define
<reinhard> that expands into a multi-line expression
<reinhard> ?
<nickr> \=?
<nickr> er
<nickr> \
<chillywilly> should be no different than C
<reinhard> no the other way around
<reinhard> i want the _result_ to be more than one line
<reinhard> i.e. the _result_ should contain newlines
<nickr> oh
<nickr> why?
<reinhard> because i use cpp to preprocess a file of a different language than C
<reinhard> where newlines are syntax relevant
<nickr> ah
<nickr> thats silly
<nickr> use m4
<chillywilly> I know
<chillywilly> everbody funny
<chillywilly> now you funny too
<jamest> hmmmm
<jamest> i thought a few people only smelled funny
<chillywilly> gah, don't tell me nobody knows that song

<dneighbo> both support reading a dtd and using the confines

<dneighbo> but it would eliminate the

<drochaid> I can see a very large difference between the two
<chillywilly> if you don't care about offending them how can you care about them?

<nickr> offence is largely harm one does to oneself

<ajmitch> so list them for me ;)
<chillywilly> odmg.txt
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> some of them should contain lists as a member
<ajmitch> alrighty
<chillywilly> some contain a dictionary
<chillywilly> andn we should implement the methods for emilating those types
<chillywilly> er, emulating
<chillywilly> the __method__ type methods
<chillywilly> and the list or dictionary interface
<ajmitch> yeah
<chillywilly> (depednign on which type it shoudl be most like
<chillywilly> and also some op methods
<chillywilly> like
<chillywilly> __add__
<ajmitch> i see you can override <, >, and == comparisons as well in python
<chillywilly> and the ODMG interfaces
<ajmitch> using __cmp__
<chillywilly> which can be implemented by derived classes
<chillywilly> so they should be more like abstract classes
<chillywilly> that implement eh python stuff
<ajmitch> ok, dunno how long this will take, i have a few more important things to do ;)
<chillywilly> and leave the ODMG methods alone for children to implement
<chillywilly> I think
<chillywilly> well
<chillywilly> I'll work on it then
<chillywilly> I am hoping to get the the point of difining the odmg collections classes in python

<chillywilly> jabber is sort of a SOAP replacement

<chillywilly> but it's not going to be a defacto standard or anything

<chillywilly> howdy
<Harald1> hmm. does anybody know a decent editor under SunOS?
<chillywilly> vi ;)
<chillywilly> doesn't emacs run on SunOS?
<Harald1> chillywilly: yes, but it's not installed. unbelievable. they install a unix-server without emacs! even my windows has it
<Harald1> they = my university
<chillywilly> request that they install emacs ;)
<Harald1> I guess they didn't install it because they use the clients to teach students unix and they want that you use vi 
<chillywilly> oh
Isomer (dahoose@210-86-57-103.jetstart.xtra.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> still they don't know that it is installed

Action: chillywilly took Java as an elective though
<chillywilly> it was an easy A

<chillywilly> hmmm, you know it seems that the OMG wants to do the same as what we are trying to do with gnurpc
<chillywilly> er, well at least have ti be an extensible framework
<chillywilly> I submit this same data implies something else. It suggests that the OMG is on the verge of successfully reinventing itself. The OMG has always been about helping companies create and manage distributed systems. Rather than sticking with a single CORBA approach, however, the OMG has had the vision to step back and embrace a new approach that will allow companies not only to use CORBA but also to simultaneously design systems that w
<chillywilly> port all of the other languages and middleware systems they need to support. 
<chillywilly> instead of CORBA they are going UML to code now
<chillywilly> it's wacky shit
<chillywilly> they are adding stuff to UML to help make code generation easier
<chillywilly> this is cool as I always thought the one stop CORBA solution was short sighted
alexey (alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<derek> chillywilly: yeah but using objects + corba adds inches to your penis so it must be good ;)
<jamest> boy
<jamest> i'm glad i don't both corba and object or I'd have to give up wearing shorts
<chillywilly> why do I even bother talking to you people
<jamest> cause we're fun
<jamest> :)
<derek> roflmao
<chillywilly> I was just noting that OMG sees the error of their ways and wants to support more then corba ;)

<derek> Blade Director to Adapt 'Akira' For Western Audiences
<derek> MoviesPosted by timothy on Saturday April 13, @10:48AM
<derek> from the no-longer-april-fool's-day dept.
<derek> dswensen writes: "According to the Sci-Fi Channel web site, Steven Norrington (director of Blade) is going to write and direct an adaptation of the classic anime Akira . Norrington says his story 'preserves the tone, the visual and the epic scope of the original, whilst telling a somewhat more accessible story [to Western audiences]." The article doesn't mention whether the adaptation will be animated or live-action. Given Norring
<derek> ack record and the butchery that usually takes place under the guise of making something 'accessible,' it's hard to take this as extraordinarily good news."

<derek> i didnt mean to do that
<derek> i meant to paste the article on slashdot about win wifi cards :(
<derek> i.e. first winmodems
<derek> now win wireless
<derek> jamest i really am sorry
Action: derek is secretly jealous that jamest doesnt need corba+objets
<jamest> i was about to kick you
<jamest> as i figured you'd screwed up 
<jamest> and would pop back in :)
<drochaid> win wireless?
<drochaid> still on WEP?
<drochaid> or have they started native ipsec do das yet
<derek> drochaid: it appears tehy are trying to convince wifi card makers
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<derek> to not use those 'expensive' hardware but rather use windows o/s software to control things
<derek> to lower the price to the *consumer*
<derek> i.e. its always about the *consumer* w/ m$
Action: derek is extremely sarcastic this morning
<jamest> didn't mean to ruin your day derek
<jamest> :)
<drochaid> <derek> i.e. its always about the *consumer* w/ m$
<drochaid> well ... that's true derek
<drochaid> just not in the way you meant it :)
<jamest> ooooo
<drochaid> it's all about limiting consumer choice to their own products .. so it IS all about the consumer ;)
<chillywilly> it's about screwing the consumer
<jamest> for those few brave souls that use the new --internal-debugger option on forms/reports/nav
<drochaid> now .. my pizza should be ready, back in a mo
<drochaid> sorry derek :)
<chillywilly> muuwahahhaha
<chillywilly> mmm, pizza
<jamest> if you need to set a breakpoint then you must do two "step" commands first
<chillywilly> that sounds good

<jamest> 555 Unsupported option: Enterprise 
<jamest> is printed at top of web page
<derek> hmmmm
<derek> jamest: i think that is an 'email' error

<Isomer> surprisingly enough, it's only slightly more verbose than the IRC protocol ;)
<chillywilly> :P
<Isomer> :)
<chillywilly> geas needs to speak IRC ;)
<chillywilly> that would be so much fun
<Isomer> mozilla have a great li'l bot
<Isomer> called mozbot from memory
<Isomer> <botbot> SeaMonkey: 'Mac Debug Depend (viper1)' has changed state from Horked to Success.
<chillywilly> horked, heheh
<chillywilly> that's a ren and stimpy word
<derek> ok i bet someones email address is invalid
<Isomer> could have a li'l bot in here that tells you when someone does a CVS commit
<Isomer> and what their log message is
<derek> you said ticket #1 right?
<chillywilly> derek: you are invalid, please authenticate yourself

<chillywilly> that's like his favorite log message
<chillywilly> ;P
<Isomer> then you slap him around the head to give better commit messages :)
<chillywilly> I dunno wtf it means
Action: Isomer ponders implementing a cvs commit bot for irc
<Isomer> he's commiting on his devel box so he can cvs update on his "test" box
<Isomer> at a guess
<chillywilly> yea
<derek> jamest your close 'worked' on that bug
<derek> so im thinking its an workflow (email) issue
<jamest> i blame the dcl admin
<derek> hmmm i added another item to it and no error
<derek> sa (the admin) had no password
<derek> so its possible perhaps that it tried to 'notify' the admin and barfed
<chillywilly> it's the derek curse
<derek> as i probably created the first ticket in the sa account to test
<chillywilly> that's what I blame
<chillywilly> he touched it
<chillywilly> it went to shit
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> i routed sa to root@gnuenterprise.org
<derek> so let me know if you encounter any more
<chillywilly> derek: you suck
<chillywilly> from now on I am just going to ignore you like you ignor me you freak
<derek> what do you mean?
<derek> where did i ignore you?
<jamest> um
<jamest> we have an admin account with no password?
<chillywilly> did someone say something?
<chillywilly> ;)
<derek> ?
Action: chillywilly throws many fishies at derek
<derek> jamest: is there ANY chance that fsf would put spam assassian or something on their servers?
<derek> as the amount of crap mail coming ot our list is getting unmanageable
<chillywilly> just filter it yourself dude
<jamest> i seriously doubt it
<derek> i.e. im deleting like 5 or so spam mails a day
<derek> chillywilly: you dont get it
<jamest> chillywilly: we are manually
<derek> its not comeing to me
<derek> its coming to the mailing list
<derek> and i am being nice and deleting it for YOU
<derek> and everyone else
<chillywilly> spamassassin should mark it as spam though when you download it
<derek> but its becoming a severe nuisance as mailman doesnt play nice anymorre with browsers
<derek> and im gettinng a boat load of requests to tend to mails that arent approved yet for mailman (as is jamest and jcater i assume)
<chillywilly> I would just let it fly and people will just have to filter their own
<chillywilly> if it that big of a headache
<derek> chillywilly: i somewhat agree, but it makes us look 'unprofessional' that we cant even keep spam off our lists
<jamest> derek: yes, i cannot admin the lists anymore from mozilla or konq
<derek> jamest: i think i learned the trick
<derek> login
<derek> click all as whatever you want them to be
<derek> and hit submit
<chillywilly> well the hurd lists aren't even moderated
<derek> it will just hang
<derek> give it like 30 seconds
<chillywilly> I get lots of crap on them
<derek> then go to the entry bar at top
<derek> and hit enter
<derek> (i.e. like a refresh w/o a repost)
<derek> and it accepts your originall submittal and says all requests processed and they are
<derek> its hokey but its been working
<jamest> cool
<Isomer> recent mozilla's have that fixed I believe
<Isomer> they barf'd on POST's over 10k in size
<chillywilly> ick
<Isomer> http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130301
Action: jamest is away: guests
<Isomer> so grab a nightly and hope for the best :)
<chillywilly> is the debian package fixed?
<chillywilly> 0.9.9-5
<Isomer> I would probably guess not
<Isomer> RC1 should be out in a few days
<Isomer> so wait until then ;)
<jamest> if people find the time I'd really like someone to hammer on forms/designer 
<chillywilly> blah, I'm not going to download mozilla
<jamest> and send me bug reports via dcl (or anyway possible)
<jamest> then after guests leave I'll fix 'em up
<jamest> the bugs not the guests
<derek> im swamped today but you be around a few
<derek> i might have an hour to hammer on it
<chillywilly> seems like everytime I click a tab fucking galeon wants to reload the page
<Isomer> rofl
<derek> jamest: for the record, the reason i find more bugs is i have a bigger hammer
<derek> example:
<derek> http://members.aon.at/cancer/kulturhof/images/hammer.jpg
<chillywilly> ok.....
Action: ra3vat recalls derek offered to send one overseas to him 
<derek> ra3vat: well i would ship a smaller one, as we are cutting costs over here :)
<ra3vat> derek: thanks, i'll let you know when there will be a chance to save on shipping cost also :)
<derek> its amazing what you learn when you read your own press releases :)

<nickr> Hrm, thats a tricky one
<derek> so i know its supported
<nickr> okay
<nickr> do you recall the driver?
<derek> but hoping i can get it working
<derek> um i can find out on google its a netgear
<derek> let me find it
<nickr> if its pnp or something its pretty easy. what installation mechanism are you using?
<derek> roflmao

[20:57] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<nickr> its scary when you provide most of your own info :)
<derek> sigh its all too common
<derek> nickr: i am installing potato 2.2r3
<derek> via 3 disk set
<derek> but want to immediately get network card working
<derek> and get it on my network and upgrade to testing for him
<nickr> yuck.
<nickr> you should use woody netinst always
<derek> agree but i dont have disks and burner is busted
<derek> and i am not sure how to do the network card
<nickr> okay
<nickr> er
<nickr> I have no idea of the driver.
<nickr> google search no lucky?
<derek> i htink ne2k
<derek> http://lhd.datapower.com/db/dispproduct.php3?DISP?1372
<derek> this give you enough info?
<nickr> ne2k is no good
<nickr> bad bad bad
<jcater> it's not that bad
<nickr> must be a pnp ne2k
<nickr> derek: you should get the 2.4bf disk set for woody
<nickr> that way you have the nifty kernel pnp driver
<derek> um too late
<derek> im already almost done with the potato install
<jcater> is this a new card?
<derek> um no
<derek> old card
<jcater> so he has no idea the irq and base port?
<derek> but i know it was support in red hat 5.2 or 6.0
<derek> as i had it working on that
<nickr> theres no way you can be 'almost done' if you don't have the network working.
<nickr> unless you installed from a CD or someting
<derek> installing from cd
<derek> actually 3 cd's
<jcater> derek: you have the EA201 driver disks?
<derek> that came with it?
<jcater> :
<jcater> :)
<jcater> take that as a no
<derek> or download
<derek> i might
<jcater> That's gonna be the easiest way to get the irq/port settings
<jcater> Do you know if, in rh, it was used in pnp mode?
<derek> been over 2 years
<derek> so nope
<derek> getting freaky crap on x install
<derek> geeks trying
<derek> _X11TransSocketUNIXConnect: CAn't connect: errno = 111
<derek> like 20 times
<derek> then says cant create XF86Config
<derek> then get 
<derek> Press [Enter] to switch to graphics mode
<derek> and i cant get out
<derek> any ideas
Maniac (User@h24-82-132-209.wp.shawcable.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jcater> this in the install?
<derek> yeah
<derek> i just did ctrl-c
<derek> and its skipping it now
ToyMan (stuq@c5300-2-ip52.albany.thebiz.net) left irc: No route to host
<jcater> you plan on updating this to woody once everything's working?
<jcater> if so, wouldn't worry about x until then
<nickr> don't even bother with X in potato
<derek> thats what im doing :)
<derek> i jsut didnt know how to get out of it :)
<derek> ctrl c worked :)
<derek> have to run to store (er drive) will be back in a minute
<derek> brandon might come in and ask for help
<jcater> you trust us w/a friend?
<nickr> wow
<nickr> thats some trust :)
Action: nickr plots
<derek> ok im back
<derek> install is done ready to play network
<derek> anyone still here?
<jcater> I could be
<derek> where should i start
<jcater> are you at the command prompt?
<derek> btw: i have the EA201 ethernet card : drivers and diagnostics disk ver 1
<derek> im at command prompt
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> any chance that disk is bootable?
<derek> nope
<jcater> or do you have an old dos bootable floppy laying around?
<derek> well maybe
<derek> but it says at dos prompt execute:
<derek> yeah i probably have a bootable floppy
<jcater> that'd make things so much easier
<jcater> you'll want to boot up, run the setup program on that floppy
<jcater> disable PNP
<jcater> and select an IRQ and IO Port
<jcater> (it's possible this was done 2 years ago, but we don;t know what they are)
<derek> ok
<derek> rebotting in dos
<derek> er rebooting
<derek> pnp disabled
<derek> full duplex disabled
<derek> interrupt number : 3
<derek> i/o base address 240
<jcater> any particular reason full-duplex is disabled?
<derek> connector type UTP RJ-45
<derek> type ea201
<jcater> are these the existing settings?
<derek> busmode 16-bit
<jcater> or have you changed them?
<derek> jcater: either i changed it cause it caused problems or it was the default :)
<jcater> also, is this the same computer system
<derek> yes
<jcater> or did you swipe this card from another
<jcater> ok
<derek> nope card just sitting in here for 2 years :)
<jcater> just leave everything alone and get back into debian
<jcater> we have what we came for
<derek> ok
<derek> rebooted
<derek> ready to rock and roll
<jcater> go into modconf
<jcater> and find the Network section
<jcater> ...I forget the organization of the potato modconf
<jcater> then select the "ne"
<jcater> when prompted for arguments
<jcater> use
<jcater> io=0x240 irq=3
<derek> sucessful
<derek> lsmod
<derek> ne 6132 0 (unused)
<derek> 8390 5924 [ne]
<derek> so seems to be there
<derek> now what
<jcater> edit /etc/network/interfaces
<jcater> is this a dhcp setup?
<derek> no dhcp
<jcater> you need to add 
<jcater> #iface eth0 inet static
<jcater> #  address 192.168.10.2
<jcater> #  netmask 255.255.255.0
<jcater> (without the # and with the correct data :)
<jcater> plus you'll need to add a nameserver line to /etc/resolv.conf
<jcater> err, how will this be connecting to the internet?
<jcater> is there a gateway/router there?
<jcater> if so, you also need
<jcater>       gateway 192.168.0.x
<jcater> in that /etc/network/interfaces
<jcater> (with the correct value of course :)
<derek> ethernet up
<derek> rock

<jcater> cool
<derek> having brain damage
<derek> in debian wehre do you setup the gateway?
<jcater> /etc/network/interfaces
<derek> ?
<jcater> err
<derek> that doesnt sound right
<jcater> are you wanting to make this a gateway
<jcater> or point it to a gateway
<derek> no
<derek> wanting to point it to a gateway :)
<jcater> this is my web server's /etc/network/interfaces
<jcater> iface eth0 inet static
<jcater>       address 65.105.10.203
<jcater>       netmask 255.255.255.248
<jcater>       gateway 192.168.0.201
<jcater> so I think that's the right way :)
<jcater> I use dhcp now at home, so that's the nearest example for me
<derek> i got it
<derek> we have net you are god
<derek> can you paste you sources.list here
<derek> as i only have one monitor
<derek> and my laptop isnt debian
<derek> i need to see what an http

<derek> rofl
<derek> i have never used it
<derek> i have heard 'interesting' things about it

<Mr_You> re

<Mr_You> hmm you should be able to write off GNU software development for tax purposes ;-))
<Mr_You> actually, that sounds like a good idea
<nickr> yea
<nickr> you know, it does
<Mr_You> specially for you guys.. directly with GNU
<nickr> If I actually made money and therefore payed taxes I'm sure it'd be a motivation to work on GNUe more ;)

<dtm> hi all
<Mr_You> hi 
<jcater> howdy
<dtm> how are yall doin
<Mr_You> not too bad, looks like I'll get a refund ;-)
<Mr_You> BTW, something you might consider next year.. writing off all this time spit on GNU software ;-)
<jcater> gah
<Mr_You> just mentioned it a sec ago
<jcater> me owes lots and lots of money this year
<jcater> I wish I could write of GNUe time
<Mr_You> why can't you?
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> how would I?
<dtm> yeah i'm getting a $3500 IRS refund
<dtm> got my $300+ state refund
<jcater> that's roughly what I owe :)
<Mr_You> somehow tally up all your time, figure a rate for that time, then get GNU Free Softwares tax ID.. should be all you need to do AFAIK
<dtm> so, what's the rough outline procedure for how someone would write off "time" spent on community software development?
<dtm> Mr_You: oh really
<dtm> Mr_You: i would bet the FSF would know exactly how, if anyone
<Mr_You> yeah
<dtm> Mr_You: go axe em:)
<Mr_You> you mean jcater heh
<dtm> yeah.  Mr_You and jcater can go axe the FSF!
<dtm> :)
<Mr_You> I don't have anything to write off, so I wouldn't be asking ;-)
<dtm> i would imagine if that's possible, then it could include a portion of the cost of the computer and ISP
<jcater> hmm
<dtm> maybe even rent and power
<jcater> well, I need to write off $3000
<Mr_You> no way
<dtm> coz that's how it is for a home business
<jcater> and at a rate of $100/hr
<Mr_You> its pretty much your time only..
<jcater> that's only 30 hrs
<jcater> shouldn't be too unreasonable :)
<Mr_You> otherwise GNU FSF would have to be paying for the phone line, etc.
<dtm> Mr_You: ok
<dtm> Mr_You: oh i suppose that's true
<dtm> then you could write those off for sure.
<Mr_You> you can write off those things when you have your own biz
<dtm> yep
<dtm> which i will do
<nickr> moo
<dtm> mewph
<dtm> meow
<Mr_You> hmm I built a custom kernel, and the pcmcia stuff doesn't "kick in" til I eject and insert my card
<nickr> mrow
<dtm> Mr_You: ever?  what if you restart the pcmcia services
<Mr_You> it should start on bootup
<dtm> does it?
<Mr_You> thats the problem.. it doesn't...
<dtm> so try restarting its init script.
<Mr_You> pcmcia services start, just doesn't turn the card on and load the appropriate module.. only when I insert and eject.. so its not doing a "probe" on started.. but why..
<Mr_You> hmm well
<Mr_You> will get to it later if I need.
<Mr_You> might be my modules.conf file
Action: jamest_ is away: sunburnt and sore

<dtm> Mr_You: i am a little too out of sync from being so sedentary!  when that happens, i read things totally jumbled and confabulatory and it surprises me when i finally read it correctly.  I thought for a second or two that you just said "I'll be back later to get weed".
<dtm> that's irritating
<dtm> coz i'm also thinking for a moment "why the *)#& is Mr_You wanting weed, and why is he telling us about it?!"
<Mr_You> I like weed.
<Mr_You> now that you mention it heh
<dtm> well never mind that!

<Mr_You> ok, that was rud
<dtm> be careful of who you talk to ... not all is as it seems....
<Mr_You> ok, that was rude
<dtm> Mr_You: sorry man  :)  it was in exactly the same context as every other discussion in here, but sorry :)
<derek> jamest_: nope you ran off
<derek> then been configuring a debian frankenbox 
<derek> fighting x
<derek> its odd it doesnt 'error' out
<jcater> derek: how's my XSLT's going?
Action: Mr_You clears it up for derek and points out dtm misread my text.
<dtm> derek: you're just nonstop configuring and upgrading!
<derek> but it thinks for a bit
<dtm> Mr_You: :)
<jcater> am I gonna have to whoop up a DCL work order on your butt? 
<derek> and screen just stays black
<derek> dtm: it seems that way
<derek> jcater: please do whoop me on the DCL
<dtm> Mr_You: he's never even going to acknowledge what i said -- see, that's also part of the context of every other discussion in here
<dtm> ;)
<dtm> Mr_You: it's all hot air!!
<derek> as to the the transformatins
<Mr_You> seems wasteful
<derek> the other day on the can i researched what it takes in xslt to do it
<derek> so i think i have a 'strategy' now
<derek> just need to implement
<jcater> cool
<dtm> Mr_You: there should be a process in the web log which interjects such a disclaimer/explanation into every page break ;)
<derek> we have a sick puppy (no not chilly) at the house
<dtm> derek: :(
<derek> so i might have to take him to vet inthe morning in which case i might be able to look at it before work
<dtm> derek: :(
<jamest_> derek: why are you letting my absence stop you from abusing my baby.....it's never stopped you in the past
<derek> grr woody still has jacked fonts 
<derek> what gives
<derek> jamest_: you remeber thje fix for this
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> "woody" and "jacked" in same sentence does not sound cool
<Mr_You> heh no
<derek> ok fixed
<derek> why does it insist on trying to use a font server
<derek> it NEVER works
<dtm> derek: so i assume that your debian fandom has resulted in some working hosts, right?
<dtm> derek: or are you only uptight over your local workstation
<dtm> derek: seems to me from what i've heard that debian has a _huge_ chasm between stable and unstable
<derek> easiest way to install kde?
<derek> with debian
<dtm> so people stay in a highly unstable limbo
<derek> dtm: well my big problem before on debian was fighting X
<dtm> and are a few notches above Slackware in the extraordinary maintenance issues
<derek> and its not a debian issue
<derek> its my card isnt supported in X
<derek> so i had to 'hack' around it
<dtm> oh that's right, you have a peesea
<derek> that and i had a fried motherboard that i was troubleshooting for a month
<Mr_You> X v4.x seems ok
<dtm> oh yeah.  hack around it except without vnc.  i a'member that.
<derek> so then i had to have a new new computer
<derek> i.e. i maintain 4 computers here at home
<derek> and 4 at work
<dtm> 4 computers at home, wow
<derek> but this configure is for a friend
<dtm> i hope those are generating revenue ;>
<derek> jcater: he is low on memory im thinking kde might be better
<derek> but need to know what the apt get for it is
<derek> ime thinking kword konqueror ---
<derek> i dont know :)
<dtm> derek: isn't it kde-base?
<dtm> derek: or you could select a simple app like knotepad or wahtever and let it resolve dependancies

<Mr_You> there is one that eliminated some icon graphics which may be better..
<Mr_You> either way its BSD licensed..
<nickr> most people who make themes for gtk are lazy and use the pixmap engine
<nickr> although Xenophelia is a nice exception
<nickr> it is a most exccelent and very fast flexible engine

<neilt> hello all
<Mr_You> hi
<neilt> been a bunch of committin going on
<Mr_You> whoo hoo
<neilt> we about to release something?
<Mr_You> man its 7pm.. my reference of time is toast
<neilt> :)
<Mr_You> was workin til 8am this morning
<neilt> i just cam home from real work
<neilt> :(
<neilt> maybe not real
<neilt> but you know what I mean
<brandon> nickr how do i add someone to audio group?
<nickr> adduser user audio
<nickr> then the user has to logout and log back in
<nickr> man
<brandon> how do  you make it so other than root can mount a cd?
<nickr> staring at an orange webpage for a while makes my red recepters tired
<jcater> neilt: yes
<jcater> in the next week, we'll be doing the first release of Reports
<nickr> brandon: if its debian, its already setup, as root make a link frem /dev/whatever to /dev/cdrom
<jcater> plus a maintenance release of common, forms, and designer
<jcater> Some of the commits you see are documentation for Common
<brandon> ?
<jcater> so GEAS can get underway again
<neilt> cool
<nickr> brandon: you need to first identify your cdrom device
<neilt> I wish i had more time to help
<brandon> nickr: grip does all that
<nickr> er
<brandon> im not manually mounting it grip it
<nickr> ah.
<jcater> neilt: it's been a bad winter for all of us
<jcater> not many commits from any of us until recently :(
<neilt> i wish i could see the end
<neilt> but alas it looks like 6 months before i come up for air
<jcater> ouch
<Mr_You> you could try automount also
<Mr_You> which I actually prefer but some do not
<nickr> brandon: grip shouldn't be mounting it
<brandon> in config it has
<brandon> CDRom device /dev/cdrom
<brandon> when i put in a cdrom i do nothing
<brandon> and it shows up in grip
<brandon> mabye debian is just automounting it (not grip)
<brandon> but grip recognizes it on mount or such
<ajmitch> hi all
<jcater> ajmitch: howdy
<neilt> ajmitch: hello
<ajmitch> what's up?
<ajmitch> neilt: i shoudl have time to help with GEAS, i hope :)
<ajmitch> tho i've said that before...
<ajmitch> at least it's getting done in python now ;)
<neilt> yep, thats cool
<neilt> its just sad that it will take a while to get back to working state
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> we'll get it there :)
<neilt> :)
<neilt> someone will have to explain to me how to debug python
<neilt> at least I hope someone will
<neilt> i have a nice gui for C
<neilt> no gui dev environ for python
<Mr_You> I saw some annoucement about a programming IDE not specificly for any language..
<ajmitch> what do you use for C?
<neilt> mac project builder
<ajmitch> ok
<neilt> it uses gcc and jam
<ajmitch> i confess to using emacs for python :)
<ajmitch> but i guess gideon might be usable?
<Mr_You> I could try to track it down if someone is interested.
<neilt> Mr_You: only interested if it is integrated with python
<Mr_You> it indicated it didn't care what environment you were using.. I dunno to what extent that means.
<brandon> exit
brandon (frootie@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<Mr_You> php was the only language mentioned I think
<ajmitch> hmm
<neilt> i have a great editor that is integrated with python
<ajmitch> but not a debugger?
<Mr_You> lemme look
<neilt> but I dont know how to step thru code
<neilt> etc
<ajmitch> right
<neilt> right not a debugger
<Mr_You> ajmitch: I dunno, ideally you could plug in your own external command line apps no?  ;-)
<Mr_You> lemme look real quick
<jcater>  our GNUe-Common includes a built-in stepping debugger now
<jcater> just run the app with --interactive-debugger
<jcater> e.g.
<jcater> gfclient --interactive-debugger intro.gfgd
<ajmitch> nice
<ajmitch> using pydb?
<neilt> wow
<jcater> ajmitch: yes
<ajmitch> cool
<jcater> it's very recent
<jcater> as in this past week :)
<jcater> but james was showing me all it can do
<jcater> and it rocks
<jcater> well, wife wants to <gasp> spend time together, so be back later
Action: jcater is away: dinner
<ajmitch> real life?
<ajmitch> how unfortunate
<Mr_You> well I couldn't find it, or what I saw was proprietary

<nickr> excellente
<jcater> mucho excellente
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> any particular reason?
<chillywilly> or just had a good Lord's day ;)?
<jcater> fresh donuts
<chillywilly> hehe
<nickr> I've been spending all day being creative and not wasting time worrying about stuff
<chillywilly> that's good to hear
<chillywilly> well I have to go upstairs and check something on the winders box
<chillywilly> (turbo tax filing status stuff)
<chillywilly> that I did for crazymike
<chillywilly> ssssh, don't let that out I know it's non-free :(
<chillywilly> oops
<chillywilly> we're logged aren't we?
<chillywilly> crud
<chillywilly> brb
Action: chillywilly is away: hitting the crack pipe
<jcater> I used TaxCut
<jcater> under linux :)
<jcater> (with the help of Win4Lin :)
<dsmith> jcater: tell me more
<jcater> ?
<dsmith> jcater: How hard was is to get taxcut running under win4lin?
<jcater> win4lin gives you a Windows desktop
<jcater> inside an X window
<jcater> I run Quark, MS Office, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, et al under it
<jcater> the install is no different than a Windows box
<dsmith> Ok.
<jcater> you'd click Start | Run... d:\setup
<jcater> it's really nice if you want a linux desktop fulltime
<jcater> but have Windows apps you must have
<jcater> (for work or whatever)
<dsmith> jcater: Do you think Notes would run?
<jcater> The only things known not to work are
<jcater> DirectX and some things that talk directly to hardware
<jcater> I'm pretty sure Notes would run
<dsmith> Hmmm
<jcater> btw, win4lin isn't free software
<jcater> but I was willing to pay the $70 to get away from a windows box
<jcater> of course, I was nervous that it wouldn't deliver
<jcater> but it did
<dsmith> jcater: How does it comepare to vmware?
<jcater> well, the end result looks the same
<jcater> i.e., you have a virtualized win98 session running under linux
<jcater> however, they are different
<jcater> in that vmware is designed to be a generic virtualizer
<jcater> win4lin is specific to win9x
<jcater> I've never used vmware
<dsmith> jcater: The boss uses vmware.  
<jcater> but everyone says the speed is incredibly different
<jcater> supposedly, vmware isn't the fastest kid on the block
<dsmith> heh
<jcater> win4lin flies
<jcater> PLUS
<jcater> win4lin uses your underlying linux filesystem
<jcater> which is much faster than fat32
<jcater> MUCH noticably faster
<jcater> a complete Win98 install took me like 5 minutes
<jcater> on the same machine, installing to a fresh drive (not linux), it took 25-30
<jcater> but the really cool thing
<jcater> is that since the files are literally linux files on a linux file system
<jcater> I can use grep or vi
<jcater> on the same files I use in windows :)
<dsmith> vmware allows the windows "box" to have a diefferent ip address than the Linux one.
<jcater> win4lin gives you two options
<jcater> one is to use Linux's tcp stack
<jcater> which means Network Neighborhood, et al don't work properly
<jcater> but this serves most needs
<jcater> that's what I do at home
<jcater> they also have another mode
<jcater> that actually uses "aliases" which uses a completely different IP address
<jcater> I use that at work
<jcater> and it works well
<jcater> as far as windows is concerned, it has its own network card
<jcater> with its own interface
<jcater> and ip address, etc
<jcater> so you can have it either way
<dsmith> What about video drivers?  Is there a special driver?
<jcater> win4lin comes with a driver for video and network
<jcater> what actually happens is
<jcater> you install win4lin
<jcater> then you put a win98 cd in your drive
<jcater> and "load" this CD
<jcater> then you tell win4lin to install windows
<jcater> and you actually see Microsoft's Windows installer pop up in a screen
<jcater> like it's on a fresh machine
<jcater> but win4lin has added its drivers to window's cab directory
<jcater> so windows sees them as a "plug-n-play" device
<jcater> so never even prompts you
<dsmith> sounds good.
<jcater> and I've never had a windows session crash yet :)
<jcater> I've had windows sessions running (often minimized) for 30 days
<jcater> I've never had a windows box up for that long :)
<jcater> now, I'm running this on an 800Mhz Duron and on a 1.6Ghz Athlon
<jcater> and the windows session is just as responsive as a dedicated install
<jcater> but I don't know what this would look like on a 166Mhz celeron
<jcater> :)
<dsmith> heh
<jcater> I've heard it's still usable
<jcater> but I can't attest to that
<dsmith> well, vmmare is horribly slow.
<jcater> well, vmware is many things
<dsmith> Eats gobs of memeory too.
<jcater> win4lin is very specific
<jcater> it's really hard to compare the two
rdean (rdean@chcgil2-ar2-052-050.chcgil2.dsl.gtei.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jcater> but if you only need a win98 session on your linux box 
<jcater> then win4lin is for you
<jcater> if you are doing low-level OS development, then
<jcater> vmware is for you
<jcater> :)
<jcater> I've been following plex86 (which is a free vmware-like system)
<jcater> but it seems dead
<dsmith> There is bochs too
<jcater> Um
<jcater> I gave up on that
<jcater> I never did get a win98 install completed on that  (with an 800Mhz machine)
<jcater> it was too painful to watch
<dsmith> Is it plex86 of box that's in Debian now?
<jcater> yeah, it's in debian
<dsmith> s/of box/or bochs/
<jcater> plex86 is in debian
<jcater> not sure about bochs
<dsmith> Both
<dsmith> bochs - IA-32 (x86) PC emulator
<dsmith> plex86 - PC virtualization program to run x86 operating systems.
<dsmith> Well, I gotta get back to doing my taxes.  Power supply died right in the middle of running taxcut.
<jcater> ok
<jcater> and for chillywilly:
<jcater> the only reason I use Win98 software
<jcater> is for my Desktop Publishing / Marketing stuff

<ajmitch_> no, cos xchat probably is dropping ctcp ping  :)
<chillywilly> yea, probably
<ajmitch_> check your ctcp replies setup
<chillywilly> do you have a ctcp ping setup in your stsp replies or you let it use the default one?
<ajmitch_> i have one setup
<chillywilly> I have one in there
<chillywilly> just not sure it is right
<ajmitch_> what is it?
<chillywilly> nope, i lied
<chillywilly> I don;t habe one
<chillywilly> er, have
<chillywilly> what's yours look like?
<ajmitch_>  /nctcp %s PING %d
<chillywilly> tnx
<chillywilly> try it again
<ajmitch_> 0.911 sec
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> [23:24:11] --- Ping reply from ajmitch_ : 0.91 second(s)
<ajmitch_> ajmitch should be the same :)
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> [23:24:58] --- Ping reply from ajmitch : 0.52 second(s)
<chillywilly> it's faster ;P
<ajmitch_> interesting
<ajmitch_> cos they're both on the same box :)
<chillywilly> heh

<chillywilly> [23:25:49] --- Ping reply from ajmitch : 0.82 second(s)
<ajmitch_> i don't think ssh would slow it down really
<chillywilly> yea
<ajmitch_> since it's about 100ms ping from work to home
<chillywilly> the encrypted tunnel brings the traffic up a bit
<chillywilly> s/encrypted tunnel/encryption/
<ajmitch_> yes i'm using bx
<chillywilly> k
<chillywilly> not that it matters
<chillywilly> I just thought I would return the favor

Action: chillywilly wonders if he can ever catch up
<chillywilly> with the debian upgrade
<chillywilly> more packages now it seems
<ajmitch_> dunno, i've got the latest packages but they're not installed
<ajmitch_> i can now update everything within a day ;)
<ajmitch_> instead of waiting an hour for 10mb to d/l
<chillywilly> form your house?
<chillywilly> er, from
<chillywilly> or from where you are at
<ajmitch_> at home
<jcater> derek: what's this about foobulations being a "lame" report?
<chillywilly> well I think I will just let this thing update overnight if it is large
<ajmitch_> here, i could do 400kB/sec if i was allowed to download :)
<chillywilly> rock
<chillywilly> where are you anyway?
<ajmitch_> same place as usual
<ajmitch_> anyway, gotta go, will be back in ~1 hr :)
<chillywilly> k
<chillywilly> anyone know what ports limewire uses?
<chillywilly> my connection is too lagged to look at their web site :-/
<derek> jcater: ?
<derek> lame?
<derek> btw: i was helping some dude via email get gnue installed

<jcater> derek: the lame comment was in GNUe KC #24
<jcater> "the report is certainly lame but its really living and breathing"
<jcater> you foob-hater, you
<chillywilly> fooberman
<jcater> reports is kickin some arse
<jcater> I tested out the "fax" output and "printer" output today at work
<jcater> works like a champ
<jcater> had already tested "email" and "file" outputs
<dneighbo> hey man im a foob man
<dneighbo> ask my wife

<dneighbo> > Anyone?
<dneighbo> this is because he needs to use the spiff function?
<dneighbo> that doesnt exist for mysql?
<dneighbo> the get next id thing?
<dneighbo> i was going to repsond saying such but wanted to confirm
<jcater> spiff?
<dneighbo> i am thinking we might want to change the 'master/detail' wizard
<dneighbo> to allow this to be auto created (the function) as an option
<jcater> auto-sequences are not a good thing in gnue-land
<jcater> dneighbo: not a bad idea
<dneighbo> well im cross posting to the LUG and gnue
<dneighbo> so you and jamest can comment
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I'm out of Mike's Hard Lemonade
<jcater> guess that means I'll have to stop gnue'n
<chillywilly> you shouldn't drink that stuff anyway
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> why?
<jcater> are you mormon?

<chillywilly> no
<chillywilly> it all deoends I guess on how much of that you drink
<chillywilly> er, depends
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I've heard once you get into multiple gallons within a few hours
<jcater> can be lethargic
<dneighbo> if it makes you work on gnue
<dneighbo> i dont care how much of it you drink
<dneighbo> in fact, please share with chilly
<jcater> does not "make" me work on gnue
<jcater> it makes work on gnue tolerable
<dneighbo> roflmao
<jcater> argh
<jcater> I committed the first code to GNUe Reports on April 11, 2001
<jcater> and it's now April 15, 2002
<chillywilly> weee
<jcater> crap, I should've planned a release on April 10th
<jcater> instead of next week
<chillywilly> that's caroline's birthday
<chillywilly> 4/11
<jcater> that way I couldn't said we released within a year of starting
<dneighbo> hmmm wonder if short year
<jcater> s/couldn't/could've
<dneighbo> maybe could claim w/in 365 days
<dneighbo> jcater: you follow main list
<jcater> main list of what?
<dneighbo> someone sent some compiere stuff to the list (todd)
<jcater> yeah, saw that
<dneighbo> and cc'd sql*ledger
<dneighbo> and sql*ledger guy replie
<jcater> oh, didn't catch that

<dneighbo> i sent a lengthy reply
<dneighbo> btw: praise report
<dneighbo> brandon in playing around got his mouse to work :)
<dneighbo> he got a different mouse (5th one is the charm) and was able to get it to work
<dneighbo> he has xmms working
<dneighbo> cutting his cds to disk via grip and loving linux
Action: dneighbo is so jazzed
<dneighbo> you want to know the FUNNIEST thing
<jcater> cool
<dneighbo> the thing he thought was the coolest about linux
<dneighbo> is that gdm requires you to login
<dneighbo> which means his brother cant login
<jcater> lol
<chillywilly> :)
<dneighbo> when he had windows his brother just hit cancel at the login
<jcater> my brother loves that
<dneighbo> and it logged him in 
<jcater> as his girlfriend can't get in
<chillywilly> who is brandon?
<dneighbo> at first he was kind of amazed
<dneighbo> and kept asking
<dneighbo> so what happens if you forget your password
<dneighbo> etc etc
<dneighbo> i mean a system that actually RESPECTS what you tell it to do
<dneighbo> is a lot to ask
<chillywilly> don't forget it ;).....at least don't forget the root passwd
<dneighbo> chillywilly: one of the kids in my youth group
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> you're corrupting the young now eh?
<dneighbo> i find it odd how God works
<dneighbo> was at a church with several hundred prolly a thousand plus congregration
<dneighbo> with hundred or so youth
<dneighbo> always tried to fit in an never could
Action: ajmitch here
<dneighbo> come to a church with maybe 50 poeple
<dneighbo> started the youth group have like 5 kids
<dneighbo> 3 of which want to be programmers when they grow
<ajmitch> :)
<dneighbo> and want to spend weekends hacking and playing games learning linux
<jcater> dneighbo: you are gonna redirect them to more meaningful careers, right?
<dneighbo> well thats whats funny
<dneighbo> is i told them you have to love this
<jcater> like, janitorial stuff, etc
<dneighbo> its not good for the 'money'
<ajmitch> you got them to hack on GNUe yet?
<dneighbo> they all actually like math
<dneighbo> and like computers
<dneighbo> not typical i like computer games and think i can make money mentality
<ajmitch> excellent
<dneighbo> ex: if we put windows on your box you might not be able to do as much with out some help
<dneighbo> etc
<dneighbo> response: cool means i get to learn something new
<dneighbo> get this, he saw me ask questions here
<dneighbo> and his first question was 
<dneighbo> can you put that thing on
<dneighbo> im like what thing
<dneighbo> that thing where you can ask for help, i think im gonna need that
<dneighbo> that thing == xchat
<ajmitch> :)
<dneighbo> nickr: he thinks you are a demi-God
<dneighbo> as he see Linux as == Debian
<dneighbo> and i told him you have written Debian packages
<dneighbo> this is impressive
Action: ajmitch bows down before nickr
Action: jcater kisses the feet of nickr
<dneighbo> ajmitch he makes ngue packages im likely to kiss his feet
<ajmitch> heh
<jcater> speaking of which, how goes dcl packages?
Action: jcater is wanting to upgrade at work, but is waiting until debs are available
<ajmitch> ask jbailey
<ajmitch> haven't seen him around for a little while
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> "marriage" must be kicking in
<ajmitch> hehe
<jcater> "You are NOT spending another Friday night on the computer"
<dneighbo> um nickr where are pysablot packages? were you willing to be the maintainer?
<dneighbo> as i will contact the pysablot dude if you are
<jcater> dneighbo: I have them mirrored at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/debian/
<dneighbo> killer
<dneighbo> jcater: do you know if nickr has a gnuenterprise.org address?
<jcater> um
<jcater> I'm not sure
<dneighbo> i.e. is there easy way for you to check
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> it appears he does not
<jcater> dunno if he has a gnue.org or not
<jcater> speaking of which, we need a list of what will need to be moved from goats
<dneighbo> dude someone call 911 i think nickr is away from his term, im getting worried ;)
<jcater> in order for us to merge gnue.org and gnuenterprise.org
<jcater> lol
<ajmitch> ok, which of the work orders on dcl can i work on?
<jcater> ajmitch: any of them assigned to "jcater"
<ajmitch> ok
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> jcater sent mail to pysablot maintainer and cc'd you and jamest
<jcater> ok
<ajmitch> hmm, there's only 4 WO's assigned to jcater
<jcater> this will make 3 abandoned python projects we've taken over
<dneighbo> ajmitch: ok ihave one you can work on
<jcater> if the owner respondes
<ajmitch> dneighbo: yeah?
<dneighbo> that 'biz rule' about jcater never have less than 5 WOs seems broken
<dneighbo> can you fix it ;)
<jcater> dneighbo: I looked into PySablot
<dneighbo> if jcater.wo < 5 then jcater.wo.add = all.wo(random())
<jcater> and the author is active
<dneighbo> what do you mean active?
<jcater> he just started a new Python-related project on sourceforge this month
<ajmitch> hmm
<dneighbo> cool
<jcater> he has half-dozen small python projects
<dneighbo> i am not hoping by the way to 'adopt' this
<dneighbo> i would rather him maintain it :)
<jcater> the latest was related to graph theory or such
<jcater> well, yeah... me too :)
<dneighbo> but im pro adopting it if need be
<dneighbo> what other python packages did we adopt?
<jcater> well, not officially
<dneighbo> at one time we were kind of toying with adopting pyncurses
<jcater> but PyPS (no response from author)
<jcater> and ntssi
Action: ajmitch has no clue with forms/reports codebase :)
<dneighbo> what is PyPS?
<dneighbo> ntssi is the curses thing right?
<jcater> postscript output routines
<jcater> yes
<jcater> is there a cvs command to list each file that's has changes pending on my machine
<jcater> not a cvs diff
<jcater> just a list of files
<ajmitch> cvs status?
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> ah
<jcater> coupled with a grep, that'll work
<jcater> thanks
<jcater> well, the Tylenol PM is kicking in

<dneighbo> what is 'upstream'
<ajmitch> the people who write it
<nickr> and maintain it
<chillywilly> the people that hack on it
<ajmitch> as opposed to 'mere' packagers :)
<dneighbo> license is GPL and copyright is the fellow who wrote it
<dneighbo> ok
<nickr> and who I can blame for bugs
<dneighbo> nickr: i didnt have your email and ihtink i caught you sleeping :)
<dneighbo> basically i sent an email to the developer
<nickr> No, I was chatting up some SI chix
<dneighbo> asking him if he was going to continue its development
<nickr> okay
<dneighbo> and if not would he turn it over to GNUe
<nickr> good
<dneighbo> hopefully i will get an answer withni a few days which will answer your 'upstream' question :)
<nickr> you can claim its GPL and copyright by him, but theres no indication of that in the source package
<dneighbo> i can probably whip together a license and copyright file for him and upload to him a new tar ball
<dneighbo> for release including at least a README ;)
<ajmitch> heh
<dneighbo> and maybe even a simple doc :)

<dneighbo> ajmitch: i will be your 'neighbor' ;)
<nickr> dneighbo: this evil project I've been doing
<nickr> I'm so tired of it
<nickr> I just can't bring myself to do the simplest things on it

<ajmitch> nickr: i understand totally, i've got the same prob
<nickr> Its stupid!
<nickr> Just 20 links!
<nickr> Put em on the page!
<chillywilly> do it then
<nickr> I can't do it. :P
<chillywilly> and stop whining about it already
<ajmitch> chillywilly: be quiet
<chillywilly> hehe ;)
<ajmitch> don't hassle our debian packager
<ajmitch> cos if he doesn't do pkgs, someone else would have to :)
<chillywilly> bah, he knows I love him
<chillywilly> and this is why I can tell him to stop whining
Action: ajmitch wonders why he hasn't seen any commits since he subscribe to the commit list
<nickr> hehe

<nickr> its annoying.

<dneighbo> i hope to get that cleaned up

<dneighbo> we figured start small
<dneighbo> file to file

<dneighbo> jcater has it working
<dneighbo> so you can generate report and have it save to file
<dneighbo> print to printer

<btami> hi all
<dneighbo> hello
<btami> derek:hello
<btami> do you know is jamest using DCL?
<nickr> chooowda
<dneighbo> um jamest personally ?
<dneighbo> is not (That i am aware)
<btami> i'v sended some little bugfix on forms, dut no response
<dneighbo> jcater and i both have dcl instances for our work environments
<dneighbo> oh
<dneighbo> yes he is a USER of dcl :)
<btami> :9
<btami> :)
Action: dneighbo misunderstood the question
<dneighbo> you will not get a response (if you submitted as guest)
<dneighbo> if you submitted as a logged in user (i dont remember if you have account)
<dneighbo> then you will get email every time he updates or works on the items
<btami> i have
<dneighbo> if you have not received anything it is probbaly he hasnt worked on the items
<dneighbo> OR
<dneighbo> he worked them but did not register timecards against them
<btami> i think he doesn't read DCL :(
<jcater> how long ago did you submit it?
<jcater> as he's been preoccupied
<btami> 10.04
<jcater> April 10?
<jcater> that was only 5 days ago
<btami> sorry :)
<dneighbo> btami im only showing one open 'work order' submitted by you btami 
<dneighbo> and it is assigned to jcater not jamest :)
<btami> this is a timecard for jamest
<btami> timecard=ticket
<btami> sended via email
<dneighbo> hmmm im showing nothing under your account
<dneighbo> but that makes sense
<dneighbo> as if done by email gateway it wont be as you
Action: dneighbo notes thats somethign iw ant to add to gateway
<btami> i can see it in DCL : tickets browse
<dneighbo> yip ticket 19
<btami> yesss
<dneighbo> i mean i cant search by 'opened by btami'
<dneighbo> jcater do you have time today or tonight
<dneighbo> it looks like this is a patch that just needs test and apply
<mdean> that could be done, as long as the From: field matches the email in the personnel table
<dneighbo> if so i will reassign it to you
<dneighbo> mdean : right thats what im thinking
<dneighbo> but it doesnt work that way today right?
<mdean> nope, but it wouldn't be hard to implement, either
<jcater> I don't see a patch
<dneighbo> its in the description (i thought)
<jcater> oh
<jcater> the initFont
<jcater> um
<jcater> btami: what is that initFont doing?
<jcater> setting it to a helvetica type font?
<jcater> that looks like what it's doing
<jcater> if so, have you tried setting fixedWidthFont = 0 in your gnue.conf file?
<jcater> I think this may accomplish the same thing as your patch
<btami> no no no
<btami> MODERN is not working on non US win2k
<btami> but DEFAULT is ok
<dneighbo> mdean : i created a wo for it and will assign to you :)
<dneighbo> btw: you have an issue if we maybe shut down the bug stuff on sourceforge for dcl
<dneighbo> and route to the gnue version of dcl
<dneighbo> or if some more work needs to be done before that can happen thats cool too
<dneighbo> but want to start showcasing the beauty of dcl :)
<mdean> will have to go through it, but would be better to eat own dog food, I guess
<dneighbo> mdean : there are many 'issues' using it for software project (bugs features)
<dneighbo> but despite those its still rather usable
<dneighbo> and with MINIMAL work i think we could overcome the issues
<jcater> btami: that's what happens
<jcater> wxMODERN is a fixed-width font
<jcater> wxDEFAULT is a helvetica font by default
<jcater> have you tried setting fixedWidthFont=0 in gnue.conf
<jcater> and see if the characters are displayed correctly
<btami> yes
<btami> but form is collapsed
<btami> so it was unusable
<jcater> collapsed?
<btami> was not readable
<jcater> is there any chance you could do screen shots
<jcater> 1) with your patch
<jcater> 2) without your patch
<jcater> 3) without your patch w/fixedWidthFont = 0
<jcater> as the patch collapses our forms into a non-fixed width format
<jcater> so we may need to find another solution
<btami> yes, tomorrow
<jcater> cool
<jcater> that would be most helpful
<btami> ok
<btami> but there is another issue
<btami> keyboardEvtHandler
<btami> have you read that?
<btami> in ticket 19 too
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> that is a known issue
<jcater> with an unknown solution :(
<jcater> we're not sure how to handle that at the moment
<btami> there is a solution too
<jcater> which is why we have that simple hack
<jcater> what?
<btami> please read ticket #19 :)
<jcater> oh
<jcater> I misread that
<btami> :)
<jcater> I thought the code was problem code
<jcater> not the actual solution
<jcater> I will at that to CVS right now
<btami> ok
<btami> thanks

<btami> jcater:can you tell me something your vision 
<btami> on report designer
<btami> i cant imagine how it will work without x,y positioning
<btami> i'v used only fixed pos designers before
<jcater> I've used both
<jcater> and in my experience, the fixed positions are a quick way to generate reports
<jcater> but once you need more than they offer
<jcater> you are kind of stuck
<jcater> btami: I'm looking in UIdriver.keyboardEvtHandler._processEvent
<jcater> and can't quite figure out where the elif goes
<jcater> is it supposed to go here:
<jcater>         if char in string.printable or char == "\n":
<jcater>           action = GFEvent('requestKEYPRESS', char,
<jcater>                          text=char,
<jcater>                          code=event.KeyCode())
<btami> yes
<psu> i have been anti-fixed positioning since before i used a report tool ;-0
<psu> you have exactly the same problem with simple spreadsheet solutions
<nickr> at some point you have to say 'this goes here'
<nickr> but up till that point, imho, you should say 'this is that'
<psu> fundamentally, y-axis absolute pos breaks as soon as you get an extra row of data
<jcater> btami: your patch is in cvs
<psu> so nickr's 'this is that' can only occour
<psu> once you have the data
<btami> jcater:thans
<psu> Really, in this web-based age
<btami> thanks
<psu> the idea of seperating formatting from semantics should be no big deal ;-)
<nickr> er
<nickr> thats what I was advocating. Logical markup over physical.
<jcater> there are instances where physical markup is a necessity
<jcater> i.e., pre-printed forms
<jcater> and i plan to allow for those
<nickr> True. But the data is still logically tagged until you get to the point of the 'form' level
<jcater> but for general reporting, I favor logical over physical
Action: mdean DCCs jcater some donuts...
<jcater> mmmm
<jcater> donuts
<btami> jcater: in the same designer?
<jcater> btami: those would probably be different designer wizards
<jcater> we haven't actually done the designer part yet
<btami> i know :)
<jcater> but I'd imagine you'd pick from a few choices of "types" of reports
<psu> KC #24 announcement gone to gnue-announce & website

<dneighbo> rdean strange miracle but today mdean was resurrected
<chillywilly> ello dneighbo
<chillywilly> rdean
<dneighbo> hi
<dneighbo> i seem to be short $1,484,854 think anyone will notice?
<chillywilly> uh, probably ;)
<chillywilly> dude, I have come to the conclusion that our service manager is a jag off
<chillywilly> and should be troutslapped immediately
<chillywilly> do not pass 'go'
<chillywilly> do not collect $100
<ajmitch> hello
<rdean> dneighbo: mdean resurrected...really?
<rdean> quite the coincidence, because I'm starting to delve into PHP programming (actually, evaluating delving into PHP vs. perl, which I already know)...installed DCL for guidance
<rdean> python's not installed at my ISP, unfortunately
<chillywilly> bastards
<dneighbo> um for web stuff i think you will be better off with php over perl (imho)
<chillywilly> psp man
<chillywilly> ;)
<ajmitch> isn't that some drug?
<chillywilly> that's pcp
<dneighbo> ajmitch a goofy sentence
<ajmitch> ah
<ajmitch> forgive my ignorance of certain substances
<dneighbo> man we have some really good psp pages to perform acid tests our mysql server using ltsp.
<dneighbo> where psp sounds like pcp
<dneighbo> acid like acid
<dneighbo> and ltsp like lsd
<rdean> what I'm seeing is that it depends on whether mod_perl is installed, and it rarely is on an ISP
<dneighbo> some poor sixities hippie might read that sentence and ask, why am in not in teh comuter business :)
<chillywilly> bidness yo

<chillywilly> dict tells me it's a wooden shoe
<chillywilly> or a wooden disk thingy in a cannon
<nickr> its IS a wooden shoe

<nickr> the term sabotage comes frow when the peasents threw their sabot into the factory machines

<drochaid> ajmitch: can I ask a generic DNS setup question?
<ajmitch> perhaps
<drochaid> well, actually I can ... whether or not you answer is probably more relevant ;)
<ajmitch> exactly :)
<drochaid> on the machine that is going to BE the DNS server ...
<drochaid> during OS install ... what do I set as the DNS server entry?
<ajmitch> 127.0.0.1, perhaps?
<ajmitch> i dunno
<drochaid> I have been using that of my firewall DNS ... but then it picks up nothing of the later config
<drochaid> hmm ... I'll maybe try that
<drochaid> all the other machines are good
<drochaid> just the dns server machine itself that can't use the dns entries %-)
<ajmitch> hehe
<drochaid> silly question time.... what file does deb hide the current dns server pointer in?
Action: drochaid hides in shame
<drochaid> for some reason I decided to look in /etc/gateways :)
<nickr>  /etc/resolv.conf
<drochaid> ta nickr
<nickr> its useful to keep that in mind, as almost all unixes afaik use that file
<nickr> maybe not
<nickr> but many
<drochaid> I think all the distros I've used where I edited it manually used that one
<drochaid> I'm so ashamed I forgot :)
<drochaid> too much MDK config apps recently methinks
<drochaid> and yes ajmitch, setting it to 127.0.0.1 worked a treat :)
