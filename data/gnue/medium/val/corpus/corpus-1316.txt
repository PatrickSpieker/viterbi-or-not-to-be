<return_this> the reason I want to utilize mozilla is purely selfish...
<return_this> I have invested a lot of time playing with xul and xpcom ... and I would like to utilize that as much as possible
<return_this> since I just stumbled onto gnue yesterday... I figured it would be a great application to play with xul/xpcom

<derek> if i had a bigger house i think i would offer someone free room and board in a bedroom in exchange for 40 hours of gnue a week
<jcater> I do 40 hrs of gnue a week
<nickr> thats a lot
<jcater> but I don't get free room / board
<nickr> how about 36?
<return_this> derek: I might bite on a deal like that :)
Action: ajmitch does 0/40 hrs of gnue a week
<derek> well i figure it would be a hacker who was a hermit
Action: ajmitch knows some of them :)
<derek> i.e. if food and room was covered
<derek> a part time grocery bagging job at 10 hours a week would cover what little social life they might have
<derek> if they played it right a small consulting job a month would cover new computer toys and such
<nickr> I'm a hermit
<derek> as i would gladly share bandwidth
<nickr> hrm

<derek> i would do it, but i dont think the wife would approve

<jcater> wow
Action: jcater didn't know new zealand had 2 extra hours in a week
<nickr> and then - 10% for miscelaneous urination and such
<derek> 168 - 21 is 147 by my count :)
<derek> and i certain now you arent spending 47 hours out of the house a week ;)
<psu> derek: all that working with accountants has rubbed off on you, I see
<ajmitch> hi psu
<nickr> I do too sleep 8 hours a day :P
<derek> psu: not quite, if that were the case i would ask for last year worth of his webcam files for auditing purposes
<derek> or actually since i work for OMB
<derek> you have 168 hours
<derek> we will budget 6 hours a day (42) for sleep
<derek> leaving us 122, budget 2 hours a day for eating, personal hygiene (14)
<derek> leaving us 108 so we budget 100 for computer time 
<derek> leaving us 2 for contigency
<derek> and from nickr is saying
<jcater> 2 hrs/day for eating and hygiene??????
<derek> our 'actuals to budget' seems to be within acceptable variance
<jcater> you must be a few degrees out of the hacker culture :)
<ajmitch> you only need a shower about every week or so
<nickr> I spend 2 hours every other day for hygiene but eat in front of the computer
<derek> jcater: he didnt want me to mention that 'backup' he has been experiencing

<derek> i figure we put him on 802.11b and we are likely to recoup at least 10 hours a week
<derek> nearly a 10% increase
<derek> oh if i boarded someone i think i woudl give them my laptop and 802.11b
<derek> and let them sit poolside and watch the kids so i can take wife out :)
<nickr> Thats a good idea actually
<ajmitch> hehe
<nickr> efficient use of resources

<reinhard> lol
<jcater> as hours go up, the latter approached 0
<jcater> s/ed/es
<nickr> you could do a 3d plot vs. sleep
<jcater> sleep? or sleeping alone?
<reinhard> actually free software projects sometimes like to get new names for old things
<reinhard> like gnome uses "druid" instead of "wizard"
<nickr> sleep in general
<reinhard> so for charting we should rename the "pie chart" to "donut chart"
<reinhard> :)
<jcater> roflmao
<nickr> so you correlate increasing sleep with increasing intercourse to a point, wheruppon they are inverse
<nickr> donut chart.
<nickr> hah
<nickr> it'd be more accurate to call it a pizza graph

<deem0N> hi all
<deem0N> could anybody tell if subforms (master/detail) are working in Forms under windows ?
<ajmitch> not sure, sorry, i don't follow forms that closely
<deem0N> also I red that HTML driver is under way (2 projects active), but where are they in CVS tree ?
<ajmitch> don't know, sorry
<reinhard> deem0N: AFAIK
<reinhard> master/detail is working
<reinhard> on all platforms
<reinhard> and there is no "html" driver
<deem0N> any downloadable example ?
<reinhard> there was a java implementation of forms
<reinhard> but that development has stopped long ago due to lack of time
<reinhard> i'm not sure about an example
<reinhard> i think the samples dir of forms should contain one
<ajmitch> there was work done on a UIwebware driver, dunno what happened to it
<deem0N> I was unable to connect to MySQL server from Windows box 
<deem0N> only Post=gres
<reinhard> deem0N: most developers use postgres
<reinhard> so it _might_ be that mysql support is temporarly broken
<reinhard> however they will be happy if you report your problems
<reinhard> because most developers can't even _test_ mysql
<reinhard> forms developers are from the u.s. mainly
<reinhard> their irc names are jcater and jamest
<reinhard> so you might want to return here in about 6 hours
<reinhard> or you might want to write a mail to gnue-dev@gnu.org
<deem0N> basically I liked Forms XML lang, as I need something to base my development on.
<reinhard> sorry that i can't help you more here
<reinhard> cool
<deem0N> I gonna have HTML Forms implementation done for my company need
<deem0N> but I am not sure if it will be 100% implementation of all features
<deem0N> also question is support on Web server side - Java funs gonna be upset, as I like Perl :-)
<reinhard> no java fans are allowed in this channel anyway
<deem0N> for now Im installing gnue on FreeBSD to test it well
<reinhard> :)
<deem0N> thanks to all who respond
<deem0N> also for now I have a bit messed my brain with HTML,JavaScript,XUL,SOAP
<deem0N> it is hard to choose right tool for Web implementation of Forms :-)
<derek> deem0N: i believe the php implementation is in cvs
<derek> or is in process of getting there
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue/phpforms$ ls
<derek> CVS  connection.php  gnue-forms.php
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue/phpforms$ 
<deem0N> For me it is very important to put maximum logic on the browser - i.e. to code Forms in JavaScript and reduce HTTP traffic
<deem0N> will check php if they do some JS as well

<deem0N> anyone ! My form does not do preselect from a Postgres table. I.e. I have 4 rows in a DB, but form shows 0 rows. I can add new rows though. How to do preselect ?

<ra3vat> deem0N: are you able to fill the form some other way like manually "start query", "execute query"?
<ra3vat> via menu command
<ra3vat> hi C00ler
<deem0N> Execute query helps
<deem0N> any idea how to run in it automatically on form open ?
<ra3vat> it better ask jamest or jcater couple hours later, I think it's possible but can't help myself
<ra3vat> many things could be done via triggers

<btami> try to use cvs version of designer
<C00ler> Ok thanks for hint
<btami> that will make encoding=xxx in gfd header
<deem0N> will new designer be available at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/snapshots/win32/ ?
<deem0N> or do we need python under windows to setup it from CVS ?
<btami> i don't know the date of the next release, sorry:)
<btami> if you use cvs, you need python
<deem0N> ok
<deem0N> btami: do you know anything about HTML/JavaScript implementation of Forms ?
<ra3vat> deem0N: have you seen http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython-2.3.3pre2u-Py22-hybrid
<btami> there is something PHP in cvs, but thats all i know:)
<ra3vat> it's new unicode version  
<ra3vat> pre2u
<btami> ra3vat: please take a look at dcl (last ticket)
<deem0N> hmm, may be it will help, but for now I need to see how Master/Deatils works
<ra3vat> btami: i got it into my maibox :)
<btami> :9
<btami> :)
<btami> ra3vat: what do you think about i18n and unicode in GNUe ?
<btami> win9x doesn't support unicode 
<btami> and GNUe wants to support win9x too
<btami> i think
<btami> but with last bugfix i'v sended, my texts in forms are all correct now
<btami> labels, gnue.conf msgs, input, all ok
<ra3vat> btami: and input into entry box also?
<btami> yes
<btami> i found your old fix in 0.1.1 forms, and it helps
<btami> found=find
<ra3vat> ok
<ra3vat> i think we will not switch to unicode in one day
<ra3vat> i'm not ready to do my forms in utf8 right now
<btami> agree
<ra3vat> btami: can you answer my last email on 2 steps?
dsmith (~dsmith@cherry7.comerica.com) joined #gnuenterprise.

<ra3vat> ah
<ra3vat> thanks

<C00ler> btami can You explain how can i use 'prequery' in datasource tag ?
<btami> prequery=""
<C00ler> when my form start i need to done to actions to fetch data from database
<C00ler> this is 'enter query' and 'execute query' (by pressing F8, F9)
<btami> and cache="5" or something, i think:)
<C00ler> Is it possible to done this automaticity ?
<btami> minute, i'm trying too
<C00ler> sure 
Action: dsmith is back (gone 00:25:56)

<C00ler> nice
<btami> doesn'n worked for me

<C00ler> in examples
<btami> oh
<C00ler> <datasource table="unit_description" name="available_units" database="devel"
<C00ler> prequery=""/>
<C00ler> I see that prequery is empty everywhere
<C00ler> So i'm trying to guess what is it for :)
<deem0N> yep, docs looks like stelth technology was applied :-)

<jamest_> what parts of gnue common should get documented first to be of the most use to the GEAS conversion?
<dneighbo> db access
<dneighbo> trigger calls
<dneighbo> rpc abstraction
<dneighbo> not necessarily in that order
<nickr> la.
<reinhard> jamest_: db access
<reinhard> that's the most important imho
<dneighbo> i think rpc has to be pretty high up there too
<dneighbo> db allows geas to look at harvesting data
<dneighbo> but without rpc no one can use it :)
<jcater> dneighbo: not entirely sure I agree
Action: jcater is back (gone 01:07:14)
<jcater> I agree w/reinhard that db is at top
<jcater> but we could consider doing the same thing I'm doing w/reports
<jcater> i.e., I'm getting the engine working
<jcater> and a command line version of it running
<jcater> so ppl can develop reports and see what it's gonna be like
<jcater> w/o actually running in a client/server setup
<jcater> if that makes sense
<jcater> of course, the goal is to get a reports server
<jcater> and report clients
<jcater> but it's still usable this early on :)
<jcater> I'm thinking the same thing could happen w/GEAS and Forms
<jcater> that would allow ppl to start using the abstraction-qualities of geas
<jcater> even before we get a solid/stable server/rpc setup
<jcater> iow, start developing apps sooner
<jcater> but that's just my $0.02

<dneighbo> unlike reports geas is not usefull w/o client/server other than testing
<dneighbo> imho
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> i do think db access is top on the list
<jcater> my point was to get app development started asap
<jamest_> just to confuse you all :) I'm starting with GClientApp and GServerApp
<dneighbo> im just saying that to be useful the other things will need to follow
<jcater> and whether ppl would like to admit it or not, this would still be usable :)
<jcater> but that wasn't my point
<jcater> my point was to get app development started asap
<jamest_> so you can see simple sample before I dive into db access
<jamest_> in either case
<jamest_> its possible to figure out common by using it
<jamest_> so the docs aren't stopping anything from being developed
<jamest_> :)
<reinhard> jcater: i tend to agree with you
<dneighbo> sigh
Action: dneighbo hates when the point is totally missed, irc communication sucks
<reinhard> jamest_: the most difficult point in figuring out common by using at the code
<reinhard> um
<reinhard> looking at the code and using it
<reinhard> is
<reinhard> that python doesn't do "encapsulation"
<reinhard> i.e. it isn't defined which routines are considered "public"
<reinhard> and which ones "private"
<jcater> reinhard: he's taken off work today to actually start documenting common
<jcater> so I don't think he was saying "I won't document it" :)
<jamest_> oh I'll document things alright.
<jamest_> Chapter 1: usinging GClientApp
<jamest_> 1.1 Intro
<reinhard> jcater: i didn't understand it that way
<jamest_> Use this class to build your apps from.   See GClientApp.py for details.
<jamest_> Chapter 2......
<jamest_> :)
<reinhard> :)
<jcater> reinhard: ok :)
<jamest_> I'm documenting
<jamest_> I'm just asking what's holding people back for utilizing common
<reinhard> just for the record
<jamest_> i'm starting w/ GClientApp as it's simple
<jamest_> then I'll do DB as it's a bitch
<reinhard> it's _not_ the lack of documentation that keeps me from writing geas :(
<jamest_> then i'll probably need some heavy drugs to recover from actually understanding the db code
<jamest_> then maybe I'll get to rpc
<jamest_> since rpc is very much a work in progress it'll be a bitch to document
<jamest_> hmmm
<jamest_> our base app class includes a --conections command line arg

<jamest_> that's ok
<jamest_> the first is for 3.x xfree
<reinhard> thanks
<jamest_> the latter is 4.x xfree
<jamest_> you have it working now?
<reinhard> so this is probably because i updated from potato to woody?
<reinhard> not yet
<reinhard> dpgk-reconf asks so many questions...

<reinhard> oops

<jamest_> you have video working?
<reinhard> ok now
<reinhard> X starts

<reinhard> and the keyboard is dead too
<jamest_> you didn't disconnect mouse/keyboard did you?
<jamest_> what am I saying
<jamest_> sigh
<jamest_> what kind of mouse you have?
<reinhard> huh?
<jamest_> what brand?
<reinhard> compaq
<reinhard> was packed with the computer
<jamest_> with a scrollwheel?
<reinhard> no
<reinhard> rather old one i think
<jamest_> ps/2?
<reinhard> yes

<jamest_> ctrl-alt-backspace if nothing else works
<jamest_> then 
<reinhard> just a sec
<reinhard> not even ctrl-alt-backspace did work
<reinhard> machine is rebooting and doing fsck
<jamest_> sigh
<jamest_> ok
<jamest_> btw - the new docs are being held up do to docbook issues
Action: jamest_ hugs docbook
<reinhard> lol
Action: jamest_ uses his fingers to hug it
Action: jamest_ hugs very, very tightly
<reinhard> ok i am logged in as root
<jamest_> vi /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
<jamest_> then
<jamest_>  /Mouse
<reinhard> i have a "Generic Mouse" and a "Configured Mouse"
<jamest_> on Configured 
<jamest_> you have device set to /dev/psaux?
<jamest_> and protocol set to ?
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> protocol = "PS/2"
<jamest_> try 
<jamest_> ImPS/2
<jamest_> or
<jamest_> Auto
<jamest_> i think the first may work better
<reinhard> ok
<jamest_> other option I've had luck with is Microsoft on older mice
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> the not so nice thing is that the machine is completely dead when X starts
<reinhard> so i have to reset it every time :(
<jamest_> ouch
<reinhard> in "ServerLayout"
<reinhard> bout "Configured Mouse" and "Generic Mouse" are mentioned
<reinhard> s/bout/both/
<reinhard> is that correct?
<jamest_> yeah
<jamest_> it tries one then the other
<reinhard> ah
<jamest_> if you had keyboard support you could run startx from the console
<reinhard> i'm 100% positive i broke something on accident
<jamest_> ctrl-alt-f1 back to the console
<jamest_> then see what mouse it's actually using
<reinhard> how would i see that?
<reinhard> i have other system from where i can telnet
<jamest_> that's on the console when you startx
<reinhard> oh ah
<jamest_> if you're not using xdm like setup
<reinhard> half an hour ago the mouse didn't work either
<reinhard> but at least it didn't hang
<reinhard> and i could use the keyboard
<reinhard> i guess i must have broken something w/ my first reconfigure
Annik (trilluser@D576875B.kabel.telenet.be) left #gnuenterprise.
<jamest_> then I'd rerun dpkg-reconfigure
<jamest_> i let it manage my x setup
<reinhard> i did that 3 times
<jamest_> but I don't let it put the defaults in
<jamest_> (the last 2 questions IIRC)
<reinhard> and answered every question to my best knowledge
<reinhard> (where my knowledge is not very much anyway)
<jamest_> did you rerun it?
<reinhard> just a sec
<reinhard> i have to wait for the fsck each time
<nickr> c-a-backspace doesn't work?
<reinhard> i think in 2 minutes i will present you the solution

<jamest_> you have to have mx library
<reinhard> ok

<reinhard> do i have to get source?

<reinhard> yeah
<reinhard> my first commit for the python part ;-)
<jamest_> I'm adding the start of the common-techref
<jamest_> so you guys can look and give feedback

<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> what's the debian package name for wxPython?
<jamest_> libwxgtk2.2-python
<jamest_> ok
<jamest_> in common/doc there is a common-techref.lyx file
<reinhard> jamest_: thanks
<jamest_> it won't print worth a damn because something in the newest docbook stuff messed up
Action: reinhard found out the "dpkg -l" command meanwhile :)
<jamest_> but chapter 2 is what I'm thinking about doing 
<jamest_> with maybe an apendix toward the end showing everthing for each class....maybe
<jamest_> if I can get feedback on this I'd appreciate it
<jamest_> btw - i'm not a writer
<jamest_> and I don't take offense at people saying this sucks you need to do something like <foo>
<jcater> jamest_: this sucks... you need to do something like <foo>
<drochaid> jamest_: it sucks ... should I look at whatever doc you're talking about now? ;)
<drochaid> damn .. beaten by jcater
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> jamest_: not sure if i may dare to ask you this
<reinhard> could you save as text somewhere on ash
<reinhard> i don't have lyx installed
<reinhard> and have had enough fight w/ installing stuff today ;)
<reinhard> not to even mention docbook :)
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> got gfcvs to run
<jamest_> reinhard you have decent net connection?
<jamest_> apt-get install lyx
<jamest_> and you're done
<jamest_> :)
<reinhard> ok let me try
<reinhard> Sorry, but the following packages have unmet dependencies:
<reinhard>   lyx: Depends: libforms0.89 but it is not installable
<reinhard> E: Sorry, broken packages
<jamest_> ooooo
<jamest_> you don't run non-free then do you?
<reinhard> not sure
<reinhard> probably not
<jamest_> if you're not against it
<jamest_> then just add non-free in your apt-sources lines
<jamest_> example from mine
<jamest_> deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ woody main contrib non-free
<jamest_> reinhard: something else you might want to do
<jamest_> apt-get install netselect
<jamest_> then
<dneighbo> btw: pyxml shouldnt be necessary anymore
<jamest_> netselect-apt woody
<jamest_> which will make a sample sources.list file for you based upon best performing debian mirrors in your area
<jamest_> is there a wysiwyg editor for docbook yet?
<jamest_> or some doc system that doesn't seem to enjoy licking the bag
<reinhard> texin..
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> didn't want to say
<reinhard> that
<jamest_> lol
<jamest_> i want something where I don't have to program my docs anymore
chillywilly (~danielb@d186.as6.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest_> lyx is fine but my using the docbook document class is kicking my ass as docbook is as stable as derek at an M$ Developers conference
<dneighbo> um
<reinhard> lol
<dneighbo> lyx is just wrong
<dneighbo> i would go texinfo if you cant get docbook to work
<jamest_> and docbook is just shit
<jamest_> :)
<reinhard> huh
Action: reinhard wonders if this is the real dneighbo
<reinhard> ;)
<dneighbo> reinhard i never have had issue with texinfo
<jamest_> docbook tools will not work on solaris after hours of trying
<dneighbo> i offerred to use it over docbook in the very beginning
<jamest_> recent changes in docbook somethings broke the packages docs on ash
<dneighbo> the number one reason i dont like lyx
<dneighbo> is its gui only
<jamest_> and have rendered all my lyx docs based upon docbook useless
<dneighbo> unless of course you are a badass with tex
<dneighbo> there are the issues of non free and using xforms etc but my big gripe is gui only :)
Action: jamest_ is about to use openoffice 
<jamest_> just gots to buy that 512MB of RAM and I'm there
<dneighbo> jamest_ at one time i considered that :)
<dneighbo> its just too hefty a requirement
<dneighbo> im honestly leaning towards going back to texinfo
<dneighbo> it would make fsf very pleased
<dneighbo> and honestly i think it better probably than lyx
<jamest_> i just want wyswyg
<jamest_> that's all 
<dneighbo> and docbook has gotten wierd of late
<jamest_> i don't care what it is as long as I don't have to code it
<dneighbo> i.e. they are changing the style sheets WAY toomuch
<jamest_> i've got more than enough on my plate as it is
<dneighbo> jamest_ honestly i fight like hell to use lyx
<dneighbo> it maybe wysiwyg
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> its like m$ frontpage
<dneighbo> it dont do what the hell you tell it to do
<nickr> the problem is frontpage suckers you into thinking you can make html do exactly what you tell
<dneighbo> one day i spent an hour trying to split bullet list in half w/ new headings
<nickr> it
<nickr> LaTeX is similar
<dneighbo> nickr that is what lyx is
<jamest_> lyx does what I tell it
<nickr> I'm saying its the output formta not the editor
<dneighbo> it tries to SUCKER you into think you can make LaTeX do what you tell it :)
<jamest_> it's docbook support is just broken now
<dneighbo> as long as you are writing docs i wont complain what you do them in :)
<nickr> Lyx does a pretty good job in my experience. Its as WYSIWYG is as you can get wy LaTeX
<jamest_> honestly
<jamest_> i dont' care
Action: jamest_ is just venting at docbook at the moment as all my docs are now broken
<jamest_> i'm about 1/2 tempted to switch the document class to something else in lyx and move on
<jamest_> but i know people wanted docbook (i did original docs in texinfo)
<jamest_> so now I'm asking for a docbook wysiwyg editor
<reinhard> lyx tells me that the document uses the unknown class "docbook-"
<reinhard> something
<jamest_> sigh
<reinhard> but the window ends there in the middle of the word
<jamest_> apt-get install sgmltools-lite docbook-xml
<jamest_> and welcome to hell :)
<chillywilly> hi
<reinhard> actually it's not funny
<reinhard> but at least it's amusing that there are less dependencies to run gnuef than to read it's docs :)
<jamest_> i can convert to text but it's a far from complete document w/ lots of cruft in it
<jamest_> i basically took the forms techref and started hacking
<chillywilly> hmmm, docbook is working here
<chillywilly> but I think I am lucky
<chillywilly> and I agree with dneighbo the style sheet changes lick balls yo

<dneighbo> nickr oddly most of your playlist seems palatable
<dneighbo> of stuff i like but dont have
<drochaid> dneighbo: what sorta stuff?
<dneighbo> i was suprised to see some 80s stuff on there 
<nickr> Heh
<nickr> Yea
<dneighbo> well today the one that caught my eye was mexican radio
<dneighbo> i think yesterday was rock me amadeus
<nickr> been hitting the Low-Fidelity Allstars pretty heavily lately
<nickr> yea
<nickr> I like falco :)
<dneighbo> generally what is interesting to me is that his playlist is 50/50
<dneighbo> 50 stuff i like
<dneighbo> 50 stuff i havent heard of
jcater (~jason@HubA-mcr-24-165-193-24.midsouth.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> which means there is probably a lot of 'new' stuff i would like that i just havent heard
<nickr> heh
<dneighbo> if it were 50 i like 50 i dont like etc it would be different story :)
<nickr> most of it is stuff I've never heard of but isn't new
<nickr> just been listening to a lot of random stuff lately
<dneighbo> nickr right
<nickr> I was rather pleased to discover LFA though
<dneighbo> i like to 'expirement' with music
<dneighbo> cool webpage script for playlist
<nickr> thanks 
<nickr> its interesting how it all works
<nickr> the webpage just renders the data

<drochaid> nickr: did you write the playlists web pages yourself, or use something like brunhilde?
<nickr> I wrote it myself
<dneighbo> wow suprised

<dneighbo> so unlike nickr to have such basic html (tsk, tsk)
<nickr> drochaid: http://nick.industrialmeats.com/proj/fun-online/playlist.php
<nickr> oh
<nickr> ah
<nickr> yea
<nickr> Heh
<nickr> well its functional, I don't really see how it could be nicer
<dneighbo> i say clean it up make it use .css that is esy to 'skin'
<nickr> Actually I do
<dneighbo> and make a deb for it
<nickr> Heh
<dneighbo> seconds should be formatted to minutes
<nickr> like I said, the way the data gets there is a little weird actually
chillywilly (~danielb@169.207.132.166) joined #gnuenterprise.
<nickr> I have a thing in xmms, the songchange plugin, which runs a script
<dneighbo> the volume xx/xx
<dneighbo> should be a status bar visual
<nickr> each time the song changes, it prepends the songname to the list
<nickr> and chops the list to the rigcht length
<nickr> i then hawe a wholly separate script that runs from cron
<nickr> and it gets the data from the XMMS infopipe plugin
<dneighbo> that does the time
<nickr> fro the 'live' info
<dneighbo> etc
<dneighbo> well its pretty cool
<nickr> Okay
<dneighbo> put it in debian so i get off my butt and set it up 
<nickr> both of these scripts write to a directory that I rsync every minute to my website
<nickr> this also takes care of my webcam and other things that are 'live'
<drochaid> cool playlist nickr ... I like the quote at the bottom :)
<nickr> :)

<chillywilly> why is it that the people that  no me rarely say hi?

<chillywilly> Liberty Enterprise Technologies: Bringing business into the digital age
<chillywilly> is this a GNUe approved slogan that I may use without people getting their panties into a bunch?
<nickr> I liked your old slogan
<chillywilly> yea, but people complained
<nickr> "BUY MY SOFTWEH!"
<chillywilly> they made me renig on it
<drochaid> lol
<chillywilly> they claimed it property of GNUe
<chillywilly> so I am being the nice guy and trying to find something else
<chillywilly> nickr: that was never my slogan it was more like "Buy My Software Bitch!"
<chillywilly> as that's more my style
<drochaid> chillywilly: you could always borrow my slogan ... "Scotlands most inovative consultancy" ... but you may need to alter it a bit :)
<nickr> I prefer the 'EAT IT BITCH!' slogan
<chillywilly> eh...
<drochaid> nickr: surely "SUCK IT BITCH!" ?
<drochaid> eat sounds a little ... final
<chillywilly> "buy my services or be damned to the eternal fires of hell"
<nickr> I don't think it refers to quite the same thing
<drochaid> ah
<chillywilly> that should be an eye opener
<chillywilly> what do yall think?
<chillywilly> btw, I am changing up my logo once again
<nickr> thank you

<drochaid> for the most common so far, fingerprint scanners, I only know of Identix and Precise Biometrics

<nickr> quite elite yes
<dtm> maybe not MUCH faster
<dtm> nickr: espeically in the upper levels
<nickr> I thought the world record was like 3 something minutes
<dtm> they're firing before seeing the targets
<dtm> nickr: i can hardly bear the thought
<nickr> I imagine it takes a lot of practice and basically memorizing the whole game
<dtm> oh my goodness yes
<dtm> and a type of cognition
<nickr> I can almost picture how the thought process would work
<dtm> to be able to memorize 3d space in a game is not yet my bag, baby
<nickr> I'm more glacial in my processing
<dtm> i used to get sick playing Descent
<dtm> me too
<dtm> i strategize in that environment.  the only way i'm mostly reflexes is in a 2d side scroller like on 8bit NES
<dtm> like Super Mario Bros
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise ("off to work...").
<dtm> but i memorized those levels
<nickr> Ahh I loved Descent
<nickr> I was so good at it
<dtm> i couldn't play it worth crap
<dtm> i have the registered macos cd of it here
<dtm> we played Descent in DOSemu back in 1997
<dtm> or 1996
<nickr> hehe
<dtm> with pc speaker sound
<nickr> I played Descent in 1996 a Lot
<nickr> I played two player over a serial cable cooperative
<dtm> haha i had friends who did that
<dtm> iplayed Doom2 over modem
<dtm> until the upper levels -- too slow on a 486 dx 33 and 14400 bps
<dtm> litearlly too slow
<dtm> like 3 fps or < 1 fps
<nickr> I really liked descent because I like 0 G environments and being able to think in real 3d with no up or down
<dtm> hehe
<dtm> that made me ill :)
<nickr> hehe
<nickr> it'd probably make me ill now a days
<dtm> well ok i'm going to now try hooking up quake1 on my tv and stereo speakers
<nickr> hehe
<nickr> I wonder if I have quake1 data
<dtm> yeah i WONDER where a fella could obtain such data...  ;)
<nickr> oh wait I do have it
<dtm> which happens to be 14MB under bzip2
<dtm> ok i'm gonna hook it up   brb   
<dtm> nickr: we can play that and/or q3a
<dtm> i have no quake2 game data at all
<nickr> I like quake2 better
<dtm> never played it
<nickr> I'll uhh
<dtm> DONT SAY IT
<dtm> NOT IN PUBLIC
<nickr> 'sell' you a 'copy' when I have the bandwidth to do it
<dtm> SSSHHHHH

Action: dtm notes with dismay that quake1 and q3a will not display properly on ntsc by defualt
<dtm> it's just wron
<dtm> g
<dtm> it's not fair!
<dtm> i just watched QdQ episode1
<dtm> i have nehahra but i haven't played it
<dtm> i oughtta watch the movie
<dtm> i started learning quake1 last weekend, and i played the first episode , e1m1 to e1m4, plus e1m8
<dtm> i then realized that i'd accidentally selected the 'hard' level.
<dtm> i died a ton of times from the abominable electric snowman in e1m1
<ajmitch> ok
<dtm> so i think i'll restart it with the 'easy' level :}
Action: ajmitch has not played quake for many a long while
<dtm> coz i have no idea what to expect
<dtm> i can say though that from watching QdQ, the nightmare level doesn't look much harder than the 'hard' level.  in fact much of the game looks a lot less hard than Doom was.
<dtm> especially nightmare
<dtm> doom in nightmare mode had about 820375270 concurrent characters.
<dtm> bbl, playing!@#(*)
<nickr> I sleep now.
<ajmitch> night
<dtm> yay i just beat e1m1-e1m4
<dtm> at 'normal' level
<dtm> it's _way_ easier

<Harald1> hi
<jamest> hey Harald1
<jamest> you know the cr/lf vs lf issue
<jamest> something extreme odd is going on on win32
<jamest> the widget is ok being passed strings with just \n in them
<jamest> however it must autoconvert to \r\n
<jamest> which throws the cursor placement off
<Harald1> jamest: ah, that explains why I hadn't problems, when I tested it in a small wypython app
<Harald1> did you change anything, or are there still problems?
<jamest> I've just been playing
<jamest> i haven't applied the latest patches you sent yet
<Harald1> jamest: well it isn't complete. It just an example of what I think has to be done to convert to \n when storing in the db. but I'm not sure that making a conversion in _tosqlString is enough
<Harald1> but as the widget does autoconvert \n -> \r\n, it could work

<dtm> http://home.smuckola.org/robot_insurance.mov -- check it out if you can play quicktime
<dtm> old quicktime, that is
<dneighbo> jcater any reason you started a lyx doc
<dneighbo> opposed to using existing docbook doc in cvs?
<dneighbo> for reports
<jcater> I'm 99.8% sure they cover different parts of reports
<psu> without setting any hares running, do we need to re-think our docs policy?
<psu> at the moment we seem to have a de facto and a de jure policy
<psu> as people understandably want to use a wysiwyg editor
<psu> We could always standardise on straight HTML, and use something like HTMLDOC 
<psu> to produce pdf & ps from this 
Action: jamest just wants docs that
<nickr> I think docbook is the best choice
<jamest> 1) don't require me to program them
<psu> and then people can use the wysigwig HTML ediotr of their choice
<jamest> 2) have tools that actually don't suck
<jamest> i was ok with docbook until i figured out that 
<jamest> 1) the tools work anywhere as long as it's linux
<jamest> 2) the tools work on linux 50% of the time
<nickr> the tools are based on open standards that could be applied to apps on any platform, not that that helps much
<jamest> i lost a good hour yesterday fucking with docbook (yet again) without any success it getting it working on my systems
<jamest> s/it getting it/trying to get it
<psu> does the docbook xslt work with sablatron? XML rather than SGML docbook
<nickr> it sohuld
<nickr> I tdhink standardizing on the XML docbook would be a positive move
<jamest> and I have spent a good day with the jade and openjade and never got them to compile on solaris
<dneighbo> jcater i disagree
<psu> nickr: it *should* work as non-XML for jamest but it don't ;-)
<dneighbo> if the name is reporting concepts
<nickr> jade is NARSTY
<dneighbo> i think it belongs in report proposal
<dneighbo> i.e. the report proposal was meant to build on
<psu> if even jamest can't hack something into working, I fear it
<dneighbo> if its a users guide
<jcater> I AM NOT GETTING INTO THIS ARGUMENT AT THIS POINT IN TIME
<dneighbo> then i agree it should be separate
<dneighbo> btw: im not arguing lyx vs docbook here
<dneighbo> im arguing fragmented vs non fragmented documentation
<jcater> the only existing reports documentation I've seen
<jcater> deals w/corba and communications
<jcater> nothing more
Action: psu will shut up, as this isn;t a useful; discussion on what may be a release weekend 
<jamest> psu: docs are a huge problem for us
<dsmith> I know you guys don't like it, but texinfo is a really nice format.  I used to use it on dos/win systems!  It's easy on the eyes (looks good without formatting).  Has outstanding printed output.  Can be converted into pdf, info, html.  
<psu> jamest: agreed
<dsmith> And it's the standard GNU format, besides.
<jamest> dsmith: yes, we did docs in texinfo at one time
<dsmith> There is also great support in emacs for texinfo.
Action: psu really will shit up this time
<dneighbo> um i still dont know where 'we dont like texinfo' comes from
<psu> s/shit/shut
<jcater> I'm trying my damnest to get some useful docs generated for the upcoming release
<psu> one of my worst irc typos ever...
<jcater> so please let me be
<jcater> we can discuss afterwards :)
<dneighbo> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/reporter/
<dneighbo> is what im talking about
<jamest> people wanted docbook so derek went to the trouble of converting everything to docbook
Action: drochaid is back (gone 04:26:16)
<jamest> my biggest issue with any docs is they must be easy to write
<dneighbo> this was a big picture overview
<jcater> dneighbo: that addresses nothing that I'm addressing
<dneighbo> but was meant to be filled with more detail
<dneighbo> sigh
<dneighbo> your missing the point
<dneighbo> this is an INCOMPLETE document
<jamest> texinfo and docbook have me spending time programming the docs
<dneighbo> what you are doing now (the details) were to go in it
<jamest> instead of programming GNUe
<dneighbo> dont argue that, you fight losing battle stick with the tools suck its valid
<dsmith> jamest: Really!.  Hmm.  I find that using a wisiwig kind of word-processor thingy does that to me.
<dneighbo> i.e.
<dneighbo> doing 
<dneighbo> <para>blah</para>
<dneighbo> is no more difficult
<nickr> I thought abiword could export docbook
<dneighbo> than selecting Paragraph in lyx and typing
<jcater> dneighbo: ok, we'll use docbook
<jcater> HOWEVER
<dsmith> jamest: I guess I'm just used to it.
<dneighbo> im not ADOVCATING docbook
<jcater> docbook tools don't work for me
<dneighbo> seriously
<nickr> if it doesn't you could use an xslt to convert the abiword xml format
<jcater> so someone else can write them
<dneighbo> docbook doesnt work on ash anymore?
<jamest> dneighbo: paragraph typing is far easier than looking for the error <tag>Something about tags/tag>
<dsmith> jamest: Exactly!
<jamest> dneighbo: it might
<jamest> honestly I don't know
<jamest> it's by the week
<jamest> last I knew it works
<psu> IMHO this discussion (which I apologise for starting) really belongs next week
<nickr> use a standardized text format, and I'll write a perl script to convert them to docbook :)
<psu> once the release is out the door
<jamest> however docbook at home does not
<psu> IMHO this discussion (which I apologise for starting) really belongs next week
<jcater> nickr: I wouldn't be opposed to that
<jamest> docbook at work does not
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> as I prefer writing text
<jcater> but it's hard to get text into other formats :)
<nickr> just put to cr between each paragraph /italic/ *bold* _underline_
<nickr> you don't really exploit the logical markup that way
<nickr> but
<dneighbo> sigh i dont mind arguing about what format to use
<nickr> whatever :)
<jcater> I was trying to be nice and use a structured/standard format that can be converted
<dneighbo> but that really wasnt my point
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> we really need chapters, sections, etc
<jamest> IMHO
<dneighbo> im more concerned that we are now going to have two documents that have a reports overview
<dneighbo> that will probably 'conflict'
<jcater> dneighbo: COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TOPICS
<jamest> if there was any editor that let me easily write docbook
<jcater> I've already said that
<dneighbo> jcater: i think it should all be one document
<jamest> and if I never have to build the docs
<jamest> then I'm ok with docbook
<nickr> I coulda sworn abiword supported docbook
<dneighbo> nickr it does
<nickr> it does!
<nickr> wtf
<dneighbo> its not worth it, you must pry lyx from their cold dead hands
<nickr> use fuckin abiword
<dneighbo> which is why its not worth arguing about
<jamest> huh?
<jcater> wtf?
<jamest> lyx sucks too
<nickr> abiword isn't crusty like lyx
<jamest> it just sucks less than doing it by hand
<dneighbo> again my point was not to bring up the what format is best war
<jamest> abiword is cool if it works
<dneighbo> jamest: i think 99% of our docbook issues are that of staleness
<dneighbo> we didnt keep up with the times
<nickr> I don't know how well abiword would do uhh the logical formatting of docbook though
<dneighbo> our docs are written to use sgml and jade(dssl)
<jamest> we don't have time to keep up with the times is my point
<dneighbo> which is all but dead
<jamest> i don't want to program docs
<dneighbo> so when you get the docbook tools that are now
<dneighbo> xml and xsl 
<dneighbo> there are 'issues'
<jamest> lyx/docbook is dead now too
<nickr> jamest: you should write in plaintext and let someone else 'program' them
<jamest> they change things as often as the wind changes direction
<dneighbo> jamest: probably for the smae reasons
<nickr> its much easier for someone to take a doc and convert it
<dneighbo> nickr thats the idea behind docbook really
<jcater> dneighbo: that link you gave me is for a reports infrastructure proposal
<jamest> nickr: we have tons of .txt docs
<dneighbo> i mean we only use like 5 tags
<jamest> no one has steped up to convert them
<dneighbo> so this 'programming docs' argument is a joke to me
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise ("probably not back till Mon - busy weekend").
<jamest> so I started on common and jcater is (trying) to start on reports
<jamest> i hate writing docs if the truth be know
<jamest> i don't need them
<jcater> as do I
<dneighbo> problem with the .txt docs is they are too incohesive and scattered
<dneighbo> and often conflicting
<reinhard> i feel the need to get into this discussion
<dneighbo> so when someone tries to consolodate them and format them
<reinhard> as i suspect one of the reasons for j* to write docs is to make me happy
<reinhard> happy == able to start with geas 
<dneighbo> its nearly impossible w/o getting the original authors involved
<reinhard> so i have to say
<reinhard> i am happy with every doc you write
<reinhard> and i appreciate your work
<dneighbo> i will say since we have doc/ dirs in each tool dir etc it has gotten much better
<reinhard> as i know what writing docs means for a programmer
<reinhard> no matter how and with which tool you write it
<reinhard> thank you anyway :)
<reinhard> --
<dneighbo> but on at least 5 occassions i tried to consolidate geas docs to no avail
<jamest> lol
<jcater> one large doc is much worse than 5 targeted docs imho
<dneighbo> for the programmer yes
<dneighbo> for the end user no
<jcater> No
[14:27] Last message repeated 2 time(s).
<dneighbo> becaues FINDING the docs is the problem
<dneighbo> the idea originally
<jcater> Each one has a different audience
<dneighbo> was to have as many small docs as you want
<dneighbo> and then create books from them
<dneighbo> so users had a choice to search for a targeted doc
jcater (~jason@w202.z065105010.mem-tn.dsl.cnc.net) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<dneighbo> or get a broader picture on a topic and garner all the docs for it
<nickr> should take the whole bodice of documentation and treat it as one book
<nickr> in separate files
<nickr> 'the gnue book'
<nickr> group all the docs for ecah module in a section
<dneighbo> nickr it was done that way at one time
<dneighbo> there was developers guide
<dneighbo> and a something else
<dneighbo> and a module guide 
<dneighbo> and they all made up the Definitive Guide
<nickr> at first you could do it just as an index, and then slowly migrate all the formats to docbook xml, so it could be an actual book
<nickr> actually you could look at the sections as books in a book colloction, and each doc as an article
<nickr> that way you could have chapters under each article

<dneighbo>  DocPro is a compilation of tools designed to allow technical writers to effectively process their DocBook SGML and XML layout. DocBook itself is a powerful markup language. However, the tools are painful to compile, configure and work with. Command Prompt, Inc. has eliminated the problems associated with the integration of these tools into a production environment.
<dneighbo> We enable technical authors to only have to worry about writing and being productive. With DocPro, users of DocBook no longer need to spend their time just getting the tools to work. Command Prompt, Inc. has created a completely self-contained environment which allows for easy upgrading and maintenance. For more information please see our fact sheet.

<chillywilly> s/rigt/right
<nickr> for silly folks who want wysiwyg
<chillywilly> oh, you mean like guis and shit?
<nickr> yea
<chillywilly> who needs that crap
<nickr> abiwword should be fine though
<chillywilly> I have emacs
<chillywilly> :P
<dneighbo> amaya really might be interesting
<dneighbo> it looks like wysiwyg 
<nickr> amaya is only html though
<dneighbo> nickr it says its any markup
<nickr> hm.
<dneighbo> including mathML, svg etc
<dneighbo> you only need to provide it an DTD
<nickr> also you can't really do mysiwyg with logial markups
<dneighbo> which docbook has
<dneighbo> hmm
<chillywilly> well they use style sheets for presentation right?
<dneighbo> KDE and FreeBSD just moved to docbook for all docs
<nickr> yep.
<dneighbo> gnome alredy did
<nickr> yep
<dneighbo> and sounds like debian will be
<chillywilly> xsl....presentation for your data and more!
<dneighbo> makes me wonder why on earth
<nickr> Debian is also a member of OASIS
<dneighbo> the suite is still such a kludge
<nickr> actually I could join any of the OASIS groups if I want to
<dneighbo> and more importantly there are no good visual editors for it
<chillywilly> does gnome use docbook xml now?
<nickr> stop complaining and write one
<nickr> if they don't they should :P
<chillywilly> dneighbo: we have emacs though
<chillywilly> ;)
<nickr> it'd be nice if emacs knew about docbook and gave you a nice sidebar for manafging the chapters/books/etc
Action: dneighbo gulps
<dneighbo> it sounds like ther eis a good tool
<nickr> emacs is a great editor but they don't give you enough convenience tools
<dneighbo> http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xeena
<dneighbo> but it uses java
<nickr> yea
<chillywilly> yea, the emacs thingy could be better
<jamest> i'll take java for a good editor
<chillywilly> "mode"
<chillywilly> I should say
Action: chillywilly thwaps jamest
<dneighbo> jamest: well if i made a dtd for forms or reports etc
<dneighbo> it could be used for them too
<chillywilly> I thought schemas were the better thing
Action: chillywilly is a bit xml illiterate
<nickr> you can convert dtds to schemas
<nickr> schemas imho are way overcomplex though
<chillywilly> *sigh 14MB now to upgrade debian
<chillywilly> I need to get a cable modem
<nickr> I just don't track unstable
<nickr> it takes too long to even do an update
<chillywilly> what you running then?
<chillywilly> it doesn't take too long
<chillywilly> I just go to bed
<chillywilly> when I wake up
<chillywilly> it's usually done
<nickr> unstable
<chillywilly> ;P
<nickr> unstable circa march 15
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> this time I started it in the morning and went to work
<chillywilly> it hs been going all day
<chillywilly> but it timed out probably when my stupid modem hung up
<nickr> I'd have to download 217 megs if I were to upgrade right now
<chillywilly> then I had to do an update again to fix some broken shit
<chillywilly> and I need 14MB now instead of 200MB
<chillywilly> Need to get 13.1MB/234MB of archives. After unpacking 11.8MB will be used.
<chillywilly> ah crap mozilla is brokem
<chillywilly> woddy will be released May 1st eh?
<chillywilly> er, woody
<nickr> supposedly
<chillywilly> you don't sound so convinced
<chillywilly> that's still pretty fucking fast for debian
<chillywilly> wouldn't you say?
<nickr> I'm not convinced
<nickr> but I've never been a release manager so I don't know
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> ok, so maybe they will do it in Aug ;)
<nickr> heh
<nickr> I think things are going well mostly
<chillywilly> then whyt he pessimism?
<chillywilly> why the
<nickr> I just don't think they'll make may 1st

<jamest> amaya
<jcater> I've used amaya and xeena
<jamest> deb package seemed very html based and unstable
<chillywilly> why you installing the jdk?
<jamest> xeena is java based
<jamest> jcater: do either of them achieve the status of "sucks less"?
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> just curious
<jcater> for what?
<chillywilly> you have to add the non-free section to sources.list?
<jcater> one is a tree-based xml editor
<jcater> the other is an html editor
<jcater> amaya shows promise as an html editor
<jcater> I couldn't imagine us doing docs in html, if that's what this is about
<chillywilly> texinfo!
<chillywilly> docbook!
<chillywilly> texinfo!
<chillywilly> docbook!
<chillywilly> lyx!
<chillywilly> stone tablets!

<chillywilly> uh, yea when pigs fly

<nickr> I prefer clay tablets with canaeoform writing
<jcater> I prefer .py files
<chillywilly> code that documents itself

<chillywilly> fuck docs
<chillywilly> yea, I know it has little doc strings
<chillywilly> but I don't think that would be enough
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> __doc__ right?
<nickr> afaik the whole ref manual is generated from the doc strings

<reinhard> anybody know how i can write a cpp macro

<reinhard> ?
<nickr> \=?
<nickr> er
<nickr> \
<chillywilly> should be no different than C
<reinhard> no the other way around
<reinhard> i want the _result_ to be more than one line
<reinhard> i.e. the _result_ should contain newlines
<nickr> oh
<nickr> why?
<reinhard> because i use cpp to preprocess a file of a different language than C
<reinhard> where newlines are syntax relevant
<nickr> ah
<nickr> thats silly
<nickr> use m4
<chillywilly> I know
<chillywilly> everbody funny

<drochaid> I can see a very large difference between the two
<chillywilly> if you don't care about offending them how can you care about them?

<nickr> offence is largely harm one does to oneself

<ajmitch> so list them for me ;)
<chillywilly> odmg.txt

<chillywilly> some of them should contain lists as a member
<ajmitch> alrighty
<chillywilly> some contain a dictionary
<chillywilly> andn we should implement the methods for emilating those types
<chillywilly> er, emulating
<chillywilly> the __method__ type methods
<chillywilly> and the list or dictionary interface
<ajmitch> yeah
<chillywilly> (depednign on which type it shoudl be most like
<chillywilly> and also some op methods
<chillywilly> like
<chillywilly> __add__
<ajmitch> i see you can override <, >, and == comparisons as well in python
<chillywilly> and the ODMG interfaces
<ajmitch> using __cmp__
<chillywilly> which can be implemented by derived classes
<chillywilly> so they should be more like abstract classes
<chillywilly> that implement eh python stuff
<ajmitch> ok, dunno how long this will take, i have a few more important things to do ;)
<chillywilly> and leave the ODMG methods alone for children to implement
<chillywilly> I think
<chillywilly> well
<chillywilly> I'll work on it then
<chillywilly> I am hoping to get the the point of difining the odmg collections classes in python

<chillywilly> jabber is sort of a SOAP replacement

<chillywilly> howdy
<Harald1> hmm. does anybody know a decent editor under SunOS?
<chillywilly> vi ;)
<chillywilly> doesn't emacs run on SunOS?
<Harald1> chillywilly: yes, but it's not installed. unbelievable. they install a unix-server without emacs! even my windows has it
<Harald1> they = my university
<chillywilly> request that they install emacs ;)
<Harald1> I guess they didn't install it because they use the clients to teach students unix and they want that you use vi 
<chillywilly> oh
Isomer (dahoose@210-86-57-103.jetstart.xtra.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> still they don't know that it is installed
<chillywilly> ;)
<Harald1> and even worse: they teach you java
<chillywilly> yuk
<chillywilly> they should be slapped
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: chillywilly took Java as an elective though
<chillywilly> it was an easy A
<chillywilly> ;P

<chillywilly> hmmm, you know it seems that the OMG wants to do the same as what we are trying to do with gnurpc
<chillywilly> er, well at least have ti be an extensible framework
<chillywilly> I submit this same data implies something else. It suggests that the OMG is on the verge of successfully reinventing itself. The OMG has always been about helping companies create and manage distributed systems. Rather than sticking with a single CORBA approach, however, the OMG has had the vision to step back and embrace a new approach that will allow companies not only to use CORBA but also to simultaneously design systems that w
<chillywilly> port all of the other languages and middleware systems they need to support. 
<chillywilly> instead of CORBA they are going UML to code now
<chillywilly> it's wacky shit
<chillywilly> they are adding stuff to UML to help make code generation easier
<chillywilly> this is cool as I always thought the one stop CORBA solution was short sighted
alexey (alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<derek> chillywilly: yeah but using objects + corba adds inches to your penis so it must be good ;)
<jamest> boy
<jamest> i'm glad i don't both corba and object or I'd have to give up wearing shorts
<chillywilly> why do I even bother talking to you people
<jamest> cause we're fun
<jamest> :)
<derek> roflmao
<chillywilly> I was just noting that OMG sees the error of their ways and wants to support more then corba ;)

<derek> Blade Director to Adapt 'Akira' For Western Audiences
<derek> MoviesPosted by timothy on Saturday April 13, @10:48AM
<derek> from the no-longer-april-fool's-day dept.
<derek> dswensen writes: "According to the Sci-Fi Channel web site, Steven Norrington (director of Blade) is going to write and direct an adaptation of the classic anime Akira . Norrington says his story 'preserves the tone, the visual and the epic scope of the original, whilst telling a somewhat more accessible story [to Western audiences]." The article doesn't mention whether the adaptation will be animated or live-action. Given Norring
<derek> ack record and the butchery that usually takes place under the guise of making something 'accessible,' it's hard to take this as extraordinarily good news."

<derek> er gack
<derek> i didnt mean to do that
<derek> i meant to paste the article on slashdot about win wifi cards :(
<derek> i.e. first winmodems
<derek> now win wireless
<derek> jamest i really am sorry
Action: derek is secretly jealous that jamest doesnt need corba+objets
<jamest> i was about to kick you
<jamest> as i figured you'd screwed up 
<jamest> and would pop back in :)
<drochaid> win wireless?
<drochaid> still on WEP?
<drochaid> or have they started native ipsec do das yet
<derek> drochaid: it appears tehy are trying to convince wifi card makers
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<derek> to not use those 'expensive' hardware but rather use windows o/s software to control things
<derek> to lower the price to the *consumer*
<derek> i.e. its always about the *consumer* w/ m$
Action: derek is extremely sarcastic this morning
<jamest> didn't mean to ruin your day derek
<jamest> :)
<drochaid> <derek> i.e. its always about the *consumer* w/ m$
<drochaid> well ... that's true derek
<drochaid> just not in the way you meant it :)
<jamest> ooooo
<drochaid> it's all about limiting consumer choice to their own products .. so it IS all about the consumer ;)
<chillywilly> it's about screwing the consumer
<jamest> for those few brave souls that use the new --internal-debugger option on forms/reports/nav
<drochaid> now .. my pizza should be ready, back in a mo
<drochaid> sorry derek :)
<chillywilly> muuwahahhaha
<chillywilly> mmm, pizza
<jamest> if you need to set a breakpoint then you must do two "step" commands first
<chillywilly> that sounds good
<jamest> derek: dcl issue when I closed ticket 19
<jamest> er ticket 1
<jamest> 555 Unsupported option: Enterprise 
<jamest> is printed at top of web page
<derek> hmmmm
<derek> jamest: i think that is an 'email' error
<derek> like the smtp server is not responding to a socket call on 25
<derek> can you see if ash mail server is still functioning correctly?
<jamest> works fine

<chillywilly> there ya go
<chillywilly> it's going just fine thanks
<Isomer> surprisingly enough, it's only slightly more verbose than the IRC protocol ;)
<chillywilly> :P
<Isomer> :)
<chillywilly> geas needs to speak IRC ;)
<chillywilly> that would be so much fun
<Isomer> mozilla have a great li'l bot
<Isomer> called mozbot from memory
<Isomer> <botbot> SeaMonkey: 'Mac Debug Depend (viper1)' has changed state from Horked to Success.
<chillywilly> horked, heheh
<chillywilly> that's a ren and stimpy word
<derek> ok i bet someones email address is invalid
<Isomer> could have a li'l bot in here that tells you when someone does a CVS commit
<Isomer> and what their log message is
<derek> you said ticket #1 right?
<chillywilly> derek: you are invalid, please authenticate yourself
<Isomer> <gnubot> CVS Commit by jamest: Fixed annoying bug
<Isomer> :)
<chillywilly> it would be more like

<chillywilly> that's like his favorite log message
<chillywilly> ;P
<Isomer> then you slap him around the head to give better commit messages :)
<chillywilly> I dunno wtf it means
Action: Isomer ponders implementing a cvs commit bot for irc
<Isomer> he's commiting on his devel box so he can cvs update on his "test" box
<Isomer> at a guess
<chillywilly> yea
<derek> jamest your close 'worked' on that bug
<derek> so im thinking its an workflow (email) issue
<jamest> i blame the dcl admin
<derek> hmmm i added another item to it and no error
<derek> sa (the admin) had no password
<derek> so its possible perhaps that it tried to 'notify' the admin and barfed
<chillywilly> it's the derek curse
<derek> as i probably created the first ticket in the sa account to test
<chillywilly> that's what I blame
<chillywilly> he touched it
<chillywilly> it went to shit
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> i routed sa to root@gnuenterprise.org
<derek> so let me know if you encounter any more
<chillywilly> derek: you suck
<chillywilly> from now on I am just going to ignore you like you ignor me you freak
<derek> what do you mean?
<derek> where did i ignore you?
<jamest> um
<jamest> we have an admin account with no password?
<chillywilly> did someone say something?
<chillywilly> ;)
<derek> ?
Action: chillywilly throws many fishies at derek
<derek> jamest: is there ANY chance that fsf would put spam assassian or something on their servers?
<derek> as the amount of crap mail coming ot our list is getting unmanageable
<chillywilly> just filter it yourself dude
<jamest> i seriously doubt it
<derek> i.e. im deleting like 5 or so spam mails a day
<derek> chillywilly: you dont get it
<jamest> chillywilly: we are manually
<derek> its not comeing to me
<derek> its coming to the mailing list
<derek> and i am being nice and deleting it for YOU
<derek> and everyone else
<chillywilly> spamassassin should mark it as spam though when you download it
<derek> but its becoming a severe nuisance as mailman doesnt play nice anymorre with browsers
<derek> and im gettinng a boat load of requests to tend to mails that arent approved yet for mailman (as is jamest and jcater i assume)
<chillywilly> I would just let it fly and people will just have to filter their own
<chillywilly> if it that big of a headache
<derek> chillywilly: i somewhat agree, but it makes us look 'unprofessional' that we cant even keep spam off our lists
<jamest> derek: yes, i cannot admin the lists anymore from mozilla or konq
<derek> jamest: i think i learned the trick
<derek> login
<derek> click all as whatever you want them to be
<derek> and hit submit
<chillywilly> well the hurd lists aren't even moderated
<derek> it will just hang
<derek> give it like 30 seconds
<chillywilly> I get lots of crap on them
<derek> then go to the entry bar at top
<derek> and hit enter
<derek> (i.e. like a refresh w/o a repost)
<derek> and it accepts your originall submittal and says all requests processed and they are
<derek> its hokey but its been working
<jamest> cool
<Isomer> recent mozilla's have that fixed I believe
<Isomer> they barf'd on POST's over 10k in size
<chillywilly> ick
<Isomer> http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130301
Action: jamest is away: guests
<Isomer> so grab a nightly and hope for the best :)
<chillywilly> is the debian package fixed?
<chillywilly> 0.9.9-5
<Isomer> I would probably guess not
<Isomer> RC1 should be out in a few days
<Isomer> so wait until then ;)
<jamest> if people find the time I'd really like someone to hammer on forms/designer 
<chillywilly> blah, I'm not going to download mozilla
<jamest> and send me bug reports via dcl (or anyway possible)
<jamest> then after guests leave I'll fix 'em up
<jamest> the bugs not the guests
<derek> im swamped today but you be around a few
<derek> i might have an hour to hammer on it
<chillywilly> seems like everytime I click a tab fucking galeon wants to reload the page
<Isomer> rofl
<derek> jamest: for the record, the reason i find more bugs is i have a bigger hammer
<derek> example:
<derek> http://members.aon.at/cancer/kulturhof/images/hammer.jpg
<chillywilly> ok.....
Action: ra3vat recalls derek offered to send one overseas to him 
<derek> ra3vat: well i would ship a smaller one, as we are cutting costs over here :)
<ra3vat> derek: thanks, i'll let you know when there will be a chance to save on shipping cost also :)
<derek> its amazing what you learn when you read your own press releases :)

[20:57] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<nickr> its scary when you provide most of your own info :)
<derek> sigh its all too common
<derek> nickr: i am installing potato 2.2r3
<derek> via 3 disk set
<derek> but want to immediately get network card working
<derek> and get it on my network and upgrade to testing for him
<nickr> yuck.
<nickr> you should use woody netinst always
<derek> agree but i dont have disks and burner is busted
<derek> and i am not sure how to do the network card
<nickr> okay
<nickr> er
<nickr> I have no idea of the driver.
<nickr> google search no lucky?
<derek> i htink ne2k
<derek> http://lhd.datapower.com/db/dispproduct.php3?DISP?1372
<derek> this give you enough info?
<nickr> ne2k is no good
<nickr> bad bad bad
<jcater> it's not that bad
<nickr> must be a pnp ne2k
<nickr> derek: you should get the 2.4bf disk set for woody
<nickr> that way you have the nifty kernel pnp driver
<derek> um too late
<derek> im already almost done with the potato install
<jcater> is this a new card?
<derek> um no
<derek> old card
<jcater> so he has no idea the irq and base port?
<derek> but i know it was support in red hat 5.2 or 6.0
<derek> as i had it working on that
<nickr> theres no way you can be 'almost done' if you don't have the network working.
<nickr> unless you installed from a CD or someting
<derek> installing from cd
<derek> actually 3 cd's
<jcater> derek: you have the EA201 driver disks?
<derek> that came with it?
<jcater> :
<jcater> :)
<jcater> take that as a no
<derek> or download
<derek> i might
<jcater> That's gonna be the easiest way to get the irq/port settings
<jcater> Do you know if, in rh, it was used in pnp mode?
<derek> been over 2 years
<derek> so nope
<derek> getting freaky crap on x install
<derek> geeks trying
<derek> _X11TransSocketUNIXConnect: CAn't connect: errno = 111
<derek> like 20 times
<derek> then says cant create XF86Config
<derek> then get 
<derek> Press [Enter] to switch to graphics mode
<derek> and i cant get out
<derek> any ideas
Maniac (User@h24-82-132-209.wp.shawcable.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jcater> this in the install?
<derek> yeah
<derek> i just did ctrl-c
<derek> and its skipping it now
ToyMan (stuq@c5300-2-ip52.albany.thebiz.net) left irc: No route to host
<jcater> you plan on updating this to woody once everything's working?
<jcater> if so, wouldn't worry about x until then
<nickr> don't even bother with X in potato
<derek> thats what im doing :)
<derek> i jsut didnt know how to get out of it :)
<derek> ctrl c worked :)
<derek> have to run to store (er drive) will be back in a minute
<derek> brandon might come in and ask for help
<jcater> you trust us w/a friend?
<nickr> wow
<nickr> thats some trust :)
Action: nickr plots
<derek> ok im back
<derek> install is done ready to play network
<derek> anyone still here?
<jcater> I could be
<derek> where should i start
<jcater> are you at the command prompt?
<derek> btw: i have the EA201 ethernet card : drivers and diagnostics disk ver 1
<derek> im at command prompt
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> any chance that disk is bootable?
<derek> nope
<jcater> or do you have an old dos bootable floppy laying around?
<derek> well maybe
<derek> but it says at dos prompt execute:
<derek> yeah i probably have a bootable floppy
<jcater> that'd make things so much easier
<jcater> you'll want to boot up, run the setup program on that floppy
<jcater> disable PNP
<jcater> and select an IRQ and IO Port
<jcater> (it's possible this was done 2 years ago, but we don;t know what they are)
<derek> ok
<derek> rebotting in dos
<derek> er rebooting
<derek> pnp disabled
<derek> full duplex disabled
<derek> interrupt number : 3
<derek> i/o base address 240
<jcater> any particular reason full-duplex is disabled?
<derek> connector type UTP RJ-45
<derek> type ea201
<jcater> are these the existing settings?
<derek> busmode 16-bit
<jcater> or have you changed them?
<derek> jcater: either i changed it cause it caused problems or it was the default :)
<jcater> also, is this the same computer system
<derek> yes
<jcater> or did you swipe this card from another
<jcater> ok
<derek> nope card just sitting in here for 2 years :)
<jcater> just leave everything alone and get back into debian
<jcater> we have what we came for
<derek> ok
<derek> rebooted
<derek> ready to rock and roll
<jcater> go into modconf
<jcater> and find the Network section
<jcater> ...I forget the organization of the potato modconf
<jcater> then select the "ne"
<jcater> when prompted for arguments
<jcater> use
<jcater> io=0x240 irq=3
<derek> sucessful
<derek> lsmod
<derek> ne 6132 0 (unused)
<derek> 8390 5924 [ne]
<derek> so seems to be there
<derek> now what
<jcater> edit /etc/network/interfaces
<jcater> is this a dhcp setup?
<derek> no dhcp
<jcater> you need to add 
<jcater> #iface eth0 inet static
<jcater> #  address 192.168.10.2
<jcater> #  netmask 255.255.255.0
<jcater> (without the # and with the correct data :)
<jcater> plus you'll need to add a nameserver line to /etc/resolv.conf
<jcater> err, how will this be connecting to the internet?
<jcater> is there a gateway/router there?
<jcater> if so, you also need
<jcater>       gateway 192.168.0.x
<jcater> in that /etc/network/interfaces
<jcater> (with the correct value of course :)
<derek> ethernet up
<derek> rock
IsoosI (dahoose@210-86-57-244.jetstart.xtra.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> cool
<derek> having brain damage
<derek> in debian wehre do you setup the gateway?
<jcater> /etc/network/interfaces
<derek> ?
<jcater> err
<derek> that doesnt sound right
<jcater> are you wanting to make this a gateway
<jcater> or point it to a gateway
<derek> no
<derek> wanting to point it to a gateway :)
<jcater> this is my web server's /etc/network/interfaces
<jcater> iface eth0 inet static
<jcater>       address 65.105.10.203
<jcater>       netmask 255.255.255.248
<jcater>       gateway 192.168.0.201
<jcater> so I think that's the right way :)
<jcater> I use dhcp now at home, so that's the nearest example for me
<derek> i got it
<derek> we have net you are god
<derek> can you paste you sources.list here
<derek> as i only have one monitor
<derek> and my laptop isnt debian
<derek> i need to see what an http 
<jcater> yeah
<derek> apt looks like
<jcater> deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian woody main contrib non-free
<jcater> deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US woody/non-US main contrib non-free
<derek> ooo never mind
<derek> ok cool
<derek> they had put commented ones in there
<jcater> ah :)
Action: derek will be back in a while, distupgrade was 238 packages :)
<jcater> ouch
