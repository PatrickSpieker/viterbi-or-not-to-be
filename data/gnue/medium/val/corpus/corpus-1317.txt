<return_this> the reason I want to utilize mozilla is purely selfish...
<return_this> I have invested a lot of time playing with xul and xpcom ... and I would like to utilize that as much as possible
<return_this> since I just stumbled onto gnue yesterday... I figured it would be a great application to play with xul/xpcom

<derek> if i had a bigger house i think i would offer someone free room and board in a bedroom in exchange for 40 hours of gnue a week
<jcater> I do 40 hrs of gnue a week
<nickr> thats a lot
<jcater> but I don't get free room / board
<nickr> how about 36?
<return_this> derek: I might bite on a deal like that :)
Action: ajmitch does 0/40 hrs of gnue a week
<derek> well i figure it would be a hacker who was a hermit
Action: ajmitch knows some of them :)
<derek> i.e. if food and room was covered
<derek> a part time grocery bagging job at 10 hours a week would cover what little social life they might have
<derek> if they played it right a small consulting job a month would cover new computer toys and such
<nickr> I'm a hermit
<derek> as i would gladly share bandwidth
<nickr> hrm

<derek> i would do it, but i dont think the wife would approve

<jcater> wow
Action: jcater didn't know new zealand had 2 extra hours in a week
<nickr> and then - 10% for miscelaneous urination and such
<derek> 168 - 21 is 147 by my count :)
<derek> and i certain now you arent spending 47 hours out of the house a week ;)
<psu> derek: all that working with accountants has rubbed off on you, I see
<ajmitch> hi psu
<nickr> I do too sleep 8 hours a day :P
<derek> psu: not quite, if that were the case i would ask for last year worth of his webcam files for auditing purposes
<derek> or actually since i work for OMB
<derek> you have 168 hours
<derek> we will budget 6 hours a day (42) for sleep
<derek> leaving us 122, budget 2 hours a day for eating, personal hygiene (14)
<derek> leaving us 108 so we budget 100 for computer time 
<derek> leaving us 2 for contigency
<derek> and from nickr is saying
<jcater> 2 hrs/day for eating and hygiene??????
<derek> our 'actuals to budget' seems to be within acceptable variance
<jcater> you must be a few degrees out of the hacker culture :)
<ajmitch> you only need a shower about every week or so
<nickr> I spend 2 hours every other day for hygiene but eat in front of the computer
<derek> jcater: he didnt want me to mention that 'backup' he has been experiencing

<derek> i figure we put him on 802.11b and we are likely to recoup at least 10 hours a week
<derek> nearly a 10% increase
<derek> oh if i boarded someone i think i woudl give them my laptop and 802.11b
<derek> and let them sit poolside and watch the kids so i can take wife out :)
<nickr> Thats a good idea actually
<ajmitch> hehe
<nickr> efficient use of resources

<reinhard> lol
<jcater> as hours go up, the latter approached 0
<jcater> s/ed/es
<nickr> you could do a 3d plot vs. sleep
<jcater> sleep? or sleeping alone?
<reinhard> actually free software projects sometimes like to get new names for old things
<reinhard> like gnome uses "druid" instead of "wizard"
<nickr> sleep in general
<reinhard> so for charting we should rename the "pie chart" to "donut chart"
<reinhard> :)
<jcater> roflmao
<nickr> so you correlate increasing sleep with increasing intercourse to a point, wheruppon they are inverse
<nickr> donut chart.
<nickr> hah
<nickr> it'd be more accurate to call it a pizza graph

<deem0N> hi all
<deem0N> could anybody tell if subforms (master/detail) are working in Forms under windows ?
<ajmitch> not sure, sorry, i don't follow forms that closely
<deem0N> also I red that HTML driver is under way (2 projects active), but where are they in CVS tree ?
<ajmitch> don't know, sorry
<reinhard> deem0N: AFAIK
<reinhard> master/detail is working
<reinhard> on all platforms
<reinhard> and there is no "html" driver
<deem0N> any downloadable example ?
<reinhard> there was a java implementation of forms
<reinhard> but that development has stopped long ago due to lack of time
<reinhard> i'm not sure about an example
<reinhard> i think the samples dir of forms should contain one
<ajmitch> there was work done on a UIwebware driver, dunno what happened to it
<deem0N> I was unable to connect to MySQL server from Windows box 
<deem0N> only Post=gres
<reinhard> deem0N: most developers use postgres
<reinhard> so it _might_ be that mysql support is temporarly broken
<reinhard> however they will be happy if you report your problems
<reinhard> because most developers can't even _test_ mysql
<reinhard> forms developers are from the u.s. mainly
<reinhard> their irc names are jcater and jamest
<reinhard> so you might want to return here in about 6 hours
<reinhard> or you might want to write a mail to gnue-dev@gnu.org
<deem0N> basically I liked Forms XML lang, as I need something to base my development on.
<reinhard> sorry that i can't help you more here
<reinhard> cool
<deem0N> I gonna have HTML Forms implementation done for my company need
<deem0N> but I am not sure if it will be 100% implementation of all features
<deem0N> also question is support on Web server side - Java funs gonna be upset, as I like Perl :-)
<reinhard> no java fans are allowed in this channel anyway
<deem0N> for now Im installing gnue on FreeBSD to test it well
<reinhard> :)
<deem0N> thanks to all who respond
<deem0N> also for now I have a bit messed my brain with HTML,JavaScript,XUL,SOAP
<deem0N> it is hard to choose right tool for Web implementation of Forms :-)
<derek> deem0N: i believe the php implementation is in cvs
<derek> or is in process of getting there
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue/phpforms$ ls
<derek> CVS  connection.php  gnue-forms.php
<derek> dneighbo@latitude:~/cvs/gnue/phpforms$ 
<deem0N> For me it is very important to put maximum logic on the browser - i.e. to code Forms in JavaScript and reduce HTTP traffic
<deem0N> will check php if they do some JS as well

<deem0N> anyone ! My form does not do preselect from a Postgres table. I.e. I have 4 rows in a DB, but form shows 0 rows. I can add new rows though. How to do preselect ?

<ra3vat> deem0N: are you able to fill the form some other way like manually "start query", "execute query"?
<ra3vat> via menu command
<ra3vat> hi C00ler
<deem0N> Execute query helps
<deem0N> any idea how to run in it automatically on form open ?
<ra3vat> it better ask jamest or jcater couple hours later, I think it's possible but can't help myself
<ra3vat> many things could be done via triggers

<btami> try to use cvs version of designer
<C00ler> Ok thanks for hint
<btami> that will make encoding=xxx in gfd header
<deem0N> will new designer be available at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/snapshots/win32/ ?
<deem0N> or do we need python under windows to setup it from CVS ?
<btami> i don't know the date of the next release, sorry:)
<btami> if you use cvs, you need python
<deem0N> ok
<deem0N> btami: do you know anything about HTML/JavaScript implementation of Forms ?
<ra3vat> deem0N: have you seen http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython-2.3.3pre2u-Py22-hybrid
<btami> there is something PHP in cvs, but thats all i know:)
<ra3vat> it's new unicode version  
<ra3vat> pre2u
<btami> ra3vat: please take a look at dcl (last ticket)
<deem0N> hmm, may be it will help, but for now I need to see how Master/Deatils works
<ra3vat> btami: i got it into my maibox :)
<btami> :9
<btami> :)
<btami> ra3vat: what do you think about i18n and unicode in GNUe ?
<btami> win9x doesn't support unicode 
<btami> and GNUe wants to support win9x too
<btami> i think
<btami> but with last bugfix i'v sended, my texts in forms are all correct now
<btami> labels, gnue.conf msgs, input, all ok
<ra3vat> btami: and input into entry box also?
<btami> yes
<btami> i found your old fix in 0.1.1 forms, and it helps
<btami> found=find
<ra3vat> ok
<ra3vat> i think we will not switch to unicode in one day
<ra3vat> i'm not ready to do my forms in utf8 right now
<btami> agree
<ra3vat> btami: can you answer my last email on 2 steps?
dsmith (~dsmith@cherry7.comerica.com) joined #gnuenterprise.

<ra3vat> ah
<ra3vat> thanks

<C00ler> btami can You explain how can i use 'prequery' in datasource tag ?
<btami> prequery=""
<C00ler> when my form start i need to done to actions to fetch data from database
<C00ler> this is 'enter query' and 'execute query' (by pressing F8, F9)
<btami> and cache="5" or something, i think:)
<C00ler> Is it possible to done this automaticity ?
<btami> minute, i'm trying too
<C00ler> sure 
Action: dsmith is back (gone 00:25:56)

<C00ler> nice
<btami> doesn'n worked for me

<C00ler> in examples
<btami> oh
<C00ler> <datasource table="unit_description" name="available_units" database="devel"
<C00ler> prequery=""/>
<C00ler> I see that prequery is empty everywhere
<C00ler> So i'm trying to guess what is it for :)
<deem0N> yep, docs looks like stelth technology was applied :-)

<jamest_> what parts of gnue common should get documented first to be of the most use to the GEAS conversion?
<dneighbo> db access
<dneighbo> trigger calls
<dneighbo> rpc abstraction
<dneighbo> not necessarily in that order
<nickr> la.
<reinhard> jamest_: db access
<reinhard> that's the most important imho
<dneighbo> i think rpc has to be pretty high up there too
<dneighbo> db allows geas to look at harvesting data
<dneighbo> but without rpc no one can use it :)
<jcater> dneighbo: not entirely sure I agree
Action: jcater is back (gone 01:07:14)
<jcater> I agree w/reinhard that db is at top
<jcater> but we could consider doing the same thing I'm doing w/reports
<jcater> i.e., I'm getting the engine working
<jcater> and a command line version of it running
<jcater> so ppl can develop reports and see what it's gonna be like
<jcater> w/o actually running in a client/server setup
<jcater> if that makes sense
<jcater> of course, the goal is to get a reports server
<jcater> and report clients
<jcater> but it's still usable this early on :)
<jcater> I'm thinking the same thing could happen w/GEAS and Forms
<jcater> that would allow ppl to start using the abstraction-qualities of geas
<jcater> even before we get a solid/stable server/rpc setup
<jcater> iow, start developing apps sooner
<jcater> but that's just my $0.02

<dneighbo> unlike reports geas is not usefull w/o client/server other than testing
<dneighbo> imho
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> i do think db access is top on the list
<jcater> my point was to get app development started asap
<jamest_> just to confuse you all :) I'm starting with GClientApp and GServerApp
<dneighbo> im just saying that to be useful the other things will need to follow
<jcater> and whether ppl would like to admit it or not, this would still be usable :)
<jcater> but that wasn't my point
<jcater> my point was to get app development started asap
<jamest_> so you can see simple sample before I dive into db access
<jamest_> in either case
<jamest_> its possible to figure out common by using it
<jamest_> so the docs aren't stopping anything from being developed
<jamest_> :)
<reinhard> jcater: i tend to agree with you
<dneighbo> sigh
Action: dneighbo hates when the point is totally missed, irc communication sucks
<reinhard> jamest_: the most difficult point in figuring out common by using at the code
<reinhard> um
<reinhard> looking at the code and using it
<reinhard> is
<reinhard> that python doesn't do "encapsulation"
<reinhard> i.e. it isn't defined which routines are considered "public"
<reinhard> and which ones "private"
<jcater> reinhard: he's taken off work today to actually start documenting common
<jcater> so I don't think he was saying "I won't document it" :)
<jamest_> oh I'll document things alright.
<jamest_> Chapter 1: usinging GClientApp
<jamest_> 1.1 Intro
<reinhard> jcater: i didn't understand it that way
<jamest_> Use this class to build your apps from.   See GClientApp.py for details.
<jamest_> Chapter 2......
<jamest_> :)
<reinhard> :)
<jcater> reinhard: ok :)
<jamest_> I'm documenting
<jamest_> I'm just asking what's holding people back for utilizing common
<reinhard> just for the record
<jamest_> i'm starting w/ GClientApp as it's simple
<jamest_> then I'll do DB as it's a bitch
<reinhard> it's _not_ the lack of documentation that keeps me from writing geas :(
<jamest_> then i'll probably need some heavy drugs to recover from actually understanding the db code
<jamest_> then maybe I'll get to rpc
<jamest_> since rpc is very much a work in progress it'll be a bitch to document
<jamest_> hmmm
<jamest_> our base app class includes a --conections command line arg

<jamest_> that's ok
<jamest_> the first is for 3.x xfree
<reinhard> thanks
<jamest_> the latter is 4.x xfree
<jamest_> you have it working now?
<reinhard> so this is probably because i updated from potato to woody?
<reinhard> not yet
<reinhard> dpgk-reconf asks so many questions...

<reinhard> oops

<jamest_> you have video working?
<reinhard> ok now
<reinhard> X starts

<reinhard> and the keyboard is dead too
<jamest_> you didn't disconnect mouse/keyboard did you?
<jamest_> what am I saying
<jamest_> sigh
<jamest_> what kind of mouse you have?
<reinhard> huh?
<jamest_> what brand?
<reinhard> compaq
<reinhard> was packed with the computer
<jamest_> with a scrollwheel?
<reinhard> no
<reinhard> rather old one i think
<jamest_> ps/2?
<reinhard> yes

<jamest_> ctrl-alt-backspace if nothing else works
<jamest_> then 
<reinhard> just a sec
<reinhard> not even ctrl-alt-backspace did work
<reinhard> machine is rebooting and doing fsck
<jamest_> sigh
<jamest_> ok
<jamest_> btw - the new docs are being held up do to docbook issues
Action: jamest_ hugs docbook
<reinhard> lol
Action: jamest_ uses his fingers to hug it
Action: jamest_ hugs very, very tightly
<reinhard> ok i am logged in as root
<jamest_> vi /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
<jamest_> then
<jamest_>  /Mouse
<reinhard> i have a "Generic Mouse" and a "Configured Mouse"
<jamest_> on Configured 
<jamest_> you have device set to /dev/psaux?
<jamest_> and protocol set to ?
<reinhard> yes
<reinhard> protocol = "PS/2"
<jamest_> try 
<jamest_> ImPS/2
<jamest_> or
<jamest_> Auto
<jamest_> i think the first may work better
<reinhard> ok
<jamest_> other option I've had luck with is Microsoft on older mice
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> the not so nice thing is that the machine is completely dead when X starts
<reinhard> so i have to reset it every time :(
<jamest_> ouch
<reinhard> in "ServerLayout"
<reinhard> bout "Configured Mouse" and "Generic Mouse" are mentioned
<reinhard> s/bout/both/
<reinhard> is that correct?
<jamest_> yeah
<jamest_> it tries one then the other
<reinhard> ah
<jamest_> if you had keyboard support you could run startx from the console
<reinhard> i'm 100% positive i broke something on accident
<jamest_> ctrl-alt-f1 back to the console
<jamest_> then see what mouse it's actually using
<reinhard> how would i see that?
<reinhard> i have other system from where i can telnet
<jamest_> that's on the console when you startx
<reinhard> oh ah
<jamest_> if you're not using xdm like setup
<reinhard> half an hour ago the mouse didn't work either
<reinhard> but at least it didn't hang
<reinhard> and i could use the keyboard
<reinhard> i guess i must have broken something w/ my first reconfigure
Annik (trilluser@D576875B.kabel.telenet.be) left #gnuenterprise.
<jamest_> then I'd rerun dpkg-reconfigure
<jamest_> i let it manage my x setup
<reinhard> i did that 3 times
<jamest_> but I don't let it put the defaults in
<jamest_> (the last 2 questions IIRC)
<reinhard> and answered every question to my best knowledge
<reinhard> (where my knowledge is not very much anyway)
<jamest_> did you rerun it?
<reinhard> just a sec
<reinhard> i have to wait for the fsck each time
<nickr> c-a-backspace doesn't work?
<reinhard> i think in 2 minutes i will present you the solution

<jamest_> you have to have mx library
<reinhard> ok

<reinhard> do i have to get source?

<reinhard> yeah
<reinhard> my first commit for the python part ;-)
<jamest_> I'm adding the start of the common-techref
<jamest_> so you guys can look and give feedback

<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> what's the debian package name for wxPython?
<jamest_> libwxgtk2.2-python
<jamest_> ok
<jamest_> in common/doc there is a common-techref.lyx file
<reinhard> jamest_: thanks
<jamest_> it won't print worth a damn because something in the newest docbook stuff messed up
Action: reinhard found out the "dpkg -l" command meanwhile :)
<jamest_> but chapter 2 is what I'm thinking about doing 
<jamest_> with maybe an apendix toward the end showing everthing for each class....maybe
<jamest_> if I can get feedback on this I'd appreciate it
<jamest_> btw - i'm not a writer
<jamest_> and I don't take offense at people saying this sucks you need to do something like <foo>
<jcater> jamest_: this sucks... you need to do something like <foo>
<drochaid> jamest_: it sucks ... should I look at whatever doc you're talking about now? ;)
<drochaid> damn .. beaten by jcater
<reinhard> lol
<reinhard> jamest_: not sure if i may dare to ask you this
<reinhard> could you save as text somewhere on ash
<reinhard> i don't have lyx installed
<reinhard> and have had enough fight w/ installing stuff today ;)
<reinhard> not to even mention docbook :)
<reinhard> cool
<reinhard> got gfcvs to run
<jamest_> reinhard you have decent net connection?
<jamest_> apt-get install lyx
<jamest_> and you're done
<jamest_> :)
<reinhard> ok let me try
<reinhard> Sorry, but the following packages have unmet dependencies:
<reinhard>   lyx: Depends: libforms0.89 but it is not installable
<reinhard> E: Sorry, broken packages
<jamest_> ooooo
<jamest_> you don't run non-free then do you?
<reinhard> not sure
<reinhard> probably not
<jamest_> if you're not against it
<jamest_> then just add non-free in your apt-sources lines
<jamest_> example from mine
<jamest_> deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ woody main contrib non-free
<jamest_> reinhard: something else you might want to do
<jamest_> apt-get install netselect
<jamest_> then
<dneighbo> btw: pyxml shouldnt be necessary anymore
<jamest_> netselect-apt woody
<jamest_> which will make a sample sources.list file for you based upon best performing debian mirrors in your area
<jamest_> is there a wysiwyg editor for docbook yet?
<jamest_> or some doc system that doesn't seem to enjoy licking the bag
<reinhard> texin..
<reinhard> oops
<reinhard> didn't want to say
<reinhard> that
<jamest_> lol
<jamest_> i want something where I don't have to program my docs anymore
chillywilly (~danielb@d186.as6.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest_> lyx is fine but my using the docbook document class is kicking my ass as docbook is as stable as derek at an M$ Developers conference
<dneighbo> um
<reinhard> lol
<dneighbo> lyx is just wrong
<dneighbo> i would go texinfo if you cant get docbook to work
<jamest_> and docbook is just shit
<jamest_> :)
<reinhard> huh
Action: reinhard wonders if this is the real dneighbo
<reinhard> ;)
<dneighbo> reinhard i never have had issue with texinfo
<jamest_> docbook tools will not work on solaris after hours of trying
<dneighbo> i offerred to use it over docbook in the very beginning
<jamest_> recent changes in docbook somethings broke the packages docs on ash
<dneighbo> the number one reason i dont like lyx
<dneighbo> is its gui only
<jamest_> and have rendered all my lyx docs based upon docbook useless
<dneighbo> unless of course you are a badass with tex
<dneighbo> there are the issues of non free and using xforms etc but my big gripe is gui only :)
Action: jamest_ is about to use openoffice 
<jamest_> just gots to buy that 512MB of RAM and I'm there
<dneighbo> jamest_ at one time i considered that :)
<dneighbo> its just too hefty a requirement
<dneighbo> im honestly leaning towards going back to texinfo
<dneighbo> it would make fsf very pleased
<dneighbo> and honestly i think it better probably than lyx
<jamest_> i just want wyswyg
<jamest_> that's all 
<dneighbo> and docbook has gotten wierd of late
<jamest_> i don't care what it is as long as I don't have to code it
<dneighbo> i.e. they are changing the style sheets WAY toomuch
<jamest_> i've got more than enough on my plate as it is
<dneighbo> jamest_ honestly i fight like hell to use lyx
<dneighbo> it maybe wysiwyg
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> its like m$ frontpage
<dneighbo> it dont do what the hell you tell it to do
<nickr> the problem is frontpage suckers you into thinking you can make html do exactly what you tell
<dneighbo> one day i spent an hour trying to split bullet list in half w/ new headings
<nickr> it
<nickr> LaTeX is similar
<dneighbo> nickr that is what lyx is
<jamest_> lyx does what I tell it
<nickr> I'm saying its the output formta not the editor
<dneighbo> it tries to SUCKER you into think you can make LaTeX do what you tell it :)
<jamest_> it's docbook support is just broken now
<dneighbo> as long as you are writing docs i wont complain what you do them in :)
<nickr> Lyx does a pretty good job in my experience. Its as WYSIWYG is as you can get wy LaTeX
<jamest_> honestly
<jamest_> i dont' care
Action: jamest_ is just venting at docbook at the moment as all my docs are now broken
<jamest_> i'm about 1/2 tempted to switch the document class to something else in lyx and move on
<jamest_> but i know people wanted docbook (i did original docs in texinfo)
<jamest_> so now I'm asking for a docbook wysiwyg editor
<reinhard> lyx tells me that the document uses the unknown class "docbook-"
<reinhard> something
<jamest_> sigh
<reinhard> but the window ends there in the middle of the word
<jamest_> apt-get install sgmltools-lite docbook-xml
<jamest_> and welcome to hell :)
<chillywilly> hi
<reinhard> actually it's not funny
<reinhard> but at least it's amusing that there are less dependencies to run gnuef than to read it's docs :)
<jamest_> i can convert to text but it's a far from complete document w/ lots of cruft in it
<jamest_> i basically took the forms techref and started hacking
<chillywilly> hmmm, docbook is working here
<chillywilly> but I think I am lucky
<chillywilly> and I agree with dneighbo the style sheet changes lick balls yo

<dneighbo> oddly enough in reviewing your playlists
<dneighbo> no i mean LEGAL music
Nick change: nickr_ -> nickr
<nickr> mp3
<nickr> I don't have a backup archive thats net accessable because my connection is slow
<nickr> dneighbo: what music were you talking about anyway?
<dneighbo> nickr oddly most of your playlist seems palatable
<dneighbo> of stuff i like but dont have
<drochaid> dneighbo: what sorta stuff?
<dneighbo> i was suprised to see some 80s stuff on there 
<nickr> Heh
<nickr> Yea
<dneighbo> well today the one that caught my eye was mexican radio
<dneighbo> i think yesterday was rock me amadeus
<nickr> been hitting the Low-Fidelity Allstars pretty heavily lately
<nickr> yea
<nickr> I like falco :)
<dneighbo> generally what is interesting to me is that his playlist is 50/50
<dneighbo> 50 stuff i like
<dneighbo> 50 stuff i havent heard of

<dneighbo> which means there is probably a lot of 'new' stuff i would like that i just havent heard
<nickr> heh
<dneighbo> if it were 50 i like 50 i dont like etc it would be different story :)
<nickr> most of it is stuff I've never heard of but isn't new
<nickr> just been listening to a lot of random stuff lately
<dneighbo> nickr right
<nickr> I was rather pleased to discover LFA though
<dneighbo> i like to 'expirement' with music
<dneighbo> cool webpage script for playlist
<nickr> thanks 
<nickr> its interesting how it all works
<nickr> the webpage just renders the data

<drochaid> nickr: did you write the playlists web pages yourself, or use something like brunhilde?
<nickr> I wrote it myself
<dneighbo> wow suprised
<dneighbo> i woudl have figured it woudl have been prettied up if you had written it :)
<dneighbo> so unlike nickr to have such basic html (tsk, tsk)
<nickr> drochaid: http://nick.industrialmeats.com/proj/fun-online/playlist.php
<nickr> oh
<nickr> ah
<nickr> yea
<nickr> Heh
<nickr> well its functional, I don't really see how it could be nicer
<dneighbo> i say clean it up make it use .css that is esy to 'skin'
<nickr> Actually I do
<dneighbo> and make a deb for it
<nickr> Heh
<dneighbo> seconds should be formatted to minutes
<nickr> like I said, the way the data gets there is a little weird actually
chillywilly (~danielb@169.207.132.166) joined #gnuenterprise.
<nickr> I have a thing in xmms, the songchange plugin, which runs a script
<dneighbo> the volume xx/xx
<dneighbo> should be a status bar visual
<nickr> each time the song changes, it prepends the songname to the list
<nickr> and chops the list to the rigcht length
<nickr> i then hawe a wholly separate script that runs from cron
<nickr> and it gets the data from the XMMS infopipe plugin
<dneighbo> that does the time
<nickr> fro the 'live' info
<dneighbo> etc
<dneighbo> well its pretty cool
<nickr> Okay
<dneighbo> put it in debian so i get off my butt and set it up 
<nickr> both of these scripts write to a directory that I rsync every minute to my website
<nickr> this also takes care of my webcam and other things that are 'live'
<drochaid> cool playlist nickr ... I like the quote at the bottom :)
<nickr> :)
Nick change: Sacha_away -> SachaS
<dneighbo> well i must run away now
<dneighbo> bbl

<SachaS> hi chillywilly
<nickr> so thats the elaborate mechanism
<nickr> my webcam operates in a similarly obfuscated way
<chillywilly> sup dawg
<chillywilly> why is it that the people that  no me rarely say hi?
<chillywilly> but all the other people who lurk say hi all the time
<chillywilly> am I that repulsive?
<chillywilly> is there something wrong with me?
<drochaid> hi chillywilly ;)
<chillywilly> hi drochaid
<nickr> blah
<chillywilly> Liberty Enterprise Technologies: Bringing business into the digital age
<chillywilly> is this a GNUe approved slogan that I may use without people getting their panties into a bunch?
<nickr> I liked your old slogan
<chillywilly> yea, but people complained
<nickr> "BUY MY SOFTWEH!"
<chillywilly> they made me renig on it
<drochaid> lol
<chillywilly> they claimed it property of GNUe
<chillywilly> so I am being the nice guy and trying to find something else
<chillywilly> nickr: that was never my slogan it was more like "Buy My Software Bitch!"
<chillywilly> as that's more my style
<drochaid> chillywilly: you could always borrow my slogan ... "Scotlands most inovative consultancy" ... but you may need to alter it a bit :)
<nickr> I prefer the 'EAT IT BITCH!' slogan
<chillywilly> eh...
<drochaid> nickr: surely "SUCK IT BITCH!" ?
<drochaid> eat sounds a little ... final
<chillywilly> "buy my services or be damned to the eternal fires of hell"
<nickr> I don't think it refers to quite the same thing
<drochaid> ah
<chillywilly> that should be an eye opener
<chillywilly> what do yall think?
<chillywilly> btw, I am changing up my logo once again
<nickr> thank you
<chillywilly> but I am keeping the 'cliches' nickr
<chillywilly> it's just going to be arranged differently and more colorful
<nickr> ugh.
Action: nickr holds his head.
<chillywilly> you're the only one to complain
<chillywilly> so you have been out voted
Action: chillywilly is away: jamming on my guitar
<nickr> its not my fault your friends have no taste

<ajmitch> what else can i complain about?
<drochaid> or would be if it wasn't for the four machines under my desk
<ajmitch> ah yes, the uni work due soon which i have got to do... ;)
<drochaid> you work for uni? :o
<ajmitch> i wish...
<drochaid> I'm almost certain I didn't do that till my 5th year
<ajmitch> i have a lab report for physics due at 5pm :)
<ajmitch> i'm only in 2nd year
<drochaid> you've got plenty of time then :)
<ajmitch> about 4 hours ;)
<drochaid> hmm ... I'd have though closer to 3 years :)
<drochaid> but that depends on your course length of course
<ajmitch> heh
<drochaid> any biometrics coolies here?
Action: drochaid is thinking that may be a no ...
<drochaid> :(
<nickr> coolie?
<drochaid> people with interest/knowledge of biometrics
Action: nickr has vague sorts of knowledge about it
Action: ajmitch has no knowledge :)
<drochaid> there's two aspects I need pointers to just now ...
<drochaid> 1. manufacturers of biometrics devices [original, not oem]
<drochaid> 2. any projects to use existing hardware with an OS other than windows
<drochaid> for the most common so far, fingerprint scanners, I only know of Identix and Precise Biometrics
<drochaid> both of which only support windows .. of course
<drochaid> and for once this is directly relevant to GNUe [makes a change for me, don't it? :)]
<nickr> hm
<ajmitch> GNUe? we talk about GNUe in here? :)
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> I don't ... other people go off topic and discussit occasionally ;)
