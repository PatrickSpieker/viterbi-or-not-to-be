<Harald1> hi
<chillywilly> howdy
<Harald1> hmm. does anybody know a decent editor under SunOS?
<chillywilly> vi ;)
<chillywilly> doesn't emacs run on SunOS?
<Harald1> chillywilly: yes, but it's not installed. unbelievable. they install a unix-server without emacs! even my windows has it
<Harald1> they = my university
<chillywilly> request that they install emacs ;)
<Harald1> I guess they didn't install it because they use the clients to teach students unix and they want that you use vi 
<chillywilly> oh
Isomer (dahoose@210-86-57-103.jetstart.xtra.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> still they don't know that it is installed
<chillywilly> ;)
<Harald1> and even worse: they teach you java
<chillywilly> yuk
<chillywilly> they should be slapped
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: chillywilly took Java as an elective though
<chillywilly> it was an easy A
<chillywilly> ;P
<Harald1> I only got an B (but the best grade), but we had to use vi...
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> good job :)
<chillywilly> how far along are you in school Harald1
<chillywilly> ?
<Harald1> in my second year of hopefully 4 1/2
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> took me 5 years :->
<Harald1> so you've got a master degree?
<Harald1> where's the | on an american keyboard?

<chillywilly> hmmm, you know it seems that the OMG wants to do the same as what we are trying to do with gnurpc
<chillywilly> er, well at least have ti be an extensible framework
<chillywilly> I submit this same data implies something else. It suggests that the OMG is on the verge of successfully reinventing itself. The OMG has always been about helping companies create and manage distributed systems. Rather than sticking with a single CORBA approach, however, the OMG has had the vision to step back and embrace a new approach that will allow companies not only to use CORBA but also to simultaneously design systems that w
<chillywilly> port all of the other languages and middleware systems they need to support. 
<chillywilly> instead of CORBA they are going UML to code now
<chillywilly> it's wacky shit
<chillywilly> they are adding stuff to UML to help make code generation easier
<chillywilly> this is cool as I always thought the one stop CORBA solution was short sighted
alexey (alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<derek> chillywilly: yeah but using objects + corba adds inches to your penis so it must be good ;)
<jamest> boy
<jamest> i'm glad i don't both corba and object or I'd have to give up wearing shorts
<chillywilly> why do I even bother talking to you people
<jamest> cause we're fun
<jamest> :)
<derek> roflmao
<chillywilly> I was just noting that OMG sees the error of their ways and wants to support more then corba ;)
<drochaid> but anything other than corba would be a liable against object technology

<derek> Blade Director to Adapt 'Akira' For Western Audiences
<derek> MoviesPosted by timothy on Saturday April 13, @10:48AM
<derek> from the no-longer-april-fool's-day dept.
<derek> dswensen writes: "According to the Sci-Fi Channel web site, Steven Norrington (director of Blade) is going to write and direct an adaptation of the classic anime Akira . Norrington says his story 'preserves the tone, the visual and the epic scope of the original, whilst telling a somewhat more accessible story [to Western audiences]." The article doesn't mention whether the adaptation will be animated or live-action. Given Norring
<derek> ack record and the butchery that usually takes place under the guise of making something 'accessible,' it's hard to take this as extraordinarily good news."

I like that this article points out the risks that Microsoft took by trying to enter a field with very established competition (and with mixed results, so far).

<derek> er gack
<derek> i didnt mean to do that
<derek> i meant to paste the article on slashdot about win wifi cards :(
<derek> i.e. first winmodems
<derek> now win wireless
<derek> jamest i really am sorry
Action: derek is secretly jealous that jamest doesnt need corba+objets
<jamest> i was about to kick you
<jamest> as i figured you'd screwed up 
<jamest> and would pop back in :)
<drochaid> win wireless?
<drochaid> still on WEP?
<drochaid> or have they started native ipsec do das yet
<derek> drochaid: it appears tehy are trying to convince wifi card makers
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<derek> to not use those 'expensive' hardware but rather use windows o/s software to control things
<derek> to lower the price to the *consumer*
<derek> i.e. its always about the *consumer* w/ m$
Action: derek is extremely sarcastic this morning
<jamest> didn't mean to ruin your day derek
<jamest> :)
<drochaid> <derek> i.e. its always about the *consumer* w/ m$
<drochaid> well ... that's true derek
<drochaid> just not in the way you meant it :)
<jamest> ooooo
<drochaid> it's all about limiting consumer choice to their own products .. so it IS all about the consumer ;)
<chillywilly> it's about screwing the consumer
<jamest> for those few brave souls that use the new --internal-debugger option on forms/reports/nav
<drochaid> now .. my pizza should be ready, back in a mo
<drochaid> sorry derek :)
<chillywilly> muuwahahhaha
<chillywilly> mmm, pizza
<jamest> if you need to set a breakpoint then you must do two "step" commands first
<chillywilly> that sounds good
<jamest> derek: dcl issue when I closed ticket 19
<jamest> er ticket 1
<jamest> 555 Unsupported option: Enterprise 
<jamest> is printed at top of web page
<derek> hmmmm
<derek> jamest: i think that is an 'email' error
<derek> like the smtp server is not responding to a socket call on 25
<derek> can you see if ash mail server is still functioning correctly?

<Isomer> .
<Isomer> QUIT
<chillywilly> there ya go
<chillywilly> it's going just fine thanks
<Isomer> surprisingly enough, it's only slightly more verbose than the IRC protocol ;)
<chillywilly> :P
<Isomer> :)
<chillywilly> geas needs to speak IRC ;)
<chillywilly> that would be so much fun
<Isomer> mozilla have a great li'l bot
<Isomer> called mozbot from memory
<Isomer> <botbot> SeaMonkey: 'Mac Debug Depend (viper1)' has changed state from Horked to Success.
<chillywilly> horked, heheh
<chillywilly> that's a ren and stimpy word
<derek> ok i bet someones email address is invalid
<Isomer> could have a li'l bot in here that tells you when someone does a CVS commit
<Isomer> and what their log message is
<derek> you said ticket #1 right?
<chillywilly> derek: you are invalid, please authenticate yourself
<Isomer> <gnubot> CVS Commit by jamest: Fixed annoying bug
<Isomer> :)
<chillywilly> it would be more like
<chillywilly> <gnubot> CVS Commit by jcater: syncing machines
<chillywilly> that's like his favorite log message
<chillywilly> ;P
<Isomer> then you slap him around the head to give better commit messages :)
<chillywilly> I dunno wtf it means
Action: Isomer ponders implementing a cvs commit bot for irc
<Isomer> he's commiting on his devel box so he can cvs update on his "test" box
<Isomer> at a guess
<chillywilly> yea
<derek> jamest your close 'worked' on that bug
<derek> so im thinking its an workflow (email) issue
<jamest> i blame the dcl admin
<derek> hmmm i added another item to it and no error
<derek> sa (the admin) had no password
<derek> so its possible perhaps that it tried to 'notify' the admin and barfed
<chillywilly> it's the derek curse
<derek> as i probably created the first ticket in the sa account to test
<chillywilly> that's what I blame
<chillywilly> he touched it
<chillywilly> it went to shit
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> i routed sa to root@gnuenterprise.org
<derek> so let me know if you encounter any more
<chillywilly> derek: you suck
<chillywilly> from now on I am just going to ignore you like you ignor me you freak
<derek> what do you mean?
<derek> where did i ignore you?
<jamest> um
<jamest> we have an admin account with no password?
<chillywilly> did someone say something?
<chillywilly> ;)
<derek> ?
Action: chillywilly throws many fishies at derek
<derek> jamest: is there ANY chance that fsf would put spam assassian or something on their servers?
<derek> as the amount of crap mail coming ot our list is getting unmanageable
<chillywilly> just filter it yourself dude
<jamest> i seriously doubt it
<derek> i.e. im deleting like 5 or so spam mails a day
<derek> chillywilly: you dont get it
<jamest> chillywilly: we are manually
<derek> its not comeing to me
<derek> its coming to the mailing list
<derek> and i am being nice and deleting it for YOU
<derek> and everyone else
<chillywilly> spamassassin should mark it as spam though when you download it
<derek> but its becoming a severe nuisance as mailman doesnt play nice anymorre with browsers
<derek> and im gettinng a boat load of requests to tend to mails that arent approved yet for mailman (as is jamest and jcater i assume)
<chillywilly> I would just let it fly and people will just have to filter their own
<chillywilly> if it that big of a headache
<derek> chillywilly: i somewhat agree, but it makes us look 'unprofessional' that we cant even keep spam off our lists
<jamest> derek: yes, i cannot admin the lists anymore from mozilla or konq
<derek> jamest: i think i learned the trick
<derek> login
<derek> click all as whatever you want them to be
<derek> and hit submit
<chillywilly> well the hurd lists aren't even moderated
<derek> it will just hang
<derek> give it like 30 seconds
<chillywilly> I get lots of crap on them
<derek> then go to the entry bar at top
<derek> and hit enter
<derek> (i.e. like a refresh w/o a repost)
<derek> and it accepts your originall submittal and says all requests processed and they are
<derek> its hokey but its been working
<jamest> cool
<Isomer> recent mozilla's have that fixed I believe
<Isomer> they barf'd on POST's over 10k in size
<chillywilly> ick
<Isomer> http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130301
Action: jamest is away: guests
<Isomer> so grab a nightly and hope for the best :)
<chillywilly> is the debian package fixed?
<chillywilly> 0.9.9-5
<Isomer> I would probably guess not
<Isomer> RC1 should be out in a few days
<Isomer> so wait until then ;)
<jamest> if people find the time I'd really like someone to hammer on forms/designer 
<chillywilly> blah, I'm not going to download mozilla
<jamest> and send me bug reports via dcl (or anyway possible)
<jamest> then after guests leave I'll fix 'em up
<jamest> the bugs not the guests
<derek> im swamped today but you be around a few
<derek> i might have an hour to hammer on it
<chillywilly> seems like everytime I click a tab fucking galeon wants to reload the page
<Isomer> rofl
<derek> jamest: for the record, the reason i find more bugs is i have a bigger hammer
<derek> example:
<derek> http://members.aon.at/cancer/kulturhof/images/hammer.jpg
<chillywilly> ok.....
Action: ra3vat recalls derek offered to send one overseas to him 
<derek> ra3vat: well i would ship a smaller one, as we are cutting costs over here :)
<ra3vat> derek: thanks, i'll let you know when there will be a chance to save on shipping cost also :)
<derek> its amazing what you learn when you read your own press releases :)

<derek> via 3 disk set
<derek> but want to immediately get network card working
<derek> and get it on my network and upgrade to testing for him
<nickr> yuck.
<nickr> you should use woody netinst always
<derek> agree but i dont have disks and burner is busted
<derek> and i am not sure how to do the network card
<nickr> okay
<nickr> er
<nickr> I have no idea of the driver.
<nickr> google search no lucky?

<derek> this give you enough info?
<nickr> ne2k is no good
<nickr> bad bad bad
<jcater> it's not that bad
<nickr> must be a pnp ne2k
<nickr> derek: you should get the 2.4bf disk set for woody
<nickr> that way you have the nifty kernel pnp driver
<derek> um too late
<derek> im already almost done with the potato install
<jcater> is this a new card?
<derek> um no
<derek> old card
<jcater> so he has no idea the irq and base port?
<derek> but i know it was support in red hat 5.2 or 6.0
<derek> as i had it working on that
<nickr> theres no way you can be 'almost done' if you don't have the network working.
<nickr> unless you installed from a CD or someting
<derek> installing from cd
<derek> actually 3 cd's
<jcater> derek: you have the EA201 driver disks?
<derek> that came with it?
<jcater> :
<jcater> :)
<jcater> take that as a no
<derek> or download
<derek> i might
<jcater> That's gonna be the easiest way to get the irq/port settings
<jcater> Do you know if, in rh, it was used in pnp mode?

<derek> brandon might come in and ask for help
<jcater> you trust us w/a friend?
<nickr> wow
<nickr> thats some trust :)
Action: nickr plots
<derek> ok im back
<derek> install is done ready to play network
<derek> anyone still here?
<jcater> I could be
<derek> where should i start
<jcater> are you at the command prompt?
<derek> btw: i have the EA201 ethernet card : drivers and diagnostics disk ver 1
<derek> im at command prompt
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> any chance that disk is bootable?
<derek> nope
<jcater> or do you have an old dos bootable floppy laying around?
<derek> well maybe
<derek> but it says at dos prompt execute:
<derek> yeah i probably have a bootable floppy
<jcater> that'd make things so much easier
<jcater> you'll want to boot up, run the setup program on that floppy
<jcater> disable PNP
<jcater> and select an IRQ and IO Port
<jcater> (it's possible this was done 2 years ago, but we don;t know what they are)
<derek> ok
<derek> rebotting in dos
<derek> er rebooting
<derek> pnp disabled
<derek> full duplex disabled
<derek> interrupt number : 3
<derek> i/o base address 240
<jcater> any particular reason full-duplex is disabled?
<derek> connector type UTP RJ-45
<derek> type ea201
<jcater> are these the existing settings?
<derek> busmode 16-bit
<jcater> or have you changed them?
<derek> jcater: either i changed it cause it caused problems or it was the default :)
<jcater> also, is this the same computer system
<derek> yes
<jcater> or did you swipe this card from another
<jcater> ok
<derek> nope card just sitting in here for 2 years :)
<jcater> just leave everything alone and get back into debian
<jcater> we have what we came for
<derek> ok
<derek> rebooted
<derek> ready to rock and roll
<jcater> go into modconf
<jcater> and find the Network section
<jcater> ...I forget the organization of the potato modconf
<jcater> then select the "ne"
<jcater> when prompted for arguments
<jcater> use
<jcater> io=0x240 irq=3
<derek> sucessful
<derek> lsmod
<derek> ne 6132 0 (unused)
<derek> 8390 5924 [ne]
<derek> so seems to be there
<derek> now what
<jcater> edit /etc/network/interfaces
<jcater> is this a dhcp setup?
<derek> no dhcp
<jcater> you need to add 
<jcater> #iface eth0 inet static
<jcater> #  address 192.168.10.2
<jcater> #  netmask 255.255.255.0
<jcater> (without the # and with the correct data :)
<jcater> plus you'll need to add a nameserver line to /etc/resolv.conf
<jcater> err, how will this be connecting to the internet?
<jcater> is there a gateway/router there?
<jcater> if so, you also need
<jcater>       gateway 192.168.0.x
<jcater> in that /etc/network/interfaces
<jcater> (with the correct value of course :)
<derek> ethernet up
<derek> rock
IsoosI (dahoose@210-86-57-244.jetstart.xtra.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> cool
<derek> having brain damage
<derek> in debian wehre do you setup the gateway?
<jcater> /etc/network/interfaces
<derek> ?
<jcater> err
<derek> that doesnt sound right
<jcater> are you wanting to make this a gateway
<jcater> or point it to a gateway
<derek> no
<derek> wanting to point it to a gateway :)
<jcater> this is my web server's /etc/network/interfaces
<jcater> iface eth0 inet static
<jcater>       address 65.105.10.203
<jcater>       netmask 255.255.255.248
<jcater>       gateway 192.168.0.201
<jcater> so I think that's the right way :)
<jcater> I use dhcp now at home, so that's the nearest example for me
<derek> i got it
<derek> we have net you are god
<derek> can you paste you sources.list here
<derek> as i only have one monitor
<derek> and my laptop isnt debian
<derek> i need to see what an http 
<jcater> yeah
<derek> apt looks like
<jcater> deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian woody main contrib non-free
<jcater> deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US woody/non-US main contrib non-free
<derek> ooo never mind
<derek> ok cool
<derek> they had put commented ones in there
<jcater> ah :)
Action: derek will be back in a while, distupgrade was 238 packages :)
<jcater> ouch
