<derek> anyone here used zsh before?
<nickr> god no
<dtm> lol!
<dtm> nickr: :)
<derek> nickr: why that response?
<dtm> i've used it but only for its 'sh' compatible features
<nickr> Er, I don't know anything about it, really, except that many people who use it are the most annoying kind of zealots imaginable, worse even than OpenBSD zealoots
<derek> rofl
<derek> i have never used it
<derek> i have heard 'interesting' things about it
<derek> specifically its interactive tab complete zen
<derek> which sounds very interesting
<derek> like you do cvs [tab]
<derek> and it lists the options for cvs
<derek> etc
<nickr> bash has that too, its just receently being exploited
<dtm> derek: cool
<dtm> nickr: cool
<dtm> how do you do that shit in bash?
<nickr> bash programmable completion
<nickr> look it up on freshmeat
<derek> i imagine like in zsh you have to put it in your .bashrc files
<derek> but like zsh im sure someone has already done it :)
<nickr> one bowl of Nong Shim does not hae enough calories to sustain me for a day
<derek> and you just download their work and reference it in your bash files?
<nickr> I think so
<nickr> I haven't investigated it
<derek> nickr: oriental food slides through me so fast it cant sustain me for 4 hours
<nickr> It lasted me about 8 hours
<nickr> but this is about 12 hours later :)
<derek> cheap good food that lasts
<derek> chili
<nickr> yea
<nickr> I have chili
<nickr> I'd have to make rice, though
<derek> you can get can of chili like under a buck
<nickr> and I don't feel like it
<derek> and it 'sticks' to da ribs
<nickr> I got a 12 pack of chili at costco
<nickr> 6$
<derek> (and your ass) (so i guess if you factor in toliet paper costs, maybe it aint such a steal)
<nickr> ah, toilet paper, I remember toilet paper
<nickr> comes in rolls ,right?:)
<derek> nickr: if times are tight
<derek> simply subscribe to
<derek> networld, eweek, etc etc (all free zines)
<nickr> hehe
<nickr> yea
<derek> they are glossy enough to not hurt rough enough to get something done
<nickr> or go to McDonalds and buy $1 items and take lots of napkins
<derek> well you could always just try to 'time' bathing and crapping
<nickr> yea
<nickr> thats the best bet, really :)
<nickr> its rather effective in fact
<derek> unless you are the type of geek that only likes to shower once a week
<derek> (as thats a little rough on the bowels)
<chillywilly> you guys are sick
<derek> and i suppose you dont take the kids to the pool?:
<chillywilly> you figured it out?
<chillywilly> ;)
<nickr> Sinec I never go anywhere nor see anyone I shower once every other day, which based on the amount of food I eat is actually a little more often than I need to
<chillywilly> or was it jc that didn't get my expression
<nickr> I should write a paper about my experiences.
<derek> just put it in the journal
<derek> release them as memoirs
<nickr> laugh
<derek> and take it to the bank ;)
<nickr> well I'm way ahead of that

<Yurik> hm
<chillywilly> a way to be middleware agnostic
<chillywilly> and use thier existing framework(s)
<chillywilly> I think they have seen the error of their ways of making CORBA the one stop middleware solution in their standards and went to using UML so as to support multiple middlewares
<chillywilly> I wonder how far along they are in converting all those IDLs of their 'services' and other standards into this UML modeling thing

<Mr_You> re
<nickr> yo
<Mr_You> hmm you should be able to write off GNU software development for tax purposes ;-))
<Mr_You> actually, that sounds like a good idea
<nickr> yea
<nickr> you know, it does
<Mr_You> specially for you guys.. directly with GNU
<nickr> If I actually made money and therefore payed taxes I'm sure it'd be a motivation to work on GNUe more ;)
<Mr_You> heh

<dtm> hi all
<Mr_You> hi 
<jcater> howdy
<dtm> how are yall doin
<Mr_You> not too bad, looks like I'll get a refund ;-)
<Mr_You> BTW, something you might consider next year.. writing off all this time spit on GNU software ;-)
<jcater> gah
<Mr_You> just mentioned it a sec ago
<jcater> me owes lots and lots of money this year
<jcater> I wish I could write of GNUe time
<Mr_You> why can't you?
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> how would I?
<dtm> yeah i'm getting a $3500 IRS refund
<dtm> got my $300+ state refund
<jcater> that's roughly what I owe :)
<Mr_You> somehow tally up all your time, figure a rate for that time, then get GNU Free Softwares tax ID.. should be all you need to do AFAIK
<dtm> so, what's the rough outline procedure for how someone would write off "time" spent on community software development?
<dtm> Mr_You: oh really
<dtm> Mr_You: i would bet the FSF would know exactly how, if anyone
<Mr_You> yeah
<dtm> Mr_You: go axe em:)
<Mr_You> you mean jcater heh
<dtm> yeah.  Mr_You and jcater can go axe the FSF!
<dtm> :)
<Mr_You> I don't have anything to write off, so I wouldn't be asking ;-)
<dtm> i would imagine if that's possible, then it could include a portion of the cost of the computer and ISP
<jcater> hmm
<dtm> maybe even rent and power
<jcater> well, I need to write off $3000
<Mr_You> no way
<dtm> coz that's how it is for a home business
<jcater> and at a rate of $100/hr
<Mr_You> its pretty much your time only..
<jcater> that's only 30 hrs
<jcater> shouldn't be too unreasonable :)
<Mr_You> otherwise GNU FSF would have to be paying for the phone line, etc.
<dtm> Mr_You: ok
<dtm> Mr_You: oh i suppose that's true
<dtm> then you could write those off for sure.
<Mr_You> you can write off those things when you have your own biz
<dtm> yep
<dtm> which i will do
<nickr> moo
<dtm> mewph
<dtm> meow
<Mr_You> hmm I built a custom kernel, and the pcmcia stuff doesn't "kick in" til I eject and insert my card
<nickr> mrow
<dtm> Mr_You: ever?  what if you restart the pcmcia services
<Mr_You> it should start on bootup
<dtm> does it?
<Mr_You> thats the problem.. it doesn't...
<dtm> so try restarting its init script.
<Mr_You> pcmcia services start, just doesn't turn the card on and load the appropriate module.. only when I insert and eject.. so its not doing a "probe" on started.. but why..
<Mr_You> hmm well
<Mr_You> will get to it later if I need.
<Mr_You> might be my modules.conf file
Action: jamest_ is away: sunburnt and sore
Action: jamest_ is back (gone 00:00:04)
<dtm> Mr_You: i am a little too out of sync from being so sedentary!  when that happens, i read things totally jumbled and confabulatory and it surprises me when i finally read it correctly.  I thought for a second or two that you just said "I'll be back later to get weed".
<dtm> that's irritating
<dtm> coz i'm also thinking for a moment "why the *)#& is Mr_You wanting weed, and why is he telling us about it?!"
<Mr_You> I like weed.

<dtm> Mr_You: he's never even going to acknowledge what i said -- see, that's also part of the context of every other discussion in here
<dtm> ;)
<dtm> Mr_You: it's all hot air!!
<derek> as to the the transformatins
<Mr_You> seems wasteful
<derek> the other day on the can i researched what it takes in xslt to do it
<derek> so i think i have a 'strategy' now
<derek> just need to implement
<jcater> cool
<dtm> Mr_You: there should be a process in the web log which interjects such a disclaimer/explanation into every page break ;)
<derek> we have a sick puppy (no not chilly) at the house
<dtm> derek: :(
<derek> so i might have to take him to vet inthe morning in which case i might be able to look at it before work

<jamest_> derek: why are you letting my absence stop you from abusing my baby.....it's never stopped you in the past
<derek> grr woody still has jacked fonts

<derek> jamest_: you remeber thje fix for this
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> "woody" and "jacked" in same sentence does not sound cool
<Mr_You> heh no
<derek> ok fixed
<derek> why does it insist on trying to use a font server
<derek> it NEVER works
<dtm> derek: so i assume that your debian fandom has resulted in some working hosts, right?
<dtm> derek: or are you only uptight over your local workstation
<dtm> derek: seems to me from what i've heard that debian has a _huge_ chasm between stable and unstable
<derek> easiest way to install kde?
<derek> with debian
<dtm> so people stay in a highly unstable limbo
<derek> dtm: well my big problem before on debian was fighting X
<dtm> and are a few notches above Slackware in the extraordinary maintenance issues
<derek> and its not a debian issue
<derek> its my card isnt supported in X
<derek> so i had to 'hack' around it
<dtm> oh that's right, you have a peesea
<derek> that and i had a fried motherboard that i was troubleshooting for a month
<Mr_You> X v4.x seems ok
<dtm> oh yeah.  hack around it except without vnc.  i a'member that.
<derek> so then i had to have a new new computer
<derek> i.e. i maintain 4 computers here at home
<derek> and 4 at work
<dtm> 4 computers at home, wow
<derek> but this configure is for a friend
<dtm> i hope those are generating revenue ;>
<derek> jcater: he is low on memory im thinking kde might be better
<derek> but need to know what the apt get for it is
<derek> ime thinking kword konqueror ---
<derek> i dont know :)

<Mr_You> either way its BSD licensed..

<Mr_You> hi
<neilt> been a bunch of committin going on
<Mr_You> whoo hoo
<neilt> we about to release something?
<Mr_You> man its 7pm.. my reference of time is toast
<neilt> :)
<Mr_You> was workin til 8am this morning
<neilt> i just cam home from real work
<neilt> :(
<neilt> maybe not real
<neilt> but you know what I mean
<brandon> nickr how do i add someone to audio group?
<nickr> adduser user audio
<nickr> then the user has to logout and log back in
<nickr> man
<brandon> how do  you make it so other than root can mount a cd?
<nickr> staring at an orange webpage for a while makes my red recepters tired
<jcater> neilt: yes
<jcater> in the next week, we'll be doing the first release of Reports
<nickr> brandon: if its debian, its already setup, as root make a link frem /dev/whatever to /dev/cdrom
<jcater> plus a maintenance release of common, forms, and designer
<jcater> Some of the commits you see are documentation for Common
<brandon> ?
<jcater> so GEAS can get underway again
<neilt> cool
<nickr> brandon: you need to first identify your cdrom device
<neilt> I wish i had more time to help
<brandon> nickr: grip does all that
<nickr> er
<brandon> im not manually mounting it grip it
<nickr> ah.
<jcater> neilt: it's been a bad winter for all of us
<jcater> not many commits from any of us until recently :(
<neilt> i wish i could see the end
<neilt> but alas it looks like 6 months before i come up for air
<jcater> ouch
<Mr_You> you could try automount also
<Mr_You> which I actually prefer but some do not
<nickr> brandon: grip shouldn't be mounting it
<brandon> in config it has
<brandon> CDRom device /dev/cdrom
<brandon> when i put in a cdrom i do nothing
<brandon> and it shows up in grip
<brandon> mabye debian is just automounting it (not grip)
<brandon> but grip recognizes it on mount or such
<ajmitch> hi all
<jcater> ajmitch: howdy
<neilt> ajmitch: hello
<ajmitch> what's up?
<ajmitch> neilt: i shoudl have time to help with GEAS, i hope :)
<ajmitch> tho i've said that before...
<ajmitch> at least it's getting done in python now ;)
<neilt> yep, thats cool
<neilt> its just sad that it will take a while to get back to working state
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> we'll get it there :)
<neilt> :)
<neilt> someone will have to explain to me how to debug python
<neilt> at least I hope someone will
<neilt> i have a nice gui for C
<neilt> no gui dev environ for python
<Mr_You> I saw some annoucement about a programming IDE not specificly for any language..
<ajmitch> what do you use for C?
<neilt> mac project builder
<ajmitch> ok
<neilt> it uses gcc and jam
<ajmitch> i confess to using emacs for python :)
<ajmitch> but i guess gideon might be usable?
<Mr_You> I could try to track it down if someone is interested.
<neilt> Mr_You: only interested if it is integrated with python
<Mr_You> it indicated it didn't care what environment you were using.. I dunno to what extent that means.

<neilt> etc
<ajmitch> right
<neilt> right not a debugger
<Mr_You> ajmitch: I dunno, ideally you could plug in your own external command line apps no?  ;-)
<Mr_You> lemme look real quick
<jcater>  our GNUe-Common includes a built-in stepping debugger now
<jcater> just run the app with --interactive-debugger
<jcater> e.g.
<jcater> gfclient --interactive-debugger intro.gfgd
<ajmitch> nice
<ajmitch> using pydb?
<neilt> wow
<jcater> ajmitch: yes
<ajmitch> cool

<derek> i think i just cleaned up the key names though

<jcater> argh!
<jcater> anyone know the ./configure options to only compile the postgresql client libs
<jcater> and not the whole damn server?
<jcater> mysql made this easy: --without-server  :)
<jcater> and it makes me sick to have figured out mysql before figuring out postgresql
<jcater> ah, #postgresql is helpful tonight
<jcater> got it figured out
<derek> ive never ever 
<derek> had mouse problems but i cant get a mouse to work on brandons box
<derek> when it was here it worked fine
<derek> ps/2
<derek> he put a ps/2 mouse there after taking it home and it doesnt worka
<derek> anyone have ANY ideas
<derek> why compile it?
<jcater> practicing
<jcater> you running gpm?
<Mr_You> what type of mouse?  maybe different mice protocols?
<derek> acer mouse
Action: derek runs off for a bit
<nickr> could it be that someone is looking into my eyes, some other place, somewhere, some other time
<jcater> nope
<jcater> I don't think that's related to derek's mouse issues
<jcater> but I could be wrong
<nickr> I think that someone is a mous manufactureer
chillywilly (~danielb@d108.as13.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dsmith> hey chillywilly
<chillywilly> hi
<chillywilly> how is everyone?
<nickr> excellente
<jcater> mucho excellente
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> any particular reason?
<chillywilly> or just had a good Lord's day ;)?
<jcater> fresh donuts
<chillywilly> hehe
<nickr> I've been spending all day being creative and not wasting time worrying about stuff
<chillywilly> that's good to hear
<chillywilly> well I have to go upstairs and check something on the winders box
<chillywilly> (turbo tax filing status stuff)
<chillywilly> that I did for crazymike
<chillywilly> ssssh, don't let that out I know it's non-free :(
<chillywilly> oops
<chillywilly> we're logged aren't we?
<chillywilly> crud
<chillywilly> brb
Action: chillywilly is away: hitting the crack pipe
<jcater> I used TaxCut
<jcater> under linux :)
<jcater> (with the help of Win4Lin :)
<dsmith> jcater: tell me more
<jcater> ?
<dsmith> jcater: How hard was is to get taxcut running under win4lin?
<jcater> win4lin gives you a Windows desktop
<jcater> inside an X window
<jcater> I run Quark, MS Office, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, et al under it
<jcater> the install is no different than a Windows box
<dsmith> Ok.
<jcater> you'd click Start | Run... d:\setup
<jcater> it's really nice if you want a linux desktop fulltime
<jcater> but have Windows apps you must have
<jcater> (for work or whatever)
<dsmith> jcater: Do you think Notes would run?
<jcater> The only things known not to work are
<jcater> DirectX and some things that talk directly to hardware
<jcater> I'm pretty sure Notes would run
<dsmith> Hmmm
<jcater> btw, win4lin isn't free software
<jcater> but I was willing to pay the $70 to get away from a windows box
<jcater> of course, I was nervous that it wouldn't deliver
<jcater> but it did
<dsmith> jcater: How does it comepare to vmware?
<jcater> well, the end result looks the same
<jcater> i.e., you have a virtualized win98 session running under linux
<jcater> however, they are different
<jcater> in that vmware is designed to be a generic virtualizer
<jcater> win4lin is specific to win9x
<jcater> I've never used vmware
<dsmith> jcater: The boss uses vmware.  
<jcater> but everyone says the speed is incredibly different
<jcater> supposedly, vmware isn't the fastest kid on the block
<dsmith> heh
<jcater> win4lin flies
<jcater> PLUS
<jcater> win4lin uses your underlying linux filesystem
<jcater> which is much faster than fat32
<jcater> MUCH noticably faster
<jcater> a complete Win98 install took me like 5 minutes
<jcater> on the same machine, installing to a fresh drive (not linux), it took 25-30
<jcater> but the really cool thing
<jcater> is that since the files are literally linux files on a linux file system
<jcater> I can use grep or vi
<jcater> on the same files I use in windows :)
<dsmith> vmware allows the windows "box" to have a diefferent ip address than the Linux one.
<jcater> win4lin gives you two options
<jcater> one is to use Linux's tcp stack
<jcater> which means Network Neighborhood, et al don't work properly
<jcater> but this serves most needs
<jcater> that's what I do at home
<jcater> they also have another mode
<jcater> that actually uses "aliases" which uses a completely different IP address
<jcater> I use that at work
<jcater> and it works well
<jcater> as far as windows is concerned, it has its own network card
<jcater> with its own interface
<jcater> and ip address, etc
<jcater> so you can have it either way
<dsmith> What about video drivers?  Is there a special driver?
<jcater> win4lin comes with a driver for video and network
<jcater> what actually happens is
<jcater> you install win4lin
<jcater> then you put a win98 cd in your drive
<jcater> and "load" this CD
<jcater> then you tell win4lin to install windows
<jcater> and you actually see Microsoft's Windows installer pop up in a screen
<jcater> like it's on a fresh machine
<jcater> but win4lin has added its drivers to window's cab directory
<jcater> so windows sees them as a "plug-n-play" device
<jcater> so never even prompts you
<dsmith> sounds good.
<jcater> and I've never had a windows session crash yet :)
<jcater> I've had windows sessions running (often minimized) for 30 days
<jcater> I've never had a windows box up for that long :)
<jcater> now, I'm running this on an 800Mhz Duron and on a 1.6Ghz Athlon
<jcater> and the windows session is just as responsive as a dedicated install
<jcater> but I don't know what this would look like on a 166Mhz celeron
<jcater> :)
<dsmith> heh
<jcater> I've heard it's still usable
<jcater> but I can't attest to that
<dsmith> well, vmmare is horribly slow.
<jcater> well, vmware is many things
<dsmith> Eats gobs of memeory too.
<jcater> win4lin is very specific
<jcater> it's really hard to compare the two
rdean (rdean@chcgil2-ar2-052-050.chcgil2.dsl.gtei.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jcater> but if you only need a win98 session on your linux box 
<jcater> then win4lin is for you
<jcater> if you are doing low-level OS development, then
<jcater> vmware is for you
<jcater> :)
<jcater> I've been following plex86 (which is a free vmware-like system)
<jcater> but it seems dead
<dsmith> There is bochs too
<jcater> Um
<jcater> I gave up on that
<jcater> I never did get a win98 install completed on that  (with an 800Mhz machine)
<jcater> it was too painful to watch
<dsmith> Is it plex86 of box that's in Debian now?
<jcater> yeah, it's in debian
<dsmith> s/of box/or bochs/
<jcater> plex86 is in debian
<jcater> not sure about bochs
<dsmith> Both
<dsmith> bochs - IA-32 (x86) PC emulator
<dsmith> plex86 - PC virtualization program to run x86 operating systems.
<dsmith> Well, I gotta get back to doing my taxes.  Power supply died right in the middle of running taxcut.
<jcater> ok
<jcater> and for chillywilly:
<jcater> the only reason I use Win98 software
<jcater> is for my Desktop Publishing / Marketing stuff

<chillywilly> hi
<chillywilly> yea, I wish we had better winders emaulation because unfortunately we don't have enough Free Software yet
<chillywilly> and some people just have to use non-free tools
<chillywilly> that's life :(
<ajmitch_> that's what jereon has been fighting a flamewar over on debain-devel :)
<ajmitch_> he was less than diplomatic about a user having problems with vmware
<chillywilly> really now?
<chillywilly> ah, yea
<chillywilly> well you have to have a VERY compelling reason, imho to use non-free software ;)
<ajmitch_> ok
Action: ajmitch_ is using non-free software right now
<chillywilly> somtimes I just say screw it and do things the hard way ;), other times I just want my damn tax return!
<chillywilly> :P

<ajmitch_> i think there's a 4 or 5Mbps dsl connection here anyway
<chillywilly> oh yea , she's got LimeWire going

<chillywilly> heheh
<ajmitch_> evil minds think alike
<chillywilly> now you're talking
<chillywilly> muwahhaahahha
<chillywilly> damn skippy

<ajmitch_> no, cos xchat probably is dropping ctcp ping  :)
<chillywilly> yea, probably
<ajmitch_> check your ctcp replies setup
<chillywilly> do you have a ctcp ping setup in your stsp replies or you let it use the default one?
<ajmitch_> i have one setup
<chillywilly> I have one in there
<chillywilly> just not sure it is right
<ajmitch_> what is it?
<chillywilly> nope, i lied
<chillywilly> I don;t habe one

<ajmitch_> i don't think ssh would slow it down really
<chillywilly> yea
<ajmitch_> since it's about 100ms ping from work to home
<chillywilly> the encrypted tunnel brings the traffic up a bit
<chillywilly> s/encrypted tunnel/encryption/
<ajmitch_> yes i'm using bx

<chillywilly> more packages now it seems

<ajmitch_> instead of waiting an hour for 10mb to d/l
<chillywilly> form your house?
<chillywilly> er, from
<chillywilly> or from where you are at
<ajmitch_> at home
<jcater> derek: what's this about foobulations being a "lame" report?
<chillywilly> well I think I will just let this thing update overnight if it is large
<ajmitch_> here, i could do 400kB/sec if i was allowed to download :)
<chillywilly> rock
<chillywilly> where are you anyway?
<ajmitch_> same place as usual
<ajmitch_> anyway, gotta go, will be back in ~1 hr :)

<dneighbo> this is because he needs to use the spiff function?

<dneighbo> the get next id thing?
<dneighbo> i was going to repsond saying such but wanted to confirm
<jcater> spiff?

<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I've heard once you get into multiple gallons within a few hours

<dneighbo> if it makes you work on gnue
<dneighbo> i dont care how much of it you drink
<dneighbo> in fact, please share with chilly

<jcater> I committed the first code to GNUe Reports on April 11, 2001
<jcater> and it's now April 15, 2002
<chillywilly> weee
<jcater> crap, I should've planned a release on April 10th
<jcater> instead of next week
<chillywilly> that's caroline's birthday
<chillywilly> 4/11
<jcater> that way I couldn't said we released within a year of starting
<dneighbo> hmmm wonder if short year
<jcater> s/couldn't/could've
<dneighbo> maybe could claim w/in 365 days
<dneighbo> jcater: you follow main list

<dneighbo> he got a different mouse (5th one is the charm) and was able to get it to work
<dneighbo> he has xmms working
<dneighbo> cutting his cds to disk via grip and loving linux
Action: dneighbo is so jazzed
<dneighbo> you want to know the FUNNIEST thing
<jcater> cool
<dneighbo> the thing he thought was the coolest about linux
<dneighbo> is that gdm requires you to login
<dneighbo> which means his brother cant login
<jcater> lol
<chillywilly> :)
<dneighbo> when he had windows his brother just hit cancel at the login
<jcater> my brother loves that
<dneighbo> and it logged him in 
<jcater> as his girlfriend can't get in
<chillywilly> who is brandon?
<dneighbo> at first he was kind of amazed
<dneighbo> and kept asking
<dneighbo> so what happens if you forget your password
<dneighbo> etc etc
<dneighbo> i mean a system that actually RESPECTS what you tell it to do
<dneighbo> is a lot to ask
<chillywilly> don't forget it ;).....at least don't forget the root passwd
<dneighbo> chillywilly: one of the kids in my youth group
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> you're corrupting the young now eh?
<dneighbo> i find it odd how God works
<dneighbo> was at a church with several hundred prolly a thousand plus congregration

<dneighbo> started the youth group have like 5 kids
<dneighbo> 3 of which want to be programmers when they grow

<dneighbo> and want to spend weekends hacking and playing games learning linux
<jcater> dneighbo: you are gonna redirect them to more meaningful careers, right?
<dneighbo> well thats whats funny
<dneighbo> is i told them you have to love this
<jcater> like, janitorial stuff, etc
<dneighbo> its not good for the 'money'
<ajmitch> you got them to hack on GNUe yet?
<dneighbo> they all actually like math
<dneighbo> and like computers
<dneighbo> not typical i like computer games and think i can make money mentality
<ajmitch> excellent
<dneighbo> ex: if we put windows on your box you might not be able to do as much with out some help
<dneighbo> etc
<dneighbo> response: cool means i get to learn something new
<dneighbo> get this, he saw me ask questions here
<dneighbo> and his first question was 
<dneighbo> can you put that thing on
<dneighbo> im like what thing
<dneighbo> that thing where you can ask for help, i think im gonna need that
<dneighbo> that thing == xchat
<ajmitch> :)
<dneighbo> nickr: he thinks you are a demi-God
<dneighbo> as he see Linux as == Debian
<dneighbo> and i told him you have written Debian packages
<dneighbo> this is impressive
Action: ajmitch bows down before nickr
Action: jcater kisses the feet of nickr
<dneighbo> ajmitch he makes ngue packages im likely to kiss his feet
<ajmitch> heh
<jcater> speaking of which, how goes dcl packages?
Action: jcater is wanting to upgrade at work, but is waiting until debs are available

<jcater> "You are NOT spending another Friday night on the computer"
<dneighbo> um nickr where are pysablot packages? were you willing to be the maintainer?
<dneighbo> as i will contact the pysablot dude if you are
<jcater> dneighbo: I have them mirrored at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/debian/
<dneighbo> killer
<dneighbo> jcater: do you know if nickr has a gnuenterprise.org address?
<jcater> um
<jcater> I'm not sure
<dneighbo> i.e. is there easy way for you to check
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> it appears he does not
<jcater> dunno if he has a gnue.org or not
<jcater> speaking of which, we need a list of what will need to be moved from goats
<dneighbo> dude someone call 911 i think nickr is away from his term, im getting worried ;)
<jcater> in order for us to merge gnue.org and gnuenterprise.org
<jcater> lol
<ajmitch> ok, which of the work orders on dcl can i work on?
<jcater> ajmitch: any of them assigned to "jcater"
<ajmitch> ok
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> jcater sent mail to pysablot maintainer and cc'd you and jamest
<jcater> ok
<ajmitch> hmm, there's only 4 WO's assigned to jcater
<jcater> this will make 3 abandoned python projects we've taken over
<dneighbo> ajmitch: ok ihave one you can work on
<jcater> if the owner respondes
<ajmitch> dneighbo: yeah?
<dneighbo> that 'biz rule' about jcater never have less than 5 WOs seems broken
<dneighbo> can you fix it ;)
<jcater> dneighbo: I looked into PySablot
<dneighbo> if jcater.wo < 5 then jcater.wo.add = all.wo(random())
<jcater> and the author is active
<dneighbo> what do you mean active?
<jcater> he just started a new Python-related project on sourceforge this month
<ajmitch> hmm
<dneighbo> cool
<jcater> he has half-dozen small python projects
<dneighbo> i am not hoping by the way to 'adopt' this
<dneighbo> i would rather him maintain it :)
<jcater> the latest was related to graph theory or such
<jcater> well, yeah... me too :)
<dneighbo> but im pro adopting it if need be
<dneighbo> what other python packages did we adopt?
<jcater> well, not officially
<dneighbo> at one time we were kind of toying with adopting pyncurses
<jcater> but PyPS (no response from author)
<jcater> and ntssi
Action: ajmitch has no clue with forms/reports codebase :)
<dneighbo> what is PyPS?
<dneighbo> ntssi is the curses thing right?
<jcater> postscript output routines
<jcater> yes
<jcater> is there a cvs command to list each file that's has changes pending on my machine
<jcater> not a cvs diff
<jcater> just a list of files
<ajmitch> cvs status?
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> ah
<jcater> coupled with a grep, that'll work
<jcater> thanks
<jcater> well, the Tylenol PM is kicking in

<dneighbo> what is 'upstream'
<ajmitch> the people who write it
<nickr> and maintain it
<chillywilly> the people that hack on it
<ajmitch> as opposed to 'mere' packagers :)
<dneighbo> license is GPL and copyright is the fellow who wrote it
<dneighbo> ok
<nickr> and who I can blame for bugs
<dneighbo> nickr: i didnt have your email and ihtink i caught you sleeping :)
<dneighbo> basically i sent an email to the developer
<nickr> No, I was chatting up some SI chix
<dneighbo> asking him if he was going to continue its development
<nickr> okay
<dneighbo> and if not would he turn it over to GNUe
<nickr> good
<dneighbo> hopefully i will get an answer withni a few days which will answer your 'upstream' question :)
<nickr> you can claim its GPL and copyright by him, but theres no indication of that in the source package
<dneighbo> i can probably whip together a license and copyright file for him and upload to him a new tar ball
<dneighbo> for release including at least a README ;)

<btami> hi all
<dneighbo> hello
<btami> derek:hello
<btami> do you know is jamest using DCL?
<nickr> chooowda
<dneighbo> um jamest personally ?
<dneighbo> is not (That i am aware)
<btami> i'v sended some little bugfix on forms, dut no response
<dneighbo> jcater and i both have dcl instances for our work environments
<dneighbo> oh
<dneighbo> yes he is a USER of dcl :)
<btami> :9
<btami> :)
Action: dneighbo misunderstood the question
<dneighbo> you will not get a response (if you submitted as guest)
<dneighbo> if you submitted as a logged in user (i dont remember if you have account)
<dneighbo> then you will get email every time he updates or works on the items
<btami> i have
<dneighbo> if you have not received anything it is probbaly he hasnt worked on the items
<dneighbo> OR
<dneighbo> he worked them but did not register timecards against them
<btami> i think he doesn't read DCL :(
<jcater> how long ago did you submit it?
<jcater> as he's been preoccupied
<btami> 10.04
<jcater> April 10?
<jcater> that was only 5 days ago
<btami> sorry :)
<dneighbo> btami im only showing one open 'work order' submitted by you btami 
<dneighbo> and it is assigned to jcater not jamest :)
<btami> this is a timecard for jamest
<btami> timecard=ticket
<btami> sended via email
<dneighbo> hmmm im showing nothing under your account
<dneighbo> but that makes sense
<dneighbo> as if done by email gateway it wont be as you
Action: dneighbo notes thats somethign iw ant to add to gateway
<btami> i can see it in DCL : tickets browse
<dneighbo> yip ticket 19
<btami> yesss
<dneighbo> i mean i cant search by 'opened by btami'
<dneighbo> jcater do you have time today or tonight
<dneighbo> it looks like this is a patch that just needs test and apply
<mdean> that could be done, as long as the From: field matches the email in the personnel table
<dneighbo> if so i will reassign it to you
<dneighbo> mdean : right thats what im thinking
<dneighbo> but it doesnt work that way today right?
<mdean> nope, but it wouldn't be hard to implement, either
<jcater> I don't see a patch
<dneighbo> its in the description (i thought)
<jcater> oh
<jcater> the initFont
<jcater> um
<jcater> btami: what is that initFont doing?
<jcater> setting it to a helvetica type font?
<jcater> that looks like what it's doing
<jcater> if so, have you tried setting fixedWidthFont = 0 in your gnue.conf file?
<jcater> I think this may accomplish the same thing as your patch
<btami> no no no
<btami> MODERN is not working on non US win2k
<btami> but DEFAULT is ok
<dneighbo> mdean : i created a wo for it and will assign to you :)
<dneighbo> btw: you have an issue if we maybe shut down the bug stuff on sourceforge for dcl
<dneighbo> and route to the gnue version of dcl
<dneighbo> or if some more work needs to be done before that can happen thats cool too
<dneighbo> but want to start showcasing the beauty of dcl :)
<mdean> will have to go through it, but would be better to eat own dog food, I guess
<dneighbo> mdean : there are many 'issues' using it for software project (bugs features)
<dneighbo> but despite those its still rather usable
<dneighbo> and with MINIMAL work i think we could overcome the issues
<jcater> btami: that's what happens
<jcater> wxMODERN is a fixed-width font
<jcater> wxDEFAULT is a helvetica font by default
<jcater> have you tried setting fixedWidthFont=0 in gnue.conf
<jcater> and see if the characters are displayed correctly
<btami> yes
<btami> but form is collapsed
<btami> so it was unusable
<jcater> collapsed?
<btami> was not readable
<jcater> is there any chance you could do screen shots
<jcater> 1) with your patch
<jcater> 2) without your patch
<jcater> 3) without your patch w/fixedWidthFont = 0
<jcater> as the patch collapses our forms into a non-fixed width format
<jcater> so we may need to find another solution
<btami> yes, tomorrow
<jcater> cool
<jcater> that would be most helpful
<btami> ok
<btami> but there is another issue
<btami> keyboardEvtHandler
<btami> have you read that?
<btami> in ticket 19 too
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> that is a known issue
<jcater> with an unknown solution :(
<jcater> we're not sure how to handle that at the moment
<btami> there is a solution too
<jcater> which is why we have that simple hack
<jcater> what?
<btami> please read ticket #19 :)
<jcater> oh
<jcater> I misread that
<btami> :)
<jcater> I thought the code was problem code
<jcater> not the actual solution
<jcater> I will at that to CVS right now
<btami> ok
<btami> thanks
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<btami> jcater:can you tell me something your vision 
<btami> on report designer
<btami> i cant imagine how it will work without x,y positioning
<btami> i'v used only fixed pos designers before
<jcater> I've used both
<jcater> and in my experience, the fixed positions are a quick way to generate reports
<jcater> but once you need more than they offer
<jcater> you are kind of stuck
<jcater> btami: I'm looking in UIdriver.keyboardEvtHandler._processEvent
<jcater> and can't quite figure out where the elif goes
<jcater> is it supposed to go here:
<jcater>         if char in string.printable or char == "\n":
<jcater>           action = GFEvent('requestKEYPRESS', char,
<jcater>                          text=char,
<jcater>                          code=event.KeyCode())
<btami> yes
<psu> i have been anti-fixed positioning since before i used a report tool ;-0
<psu> you have exactly the same problem with simple spreadsheet solutions
<nickr> at some point you have to say 'this goes here'
<nickr> but up till that point, imho, you should say 'this is that'
<psu> fundamentally, y-axis absolute pos breaks as soon as you get an extra row of data
<jcater> btami: your patch is in cvs
<psu> so nickr's 'this is that' can only occour
<psu> once you have the data
<btami> jcater:thans
<psu> Really, in this web-based age
<btami> thanks
<psu> the idea of seperating formatting from semantics should be no big deal ;-)
<nickr> er
<nickr> thats what I was advocating. Logical markup over physical.
<jcater> there are instances where physical markup is a necessity
<jcater> i.e., pre-printed forms
<jcater> and i plan to allow for those
<nickr> True. But the data is still logically tagged until you get to the point of the 'form' level
<jcater> but for general reporting, I favor logical over physical
Action: mdean DCCs jcater some donuts...
<jcater> mmmm
<jcater> donuts
<btami> jcater: in the same designer?
<jcater> btami: those would probably be different designer wizards
<jcater> we haven't actually done the designer part yet
<btami> i know :)
<jcater> but I'd imagine you'd pick from a few choices of "types" of reports

<ajmitch> hello
<rdean> dneighbo: mdean resurrected...really?
<rdean> quite the coincidence, because I'm starting to delve into PHP programming (actually, evaluating delving into PHP vs. perl, which I already know)...installed DCL for guidance
<rdean> python's not installed at my ISP, unfortunately

<ajmitch> ah
<ajmitch> forgive my ignorance of certain substances
<dneighbo> man we have some really good psp pages to perform acid tests our mysql server using ltsp.
<dneighbo> where psp sounds like pcp
<dneighbo> acid like acid
<dneighbo> and ltsp like lsd
<rdean> what I'm seeing is that it depends on whether mod_perl is installed, and it rarely is on an ISP

Nick change: dneighbo -> derek
<jcater> derek: not completely
<jcater> btw, I mirrored dcl to ash
<jcater> thought that'd be appropriate seeing as how he's gnue affiliated and all :)
<dnWork> :)
<dnWork> rock
<dnWork> it was on my todo list to add to dcl :)
<dnWork> on the dcl upgrade dont know if mdean told you
<dnWork> but just move your current directory to something else
<chillywilly> sup niggie
<dnWork> untar the tar ball
<dnWork> run all the scripts in upgrade that fall between your release and newest
<dnWork> and you are done
<jcater> cool
<dnWork> only exception is that if you allowed uploaded attachments you will need to move those off some where
<dnWork> and then move them back
<jcater> um
<jcater> what script did I need to modify to point to my database?
<dnWork> mdean suggests making the attachment directory outside the dcl tree so you dont have to toy with it for upgrades
<dnWork> config.php
<dnWork> in dclgw/inc/
<dnWork> iirc
<jcater> ok
<chillywilly> sup dawgs
