<derek> anyone here used zsh before?
<nickr> god no
<dtm> lol!
<dtm> nickr: :)
<derek> nickr: why that response?
<dtm> i've used it but only for its 'sh' compatible features
<nickr> Er, I don't know anything about it, really, except that many people who use it are the most annoying kind of zealots imaginable, worse even than OpenBSD zealoots
<derek> rofl
<derek> i have never used it
<derek> i have heard 'interesting' things about it
<derek> specifically its interactive tab complete zen
<derek> which sounds very interesting
<derek> like you do cvs [tab]
<derek> and it lists the options for cvs
<derek> etc
<nickr> bash has that too, its just receently being exploited
<dtm> derek: cool
<dtm> nickr: cool
<dtm> how do you do that shit in bash?
<nickr> bash programmable completion
<nickr> look it up on freshmeat
<derek> i imagine like in zsh you have to put it in your .bashrc files
<derek> but like zsh im sure someone has already done it :)
<nickr> one bowl of Nong Shim does not hae enough calories to sustain me for a day
<derek> and you just download their work and reference it in your bash files?
<nickr> I think so
<nickr> I haven't investigated it
<derek> nickr: oriental food slides through me so fast it cant sustain me for 4 hours
<nickr> It lasted me about 8 hours
<nickr> but this is about 12 hours later :)
<derek> cheap good food that lasts
<derek> chili
<nickr> yea
<nickr> I have chili
<nickr> I'd have to make rice, though
<derek> you can get can of chili like under a buck
<nickr> and I don't feel like it
<derek> and it 'sticks' to da ribs
<nickr> I got a 12 pack of chili at costco
<nickr> 6$
<derek> (and your ass) (so i guess if you factor in toliet paper costs, maybe it aint such a steal)
<nickr> ah, toilet paper, I remember toilet paper
<nickr> comes in rolls ,right?:)
<derek> nickr: if times are tight
<derek> simply subscribe to
<derek> networld, eweek, etc etc (all free zines)
<nickr> hehe
<nickr> yea
<derek> they are glossy enough to not hurt rough enough to get something done
<nickr> or go to McDonalds and buy $1 items and take lots of napkins
<derek> well you could always just try to 'time' bathing and crapping
<nickr> yea
<nickr> thats the best bet, really :)
<nickr> its rather effective in fact
<derek> unless you are the type of geek that only likes to shower once a week
<derek> (as thats a little rough on the bowels)
<chillywilly> you guys are sick
<derek> and i suppose you dont take the kids to the pool?:
<chillywilly> you figured it out?
<chillywilly> ;)
<nickr> Sinec I never go anywhere nor see anyone I shower once every other day, which based on the amount of food I eat is actually a little more often than I need to
<chillywilly> or was it jc that didn't get my expression
<nickr> I should write a paper about my experiences.
<derek> just put it in the journal
<derek> release them as memoirs
<nickr> laugh
<derek> and take it to the bank ;)
<nickr> well I'm way ahead of that

<Yurik> hm
<chillywilly> a way to be middleware agnostic
<chillywilly> and use thier existing framework(s)
<chillywilly> I think they have seen the error of their ways of making CORBA the one stop middleware solution in their standards and went to using UML so as to support multiple middlewares
<chillywilly> I wonder how far along they are in converting all those IDLs of their 'services' and other standards into this UML modeling thing

<Mr_You> re
<nickr> yo
<Mr_You> hmm you should be able to write off GNU software development for tax purposes ;-))
<Mr_You> actually, that sounds like a good idea
<nickr> yea
<nickr> you know, it does
<Mr_You> specially for you guys.. directly with GNU
<nickr> If I actually made money and therefore payed taxes I'm sure it'd be a motivation to work on GNUe more ;)
<Mr_You> heh

<dtm> hi all
<Mr_You> hi 
<jcater> howdy
<dtm> how are yall doin
<Mr_You> not too bad, looks like I'll get a refund ;-)
<Mr_You> BTW, something you might consider next year.. writing off all this time spit on GNU software ;-)
<jcater> gah
<Mr_You> just mentioned it a sec ago
<jcater> me owes lots and lots of money this year
<jcater> I wish I could write of GNUe time
<Mr_You> why can't you?
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> how would I?
<dtm> yeah i'm getting a $3500 IRS refund
<dtm> got my $300+ state refund
<jcater> that's roughly what I owe :)
<Mr_You> somehow tally up all your time, figure a rate for that time, then get GNU Free Softwares tax ID.. should be all you need to do AFAIK
<dtm> so, what's the rough outline procedure for how someone would write off "time" spent on community software development?
<dtm> Mr_You: oh really
<dtm> Mr_You: i would bet the FSF would know exactly how, if anyone
<Mr_You> yeah
<dtm> Mr_You: go axe em:)
<Mr_You> you mean jcater heh
<dtm> yeah.  Mr_You and jcater can go axe the FSF!
<dtm> :)
<Mr_You> I don't have anything to write off, so I wouldn't be asking ;-)
<dtm> i would imagine if that's possible, then it could include a portion of the cost of the computer and ISP
<jcater> hmm
<dtm> maybe even rent and power
<jcater> well, I need to write off $3000
<Mr_You> no way
<dtm> coz that's how it is for a home business
<jcater> and at a rate of $100/hr
<Mr_You> its pretty much your time only..
<jcater> that's only 30 hrs
<jcater> shouldn't be too unreasonable :)
<Mr_You> otherwise GNU FSF would have to be paying for the phone line, etc.
<dtm> Mr_You: ok
<dtm> Mr_You: oh i suppose that's true
<dtm> then you could write those off for sure.
<Mr_You> you can write off those things when you have your own biz
<dtm> yep
<dtm> which i will do
<nickr> moo
<dtm> mewph
<dtm> meow
<Mr_You> hmm I built a custom kernel, and the pcmcia stuff doesn't "kick in" til I eject and insert my card
<nickr> mrow
<dtm> Mr_You: ever?  what if you restart the pcmcia services
<Mr_You> it should start on bootup
<dtm> does it?
<Mr_You> thats the problem.. it doesn't...
<dtm> so try restarting its init script.
<Mr_You> pcmcia services start, just doesn't turn the card on and load the appropriate module.. only when I insert and eject.. so its not doing a "probe" on started.. but why..
<Mr_You> hmm well
<Mr_You> will get to it later if I need.
<Mr_You> might be my modules.conf file
Action: jamest_ is away: sunburnt and sore
Action: jamest_ is back (gone 00:00:04)
<dtm> Mr_You: i am a little too out of sync from being so sedentary!  when that happens, i read things totally jumbled and confabulatory and it surprises me when i finally read it correctly.  I thought for a second or two that you just said "I'll be back later to get weed".
<dtm> that's irritating
<dtm> coz i'm also thinking for a moment "why the *)#& is Mr_You wanting weed, and why is he telling us about it?!"
<Mr_You> I like weed.

<dtm> Mr_You: he's never even going to acknowledge what i said -- see, that's also part of the context of every other discussion in here
<dtm> ;)
<dtm> Mr_You: it's all hot air!!
<derek> as to the the transformatins
<Mr_You> seems wasteful
<derek> the other day on the can i researched what it takes in xslt to do it
<derek> so i think i have a 'strategy' now
<derek> just need to implement
<jcater> cool
<dtm> Mr_You: there should be a process in the web log which interjects such a disclaimer/explanation into every page break ;)
<derek> we have a sick puppy (no not chilly) at the house
<dtm> derek: :(
<derek> so i might have to take him to vet inthe morning in which case i might be able to look at it before work

<jamest_> derek: why are you letting my absence stop you from abusing my baby.....it's never stopped you in the past
<derek> grr woody still has jacked fonts

<derek> jamest_: you remeber thje fix for this
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> "woody" and "jacked" in same sentence does not sound cool
<Mr_You> heh no
<derek> ok fixed
<derek> why does it insist on trying to use a font server
<derek> it NEVER works
<dtm> derek: so i assume that your debian fandom has resulted in some working hosts, right?
<dtm> derek: or are you only uptight over your local workstation
<dtm> derek: seems to me from what i've heard that debian has a _huge_ chasm between stable and unstable
<derek> easiest way to install kde?
<derek> with debian
<dtm> so people stay in a highly unstable limbo
<derek> dtm: well my big problem before on debian was fighting X
<dtm> and are a few notches above Slackware in the extraordinary maintenance issues
<derek> and its not a debian issue
<derek> its my card isnt supported in X
<derek> so i had to 'hack' around it
<dtm> oh that's right, you have a peesea
<derek> that and i had a fried motherboard that i was troubleshooting for a month
<Mr_You> X v4.x seems ok
<dtm> oh yeah.  hack around it except without vnc.  i a'member that.
<derek> so then i had to have a new new computer
<derek> i.e. i maintain 4 computers here at home
<derek> and 4 at work
<dtm> 4 computers at home, wow
<derek> but this configure is for a friend
<dtm> i hope those are generating revenue ;>
<derek> jcater: he is low on memory im thinking kde might be better
<derek> but need to know what the apt get for it is
<derek> ime thinking kword konqueror ---
<derek> i dont know :)

<Mr_You> either way its BSD licensed..

<Mr_You> hi
<neilt> been a bunch of committin going on
<Mr_You> whoo hoo
<neilt> we about to release something?
<Mr_You> man its 7pm.. my reference of time is toast
<neilt> :)
<Mr_You> was workin til 8am this morning
<neilt> i just cam home from real work
<neilt> :(
<neilt> maybe not real
<neilt> but you know what I mean
<brandon> nickr how do i add someone to audio group?
<nickr> adduser user audio
<nickr> then the user has to logout and log back in
<nickr> man
<brandon> how do  you make it so other than root can mount a cd?
<nickr> staring at an orange webpage for a while makes my red recepters tired
<jcater> neilt: yes
<jcater> in the next week, we'll be doing the first release of Reports
<nickr> brandon: if its debian, its already setup, as root make a link frem /dev/whatever to /dev/cdrom
<jcater> plus a maintenance release of common, forms, and designer
<jcater> Some of the commits you see are documentation for Common
<brandon> ?
<jcater> so GEAS can get underway again
<neilt> cool
<nickr> brandon: you need to first identify your cdrom device
<neilt> I wish i had more time to help
<brandon> nickr: grip does all that
<nickr> er
<brandon> im not manually mounting it grip it
<nickr> ah.
<jcater> neilt: it's been a bad winter for all of us
<jcater> not many commits from any of us until recently :(
<neilt> i wish i could see the end
<neilt> but alas it looks like 6 months before i come up for air
<jcater> ouch
<Mr_You> you could try automount also
<Mr_You> which I actually prefer but some do not
<nickr> brandon: grip shouldn't be mounting it
<brandon> in config it has
<brandon> CDRom device /dev/cdrom
<brandon> when i put in a cdrom i do nothing
<brandon> and it shows up in grip
<brandon> mabye debian is just automounting it (not grip)
<brandon> but grip recognizes it on mount or such
<ajmitch> hi all
<jcater> ajmitch: howdy
<neilt> ajmitch: hello
<ajmitch> what's up?
<ajmitch> neilt: i shoudl have time to help with GEAS, i hope :)
<ajmitch> tho i've said that before...
<ajmitch> at least it's getting done in python now ;)
<neilt> yep, thats cool
<neilt> its just sad that it will take a while to get back to working state
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> we'll get it there :)
<neilt> :)
<neilt> someone will have to explain to me how to debug python
<neilt> at least I hope someone will
<neilt> i have a nice gui for C
<neilt> no gui dev environ for python
<Mr_You> I saw some annoucement about a programming IDE not specificly for any language..
<ajmitch> what do you use for C?
<neilt> mac project builder
<ajmitch> ok
<neilt> it uses gcc and jam
<ajmitch> i confess to using emacs for python :)
<ajmitch> but i guess gideon might be usable?
<Mr_You> I could try to track it down if someone is interested.
<neilt> Mr_You: only interested if it is integrated with python
<Mr_You> it indicated it didn't care what environment you were using.. I dunno to what extent that means.

<neilt> etc
<ajmitch> right
<neilt> right not a debugger
<Mr_You> ajmitch: I dunno, ideally you could plug in your own external command line apps no?  ;-)
<Mr_You> lemme look real quick
<jcater>  our GNUe-Common includes a built-in stepping debugger now
<jcater> just run the app with --interactive-debugger
<jcater> e.g.
<jcater> gfclient --interactive-debugger intro.gfgd
<ajmitch> nice
<ajmitch> using pydb?
<neilt> wow
<jcater> ajmitch: yes
<ajmitch> cool

<derek> um
<derek> if i added it i think i sent it to you in a patch
<derek> i think i just cleaned up the key names though
<derek> didnt add the type
<derek> i have base for some stuff done

<jcater> argh!
<jcater> anyone know the ./configure options to only compile the postgresql client libs
<jcater> and not the whole damn server?
<jcater> mysql made this easy: --without-server  :)
<jcater> and it makes me sick to have figured out mysql before figuring out postgresql
<jcater> ah, #postgresql is helpful tonight
<jcater> got it figured out
<derek> ive never ever 
<derek> had mouse problems but i cant get a mouse to work on brandons box
<derek> when it was here it worked fine
<derek> ps/2
<derek> he put a ps/2 mouse there after taking it home and it doesnt worka
<derek> anyone have ANY ideas
<derek> why compile it?
<jcater> practicing
<jcater> you running gpm?
<Mr_You> what type of mouse?  maybe different mice protocols?
<derek> acer mouse
Action: derek runs off for a bit
<nickr> could it be that someone is looking into my eyes, some other place, somewhere, some other time
<jcater> nope
<jcater> I don't think that's related to derek's mouse issues
<jcater> but I could be wrong
<nickr> I think that someone is a mous manufactureer

<dsmith> hey chillywilly
<chillywilly> hi
<chillywilly> how is everyone?
<nickr> excellente
<jcater> mucho excellente
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> any particular reason?
<chillywilly> or just had a good Lord's day ;)?
<jcater> fresh donuts
<chillywilly> hehe
<nickr> I've been spending all day being creative and not wasting time worrying about stuff
<chillywilly> that's good to hear
<chillywilly> well I have to go upstairs and check something on the winders box
<chillywilly> (turbo tax filing status stuff)
<chillywilly> that I did for crazymike
<chillywilly> ssssh, don't let that out I know it's non-free :(
<chillywilly> oops
<chillywilly> we're logged aren't we?
<chillywilly> crud
<chillywilly> brb
Action: chillywilly is away: hitting the crack pipe
<jcater> I used TaxCut
<jcater> under linux :)
<jcater> (with the help of Win4Lin :)
<dsmith> jcater: tell me more
<jcater> ?
<dsmith> jcater: How hard was is to get taxcut running under win4lin?
<jcater> win4lin gives you a Windows desktop
<jcater> inside an X window
<jcater> I run Quark, MS Office, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, et al under it
<jcater> the install is no different than a Windows box
<dsmith> Ok.
<jcater> you'd click Start | Run... d:\setup
<jcater> it's really nice if you want a linux desktop fulltime
<jcater> but have Windows apps you must have
<jcater> (for work or whatever)
<dsmith> jcater: Do you think Notes would run?
<jcater> The only things known not to work are
<jcater> DirectX and some things that talk directly to hardware
<jcater> I'm pretty sure Notes would run
<dsmith> Hmmm
<jcater> btw, win4lin isn't free software
<jcater> but I was willing to pay the $70 to get away from a windows box
<jcater> of course, I was nervous that it wouldn't deliver
<jcater> but it did
<dsmith> jcater: How does it comepare to vmware?
<jcater> well, the end result looks the same
<jcater> i.e., you have a virtualized win98 session running under linux
<jcater> however, they are different
<jcater> in that vmware is designed to be a generic virtualizer
<jcater> win4lin is specific to win9x
<jcater> I've never used vmware
<dsmith> jcater: The boss uses vmware.  
<jcater> but everyone says the speed is incredibly different
<jcater> supposedly, vmware isn't the fastest kid on the block
<dsmith> heh
<jcater> win4lin flies
<jcater> PLUS
<jcater> win4lin uses your underlying linux filesystem
<jcater> which is much faster than fat32
<jcater> MUCH noticably faster
<jcater> a complete Win98 install took me like 5 minutes
<jcater> on the same machine, installing to a fresh drive (not linux), it took 25-30
<jcater> but the really cool thing
<jcater> is that since the files are literally linux files on a linux file system
<jcater> I can use grep or vi
<jcater> on the same files I use in windows :)
<dsmith> vmware allows the windows "box" to have a diefferent ip address than the Linux one.
<jcater> win4lin gives you two options
<jcater> one is to use Linux's tcp stack
<jcater> which means Network Neighborhood, et al don't work properly
<jcater> but this serves most needs
<jcater> that's what I do at home
<jcater> they also have another mode
<jcater> that actually uses "aliases" which uses a completely different IP address
<jcater> I use that at work
<jcater> and it works well
<jcater> as far as windows is concerned, it has its own network card
<jcater> with its own interface
<jcater> and ip address, etc
<jcater> so you can have it either way
<dsmith> What about video drivers?  Is there a special driver?
<jcater> win4lin comes with a driver for video and network
<jcater> what actually happens is
<jcater> you install win4lin
<jcater> then you put a win98 cd in your drive
<jcater> and "load" this CD
<jcater> then you tell win4lin to install windows
<jcater> and you actually see Microsoft's Windows installer pop up in a screen
<jcater> like it's on a fresh machine
<jcater> but win4lin has added its drivers to window's cab directory
<jcater> so windows sees them as a "plug-n-play" device
<jcater> so never even prompts you
<dsmith> sounds good.
<jcater> and I've never had a windows session crash yet :)
<jcater> I've had windows sessions running (often minimized) for 30 days
<jcater> I've never had a windows box up for that long :)
<jcater> now, I'm running this on an 800Mhz Duron and on a 1.6Ghz Athlon
<jcater> and the windows session is just as responsive as a dedicated install
<jcater> but I don't know what this would look like on a 166Mhz celeron
<jcater> :)
<dsmith> heh
<jcater> I've heard it's still usable
<jcater> but I can't attest to that
<dsmith> well, vmmare is horribly slow.
<jcater> well, vmware is many things
<dsmith> Eats gobs of memeory too.
<jcater> win4lin is very specific
<jcater> it's really hard to compare the two
rdean (rdean@chcgil2-ar2-052-050.chcgil2.dsl.gtei.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jcater> but if you only need a win98 session on your linux box 
<jcater> then win4lin is for you
<jcater> if you are doing low-level OS development, then
<jcater> vmware is for you
<jcater> :)
<jcater> I've been following plex86 (which is a free vmware-like system)
<jcater> but it seems dead
<dsmith> There is bochs too
<jcater> Um
<jcater> I gave up on that
<jcater> I never did get a win98 install completed on that  (with an 800Mhz machine)
<jcater> it was too painful to watch
<dsmith> Is it plex86 of box that's in Debian now?
<jcater> yeah, it's in debian
<dsmith> s/of box/or bochs/
<jcater> plex86 is in debian
<jcater> not sure about bochs
<dsmith> Both
<dsmith> bochs - IA-32 (x86) PC emulator
<dsmith> plex86 - PC virtualization program to run x86 operating systems.
<dsmith> Well, I gotta get back to doing my taxes.  Power supply died right in the middle of running taxcut.
<jcater> ok
<jcater> and for chillywilly:
<jcater> the only reason I use Win98 software
<jcater> is for my Desktop Publishing / Marketing stuff

<ajmitch_> hey chillywilly 
<chillywilly> hi
<chillywilly> yea, I wish we had better winders emaulation because unfortunately we don't have enough Free Software yet
<chillywilly> and some people just have to use non-free tools
<chillywilly> that's life :(
<ajmitch_> that's what jereon has been fighting a flamewar over on debain-devel :)
<ajmitch_> he was less than diplomatic about a user having problems with vmware
<chillywilly> really now?
<chillywilly> ah, yea
<chillywilly> well you have to have a VERY compelling reason, imho to use non-free software ;)
<ajmitch_> ok
Action: ajmitch_ is using non-free software right now
<chillywilly> somtimes I just say screw it and do things the hard way ;), other times I just want my damn tax return!
<chillywilly> :P
Action: ajmitch_ is using windows ME at the moment
<chillywilly> for work?
<ajmitch_> yep
<ajmitch_> editing stuff in vim using putty for my ssh connection
<ajmitch_> when you gonna work on geas, eh?
<chillywilly> heh, who says I haven't been?
<chillywilly> I got a big ol' outline.txt file baby

<chillywilly> seems slow anyway
<ajmitch_> works fine from here :)
<chillywilly> well my sister might be slurping mp3s
<ajmitch_> i think there's a 4 or 5Mbps dsl connection here anyway
<chillywilly> oh yea , she's got LimeWire going
<ajmitch_> block it with iptables
Action: chillywilly should block the port ;)
<chillywilly> heheh
<ajmitch_> evil minds think alike
<chillywilly> now you're talking
<chillywilly> muwahhaahahha
<chillywilly> damn skippy
<chillywilly> I think it uses 4169

<ajmitch_> no, cos xchat probably is dropping ctcp ping  :)
<chillywilly> yea, probably
<ajmitch_> check your ctcp replies setup
<chillywilly> do you have a ctcp ping setup in your stsp replies or you let it use the default one?
<ajmitch_> i have one setup
<chillywilly> I have one in there
<chillywilly> just not sure it is right
<ajmitch_> what is it?
<chillywilly> nope, i lied
<chillywilly> I don;t habe one
<chillywilly> er, have
<chillywilly> what's yours look like?

<ajmitch_> i don't think ssh would slow it down really
<chillywilly> yea
<ajmitch_> since it's about 100ms ping from work to home
<chillywilly> the encrypted tunnel brings the traffic up a bit
<chillywilly> s/encrypted tunnel/encryption/
<ajmitch_> yes i'm using bx
<chillywilly> k
<chillywilly> not that it matters
<chillywilly> I just thought I would return the favor
<chillywilly> and probe you back

Action: chillywilly wonders if he can ever catch up
<chillywilly> with the debian upgrade
<chillywilly> more packages now it seems
<ajmitch_> dunno, i've got the latest packages but they're not installed
<ajmitch_> i can now update everything within a day ;)
<ajmitch_> instead of waiting an hour for 10mb to d/l
<chillywilly> form your house?
<chillywilly> er, from
<chillywilly> or from where you are at
<ajmitch_> at home
<jcater> derek: what's this about foobulations being a "lame" report?
<chillywilly> well I think I will just let this thing update overnight if it is large
<ajmitch_> here, i could do 400kB/sec if i was allowed to download :)
<chillywilly> rock
<chillywilly> where are you anyway?
<ajmitch_> same place as usual
<ajmitch_> anyway, gotta go, will be back in ~1 hr :)
<chillywilly> k
<chillywilly> anyone know what ports limewire uses?
<chillywilly> my connection is too lagged to look at their web site :-/

<dneighbo> this is because he needs to use the spiff function?
<dneighbo> that doesnt exist for mysql?
<dneighbo> the get next id thing?
<dneighbo> i was going to repsond saying such but wanted to confirm
<jcater> spiff?
<dneighbo> i am thinking we might want to change the 'master/detail' wizard
<dneighbo> to allow this to be auto created (the function) as an option

<jcater> dneighbo: not a bad idea
