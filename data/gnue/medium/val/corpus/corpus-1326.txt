<chillywilly> no
<chillywilly> it all deoends I guess on how much of that you drink
<chillywilly> er, depends
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I've heard once you get into multiple gallons within a few hours
<jcater> can be lethargic
<dneighbo> if it makes you work on gnue
<dneighbo> i dont care how much of it you drink
<dneighbo> in fact, please share with chilly
<jcater> does not "make" me work on gnue
<jcater> it makes work on gnue tolerable
<dneighbo> roflmao
<jcater> argh
<jcater> I committed the first code to GNUe Reports on April 11, 2001
<jcater> and it's now April 15, 2002
<chillywilly> weee
<jcater> crap, I should've planned a release on April 10th
<jcater> instead of next week
<chillywilly> that's caroline's birthday
<chillywilly> 4/11
<jcater> that way I couldn't said we released within a year of starting
<dneighbo> hmmm wonder if short year
<jcater> s/couldn't/could've
<dneighbo> maybe could claim w/in 365 days
<dneighbo> jcater: you follow main list
<jcater> main list of what?
<dneighbo> someone sent some compiere stuff to the list (todd)
<jcater> yeah, saw that
<dneighbo> and cc'd sql*ledger
<dneighbo> and sql*ledger guy replie
<jcater> oh, didn't catch that
<dneighbo> d
<dneighbo> i sent a lengthy reply
<dneighbo> btw: praise report
<dneighbo> brandon in playing around got his mouse to work :)
<dneighbo> he got a different mouse (5th one is the charm) and was able to get it to work
<dneighbo> he has xmms working
<dneighbo> cutting his cds to disk via grip and loving linux
Action: dneighbo is so jazzed
<dneighbo> you want to know the FUNNIEST thing
<jcater> cool
<dneighbo> the thing he thought was the coolest about linux
<dneighbo> is that gdm requires you to login
<dneighbo> which means his brother cant login
<jcater> lol
<chillywilly> :)
<dneighbo> when he had windows his brother just hit cancel at the login
<jcater> my brother loves that
<dneighbo> and it logged him in 
<jcater> as his girlfriend can't get in
<chillywilly> who is brandon?
<dneighbo> at first he was kind of amazed
<dneighbo> and kept asking
<dneighbo> so what happens if you forget your password
<dneighbo> etc etc
<dneighbo> i mean a system that actually RESPECTS what you tell it to do
<dneighbo> is a lot to ask
<chillywilly> don't forget it ;).....at least don't forget the root passwd
<dneighbo> chillywilly: one of the kids in my youth group
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> you're corrupting the young now eh?
<dneighbo> i find it odd how God works
<dneighbo> was at a church with several hundred prolly a thousand plus congregration
<dneighbo> with hundred or so youth
<dneighbo> always tried to fit in an never could
Action: ajmitch here
<dneighbo> come to a church with maybe 50 poeple
<dneighbo> started the youth group have like 5 kids
<dneighbo> 3 of which want to be programmers when they grow
<ajmitch> :)
<dneighbo> and want to spend weekends hacking and playing games learning linux
<jcater> dneighbo: you are gonna redirect them to more meaningful careers, right?
<dneighbo> well thats whats funny
<dneighbo> is i told them you have to love this
<jcater> like, janitorial stuff, etc
<dneighbo> its not good for the 'money'
<ajmitch> you got them to hack on GNUe yet?
<dneighbo> they all actually like math
<dneighbo> and like computers
<dneighbo> not typical i like computer games and think i can make money mentality
<ajmitch> excellent
<dneighbo> ex: if we put windows on your box you might not be able to do as much with out some help
<dneighbo> etc
<dneighbo> response: cool means i get to learn something new
<dneighbo> get this, he saw me ask questions here
<dneighbo> and his first question was 
<dneighbo> can you put that thing on
<dneighbo> im like what thing
<dneighbo> that thing where you can ask for help, i think im gonna need that
<dneighbo> that thing == xchat
<ajmitch> :)
<dneighbo> nickr: he thinks you are a demi-God
<dneighbo> as he see Linux as == Debian
<dneighbo> and i told him you have written Debian packages
<dneighbo> this is impressive
Action: ajmitch bows down before nickr
Action: jcater kisses the feet of nickr
<dneighbo> ajmitch he makes ngue packages im likely to kiss his feet
<ajmitch> heh
<jcater> speaking of which, how goes dcl packages?
Action: jcater is wanting to upgrade at work, but is waiting until debs are available
<ajmitch> ask jbailey
<ajmitch> haven't seen him around for a little while
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> "marriage" must be kicking in
<ajmitch> hehe
<jcater> "You are NOT spending another Friday night on the computer"
<dneighbo> um nickr where are pysablot packages? were you willing to be the maintainer?
<dneighbo> as i will contact the pysablot dude if you are
<jcater> dneighbo: I have them mirrored at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/debian/
<dneighbo> killer
<dneighbo> jcater: do you know if nickr has a gnuenterprise.org address?
<jcater> um
<jcater> I'm not sure
<dneighbo> i.e. is there easy way for you to check
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> it appears he does not
<jcater> dunno if he has a gnue.org or not
<jcater> speaking of which, we need a list of what will need to be moved from goats
<dneighbo> dude someone call 911 i think nickr is away from his term, im getting worried ;)
<jcater> in order for us to merge gnue.org and gnuenterprise.org
<jcater> lol
<ajmitch> ok, which of the work orders on dcl can i work on?
<jcater> ajmitch: any of them assigned to "jcater"
<ajmitch> ok
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> jcater sent mail to pysablot maintainer and cc'd you and jamest
<jcater> ok
<ajmitch> hmm, there's only 4 WO's assigned to jcater
<jcater> this will make 3 abandoned python projects we've taken over
<dneighbo> ajmitch: ok ihave one you can work on
<jcater> if the owner respondes
<ajmitch> dneighbo: yeah?
<dneighbo> that 'biz rule' about jcater never have less than 5 WOs seems broken
<dneighbo> can you fix it ;)
<jcater> dneighbo: I looked into PySablot
<dneighbo> if jcater.wo < 5 then jcater.wo.add = all.wo(random())
<jcater> and the author is active
<dneighbo> what do you mean active?
<jcater> he just started a new Python-related project on sourceforge this month
<ajmitch> hmm
<dneighbo> cool
<jcater> he has half-dozen small python projects
<dneighbo> i am not hoping by the way to 'adopt' this
<dneighbo> i would rather him maintain it :)
<jcater> the latest was related to graph theory or such
<jcater> well, yeah... me too :)
<dneighbo> but im pro adopting it if need be
<dneighbo> what other python packages did we adopt?
<jcater> well, not officially
<dneighbo> at one time we were kind of toying with adopting pyncurses
<jcater> but PyPS (no response from author)
<jcater> and ntssi
Action: ajmitch has no clue with forms/reports codebase :)
<dneighbo> what is PyPS?
<dneighbo> ntssi is the curses thing right?
<jcater> postscript output routines
<jcater> yes
<jcater> is there a cvs command to list each file that's has changes pending on my machine
<jcater> not a cvs diff
<jcater> just a list of files
<ajmitch> cvs status?
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> ah
<jcater> coupled with a grep, that'll work
<jcater> thanks
<jcater> well, the Tylenol PM is kicking in

<nickr> dneighbo: I'm willing to maintain pysablot if there is ubstream and docs and a copyright and a license
<dneighbo> what is 'upstream'
<ajmitch> the people who write it
<nickr> and maintain it
<chillywilly> the people that hack on it
<ajmitch> as opposed to 'mere' packagers :)
<dneighbo> license is GPL and copyright is the fellow who wrote it
<dneighbo> ok
<nickr> and who I can blame for bugs
<dneighbo> nickr: i didnt have your email and ihtink i caught you sleeping :)
<dneighbo> basically i sent an email to the developer
<nickr> No, I was chatting up some SI chix
<dneighbo> asking him if he was going to continue its development
<nickr> okay
<dneighbo> and if not would he turn it over to GNUe
<nickr> good
<dneighbo> hopefully i will get an answer withni a few days which will answer your 'upstream' question :)
<nickr> you can claim its GPL and copyright by him, but theres no indication of that in the source package
<dneighbo> i can probably whip together a license and copyright file for him and upload to him a new tar ball
<dneighbo> for release including at least a README ;)
<ajmitch> heh
<dneighbo> and maybe even a simple doc :)

<nickr> dneighbo: this evil project I've been doing
<nickr> I'm so tired of it
<nickr> I just can't bring myself to do the simplest things on it

<ajmitch> nickr: i understand totally, i've got the same prob

<nickr> Put em on the page!
<chillywilly> do it then

<ajmitch> cos if he doesn't do pkgs, someone else would have to :)
<chillywilly> bah, he knows I love him
<chillywilly> and this is why I can tell him to stop whining

<nickr> hehe

<nickr> its annoying.

<dneighbo> i hope to get that cleaned up
<dneighbo> yeah to static but its all using pysablot so we can do inline
<dneighbo> eventually
<dneighbo> we figured start small
<dneighbo> file to file
<dneighbo> and build up to stream to stream
<dneighbo> jcater has it working
<dneighbo> so you can generate report and have it save to file
<dneighbo> print to printer
<dneighbo> email file
<dneighbo> or fax file
<dneighbo> i.e. so reports support output of

<btami> hi all
<dneighbo> hello
<btami> derek:hello
<btami> do you know is jamest using DCL?
<nickr> chooowda
<dneighbo> um jamest personally ?
<dneighbo> is not (That i am aware)
<btami> i'v sended some little bugfix on forms, dut no response
<dneighbo> jcater and i both have dcl instances for our work environments
<dneighbo> oh
<dneighbo> yes he is a USER of dcl :)
<btami> :9
<btami> :)
Action: dneighbo misunderstood the question
<dneighbo> you will not get a response (if you submitted as guest)
<dneighbo> if you submitted as a logged in user (i dont remember if you have account)
<dneighbo> then you will get email every time he updates or works on the items
<btami> i have
<dneighbo> if you have not received anything it is probbaly he hasnt worked on the items
<dneighbo> OR
<dneighbo> he worked them but did not register timecards against them
<btami> i think he doesn't read DCL :(
<jcater> how long ago did you submit it?
<jcater> as he's been preoccupied
<btami> 10.04
<jcater> April 10?
<jcater> that was only 5 days ago
<btami> sorry :)
<dneighbo> btami im only showing one open 'work order' submitted by you btami 
<dneighbo> and it is assigned to jcater not jamest :)
<btami> this is a timecard for jamest
<btami> timecard=ticket
<btami> sended via email
<dneighbo> hmmm im showing nothing under your account
<dneighbo> but that makes sense
<dneighbo> as if done by email gateway it wont be as you
Action: dneighbo notes thats somethign iw ant to add to gateway
<btami> i can see it in DCL : tickets browse
<dneighbo> yip ticket 19
<btami> yesss
<dneighbo> i mean i cant search by 'opened by btami'
<dneighbo> jcater do you have time today or tonight
<dneighbo> it looks like this is a patch that just needs test and apply
<mdean> that could be done, as long as the From: field matches the email in the personnel table
<dneighbo> if so i will reassign it to you
<dneighbo> mdean : right thats what im thinking
<dneighbo> but it doesnt work that way today right?
<mdean> nope, but it wouldn't be hard to implement, either
<jcater> I don't see a patch
<dneighbo> its in the description (i thought)
<jcater> oh
<jcater> the initFont
<jcater> um
<jcater> btami: what is that initFont doing?
<jcater> setting it to a helvetica type font?
<jcater> that looks like what it's doing
<jcater> if so, have you tried setting fixedWidthFont = 0 in your gnue.conf file?
<jcater> I think this may accomplish the same thing as your patch
<btami> no no no
<btami> MODERN is not working on non US win2k
<btami> but DEFAULT is ok
<dneighbo> mdean : i created a wo for it and will assign to you :)
<dneighbo> btw: you have an issue if we maybe shut down the bug stuff on sourceforge for dcl
<dneighbo> and route to the gnue version of dcl
<dneighbo> or if some more work needs to be done before that can happen thats cool too
<dneighbo> but want to start showcasing the beauty of dcl :)
<mdean> will have to go through it, but would be better to eat own dog food, I guess
<dneighbo> mdean : there are many 'issues' using it for software project (bugs features)
<dneighbo> but despite those its still rather usable
<dneighbo> and with MINIMAL work i think we could overcome the issues
<jcater> btami: that's what happens
<jcater> wxMODERN is a fixed-width font
<jcater> wxDEFAULT is a helvetica font by default
<jcater> have you tried setting fixedWidthFont=0 in gnue.conf
<jcater> and see if the characters are displayed correctly
<btami> yes
<btami> but form is collapsed
<btami> so it was unusable
<jcater> collapsed?
<btami> was not readable
<jcater> is there any chance you could do screen shots
<jcater> 1) with your patch
<jcater> 2) without your patch
<jcater> 3) without your patch w/fixedWidthFont = 0
<jcater> as the patch collapses our forms into a non-fixed width format
<jcater> so we may need to find another solution
<btami> yes, tomorrow
<jcater> cool
<jcater> that would be most helpful
<btami> ok
<btami> but there is another issue
<btami> keyboardEvtHandler
<btami> have you read that?
<btami> in ticket 19 too
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> that is a known issue
<jcater> with an unknown solution :(
<jcater> we're not sure how to handle that at the moment
<btami> there is a solution too
<jcater> which is why we have that simple hack
<jcater> what?
<btami> please read ticket #19 :)
<jcater> oh
<jcater> I misread that
<btami> :)
<jcater> I thought the code was problem code
<jcater> not the actual solution
<jcater> I will at that to CVS right now
<btami> ok
<btami> thanks
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<btami> jcater:can you tell me something your vision 
<btami> on report designer
<btami> i cant imagine how it will work without x,y positioning
<btami> i'v used only fixed pos designers before
<jcater> I've used both
<jcater> and in my experience, the fixed positions are a quick way to generate reports
<jcater> but once you need more than they offer
<jcater> you are kind of stuck
<jcater> btami: I'm looking in UIdriver.keyboardEvtHandler._processEvent
<jcater> and can't quite figure out where the elif goes
<jcater> is it supposed to go here:
<jcater>         if char in string.printable or char == "\n":
<jcater>           action = GFEvent('requestKEYPRESS', char,
<jcater>                          text=char,
<jcater>                          code=event.KeyCode())
<btami> yes
<psu> i have been anti-fixed positioning since before i used a report tool ;-0
<psu> you have exactly the same problem with simple spreadsheet solutions
<nickr> at some point you have to say 'this goes here'
<nickr> but up till that point, imho, you should say 'this is that'
<psu> fundamentally, y-axis absolute pos breaks as soon as you get an extra row of data
<jcater> btami: your patch is in cvs
<psu> so nickr's 'this is that' can only occour
<psu> once you have the data
<btami> jcater:thans
<psu> Really, in this web-based age
<btami> thanks
<psu> the idea of seperating formatting from semantics should be no big deal ;-)
<nickr> er
<nickr> thats what I was advocating. Logical markup over physical.
<jcater> there are instances where physical markup is a necessity
<jcater> i.e., pre-printed forms
<jcater> and i plan to allow for those
<nickr> True. But the data is still logically tagged until you get to the point of the 'form' level
<jcater> but for general reporting, I favor logical over physical
Action: mdean DCCs jcater some donuts...
<jcater> mmmm
<jcater> donuts
<btami> jcater: in the same designer?
<jcater> btami: those would probably be different designer wizards
<jcater> we haven't actually done the designer part yet
<btami> i know :)
<jcater> but I'd imagine you'd pick from a few choices of "types" of reports

<dneighbo> rdean strange miracle but today mdean was resurrected
<chillywilly> ello dneighbo
<chillywilly> rdean
<dneighbo> hi
<dneighbo> i seem to be short $1,484,854 think anyone will notice?
<chillywilly> uh, probably ;)
<chillywilly> dude, I have come to the conclusion that our service manager is a jag off
<chillywilly> and should be troutslapped immediately
<chillywilly> do not pass 'go'
<chillywilly> do not collect $100
<ajmitch> hello
<rdean> dneighbo: mdean resurrected...really?
<rdean> quite the coincidence, because I'm starting to delve into PHP programming (actually, evaluating delving into PHP vs. perl, which I already know)...installed DCL for guidance
<rdean> python's not installed at my ISP, unfortunately
<chillywilly> bastards
<dneighbo> um for web stuff i think you will be better off with php over perl (imho)
<chillywilly> psp man
<chillywilly> ;)
<ajmitch> isn't that some drug?
<chillywilly> that's pcp
<dneighbo> ajmitch a goofy sentence
<ajmitch> ah
<ajmitch> forgive my ignorance of certain substances
<dneighbo> man we have some really good psp pages to perform acid tests our mysql server using ltsp.
<dneighbo> where psp sounds like pcp
<dneighbo> acid like acid
<dneighbo> and ltsp like lsd
<rdean> what I'm seeing is that it depends on whether mod_perl is installed, and it rarely is on an ISP
<dneighbo> some poor sixities hippie might read that sentence and ask, why am in not in teh comuter business :)
<chillywilly> bidness yo
<chillywilly> cause he need to learn SOAP ;)
<ajmitch> SOAP is evil

<nickr> wooden shoes, yes
<nickr> its the root word of 'sabotage'
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> wtf is sabot?
<chillywilly> k
<chillywilly> that would make sense
<chillywilly> dict tells me it's a wooden shoe
<chillywilly> or a wooden disk thingy in a cannon
<nickr> its IS a wooden shoe
<chillywilly> k
<nickr> the term sabotage comes frow when the peasents threw their sabot into the factory machines
<chillywilly> either way it will fuck up the machine
<chillywilly> cool

<drochaid> madainn mhath ajmitch :)
<drochaid> ajmitch: can I ask a generic DNS setup question?
<ajmitch> perhaps
<drochaid> well, actually I can ... whether or not you answer is probably more relevant ;)
<ajmitch> exactly :)
<drochaid> on the machine that is going to BE the DNS server ...
<drochaid> during OS install ... what do I set as the DNS server entry?
<ajmitch> 127.0.0.1, perhaps?
<ajmitch> i dunno
<drochaid> I have been using that of my firewall DNS ... but then it picks up nothing of the later config
<drochaid> hmm ... I'll maybe try that
<drochaid> all the other machines are good
<drochaid> just the dns server machine itself that can't use the dns entries %-)
<ajmitch> hehe
<drochaid> silly question time.... what file does deb hide the current dns server pointer in?
Action: drochaid hides in shame
<drochaid> for some reason I decided to look in /etc/gateways :)
<nickr>  /etc/resolv.conf
<drochaid> ta nickr
<nickr> its useful to keep that in mind, as almost all unixes afaik use that file
<nickr> maybe not
<nickr> but many
<drochaid> I think all the distros I've used where I edited it manually used that one
<drochaid> I'm so ashamed I forgot :)
<drochaid> too much MDK config apps recently methinks
<drochaid> and yes ajmitch, setting it to 127.0.0.1 worked a treat :)

<jcater> thought that'd be appropriate seeing as how he's gnue affiliated and all :)
<dnWork> :)
<dnWork> rock
<dnWork> it was on my todo list to add to dcl :)
<dnWork> on the dcl upgrade dont know if mdean told you
<dnWork> but just move your current directory to something else
<chillywilly> sup niggie
<dnWork> untar the tar ball
<dnWork> run all the scripts in upgrade that fall between your release and newest
<dnWork> and you are done
<jcater> cool
<dnWork> only exception is that if you allowed uploaded attachments you will need to move those off some where
<dnWork> and then move them back
<jcater> um
<jcater> what script did I need to modify to point to my database?
<dnWork> mdean suggests making the attachment directory outside the dcl tree so you dont have to toy with it for upgrades
<dnWork> config.php
<dnWork> in dclgw/inc/
<dnWork> iirc
<jcater> ok
<chillywilly> sup dawgs
