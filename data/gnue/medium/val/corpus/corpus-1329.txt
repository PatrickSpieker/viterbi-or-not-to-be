<SachaS> hi LuftHans hows going with your Inventory app?
<LuftHans> SachaS: been working on another contract
<LuftHans> I've got the PHP base ready to start working on it, but I hope in 2 weeks that Derek will show me the light and I can use GNUe :)
<SachaS> and there was light :)
<SachaS> oops :)
<SachaS> hope so for you.
dimas (~dimas@195.218.177.46) left irc: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)
<LuftHans> yeah, I hope so
<LuftHans> I need to finish the other contract tomorrow, then I can get back to the inventory thing
<LuftHans> there's also the job in .de to consider :)
<SachaS> i like the idea of dotgnu to have sort of "joining forces" of free software developers doing projects for a living.
<SachaS> a network of fs developers to make money ofr a living
<LuftHans> I'm trying to build that here
Action: SachaS has to look for a job next year :)
<LuftHans> I've got some work and think I can build more, but I lack the business skills and desire to really make it work :(
Action: ajmitch has to look for summer work :)

<siesel> hi
<siesel> has anyone tried SK-Ledger? (sk-ledger.sf.net)
<siesel> they say: CK-Ledger (with 15 modules, Ledger Admin, Ledger, Bank Reconciliation, Inventory, Service, AP, AR, PO, SO, Quotation, POS for Cashier, POS for Manager, HR, Staff Self Service, Payroll) is modeled on an Open Source accounting software and runs on top of phpGroupWare.
<siesel> it's a bit like arias, but a bit more generic and less convinient to use.
Action: SachaS runs test2 happily even with patched nvidia driver so i have 3d on unstab le kernel :)

<chillywilly> hey siesel 
<dcmwai> siesel, I think nola is better in the way of present

<siesel> hi btami
<btami> hello siesel
<btami> how about your i18n changes to forms (unicode default) ?
<siesel> Its allmost ready, just some small parts still have to made ready
<siesel> f.e. the way database encodings are set...
<siesel> and I still haven't worked on "unicodification" of GParser entities
<siesel> f.e. the "name" type should be converted to unicode, because it's used for labels etc
<btami> btw. can you/reinhard change authentification to authentication in all appserver stuff?
<chillywilly> heheh
<siesel> ok
<btami> :)
<siesel> Is it just in the code or in the documentation too?
<btami> in the code

<siesel> hi jcater
<jcater> hello
<siesel> I was planning to commit some of the unicode changes to forms etc.
<siesel> because common is changed to, some parts of reports possibly won't work as expected
<siesel> so it will be like the _() i18n changes
<jcater> ?
<siesel> i.e. there will be much to be fixed
<siesel> problems, which I can't check for, because I don't use reports regualary.
<siesel> I think, that now (after 0.5.1) is the time for changes like that, so I just want to ask if you have objections
<siesel> or what do you think about it.
<jcater> what kind of changes is this causing to common?
<jcater> we use common in a lot of things besides reports and forms
<siesel> the return type for strings is unicode instead of string
<siesel> when doing database access
<siesel> it could made optional, so that f.e. gnue-pos can keep using normal string 
<siesel> jcater: I' ll ask you again, later

<chillywilly> don't be sad
<jcater> how's work going?
<jcater> still going steady?
<chillywilly> yep, things are looking up
<lex> um... stupid repeated question of the day.... where is the connection file supposed to be?
<LuftHans> etc/connections.com
<LuftHans> s/com/conf/
<lex> shouldve known
<LuftHans> if you dislike security use 'username =' and 'password =' to add username and passwd to connections.conf
<lex> i do dislike it very much....thank you...:)
<LuftHans> bitte :)
<ajmitch> ello lex :)
<lex> yo
Action: lex sobs .... doesnt find my connection
<lex>  The connections file does not contain a definition 
<lex> DB000:        for "lex".
<lex> But its there..... i swear
<lex> And i can connect from here
<LuftHans> are you using cvs or pre-packaged?
<lex> debs
<lex> sid debs
<LuftHans> ooh, you got them to install :)
<lex> yeah... they did all that themselves
<LuftHans> they put binaries in /usr/bin?
<lex> and gnue-designer actually works well
<lex> yeah
<LuftHans> I ran into dependency problems, might've gotten fixed. I haven't checked in a week or 10 days
<LuftHans> I would think, then, that /etc/connections.conf is the place. That's where you have it?
<lex> AHA!
<lex> gnue-designer --conections /etc/connections.conf
<LuftHans> or specify it on the command line ;-)
<LuftHans> wonder what the default is, though
<LuftHans> is there an /etc/gnue?
<lex> nope
<lex> Bad packaging.... in --configure even...will post to bugs.debian.org
<LuftHans>  /etc/gnu*?
<LuftHans> cool
<LuftHans> is it a bug?
<LuftHans> yes, but it's documented.
<LuftHans> ok, that'll work.
<LuftHans> :)
<lex> yeah
<ajmitch> lex: not /etc/gnue/connections.conf??
Action: ajmitch hasn't installed debs for awhile :)
<lex> No...:(
<LuftHans> I agree /etc/gnue is probably where it should be. I was obviously being a bit dense earlier :(.

<Vee2d2> jcater: what bug? wrt win4lin / vmware?
<Vee2d2> only annoyance I've yet to get over is the fact that vmware4 doesnt play correctly with esddsp the the supposed fix I found doesnt seem to work.. but I wasted more time than I budgeted for it so *shrug*
<Vee2d2> http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/LD_*-gallery/index.html#vmware4
<Vee2d2> really interesting code snippets
<Vee2d2> never seen anyone write quite like that
<Vee2d2> that == it's an asm file, but it's also an sh script that compiles itself and sets itself up in the environment.. 
<Vee2d2> s/asm/c module that calls the asm() function.. 
<jcater> Vee2d2: you using debian sid?
<Vee2d2> yip
<jcater> you updated this week?
<Vee2d2> everyday
<jcater> :(
<Vee2d2> I'm holding back some python related stuffs..
<jcater> you restarted win4lin in the last few days?
<Vee2d2> I only use vmware
<jcater> ah
<Vee2d2> does w4l not run at all? 
<jcater> I don't have VMWare
<jcater> I just saw on the w4l lists that there was a debian bug entry
<jcater> for vmware not running w/2.3.2 either
<jcater> but it might be a specific version
Nick change: dneighbo_ -> derek
<Vee2d2> heya derek
<derek> hi Vee2d2
<Vee2d2> jcater: I dunno, everything's still working here.
<derek> anyone know how to trouble shoot NIC problems?
<derek> i.e. i have a NIC and it works
<derek> er 2 nics and they work
<ajmitch> but?
<jcater> Vee2d2: well, basically
<derek> if i traceroute they look clean (one box to another) internal network
<jcater> glibc 2.3.2 broke compatibility with glibc 2.0
<derek> and i can copy things back and forth
<derek> however it is DOG slow
<jcater> so any programs compiled against 2.0 will no longer work
<derek> i thought maybe it was samba
<jcater> (which is quite a few prepackaged stuff, apparently)
<derek> but if i do ssh even its slow
<derek> er scp
<derek> like REALLY slow
<jcater> like, how slow?
<jcater> 100Mb card running at 10Mb speeds?
<derek> the "server" with samba and such on it isn't exactly a lightning box (p-133mhz 80mb RAM)
<jcater> or slower
<derek> jcater: if i have say 40 or 50 4megapix photos
<derek> and i copy them from box A to box B it might take ALL night
<derek> i haven't timed things as i haven't gotten good chance to troubleshoot
<derek> i suspect it is a misconfigured card on one box or the other
<derek> like the server as my laptop copies things to the server slow as well
<derek> is there a way to "time" a copy?
<derek> for a while i thought it was cause i stream music off that server
<derek> but even when not streaming music its slow
<Vee2d2> that's pretty slow
<derek> its irrating because i copy digital camera stuff too much :(
<derek> i woudl just download images right on server but its so old, no usb :)
<derek> problem has existed since day 1
<Vee2d2> have you used something like lftp or such to see what the actual throughput looks like?
<derek> (so like 3 years ago)
<derek> but have just been too lazy or forgetfull to fix it
<derek> but tonight it needs to be looked at if anyone has suggestions
<derek> i dont know where to start 
Action: derek HATES hardware...
<derek> let me rephrase that, hardware hates me
<Vee2d2> might be a bad cable?
<derek> Vee2d2: that i have changed
<derek> and i have two pc's connected to server
<derek> both are slow
<derek> and i have changed the server to hub connection
<Vee2d2> have you used something like lftp,ncftp or some such to see what the actual throughput looks like?
<derek> nope
<derek> dont really want to install ftp
<derek> is there some other tool?
<derek> i can scp with verbose and it will tell me i suppose
<Vee2d2> these arent debian boxens? :)
<Vee2d2> apt-get -uf install proftpd lftp; lftp -u derek fish://myothermachine/~/porn
<Vee2d2> or whatever, right..?
<jcater> iftop ?
<jcater> iftop -B
<jcater> then scp a large file across
<Vee2d2> hey that's pretty cool.. never used that before
<derek> they are
<derek> debian boxes
<derek> but i dont want to install ftp
<derek> just one more thing to have to "babysit" for vulnerabilities :)
<derek> looks like im getting about 10KB/s throughput
<derek> when its not STALLING
<Vee2d2> y'know.. I guess first thing I would check is ifconfig on all the machines to see if there's some interesting figures.. like a bunch of errors or something.. 
<derek> with a max of may 19KB/s
<ajmitch> derek: syslog show any timeouts?
<derek> ajmitch: which machine
<ajmitch> either
<ajmitch> or general ethernet errors
<ajmitch> or it could be a large number of collisions
<ajmitch> as Vee2d2 said, check ifconfig :)
<derek> hmm no timeout to syslog
<jcater> does ifconfig -a
<derek> but this is the machine that throws crap to the screen instead of logs
<jcater> show many drops or errors?
<derek> grrrr
<Vee2d2> eww!

<derek> ok a 4.2mb file copies in 7:14
<derek> ouch
<derek> via scp
<ajmitch> 'bing' is also a useful tool for measuring throughput :)
<ajmitch> that is slower than my crappy DSL
<ajmitch> it'd be faster to string up a serial cable between them
<Vee2d2> derek: that high frame count says something, what I dont know..

<derek> jcater: copying another file
<jcater> bing?
<jcater> was that a typo?
<jcater> or a tool I don't know about?

<derek> if we cant find out whats up where
<derek> er here
<ajmitch> jcater: no typo
<ajmitch> jcater: a tool for measuring bandwidth
<derek> jcater: speed still really slow
<jcater> well, isn't that spiffy
<jcater> linux has too many damn tools to learn
<jcater> esp, debian :)
<jcater> derek: I'd be tempted to try a new card
<jcater> I can't think of too many things that would cause this
<derek> no kidding (re: too many tools)
Action: Vee2d2 has picked up a few just in this thread.. ;)
<derek> ok will try other card as soon as done copying some pictures
<Vee2d2> few new tools/tricks
<derek> only thing else i can think is newer driver
<jcater> maybe
<derek> but i have used netgear a LOT in the past with no problem
<jcater> but it's a tulip
<jcater> and that driver has a lot of history behind it
Action: Vee2d2 has some tulips
<jcater> I prefer daffodils
<Vee2d2> my ltsp workstation is a tulip based card
<jcater> derek: it could be the
<jcater> damn network is so exhausted
<jcater> because you are making it work
<jcater> in the phoenix heat
<jcater> I know I'd be exhausted and moving slowly
<Vee2d2> needs some water, maybe.
<derek> hey its only 90 right now
<jcater> ah
<jcater> that's no worse than here then
Action: derek did have to snicker that the poor french were DYING (literally) in 100 degree weather
<Vee2d2> it's only 78 here.. but 78% humidity
<derek> btw: kudos to best buy...
<derek> our camera took a dump (we paid 49.99 for the warranty)
<derek> took it back and they said store credit for amount of camera buy a new one
<derek> problem is that camera prices went up
<derek> couldnt get same camera specs for same price (and kodak switched storage media type)
<derek> so looked like was going to have to pay like 100 to get equiv camera
<derek> i talked to a manager and said what good is the warranty if i have to pay 100 to get same quality camera
<derek> they made it a wash and i paid 7 bucks to extend the warranty of new camera a year
<derek> and in actually got camera with better battery, optical zoom and an extra compact flash card
<derek> all i can say is best buy's customer service wow'ed me today
<jcater> wow...nothing like the Best Buys around here
<jcater> i'm jealous
<derek> yeah me too.  
<Vee2d2> not sure what I'm gonna do with mine.. it's dead again and I'm not about to shell out another $125 to get it fixed (old olympus d-600L 1.3MP)
<Vee2d2> maybe try and repair it myself.. ;)
<derek> well thats why i bought warranty
<derek> normally i avoid them liek the plague
<Vee2d2> I bought this thing like... 4 or 5 years ago, I think.
<derek> but i know digital cameras are notorious for not lasting long
Action: derek twiddles thumbs waiting for that copy to finish
<Vee2d2> maybe 3 or 4.. not sure
<derek> so i can try another card
<Vee2d2> I want to know what that frame count means
Action: derek HAS to get a GNU Enterprise presentation ready real soon now
<jcater> I've been googling
<Vee2d2> I googled a little bit too
<jcater> and can't seem to find much info
<jcater> on what frame means
<jcater> other than errors
Action: derek would be happy to see messages go to syslog instead of screen
<derek> but of course that is an enigma no debianite has been able to solve in 3 years :)
<derek> i have two bugs that are in the "no way that is possible category"
<Vee2d2> you look in /etc/syslog.conf?
<derek> 1. modules disappearing for modconf even though they exist and work on a new kernel from packaging
<derek> 2. ethernet messages going to stdout opposed to a relevant log
<jcater> #1 happens to me all the time after a kernel upgrade
<jcater> usually have to wait for updated modutils then upgrade again
<derek> it is funny when people say "not possible", my response usually is "you dont know me" ;)
<jcater> even then, that doesn't always work
<derek> jcater: that sounds feasible
<derek> as i had a period where i did like 4 machines and all 4 had the problem
<Vee2d2> modules.conf?
<derek> and took like two kernel upgrades before it came back
<derek> modconf
<Vee2d2> wtf is modconf?
<Vee2d2> ;)
<derek> its a debian program that kicks butt (imho)
<Vee2d2> sounds like it is.. ;)
<derek> lets you select modules and configure them
<Vee2d2> interesting.. never used this..
<derek> so you dont have to play the /etc/modules.conf and insmod delmod bullsh1t game
<derek> i.e. its yet another debian nicety that people using other distros miss out on
<Vee2d2> I was going to say.. modules.conf is autogenerated so it's understandable things might disappear if you're mucking in that file.. 
<derek> what i find funny is most debian folks dont like modconf, but other than it dissappearing on some kernel upgrads
<derek> it has been PURE gold for me
<jcater> I get lost without it
<derek> jcater: that is how i feel
<jcater> it handles "module" dependencies 
<jcater> mainly is the reason I like it
<Vee2d2> I just edit /etc/modules to list the modules I want loaded.. and... 
<derek> the only module tool i use besides modconf now is lsmod
<derek> to see if something is loaded
<derek> Vee2d2: we're sorry.. you should try modconf :)
<derek> thats probably my one gripe about debian
<Vee2d2> I use discover and have it skip the es1371 module so that it uses alsa's module instead..
<derek> its very "insiderish"
<derek> i.e. you will do something the hard way for years and someone will say have you tried "foo"
<derek> you try "foo" and nearly crap your pants and ask something dumb like "when did that come out"
<derek> to which the answer is 5 years ago
<derek> as we all stated in this thread
<derek> what is iftop "cool" what is bing "cool"
<Vee2d2> DWN rocks if for no other reason that the new package listing in each one.. ;)
<derek> sometimes 10,000 packages is too much :)
<derek> man this libc thing is painful
<derek> so Vee2d2 you bracing for erika yet?
Action: Vee2d2 is about as far away from the coast as you
<Vee2d2> I might as well be in oklahoma
Action: ajmitch is near a different coast
<Vee2d2> been living under a rock, too.. Had I not happened to hear it mentioned on my 5 minute trek home from the office tonight I wouldnt have had a clue what you were talking about. ;)
Action: derek crys
<derek> 5 minute trek
<ajmitch> first I've heard of it :)
<Vee2d2> derek: :)
<Vee2d2> my office is on top of a bar, too.
<derek> hmmmm
<derek> berry interesting
<derek> when switching to other machine (instead of ssh into a term)
<derek> to switch ethernet connection
<derek> this was on term
<jcater> Vee2d2: you dance on bar tops?
<jcater> I know the economy is tough
<derek> NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0 : transit timeout
<derek> over and over and over
<ajmitch> ah
<Vee2d2> jcater: whatever it takes.
Action: Vee2d2 ordered the floorplans for his guest house this morning. (sorry if that's a repeat, I've been telling everyone today)
<jcater> isn't eth0 the unused one?
<jcater> cool
<derek> yes it is
<derek> im thinking it is probably unused because i couldnt get it to work
<derek> sweet
<derek> making room for us to have that GNU Enterprise conference eh
<Vee2d2> heh.. I was fixing to ask why you have a card in there but arent using it..
<jcater> what kernel version?
<Vee2d2> derek: you bet.. tentatively set for October
<Vee2d2> 2006
<jcater> cool!
<jcater> just in time for 0.6.x series of tools?
<Vee2d2> abitious!
<Vee2d2> ambitious, too!
<derek> hmmm
<derek> ok i had an eth0 with nothing and an eth1 with something
<derek> i switched cables
<derek> restarted /etc/init.d/networking stop
<derek> restarted /etc/init.d/networking start
<derek> and then did a dhclient
<derek> it got an ip for eth0
<derek> but shows an ip still for eth1
<derek> i tried an ifdown eth1 but it wont let me
<derek> anyone know how to make eth1 GO AWAY?
<ajmitch> ifconfig eth1 down
<jcater> or a screwdriver and gloves
<derek> fsck
<derek> you know what
<derek> cp 4.2 file (same as before)
<derek> 4 seconds
<derek> yes 4 seconds
<derek> instead of 7min 4 secons
Action: derek kicks shit around
<derek> well problem solved
<jcater> good
<derek> to think for like 1.5 years have suffered
<Vee2d2> haha
<Vee2d2> :)
<derek> but in fairness i couldnt reach the server before w/o a MAJOR hassle
<derek> now that in new office i made sure boxes were easy to get at
<derek> Vee2d2: you suggestion worked
Action: derek does happy dance
Action: derek creams self
<derek> ah.... whole roll of film (128MB Flash Card) copied up in less than 10 seconds
Action: jcater hands derek tissue
<derek> this took LITERALLY over night before
<derek> jcater: thanks
<Vee2d2> that would've driven me crazy quickly.. I dont think I would've put up with it
<Vee2d2> more than about 5 mins anyway.
<Vee2d2> that's another thing. my camera has a serial interface.. which is very very slow.. and the connector is a PoS that I have to jury rig with a rubber band in order to maintain a connection long 'nuff to get the files.. 
<Vee2d2> looking forward to something a bit more modern like a usb interface or something..
<Vee2d2> I know there's card readers.. and I had a couple.. but I'd rather just 'plug it in'
Action: jcater hates usb
<jcater> but I suppose I'd hate screwing w/serial and a rubberband too
<derek> well i used to be able to use gtkam (and it worked great)
<derek> new camera is in the gtkam list but it wont recognize it :(
<Vee2d2> I wrote a script to use gphoto's cli
<derek> i fought and fought to no avail, but usb was seeing it
<derek> i mounted it like a file system and it works like a charm
<derek> it KICKS THE CRAP out of gphoto
<derek> 2 seconds to mount
<Vee2d2> gphoto was the only option in the beginning
<derek> mv /mnt/camera/*.jpg  /mnt/smb/photos/
<Vee2d2> short of writing my own thing anyway
<Vee2d2> yea, see that would be nice.. 
<Vee2d2> ;)
<derek> and it copies in a matter of seconds
<derek> and leaves me with a blank flash card
<derek> its really equiv of having a flash card reader
<derek> i had tried to do that with old camera and couldnt
Action: Vee2d2 is looking at his scripts..
<Vee2d2> I have another one to create a link farm from directories of pix into like an index directory
<Vee2d2> so I'd suck pix off the camera into $title-date labeled directories then when I had enough for a cd or something I'd run this linkfarm script to link all the pictures to something like index/$count.jpg so I could easily view every picture on the disc from that one directory.. 
<Vee2d2> this camcorder I have has a usb port.. suppose to be able to stream video through it.. havent had time to play with that though..
<Vee2d2>  http://www.zug.com/pranks/credit/index.html
<Vee2d2> that is so funny
<derek> scripting and photo on GNU/Linux is just bad ;)
<derek> i.e. i dont know how windows people live
<derek> i have digital video camcorder
<derek> need to install my firewire card
<derek> and try to get it working supposedly its supported
<derek> prolly wait for new laptop with built in dvd writer and firewire :)
<chillywilly> getting new laptop?
<derek> prolly
<derek> work went to "leasing" computers
<derek> they call it "capital replacement program"
<derek> every computer bought in the general fund gets replaced every 2 or 3 years
<derek> this is replacement year, my laptop is on the plan
<derek> so i have been told sometime soon they will be taking my order for a new one
<derek> in some ways for desktops i think we are wasting our money, ditching perfectly good computers
<derek> for laptops (where people use them) its not an all bad move
<derek> as this machine will be out of warranty
<chillywilly> yea
<derek> and between batteries dying, keyboard and pointer devices dying etc wouldnt be long for repair bills to surpass new machine
<derek> but on pc's parts are cheap and interchangeable
<derek> so i have harder time buying 'out of warranty' fears
<derek> the "your computer is obsolete in 2 years" mentality sucks
