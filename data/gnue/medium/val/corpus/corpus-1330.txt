<dcmwai> hello dickweed
<dickweed> this might be off-topic. but, i want to be a developer
<dcmwai> dickweed, That is great.
<dickweed> ok
<dcmwai> dickweed, you want to be a developer on which part?
<dcmwai> you could start by having an account in savana( did I spell it right)
<dickweed> well.. i fiddle with java, c, python2 and a bit of sql. rudimentary. but given a task i might be able to push forward
<dickweed> i also scheme. very little i'm ashamed to admit.
<dcmwai> ghttps://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnue/
<dcmwai> https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnue/
<dickweed> ok
<dcmwai> goto savannah checkout the cvs, and see what you can do on the TODO list
<dcmwai> then submit the patch to derek... 
<dickweed> it is acceptable to look at the TODO list without knowing everything there is to know about gnue?
<dcmwai> dickweed, There are many parts in Gnue...
<dcmwai> choose the one you like most and have a look on it code
<dickweed> ok

<btami> btw reinhard, i have a hard question
<reinhard> ok
<btami> i have a 2 people owned company (kft or gmbh)
<btami> me and an old fashioned lady
<btami> we have a proprietary software
<btami> payroll and tax calculation
<reinhard> have == sell or have == use ?
<btami> it was developed in foxpro(dos)
<btami> sell
<reinhard> ok
<btami> i'v developed it
<btami> my plan is to completely rewrite it in GNUe
<dsmith> Did enyone enjoy Debian's 10th birthday?
<chillywi1ly> hi btami 
<chillywi1ly> thanks reinhard 
<Vee2d2> dsmith: nope, not a single person.
<Vee2d2> ;)
Action: reinhard thinks he knows what the question will be...
<btami> if i think it right , it hten have to be GPL-ed
<reinhard> no
<reinhard> of course you would not even _want_ to write proprietary software
<btami> if no, what?
<reinhard> but if you really want, you can write prop software with gnue
<chillywi1ly> custom != proprietary
<chillywi1ly> ;)
<reinhard> just like you can write prop software with gcc
<jamest> you can make prop forms, reports, etc
<reinhard> only the tools are gpl
<chillywi1ly> if it's not a general solution it won't be useful to gnue anyway
<btami> i see
<reinhard> so you have to provide the source for gnue-forms, gnue-common etc
<jamest> but you couldn't embed gnue-common in your app
<reinhard> however
<reinhard> i don't see how you would hide the source of a form from your user ;-)
<jamest> actually you might be able to even do that
<chillywi1ly> and what about in-house stuff?
<jamest> but you'd have to give back any changes to gnue-common
<jamest> i'm honestly not sure how that whole embedded gnue-common would work out
<btami> ok, 2. question:
<jamest> i wonder if a person could do a pgp type setup w/ forms/reports/etc
<jamest> in common
<btami> i want to put it GPL
<jamest> so that forms could be encrypted w/ a private key
<btami> but my business partner asks
<jamest> and the public key distributed with app
<chillywi1ly> hmmm, my IP changed
<btami> what is the benefit of opening our code?
<jamest> of course others could hack common to spit out the unencrypted stuff
<chillywi1ly> there's 2 of me...
dsmith (~dsmith@mail.actron.com) left irc: "Client exiting"
<havoc> that is very odd
<havoc> shouldn't be possible
<reinhard> btami: the main benefit is getting back imporvements from the community
<havoc> but then this is freenode after all ;)
<btami> reinhard:i know that, but
<chillywi1ly> heheh
<reinhard> this is for example what i experienced with you last week with your fixes to appserver :)
<btami> she is not a programmer
<reinhard> another advantage
<btami> and she ask me :
<reinhard> especially for small companies
<btami> why make concorrence for us
<btami> concurence
<reinhard> is she might get asked quite a lot "what happens if btami is hit by a bus"
<reinhard> and then she might answer "you are in no way dependent from us"
<chillywi1ly> heheh
<reinhard> no kidding
<reinhard> i get asked this a lot (being a 3 person company)
<reinhard> s/i/we/
<btami> exactly same here
<reinhard> btami: and don't forget
<reinhard> you don't have to open the source code to the world
<reinhard> you just have to open it to your customer
<reinhard> and let him open it to whomever he likes
<reinhard> most customers will probably keep it to themselves anyway
<btami> aha, this is new to me
<reinhard> yeah the gpl doesn't say you have to give your code to anyone
<reinhard> you can keep it all for yourself if you like
<reinhard> but _when_ you give it away, you have to
<reinhard> 1. give the source code, too
chillywilly (danielb@CPE-24-167-193-95.wi.rr.com) left irc: Connection timed out
<reinhard> 2. let the receiver give it to any 3rd persons he wants under the same conditions
<reinhard> so it might be totally normal to write code under gpl
<reinhard> and give it only to a single customer
<btami> ok
<btami> my  original idea was to put the development to savannah, but she complained
<reinhard> the customer then has all the freedoms of changing the program himself (if he likes
<reinhard> )
<btami> but this is not a mus
<btami> must
<reinhard> savannah is not a must at all
<reinhard> brb (wife calls...)
<btami> ok, thanks for all
<LuftHans> there are no requirements for anyone to give the code to a 3rd party
<LuftHans> also, technically you don't have to give the source code to your customers, you just have to make it available to them
<reinhard> back
<reinhard> LuftHans: yes, you're right
<LuftHans> I think you should, but you don't have to :)
<reinhard> i provide a "written offer" myself instead of the source code
<reinhard> for debian
<btami> btw reinhard: what kind of software you develop,have,maintain?
<reinhard> erp for small companies
<reinhard> ca. 1-30 users
<reinhard> mainly wholesale
<btami> is it prop too?
<reinhard> actually yes
<reinhard> but i handle it nearly like free software
<reinhard> for example if someone asks me for the source i give it to him at no cost
<btami> i think we all in the same boat :)
<reinhard> :)
<btami> what language?
<reinhard> it's called starbasic
<reinhard> has nothing to do with star office
<reinhard> it's a kind of basic that has integrated access to informix C-ISAM files
<reinhard> which is a nice "db" system
<btami> i see
<reinhard> (something like dbase)
<btami> no sql?
<reinhard> and it compiles to a pseudocode
<reinhard> no sql
<reinhard> the pseudocode is then interpreted on the target machine
<reinhard> and interpreters exist for sco, hp-ux, linux, dos and some other OS
<reinhard> that gave us platform independance even 20 years ago
<reinhard> when there was no python :-)
<btami> nice
<btami> foxpro does nothing, just a little sql :)
<reinhard> :)
<reinhard> however having no sql and no graphical ui kills this beast
<reinhard> slowly but steadily
<reinhard> and it's a good opportunity to replace it by gnue someday
<reinhard> customer by customer
<reinhard> (still got about 150 of them)
<btami> same here
<reinhard> i think many here are in a similar situation
<btami> the foxpro for dos is killd by USB printers 
<reinhard> yeah for example
<btami> dos knows nothing about USB
<reinhard> right - same problem here when using dos platform
<reinhard> and win xp is really making problems with dos boxes
<reinhard> well it works but you have to tewak like a dozen parameters till it works :)
<LuftHans> what about dosemu or some other on GNU/Linux?
<btami> yes
<reinhard> LuftHans: that would be pervert because it runs natively on GNU/Linux :)
<reinhard> but as i said for small companies
<LuftHans> ah, ok, nevermind the peanut gallery :)
<btami> but my main problem with prop dev environments is
<reinhard> some of my customers only have a single pc in their company
<reinhard> and that has to be windows (because they want word, outlook etc.)
<btami> have to sleep, night all
btami (~btami@ngprs.pannongsm.hu) left irc: 
<reinhard> huh
<LuftHans> reinhard: put them on a GNU/Linux box with vmware
<reinhard> stopped in the middle of a sentence
<reinhard> must have been wife that called ;-)
<reinhard> LuftHans: i don't want to support the whole PC
<LuftHans> guess btami doesn't have to sleep if he uses Free Software dev environments  :)
<reinhard> i don't want my customers to call me if they have a problem in word or excel
<reinhard> so i _may_ not install them :)
<LuftHans> reinhard: ok, makes sense
<reinhard> i've got some customers that virtually call me when the tap drips
<reinhard> (?)
<reinhard> the cock drops?
<reinhard> aehm
<reinhard> gotta sleep, too :-)
<LuftHans> :)

<chillywilly> it can be free can't it ;)
<derek> NEXT time (if this goes well) i might charge cost of azoto shirt (then say free azoto shirt included) ;)
Action: LuftHans thinks your wife is smart ;-)
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> what is AZOTO?
<LuftHans> maybe we should get the website back up before the class....
<derek> definitely
<chillywilly> AZ Open Tech Org
<derek> i considered hacking together something
<chillywilly> nm
<chillywilly> google is my bitch
<derek> i STILL think postnuke or whatever is way overkill
<LuftHans> cw: AZ Open Tech Org, a non-profit dedicates to promoting Free Software and Open Standards in the state of .az.us
<derek> AZOTO should pretty much be a marketing site (so to speak)
<derek> with needs for a calendar
<chillywilly> derek: havoc wants to make out LUG site into more of a marketing site
<derek> and a store (to take donations and sell merchandise for stuff)
<chillywilly> the current domain is not under our control and now we got a new one
<chillywilly> and havoc is gonna host it
<chillywilly> he's got the T1
<chillywilly> milwaukeelug.org
<LuftHans> derek: as long as I can get updates on the site, it contains the info we need and we can get backups/mirrors I'm happy
<chillywilly> havoc was suggesting someone form an NPO for the LUG
<LuftHans> cw: derek and I can give pointers on how not to do that :)
<chillywilly> you guys formed AZOTO?
<chillywilly> organized it
<LuftHans> cw: I am one of the three co-founders and conned Derek into joining at the end of last year
<chillywilly> well I suppose I wouldn't mind doing it with Joe...I know havoc does not want to do it as he has plate full running his own business
<LuftHans> so far we have produced:
<LuftHans> 1) nix
<LuftHans> 2) nada
<LuftHans> 3) nothing
<LuftHans> :(
<chillywilly> what are you supposed to "produce"?
<LuftHans> cw: results
<chillywilly> marketing materials and such I guess ;)
<LuftHans> :)
<chillywilly> haha
<chillywilly> business relationships
<chillywilly> blah blah blah
<chillywilly> I can see how it could quickly get out of hand
<chillywilly> and become a lot of work
<chillywilly> or none at all ;)
<LuftHans> cw: we're supposed to be helping NGOs and EDUs move to Free Software and Open Standards, provide classes and help groups
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> well derek is doing his part then ;)
<LuftHans> we've actually done the help groups some, some EDU ( Derek's class counts for that )
<chillywilly> he's giving a class
<LuftHans> cw: yup
<derek> hardest part is breakign away from our LUG
<derek> i.e. imho we are not a separate identity just yet
<derek> and so it makes what we can do far more limited
<chillywilly> I'm not sure havoc thinks they should be separated
<derek> however, most of our potential volunters are from the LUG
<LuftHans> yeah, we need more outside resources. I need to go try to drum that up again
<chillywilly> they way he was explaining it to me today ;)
<LuftHans> brb
<derek> so there needs to be "synergy" ;)
<derek> but separation
<chillywilly> no, Free Tech Org derek ;)
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> doesn't make a cool acronym
<chillywilly> AZFTO
<chillywilly> eh I like AZOTO better
<chillywilly> uh, dudes maybe you should create a web site ;)
<chillywilly> MFSF
<chillywilly> Milwaukee Foundation for Software Freedom
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> mutha fuckin san franciso
<chillywilly> ;-o
