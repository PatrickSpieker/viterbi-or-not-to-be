<Vee2d2> chillywilly: references to your old ~chillywilly on goats but that's defunkt
<chillywilly> yea cause they took my account away ;)
<chillywilly> http://www.libertyetech.com/photos/
<chillywilly> these pictures are mostly old
<derek> too funny
<chillywilly> yea, it was the heavy metal hair day or some shit
<chillywilly> ;P
<derek> i was just updating my pictures for livejournal (my new obsession, the journal not the pictures)
<derek> http://www.livejournal.com/allpics.bml?user=dneighbo
<derek> kind of scary i think every picture i own of me (not many) i have something red on :)
<chillywilly> man I need new pictured up there
<derek> darn fetishes
<chillywilly> pictures
<Vee2d2> chillywilly: nuttin coming through over here.. 
<Vee2d2> just.. Loading...
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> that would suck...maybe RR is trying to block ports on me
<chillywilly> those fsckers
<chillywilly> nah
<chillywilly> I am able to do it from a clients machine
<chillywilly> erm, reach my site
Action: chillywilly fired up links
<ajmitch> hmmph
<Vee2d2> works now..
<chillywilly> gah, don't look ;)
<chillywilly> run away
<ajmitch> hehe, old photos :)
Action: LuftHans moves over to #OpenOffice.org to herass them for not having presentations on how to use OpenOffice.org
<LuftHans> it's not like they don't have any presentation software available...
<ajmitch> heh :)
<chillywilly> yea...ok...
<chillywilly> LuftHans: good luck ;)
<LuftHans> their hackers guide is at ximian rather than OO.o...
<ajmitch> s/ximian/novell/ ;)
<LuftHans> yeah, maybe we'll see some improvement :)
<chillywilly> doubt it
<derek> ximian sux
<derek> oops did i say that
Action: derek wears a ximian shirt almost everyday.... sadly
<chillywilly> you need to buy some FSF t-shirt
<chillywilly> s
<LuftHans> hey, they actually have a guide
<LuftHans> it's in flash :(
Action: chillywilly has 2
<chillywilly> bah
<LuftHans> derek: I know where you can get PLUG t-shirts ;-)
<derek> yeah i have one
<derek> need more
<derek> i HATE images on front though :(
Action: derek might design some and make them
<chillywilly> I wonder if jbailey ever finished the book he was writing for GNU Press
<derek> as im picky
<chillywilly> bah
<derek> also i got XXL (and then lost 30 pounds)
<chillywilly> I like images on front
<derek> so i kind of swim in it
<LuftHans> well, images on the back don't make sense for me...
<chillywilly> I thought when you're old you're supposed to keep that weight
<chillywilly> ;)
<LuftHans> derek: swimming this time of year is a good thing
<chillywilly> I have the typing gnu with the GPL on the back
<chillywilly> and also the savannah GNU one
Action: ajmitch has none
<ajmitch> shipping costs are probably more than shirt costs for me :)
<chillywilly> yea, but it's a "donation" ;)
<chillywilly> http://www.gnu.org/gear/Happy-tshirt.html
<chillywilly> http://www.gnu.org/gear/01-tshirt.html <-- that one I have
Action: LuftHans feels dirty.
<LuftHans> he's been looking at legal stuff Sun put up on OO.o :(
<chillywilly> ttp://www.gnu.org/gear/98-tshirt.html <-- and that one
<chillywilly> woops
<chillywilly> http://www.gnu.org/gear/98-tshirt.html
<chillywilly> a gray shirt
<chillywilly> actually yhr gnu age one is thw wrong size
<chillywilly> and I still haven't done crap about it
<chillywilly> it's a L
<chillywilly> I need XL
<chillywilly> for my fat gut
<chillywilly> hmmm, maybe I should email them right now
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> hell if I know where the receipt is
<derek> LuftHans: sun and legalese are a scary combination
<derek> maybe its cause the words sco and sun are kind of similar :P)
<chillywilly> ouch
<LuftHans> derek: yeah, I keep thinking we should work to take Sun down, then move on to m$
<LuftHans> I can't believe they don't have any presentations on OO.o available
<LuftHans> If I write them I'll first write a doc license that prohibits use by sun or mention of sun during the presentation
Action: Vee2d2 has been thinking about offering shirts for everyone that commits code towards a 1.0 release version free (just gimme a size and an address I can mail it, anywhere) embroidered GNUe shirt, probably with something extra like "development team" or "developer" or something 
<LuftHans> oooh, someone awake on OO.o
<Vee2d2> s/code/effort
<chillywilly> 1.0 release of what?
<Vee2d2> each piece of the pie.. maybe  send a shirt to everyone who makes designer 1.0 a reality.. everyone that makes appserver 1.0 a reality.. etc.. 
<ajmitch> how big a contribution tho?
<Vee2d2> more than ircing, I would expect.. :) something productive that helps bring the release within grasp.. 
<Vee2d2> documentation, presentation/promotion (enlightening the masses could produce future contributors), ... ?
<derek> Vee2d2: i meant to ask you about doing some work for me :)
<ajmitch> LUG presentations & media kits? ;)
<derek> you can get shirts too right? or you just do the embrodiery?
<Vee2d2> you bet, I can get 'em. 
Action: ajmitch wonders how far off 1.0 releases would realistically be
<chillywilly> Vee2d2: if you really wanna get 1.0 whatever released just fsend donuts to jacter on a regular basis
<Vee2d2> I'd like to clone jcater.. 
<Vee2d2> ok new deal
<ajmitch> well if every bug derek finds is fixed, then 1.0 would be extremely solid :)
<Vee2d2> a dozen GNUe shirts to the first hacker that clones jcater
<chillywilly> haha
<LuftHans> that was someone looking for help, good thing I was around, otherwise there'd've been no one to help him screw up his box :)
<LuftHans> it appears that OO.o doesn't provide an uninstall mechanism :(
<Vee2d2> I use to idle in that channel
<ajmitch> LuftHans: rm -rf
<LuftHans> do you know of any presentations we can use for teaching people how to use the beast?
<SachaS> or apt-get --purge remove OO
<LuftHans> ajmitch: that's what I told him to use
<SachaS> if debian ...
<LuftHans> he's using slackware and the OO.o install mechanism
Action: Vee2d2 wanders off to the bed place
<derek> i hate the gimp
<derek> is there an easy way to draw a straight line?
Action: derek wonders why their UI has to suck so bad that its impossilbe to find something to make a straightline

<derek> its too late
<LuftHans> http://mmmaybe.gimp.org/tutorials/Straight_Line/
<LuftHans> google is your friend, or at least it pretends to be your friend
<LuftHans>  This tutorial shows you how you can do straight lines with the gimp, using a feature called the Shift Key.
<LuftHans> :)
<derek> this smart ass is exactly why gimp sucks ass
<derek> i.e. he has a point, but tell me how its INTUITELY obvious to use the shift key?

<dcmwai> Vee Web Base?

<jcater> I'll chip in a box of donuts

<dcmwai> Nice song
<dyfet> you dont need hardware to try bayonne
<dcmwai> dyfet, isn't bayonne the telecommunication services?
<Vee> dyfet, oh? I was under the same impression. 
<dyfet> with current releases, just a soundcard to test the server, and with the cvs version (soon 1.3.0), you can use h323 and gnomemeeting
<dyfet> as well as supporting traditional telephone networks :)
<dyfet> for the latter, you do need hardware...
<dcmwai> How to get computer to get traditional telephone networks?
<dyfet> for that you need hardware
<dcmwai> :)
<dyfet> but you dont need hardware to test bayonne, or to use ip voice

<btami> hello
<btami> jamest/jcater: what is the correct way if i fix a packaging error and build a new setup exe?
<btami> 1. owerwrite
<btami> 2. upload with another name
<btami> 3: wait for next release
<btami> ?
<jamest> um
<jamest> gut tells me we should re-release w/ new point number
<jamest> 0.5.2
<jcater> even if it's a packaging error?
<btami> the designers toolbar wizards doesn't work in setup exe
<btami> just a packaging error
<jamest> we've already got the package in the wild
<jbailey> Or add a .1 to the end.
<jamest> yeah
<jcater> we have win32 packages?
<jcater> if so, we never announced it
<jamest> 0.5.1.1
<jamest> is fine too
<jamest> but I think we need way to mark the diff
<Vee> .1.1 or .1-1 ? ;)
<jbailey> Please don't use .1-1
<ajmitch> it would be evil
<ajmitch> hi jeff
<jbailey> Versions with -'s are used by distros, so unless all win32 versions are going to start -1, -2 for sub releases, it will just get confusing.
<jbailey> Heya Andrew.
<btami> 0.5.1.1 ?
<ajmitch> sure
<jcater> sounds good to me
<btami> ok
<ajmitch> are there 0.5.1 debs? :)
<btami> i will try to upload tomorrow
Action: jbailey looks around.
<btami> :)
<Vee> jbailey, but isnt that the point? the exes are distributed as they are, no? there would be no need to repackage everything, right? if it was a problem in the debs, you would issue 0.5.1-2, right?
<ajmitch>  /msg jbailey don't woryr, jcater is here to blame
<jbailey> Vee: Sure, but you're changing from 0.5.1 to 0.5.1-2, which is just confusing.
<jbailey> If you changed so that the initial release was x.y.z-m then it would make sense.

Action: drochaid strokes his collection of 10yr Ardbeg, 10yr Talisker, 10yr Laphroaig, natural cask strength Talisker, 17yr Ardbeg and 20yr Ledaig whisky :-D
Action: drochaid forgot about the 18yr Highland Park
<LuftHans> ok, time to get ready for Stammtisch
Action: LuftHans visits drochaid.
<lupo__> you're an alcoholic, drochaid.
Action: drochaid drinks about once every couple of weeks
<drochaid> a bottle last me MONTHS
<LuftHans> lupo__: nah, an alcoholic would have empties.
<drochaid> heh
<lupo__> :)
<LuftHans> I've just got Bushmills 10 yr at this point, had the bottle for a year or so before I opened it.
<drochaid> :o
<LuftHans> haven't had Laphroaig in a number of years and don't know the others
<drochaid> but but but
<drochaid> that's Irish!
<LuftHans> I might've heard of Ardbeg
<drochaid> Arbeg == the best of Islay whisky
<LuftHans> drockaid: na und?  :)
<drochaid> *Ardbeg
<drochaid> Talisker is from Skye, only distillery on the Island
<LuftHans> hmm, gonna have to get some Talisker
<drochaid> Ledaig is the GOOD version of Tobermory from the Isle of Mull
<drochaid> Highland Park is from Orkney
<LuftHans> my neice's middle name comes from Skye, so it seems like a family obligation :)
<drochaid> 10yr Tobermory is weak pish .. mainly sold to tourists ... ledaig is smooth, spicy and great after a full days photo shoot :)
<drochaid> LuftHans, go visit the distillery, you can ONLY get the natural cask strength one there
Action: drochaid decides tonight is a 20yr Ledaig night
<drochaid> brb
<LuftHans> drockaid: I'm looking at a job in Dublin. If I get that I'll make sure to visit several distilleries :).
<drochaid> but ... Scottish ones
<LuftHans> drochaid: I'll have to make a comparitive tour :)
<jcater> anyone know of any good data entry operations in ireland?
<drochaid> just as long as you recognise that Sottish single malts are the best!!
<drochaid> jcater, data entry operations?
<jcater> ya
<jcater> company is looking to outsource data entry overseas
<jcater> heard good things about data entry from ireland
<drochaid> hmm
<drochaid> India seems to be the main outsourcing target market for Europe at the moment
<LuftHans> drochaid: if they're better than midletons they've got a good chance of that recognition :)
<drochaid> lol
<jcater> we did india several times
<jcater> bad luck each time
<LuftHans> jcater: remind me tomorrow to check on that
<LuftHans> the person in Dublin who's gonna help me try to get into his company might know
<drochaid> jcater, I didn't say they were any good ;P
<jcater> cool

<nickr> No
<nickr> Its a horrible shambling imposter
<derek> no one can compare to the real nick
<nickr> Hehe
<derek> just never been the same since he left
Action: derek sulks in a pile of industrial meats
<nickr> much less knowitallery I'm sure :)
<Vee2d2> mmm.. industrial meats!
<derek> hmmm... actually nick did know most things debian
<derek> thats what i miss about him
<derek> jbailey is a good replacement, but isnt here enough :)
<nickr> jbailey, pshaw!
<derek> again: <derek> no one can compare to the real nick
<nickr> hehe.
<nickr> I've also become quite proficient in wxPython in the period of my absense
<derek> wow
Action: Vee2d2 smells the owner of a shiney new embroidered GNUe shirt in our midst
<derek> wx is nice but it's just got issues :)
<derek> btw: i have learned to love debian bts in your abscence
<derek> mostly after having to deal with bugzilla way too much
<nickr> wow
<nickr> so you're saying you killed the real derek and replaced him completely?
<derek> i have made my peace with some of it's oddities and just think, could be worse, i could be using bugzilla :)
<nickr> heheh.
<derek> yeah real derek died a while back
<derek> that and jbailey gave me a reason to submit bugs regularly.... and if i get to annoy someone filing bugs, it makes any system fun ;)
<derek> good to see you back, seriously
<nickr> thank you

<alandd> derek: How are you?
<derek> tired
<derek> just got my bills done (yeah!) finally keeping up on getting them in gnucash(double yeah!)
<derek> and was getting ready to email you :)
<derek> can we meet on saturday to do the image for elite pc?
<derek> we have 0.5.1 ready (likely it wont be "packaged" before saturday) but cvs is fairly easy on a debian "woody" or "sid" installation 
<derek> and if they do LTSP its pretty straightforward to install and setup
<derek> basically if they can have a debian woody machine with LTSP ready (with emacs) by time we get there... it should be pretty quick :)
<derek> assuming they have a net connection 
<chillywilly> hi nickr 
<derek> alandd: i am trying to do some demo stuff this week to prepare... will be flying by seat of pants a lot :(
<derek> if it goes well i will ask anyone that enjoyed the session to buy an PLUG shirt or donate directly to AZOTO
Action: Vee2d2 has confidence in derek's pants
<derek> or my wife will kick my butt
<derek> :)
Action: derek goes to make a schema
<derek> student
<derek> class
<derek> schedule
<derek> or should i get the contact form working from gnue-sb
<derek> ah what the heck
Action: derek goes to cvsup the world... watch out savannah here i come
<Vee2d2> where the heck to moz developers idle? 
<Vee2d2> ack, I was fixing to do that.. ;)
Action: Vee2d2 rushes to beat derek to the punch
<derek> oh snap, cvs is restructured... i forgot
<derek> holy moses i had wget on here from cvs and was compiling it....
<Vee2d2> wow.. I dont recall seeing this many changes come through the commit lists.. it must've been a while since I synced
<alandd> derek: the script LuftHans seems to get CVS OK.
Action: derek remembers now i was hacking around groups.yahoo.com crap
<alandd> your pants will hold up.
<alandd> I will let them know that we want a debian woody LTSP server ready.  I hope they can.
<alandd> when were you thinking, roughly, of going over there to setup?
Action: alandd is away: Be right back.
<derek> alandd: thats up to you :)

Action: Vee2d2 goes ahead and upgrades everything to 2.3 rather than waiting on popy
Action: derek does the WAY HAPPY DANCE
<derek> looks like just nailed a $1200/ year hosting contract that should consist of about 5 hours of upfront work of which 2 hours are done!!!!
<Vee2d2> cool
<derek> all i can say is people are dying for providers of decent email
<derek> i.e. that provide solid spam resistance and uptime (not real hard to do on linux)
<Vee2d2> --- Topic for #sodipodi is http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2003/8/4/222054/6295/237#237

<alandd> derek: Ooo... I get to pick the time?  Hmm...  I'll have to check with my wife, who is not here right now :^(
<derek> will she be back before 24:00?
<derek> i should be aroudn until then at least
<alandd> Oh yea.  I expect her before the half hour.  She knows the family weekend schedule.  My personal schedule is wide open.
<alandd> elitepc claims Saturday hours of noon to midnight.  we probably can get in sooner.  I'll double check with them.
<derek> cool, i prepared wife for saturday
<derek> basically if i say computer/work she assumes all day :)
Action: alandd is away: wife arrived, must go help for a bit
<derek> all cvs'es updated downloading 0.5.1 release
<derek> you know our install even w/o packages is pretty painless 
<derek> jcater: you around? Vee2d2?
<Vee2d2> yah?
<derek> if i do a gnue-navigator --version it returns 0.0.5 however if i do a gnue-navigator mygpd.gpd and do Help->About it returns version of 0.0.1
<derek> can anyone else confirm or deny this on the 0.0.5 release tarball
<derek> im looking like mad in cvs and everythign looks labeled 0.0.5
<derek> so i dont know if its  cruft on my system popping up or what
<Vee2d2> I can confirm cvs acts that way
Action: Vee2d2 watches derek get warmed up
<derek> grrr... we need fricken lxr setup :)
<derek> or i need to remember my black belt in cvs commands
<Vee2d2> lxr?
<Vee2d2> cvs add newfiles; cvs ci -m "important fixes"
<derek> Vee2d2: can you cvsupdate and see if its fixed
<Vee2d2> if aiye, 'tis!
<Vee2d2> s/if//

<alandd> im at gilbert and juniper.  I'll drive if you like.  I haven't been to south-ish gilbert in a while.

<derek> http://bonsai.php.net/cvsquery.cgi?branch=HEAD&file=/php-src/pear/&date=month
<derek> would be the output
<derek> wow gilbert and juniper eh
<derek> you are really close

<derek> i can meet you up there and leave my car in that parking lot
<alandd> yep.  I've probably seen him then.  OK.
<derek> hey Vee2d2 have you ever "played" with navigator?
<alandd> I'll make sure I have gas in my truck  ;^)
Action: derek is curious if you knew that you could make it make gnome menus and crap :)
<alandd> 2pm at subway then?
<derek> yip lets do it
<derek> email me your phone number just incase
<alandd> emailing...
<derek> gnue-navigator --install-gnome-menu contacts.gpd for example
<Vee2d2> derek:  only in the breif moments that I created those skimpy copies of navigator files for -sb.. 
<derek> :)
<derek> seesm like that functionality is broked right now
<Vee2d2> no, nothing fancy like that. ;) which seems to bomb here, btw. 
<Vee2d2> I also checked out the gtk ui, which looks pretty darned sweet
<alandd> sent... coolio!
Action: alandd is away: Got to run to the store, grrr...
