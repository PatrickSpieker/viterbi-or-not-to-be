<jamest> any reasons we can't be thinking release?
<Vee2d2> on-startup trigger doesnt fire first? :)
<Vee2d2> touching the trigger drop down on the code editor in designer is still dangerous
<jamest> sigh, i know about the startup trigger thin
<jamest> g
<jamest> before I changed stuff I spoke w/ jcater about it
<jamest> he'd mentioned having some code in designer(?) that could be copied to solve this
<jamest> i should start a list of release bugs I guess
<jamest> i've got some work I think I want to do in gnue but not until after a release
<Vee2d2> that trigger drop down thing is pretty bad, the on-startup issue is up to you guys if it's release critical or not.. I'm not sure if I found a different way to do what I needed or not, been busy with other things so I havent been able to work on that for lately.
<jamest> i hear you there

<chillywilly> him as in dneighbo 
<alandd> ah, busy guy, I know.
<chillywilly> that's not what I meant ;)
<chillywilly> he's usually too busy talking to actually read what you are typing ;)
<chillywilly> or some such thing
<chillywilly> I don't make any sense today
<alandd> OK
<chillywilly> but that is ok
<alandd> sure
<chillywilly> cause I still have the ice weasels
<Vee2d2> derek irc's from the logs... ;)
<chillywilly> and lots of trout
<chillywilly> Vee2d2: heheh, yea
<chillywilly> carrying on a conversation with him can be a bit like pulling teeth
<alandd> I have some good news for him and thought I might beat the email I already sent by catching him here.
<chillywilly> hmmm, you might
<chillywilly> he might respond like 4 hours later ;)
<alandd> I guess he can just read about it in the logs or when he gets around to reading his gnu.org email.
<alandd> hey since I have an ear or two here...
<chillywilly> time to do some real work
<Vee2d2> alandd: so what's the good news? or is it personal..
Action: chillywilly looks at havoc and slinks away
<alandd> tell me about gnue training materials or methods.  Is anything already available/created?
<chillywilly> nah
<chillywilly> we got zilch
<chillywilly> we have sorta outdated developers guides
<jcater> not outdated
<Vee2d2> there not really outdated
<jcater> just incomplete
<Vee2d2> the docs are pretty good, imo
<jcater> or sparse may be a better word
<Vee2d2> yea
<alandd> Vee2d2: it's not personal, really, but I don't want to take the announcement of it away from Derek.  I am helping him establish something and have done my part.  He can direct who gets told.
<Vee2d2> if anything, they're just incomplete
<alandd> OK, I will be starting to learn about it and playing with it so, thought I'd ask.
<chillywilly> ok, incomplete -- you win
<alandd> some say the source is the only real complete documentation anyway.  And the gnue source is all right there!
<chillywilly> haha
<Vee2d2> and pretty easy to read at that

<jcater> I have enough of my own code to deal with
<chillywilly> alrighty then
<chillywilly> hmmm, where's Vee2d2's code at?
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> check out gnue-sb
<jcater> and you can see
<jcater> :)
<Vee2d2> I should be making some commits this weekend I imagine.. 
<chillywilly> well I am really itching to do something with twisted
<Vee2d2> provided I finish this other project before then
<chillywilly> it looks very fun
<Vee2d2> hmm maybe time for a cup-a-joe
<chillywilly> I do gnue-sb every day in perl ;)
<chillywilly> yay
<chillywilly> if you were to intergrate mailing lists, irc, web message board, etc. all form of online communication...like a community what type of castegory would that kinda of thin fall under, Groupware?
<chillywilly> just curious
<chillywilly> eh, I suppose sf and savannah are almost like that except you have code too ;)
<chillywilly> just seems like it's a little looser though, not as integrated as it could be or that people may want

<alandd> LuftHans: so, you hang out here, do u?
<Vee2d2> is there any other place to hang?
<alandd> I keep coming around looking for dneighbo.
<alandd> yyyeeee...well...no.
<alandd> well, PLUG has two channels offered by members so they are a good place to hang.
<Vee2d2> so I take it you're in Phoenix, too.. 
<alandd> yep.
<alandd> it's a dry heat!
<alandd> i just wish it was a dry warm instead.
<Vee2d2> I'll be glad when ~october's here.. 
<Vee2d2> looking forward to fall.. and then spring.. and then fall.. ;)
<alandd> got that right.
<Vee2d2>  Current conditions at Fort Worth, Fort Worth Alliance Airport, TX, United States: It is 28 C (84 F), windspeed is 8.05 km/h, and visibility is 16.09 km. (Information current as of 2003.07.18 0253 UTC).
<alandd> humidity?
<Vee2d2> 58%
<alandd> ok.  I'll take the dry heat.
<alandd> Going to Illinois this coming week.  not looking forward to the humidity.  maybe it'll make me appreciate the dry heat.
<Vee2d2> I'm going to have to go west sometime if nothing else to understand this 'dry heat' first hand.. ;)
<alandd> turn on your oven to 150.  put your face down by the door.  Open rapidly and feel the heat blast up.  That is what it is like opening your front door on a 110+ day.
<alandd> but, the dry part is the moderator.  at least when you sweat, in evaporates and cools.  have to keep drinking water.
<LuftHans> alandd: two channels from PLUG?
<alandd> yea, one of the guys offered his sleuthlinux(?) channel for general PLUG/Linux use
<LuftHans> ah, the cop from .tx.us :)
<alandd> i guess, dont' remember his name now
<LuftHans> bah, dry heat isn't too bad

<alandd> man, that was a pain!  I got dumped and couldn't come back.
<dneighbo> ouch
<alandd> dneighbo: The date and place is set, then.  u get to do the announcement and as much PR as you want.  Let me know what I can do to help.
<alandd> I've got one friend who wants to drop everything to come and another coworker that has expressed interest.
<dneighbo> you can do all that :)
Action: dneighbo is just kidding
<dneighbo> likely will get some announcement stuff going
<dneighbo> but probably will ask for some PR help
<alandd> the friend wants to help with whatever he can.  a very linux newbie but very willing.
<dneighbo> i think i have about 20 - 25 people on the list current that are interested (that i send update mails too)
<LuftHans> back
<LuftHans> derek: I'll be talking to Beth this weekend, so PR help might be available
<alandd> I'll bet we get 15 there.  the place has 20 computers so we'll have to plan ahead for what we want there.  They will wipe the HDs and install whatever we want for our session.
<alandd> I'll post to the PLUG web site when you get out any content.
<dneighbo> i wish i had a GNU Enterprise Knoppix cd
<dneighbo> Vee2d2: you know if jamest or jcater mentioned a release soon?
<Vee2d2> yes they did
<alandd> a cd like that would be cool!
<LuftHans> derek: that's something I need, so help me get gnue working and I'll have it on Knoppix :)
<dneighbo> GNU Enterprise works just fine
<dneighbo> its just doesnt like german speaking americans with long hair and beards ;)
<alandd> LuftHans: I don't have access to my email client right now or I would check myself.  Who is the PLUGger getting the knoppix CD ready for the show?  is he the same one making copies?  can he help here?
<LuftHans> derek: I've got it running and it even has multiple windows
<dneighbo> btw: that scares the hell out of me
<dneighbo> i.e. if they do a lousy job bundling that
<dneighbo> plug is then giving GNU/Linux a bad name
<dneighbo> would much rather see stock knoppix cd's handed out with plug labels on them (for now)
<dneighbo> until we can FULLY test a PLUG Knoppix CD
<dneighbo> imho
<dneighbo> but thats for antoher channel
<dneighbo> like #phoenixlug 
<LuftHans> alandd: Austin is doing the Knoppix CD
<alandd> OK
<LuftHans> derek: it'll be stock CD with PLUG images ( and welcome page if I can write it this weekend ), plus Austin's good, he's not likely to make a mistake
<LuftHans> #pfug :)
Action: LuftHans just passed up an op to go to a movie, so y'all better be entertaining ;-)
<alandd> dneighbo: do you really want a GNUe/Knoppix CD?  I'll explore that for you.
<dneighbo> what movie?
<dneighbo> well i think it would be nice
<dneighbo> i need some experienced folks to run a booth in San Francisco in August :)
<LuftHans> ${disney_ride_of_the_week_gone_movie}
<LuftHans> I was wondering if you're going up again this year
Action: dneighbo thinks they gave us one eventhough  i never asked
<dneighbo> i dont think i have the cash to go :(
<dneighbo> but would love to
<alandd> LuftHans: saw it.  not bad really.
<dneighbo> would love to escape with the wife
<LuftHans> I'm definitely short on cash, but if you help me earn some in the next few weeks I might be able to make it ;-)
<LuftHans> any docs on getting started on a project once you have the beast installed and running?
<alandd> i'm chewing up my vacation time next week.  it would be fun.  talking linux world, right?
Action: LuftHans has his connection setup with a cheesy db on the backend
<dneighbo> um sept 20th there will be a class on what to do when you have it up and running P:)
Action: alandd is away: Tuck in kid duty...
<LuftHans> derek: well that's too late for the gig and too late for the booth :(
<dneighbo> well i can have an earlier session maybe on the 23rd at aztech
<dneighbo> in the booth
<LuftHans> derek: OK, but I'll be working on it this weekend as well
Action: LuftHans looks at the GNUe forms document
<dneighbo> is this EMR stuff?
<LuftHans> by jove, this might actually be useful!!!  ;-)
<dneighbo> maybe i can just help you
Action: dneighbo isnt looking for money
<LuftHans> derek: yup, for emr.
<dneighbo> well actually some of that wouldnt hurt right now
<dneighbo> but i told kyle i would do pro bono if it helped the gospel of tux
<LuftHans> derek: I need to convert access muck to postgres, build an app around the data and possibly integrate it with sql-ledger
Action: alandd is back (gone 00:03:42)
<alandd> dneighbo: sept 20th is a class?  where?
<dneighbo> er
<dneighbo> august something
<dneighbo> sept 20th is day soccer starts
Action: dneighbo has too much going on in this brain
<alandd> and it's late, i know.
<alandd> you meant to refer to the date we now have?
<LuftHans> derek: don't do aug class the same time as LWE, bitte :)
<alandd> LWE?
<LuftHans> Linux World Expo
<LuftHans> G/LWE around here ;-)
<LuftHans> bah, that's in two weeks
Action: LuftHans is out.
<dneighbo> i think L(sic) WE is 1st week in august
<dneighbo> btw Linux (sic) World Expo is how FSF acknowledges it ;)
<alandd> 5th-7th
<LuftHans> yup, 4 - 7
<alandd> class is on the . . . should I say it?
<dneighbo> you can as i dont have right by me
<dneighbo> 30th
<alandd> Saturday, August 30th at ElitePC
<dneighbo> August 30th
--- Fri Jul 18 2003
<alandd> LuftHans: still too late for you?
<alandd> that's when they had the room available.
<LuftHans> still too late for the current project, they need something ASAP ( isn't that always the case? )
<LuftHans> I'll work through docs and figure stuff out on my own for now, but will be bugging derek and other #gnuenterp denizens :)
Action: alandd ASAP.  I ahve been hearing that all week.  always the week before vacation.
<LuftHans> alandd: well, since you're leaving on vacation remind them that asap is at the earliest in two weeks ;-)
<alandd> well, it's just one week this time but, yea, they know, i got the emergency stuff done today but my main project is now suffering a 3 day deficit.
<LuftHans> alandd: well the week of vaca and this week, when you'll be preparing for time off not for new projects 
Action: LuftHans even switched to KDE to get GNUe working
<alandd> GNUe doesn't like GNOME?
Action: alandd i use kde anyway
<LuftHans> not when GNOME in testing is borken such that you can't resize windows
<alandd> i figure gnue is a "debian based" project.  How well does it do on Redhat
Action: alandd getting ready to duck.
<LuftHans> gute nacht alan
<alandd> no, really.  We have redhat servers at Adtron.  they know the name.  could I expect gnue to run on it?
<LuftHans> ah, I thought you meant go to bed :)
<LuftHans> alandd: I got gnue running from cvs because the debian packages are borken, the same should work on other GNU/Linux distros
<alandd> i hope to try it before the class.  the database on the back end will be new to me too.  fun! fun!
<LuftHans> I think that mysql is better setup using RH than postgresql
<LuftHans> derek will probably encourage the latter, though :)
<alandd> that will be my first learning curve.
<LuftHans> db stuff isn't too hard, even I can get them setup
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-126.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
Action: LuftHans restarts gfdes to get it in english
<LuftHans> lots of errors :(
<alandd> i'm not really worried about it. just new stuff.
<alandd> sorry im distracted.  still researching my trip.
<LuftHans> enjoy it
Action: LuftHans is working on a demo GNUe XML form. Good thing there's a 'using a text editor' section since gfdes isn't working
<alandd> gfdes is a german translator?  you are working on a german project?
<LuftHans> gnue form designer, the starting point for GNUe
<alandd> ok. Im getting in deep here in the maps of kansas city.  I better go.  Im excited about this class!

<LuftHans> is there an XML syntax checker that will indicate what's wrong without all this traceback crap?
<dneighbo> mysql is a piece of crap
<dneighbo> seriously
<LuftHans> mysql? this is a python problem
mouns (mouns@62.212.97.112) joined #gnuenterprise.
<LuftHans> I need to know what the supposed syntax error was, not what fx() begat what fx() begat what fx()...
<dneighbo> what is wrong with designer
<dneighbo> last i heard it pretty close to having most bugs fixed
<dneighbo> plese note you need wxPython 2.4
<dneighbo> er please
<dneighbo> need the error to be of help
<LuftHans> designer throws errors when trying to 'continue' when choosing a data source, it's borking on the sample xml form. I think I have it done w/o typos
<dneighbo> did you make the xml file from hand
<LuftHans>  DB000: AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'supportedDataObjects'
Action: dneighbo isnt sure what exactly you have or havent done
<LuftHans> that's the last error from trying to continue after choosing a data source
Action: dneighbo truthfully hasnt done GNU Enterprise stuff for nearly a month :(
<LuftHans> created form by hand per the forms docs since designer isn't working
<dneighbo> probably your form is toast
Action: LuftHans is following the zipcodes example in the forms doc
<dneighbo> doing xml by hand is less than optimal (way easy to hose up)
<dneighbo> also if you copied something out of the docs likely they are inaccurate
<dneighbo> try as we might... development happens faster than documentation
<LuftHans> "DB000: KeyError: zipcode" is the open the gfd error, don't know what it means, the entries with zipcode seem to be correct per the forms doc
<LuftHans> well, I need a starting point :)
<dneighbo> do you have  a database 
<dneighbo> do you have a table
<dneighbo> does the table have zipcode field?
<LuftHans> wxPython 2.4.0.7
<LuftHans> yup, yup, yup
<LuftHans> select * from zipcodes;
<LuftHans>  zipcode | city | state
<dneighbo> can you /msg me the form
Action: LuftHans just tried a dcc send of the form.
<LuftHans> save that as /vmlinuz and reboot to get it to take effect ;-)
<dneighbo> dcc is evil will try it
<dneighbo> no luck with the dcc
<dneighbo> please email it
<LuftHans> it's in the mail :)
<LuftHans> doesn't the PHP thingy have a validator?
<dneighbo> ?
<dneighbo> php thingy
<LuftHans> the PHP parser for gfd docs
<dneighbo> stay away from that
<dneighbo> its not usuable for anything remotely close to production
<LuftHans> why? is it borken?
<dneighbo> unless you want to contribute code to make it work :)
<dneighbo> web apps are shite anyhow ;)
<LuftHans> hmm, I need web-based for this app, that's more important than stand-along
<LuftHans> s/ong/one/
<LuftHans> well, I can help with PHP :)
<dneighbo> is this the error you get
<dneighbo> DB000:   File "/home/dneighbo/cvs/gnue/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/forms/GFObjects/GFEntry.py", line 94, in initialize
<dneighbo> DB000:     raise "Entry references non-existent field '%s'" % self.field
<dneighbo> DB000: Entry references non-existent field 'zipcode'
<dneighbo> ah gack
<dneighbo> form spec has changed radically
<LuftHans> nope
<ajmitch> g'evning
<dneighbo> stopped editing dumb files by hand when designer got better
<dneighbo> forgot about the namespacing
<dneighbo> hans
<dneighbo> run
<dneighbo> cvs/gnue/forms/samples/zipcode/zipcode.gfd
<dneighbo> does that work?
<dneighbo> if not your setup is messed
<LuftHans> ok, that one opens *and* only a few Gdk-CRITICAL errors
<LuftHans> gc == garbage collection?
<dneighbo> that is wx stuff
<dneighbo> the Gdk-CRITICAL errors
<dneighbo> cause GNOME sux ass lately :(
<LuftHans> GNOME?
Action: LuftHans is running KDE because GNOME was borky, borky.
<dneighbo> hmm your first form has something goofy
<dneighbo> researching
<LuftHans> DB000: AttributeError: GFLabel instance has no attribute 'text'
<dneighbo> ok figured it out
<dneighbo> you still have original form you sent me?
<LuftHans> yup
<dneighbo> silly error
Action: dneighbo is not a huge block fan
<dneighbo> change
<dneighbo> <entry c:x="13" c:y="1" c:width="5" block="ZipBlock" field="zipcode"/>
<dneighbo> to be

<dneighbo> save form then try to run
<LuftHans> oooh, it opens :)
<LuftHans> how do I 'run' it?
<LuftHans> found a 'run form' under tools, whcih gives a bunch of errors
<LuftHans> gnue.common.datasources.drivers.postgresql.psycopg does not contain dbdrivers
<dneighbo> ?
<dneighbo> gnue-forms formname.gfd
<dneighbo> or
<LuftHans> that seems bad
<dneighbo> gfcvs formname.gfd
<dneighbo> or what ever it takes to 'run' it
<dneighbo> im not sure what you mean by RUN it
<dneighbo> i thought you were running it
<dneighbo> otherwise how did you get errors?
<LuftHans> no db driver for psycopg
<LuftHans> I've been in gfdes and looking at layout editor
<Vee2d2> apt-get -uf install python2.2-psycopg
<dneighbo> what Vee2d2 said
<dneighbo> Vee2d2: i just played with designer found 2 major bugs
Action: Vee2d2 -uf's out of habbit.. 
<Vee2d2> dneighbo: dont touch the trigger drop down on the code editor.. :) 
<dneighbo> a. in schema editor there is no 'scrollbar' so if you have say 100 tables no way to scroll down, if you use the keys it REALLY fubars things
<Vee2d2> and if you make an entry hidden, then touch the property editor you'll probably discover segfault or something.. but I think he fixed that one
<dneighbo> b. if you use the wizard it saves height attributes as "1.0" intead of "1" which errors out when running the form
<dneighbo> hans your form here is working like a little champ
<dneighbo> after those three lines of editing
<Vee2d2> dneighbo: is the schema nav a tree style widget?
<Vee2d2> dneighbo: because that should be fixed in cvs, I think. 
<LuftHans> user/passwd for GNUe is the user/passwd combo for the db?
<dneighbo> it is tree style widget
<dneighbo> i just updated cvs to no avail....
<dneighbo> LuftHans: yeah
<Vee2d2> dneighbo: I get a scroll bar.. weird
<dneighbo> i think my cvs is fooed
<dneighbo> i think i accidently got it as 'root' a few cycles back
<Vee2d2> tsh tsh
<dneighbo> no kidding
<dneighbo> crap
<dneighbo> did they turn cvs into modules?
<dneighbo> i.e. how do you checkout the whole mess now
<Vee2d2> yip
<LuftHans> ok, got the form to start and made an entry
Action: dneighbo goes to look at site
Action: dneighbo hates not being around
<Vee2d2> you dont read the list, or what? :)
<dneighbo> ah i knew i saw something somewhere

<LuftHans> did you get gnue-forms-wx to install from the unofficial deb?

<LuftHans> does it have to =2.3, could it =>2.3?
<jbailey> I don't know off hand.
<jbailey> If it needs to be changed to 2.4, I can certainly update it.

<chillywilly> anyone have recommendations for a good NIC that works with linux the cheap one I have sucks with this new driver and the old one times out all the time but it is faster
<dsmith> chillywilly: I've had good experiences with those nics that come up as dc0 in *bsd.  
<dsmith> chillywilly: Linksys perhaps?  One of the cheap ones you can get at compusa.
<chillywilly> havoc says geta Linksys LNE100TX
<dcmwai> chillywilly, Just get the one wit RTL8139 Chipset... it is widel use, cheap and work on linux :)
<dsmith> chillywilly: Yeah, that sounds about right.
<Vee2d2> I've only bought a 'good' net card once, plopped down $100+ for it and it died about a year after I started using it.. was 3com, dont recall which.. 
<chillywilly> I don't mean expensive
<chillywilly> just soemthing that works better than this myson803 card that likes to timeout and now it seems they crippled it with the newer drivers so it'll only do 30k/s
<dcmwai> chillywilly, May be compex will suit your need...
<dcmwai> Compex have a range of product, one of them are value... get It,

<dcmwai> nvm...
<dcmwai> It is just a erp that is incomplete... and our objective is to complete every part of it.. and Joining with Gnue-sb will make things work without double work

<dcmwai> I think I should ask josh and Jcater to workout one.
<Vee2d2> and or derek
<dcmwai> oh yes him... Where is he right now?

<derek> not very
<derek> i.e. same as before
<ToyMan> hey derek
<derek> wrt to web interface
<derek> other than that
<ToyMan> hmmm.
<derek> its all xml and is highly usable as a backend for web store fronts
<ToyMan> we're doing a franchise operation...
<derek> really i cant imagine running a business off all web backend
<derek> i have seen it with peoplesoft 8
<ToyMan> looking for a way for franchisees to do their financials on-line
<derek> and its rather horrible
<derek> you could do with a GNU Enterprise front end
<ToyMan> and integrate their data into a franchise-wide view
<derek> that uses secure ssh (or vpn) to connect to a backend
<derek> or you could have them do all local and use vpn to 'pump' their data on regular basis
<ToyMan> anyway... how's the project coming along.. havn't checked in for a long time
<derek> depending on if you want consolidations or actually want to treat them like a 'extension of home'

<derek> who is peter?
<derek> btw: no websetup can convince me
<derek> i have seen some really good ones
<derek> the problem is the web makes for a HORRIBLY inefficient UI
<derek> unless you use java applets or activeX controls
<derek> but then you are not a 'web application' you are an application in a web browser 
<LuftHans> Peter is one of the Germans
<LuftHans> no js, no java
<derek> ie you lose all the good reasons to use a web app (as you have to deploy stuff client side)
<LuftHans> I think you know I hate web UIs more than you do :), but this one's pretty good
<derek> basically if its not java/activeX etc its stateless which makes for horridly inefficient refreshes
<derek> not saying there are ones that arent 'decent'
<derek> but not something i would want a large client running backend services on soley
<LuftHans> I'm certain he's using more bandwidth than he would be by using a local app with a tunnel to the back end, but it's damned quick, including popping up dozens of images of forms that have been scanned in
<LuftHans> most of his app is lookup with some notes being added, so it's workable
<derek> my problem is for example my online banking application
<LuftHans> even as quick as the interface is, it would suck for data entry/manipulation
<derek> it is rather killer

<derek> its 'stateless' refresh times are so horrible it's nearly unusable :(
<LuftHans> well, he's feeding small businesses with at most 3500 people to hit it
<derek> when i bank at middle of night when no one is around i think its best thing since slice bread
<derek> also im glad its web based as i can use it with GNU/Linux :)
<LuftHans> he's working on a contract that could take him over 50,000 employees to hit the system, don't know how well it will scale
<derek> so im not saying natively webapps are evil hell, just saying its not my favorite choice :)

<Vee> wrt http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/gnue20030614_85.html#5, I've been rescanning the archives to see if some form of roadmap were set for integrating arias with gnue-sb.. 
<Vee> ...They discussed the practical steps involved in merging the code base - Derek said the priorities were to "get dir structure over"  and "get schema converted to gnue schema format" . After that, the priorities, in whatever order people felt was urgent, were to fold in the existing Product and Contact support from GNUe Small Business, and adding the accounting functionality that Jason had requested
<Vee> so the dir structure's there, right? the schema's converted, right? 
<Vee> did Josh get hooked up the other day?
<Vee> heya jbailey
<Vee> .. I was guessing the "<jcater> Vee2d2: if you're around" might've had something to do with the conversation dcmwai and I had earlier.. 
<Vee> btw, another sort of "dont do that" segfault in designer.. grab a label and change it in some way like altering the text, then grab another label, a click anywhere in the property editor yeilds a segfault.. my mistake for not hitting enter after altering the first label, I guess.. ;)

<Vee> I've got a couple entrys that are date/time type..

<Vee> this works, pretty well..
<Vee> however, if I go and enter a timestamp by hand.. I cant seem to make it work.. the client just beeps at me and sometimes tells me via the staus bar that it was invalid input
<pr0c> hmm.. i have to have libwxgtk2.3-python? libwxgtk2.4-python won't work apparently?
<Vee> why not?
<Vee> 2.4 works here
<pr0c> gnue-designer: Depends: libwxgtk2.3-python but it is not installable
<pr0c> i have 2.4 installed

<pr0c> doh!
<Vee> you see /topic ?
<pr0c> i'm reading the topic right now
<Vee> which flavor of debian are you using?
<pr0c> debian unstable
<Vee> I'd recommend just grabbing cvs
<pr0c> actually i followed instructions from the topic to begin with
<Vee> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/community/cvs.html gives instructions on how to obtain via cvs, once you have it, just shimmy into the gnue-common directory and ./setup-cvs.py and it'll set things up for ya.. 
<Vee> or you could wait for 0.5.1 which should be coming out shortly

<pr0c> is there documentation on python script somewhere? I've never used python before. Is python script almost exactly the same as just python?
<Vee> it is exactly the same python.. 
<pr0c> okay then i can just read up on python then. Thanks Vee
<Vee> there's incomplete, but still usefull, documentation in gnue-forms/doc/Developers-Guide.sxw
<Vee> you might also have a look at the forms in the samples directory for working examples
<pr0c> ok, cool. I can't wait until i can drop Access!

<thierry> very interesting
<Vee2d2> thierry: so what's your itch/interest here?
<thierry> i'm participating to the project since 2000

<Vee2d2> neat
<Vee2d2> what's the company do?
<thierry> consulting
<thierry> i'm python/C developer and zope expert
<thierry> i developed PoPy python/PG driver (The project will merge w/ pygresql for its next release)
Arturas (~arturas@gsk.vtu.lt) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> Hello
<thierry> hi Arturas
<Vee2d2> this is my first experience with python, but so far it's been rather transparent 
<Vee2d2> 'sup Arturas
<thierry> Vee2d2: python is very intuitive
<Vee2d2> thierry: oh, that's even more interesting.. :)
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-7.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<thierry> Vee2d2: :).. I'm developing some BO concepts on XMLRPC protocol
<thierry> like object transparent persistence in relational db,... 
<Vee2d2> thierry: I tried popy last week but had to revert back to psycopg because it breaks designer's schema navigator.. apparently because of the way it returns types.. like it was expecting oid to be returned as a int type but was getting a str, I think.. *shrug*
<thierry> it's complex to deal w/ oid type
<thierry> each table has an oid and lob are also using oid
<thierry> but it's strange that popy returns an str for oid.... :/
<Vee2d2> I'm only assuming it was a str.. :)
<Vee2d2> it wasnt an int
<Vee2d2> going in and doing a print "%d" on the var threw an error.. but %s worked
<thierry> could you send me a traceback to thierry@xtensive.com ?
<Vee2d2> of which? the original error?
<thierry> yep

<Vee2d2> morning ToyMan
<thierry> hi ToyMan
<thierry> Vee2d2: I would like to provide services for SB and associations in east of france
<thierry> but in asp mode
<Vee2d2> hmm.. I want a field to carry the last entry in the db in it.. something like select field from table order by id desc limit 1, 
Action: thierry is reading the Vee2d2's email...
Action: Vee2d2 adds an order_by= to his datasource
<thierry> from which table did you get 'oid' ?  could you paste me the select you do ?
<ToyMan> morning all
<Vee2d2> thierry: do you have cvs of gnue somewhere? 
<thierry> an old one...
<thierry> i can get the new one easily
<Vee2d2> gnue-common/src/datasources/drivers/postgresql/Base/Driver.py ~188 is where the error occurs, IIRC
<thierry> ok i'll get a look
<jamest> hello
<thierry> how are you jamest ?
<jamest> busy/tired
<jamest> but ok :)
<jamest> and you?
<thierry> hehe :)
<thierry> very well, busy too
<thierry> i changed company
<jamest> you were working on popy right?
<thierry> yep
<thierry> did you read the announce about pygresql/popy project merging ?
<jamest> nope
<jamest> i'm really out of touch w/ all things gnue at the moment
<jamest> don't think i've read by gnue/db mail in a few weeks
<jamest> yeah, i suck
<thierry> :)
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> for some reason my remote quota daemon bound itself to the port spamassass uses
Action: jamest grabs a trout and heads toward server
SachaS_ (~Sacha@dialup-196-208.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Vee2d2> hmm.. this timeclock form works well with one exception.. my timestamp entries dont seem to respect the display masks
<Vee2d2> when I bring up records I only see the date
<thierry> Vee2d2: I saw what is the problem w/ popy
<Vee2d2> thierry: cool, so will it be fixed? :)
<thierry> right now!
<Vee2d2> irc is a beautiful thing
<thierry> popy tries to detect LOB and handles them transparently
<thierry> but as oid is used by tables, the automatic detection is impossible IMHO
<thierry> so, LOB are not handled by default by popy and oid too...
<jamest> just out of curiosity does popy deal with ' properly?
<jamest> i do things like 
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-7.wasp.net.au) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<jamest> execute("insert into foo values (%(keyName)s)",dictionaryVarContainingKey)
<jamest> i tested out some of my forms with pygresql and it did the right thing wrt strings that contained '
<jamest> however one of my users told me the other day that strings with ' in them choaked the form
<jamest> the only change I recall was going to popy
Action: jamest has hod 0 time to look at gnue's code, the users example, or anything
<jamest> so it could be user error but I figured since the popy author was here for abuse
<jamest> it was too good to pass up
<thierry> popy has problem with quoting
Action: Vee2d2 notes jamest's still holding the trout
<thierry> we are working on it and a better types converter
<derek> bonjour mon ami 
<jamest> ok, thanks as you've saved me some time
<thierry> bonjour derek, comment vas-tu ?
<jamest> thierry popy is quite good at dealing with timestamps though
<jamest> which is why i switched to it as the other driver would truncate the data returned
<thierry> jamest: i will try to do last patches to the actual popy driver before new project begins
<derek> comme ci comme ca
<thierry> what's up ?
<Vee2d2> hmm.. 
<derek> long temps ne voyez pas (man my french is RUSTY)
Action: Vee2d2 ponders how to get the form to display the time as well.. 
Action: derek hopes that said something like long time no see
Action: Vee2d2 borrows jamest's trout
<derek> Vee2d2: you have it all wrong...
<derek> trout are for people
<derek> hammers are for bad forms
Action: derek hands Vee2d2 a suitable hammer
Action: Vee2d2 throws his hands and just grabs derek instead
Action: derek runs screaming
<jamest> damn man
<jamest> swinging derek is going to take some serious upper body strength
<Vee2d2> :)
<Vee2d2> whatever it takes
<jamest> oooo, just have him hold still and swing the pc at him instead
<derek> rofl
<derek> jamest: remember what happens to pc's that get near me
<derek> better be willing to sacrifice that pc ;)
<Vee2d2> hmm.. looks like the gfd04to05.py link gets forgotten in the post-restructured setup-cvs.py
<Vee2d2> mine's still pointing to the old directory
<thierry> Vee2d2: I sent you the last version of popy 2.0.10 now oid are handled as int

<Vee2d2> jcater: WOO!
Action: Vee2d2 strikes one off his list
<Vee2d2> ;)
<jcater> lol
<Vee2d2> you want the list just to make sure you arent missing any? :) I added one related to mysql yesterday
<Vee2d2> didnt have the patience to really find out why it happened so I just switched to postgresql
<jcater> sure
<jcater> erm, I'm behind a firewall
<jcater> better email that to me
<jcater> jcater @ gnue
<Vee2d2> oh cool Block Tabs!
Action: Vee2d2 rushes to up
<jcater> I wonder what people would think of http://backtalk.sourceforge.net/
<jcater> I've debated about testing it out for almost a year now
<jcater> it's basically online book editing
Action: jcater is thinking the dev guide he's working on
<jcater> The Zope Book (http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Books/ZDG/current/index_html) uses it
<jcater> oops, http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Books/ZopeBook/2_6Edition is current url
<Vee2d2> if it's some sorta wiki thing I think that'd be cool.. I find the online php manual indespensible with all it's annotations from users.. 
Action: jcater goes back to coding, knowing full well he's going to get flaimed
<jcater> Vee2d2: yeah, it's a lot like the PHP manual
<Vee2d2> that'd rock.. 
<Vee2d2> flamed.. after those commits today? pushaw.. 
Action: jcater is never worried about flaming from Vee2d2
Action: Vee2d2 slides the hard lemonaide down..

<Vee2d2> oh yea... popy got fixed... 
Action: Vee2d2 whaks another off
<jcater> did you email that list?
<Vee2d2> no but I can ina sec
<Vee2d2> gonna try & kids to sleep  brb
R45 (~rastabeen@cuscon396.tstt.net.tt) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Vee2d2> send
<Vee2d2> sented to!
<drochaid> and scented?
<Vee2d2> it was a pretty stinky one
<drochaid> even the sweet smell of roses are nurtured by shit :)
Action: Vee2d2 pokes jcater and urges him to listen to what drochaid says.. 
<Vee2d2> man.. that's topic worthy.. ;)

<Vee2d2> jcater: man.. this is awesome..
<jcater> ?
Action: Vee2d2 plays with the trigger dropdown
Action: jcater is doing several forms for the wife tonight
<jcater> all using designer
<jcater> hence the usability commits :)
<Vee2d2> it's everything I dreamed it would be.. :)
<Vee2d2> the block tabs Rock! too.. 
<Vee2d2> I'm all for a 0.5.1 now.. you guys have my vote fwiw.. 
<jcater> I've hit a bug in forms I need fixed first
<jcater> if you mark an entry as non-navigable
<jcater> you can still click on it in the wxWindows-driver
<jcater> the wx focus changes
<jcater> but the forms focus doesn't change
<Vee2d2> I think I made mine nonnav and readonly
<Vee2d2> wasnt there a gsd tool in designer before?
<Vee2d2> what's the proper method for creating a gsd now?
<jcater> I think there is
<jcater> I created a .gsd for Arias using designer
<jcater> the wizards, iircx
<jcater> but there aren't really any good editing tools for .gsd in designer yet
<jcater> just creation
<Vee2d2> that's all I was looking for
<Vee2d2> aha
<Vee2d2> which answers another question I was brewing wrt creating reports.. ;)
<Vee2d2> I dont plan to ask any reports related questions until I've had a chance to fully delve into the gnue-reports directory..
