<jamest> any reasons we can't be thinking release?
<Vee2d2> on-startup trigger doesnt fire first? :)
<Vee2d2> touching the trigger drop down on the code editor in designer is still dangerous
<jamest> sigh, i know about the startup trigger thin
<jamest> g
<jamest> before I changed stuff I spoke w/ jcater about it
<jamest> he'd mentioned having some code in designer(?) that could be copied to solve this
<jamest> i should start a list of release bugs I guess
<jamest> i've got some work I think I want to do in gnue but not until after a release
<Vee2d2> that trigger drop down thing is pretty bad, the on-startup issue is up to you guys if it's release critical or not.. I'm not sure if I found a different way to do what I needed or not, been busy with other things so I havent been able to work on that for lately.
<jamest> i hear you there

<chillywilly> him as in dneighbo 
<alandd> ah, busy guy, I know.
<chillywilly> that's not what I meant ;)
<chillywilly> he's usually too busy talking to actually read what you are typing ;)
<chillywilly> or some such thing
<chillywilly> I don't make any sense today
<alandd> OK
<chillywilly> but that is ok
<alandd> sure
<chillywilly> cause I still have the ice weasels
<Vee2d2> derek irc's from the logs... ;)
<chillywilly> and lots of trout
<chillywilly> Vee2d2: heheh, yea
<chillywilly> carrying on a conversation with him can be a bit like pulling teeth
<alandd> I have some good news for him and thought I might beat the email I already sent by catching him here.
<chillywilly> hmmm, you might
<chillywilly> he might respond like 4 hours later ;)
<alandd> I guess he can just read about it in the logs or when he gets around to reading his gnu.org email.
<alandd> hey since I have an ear or two here...
<chillywilly> time to do some real work
<Vee2d2> alandd: so what's the good news? or is it personal..
Action: chillywilly looks at havoc and slinks away
<alandd> tell me about gnue training materials or methods.  Is anything already available/created?
<chillywilly> nah
<chillywilly> we got zilch
<chillywilly> we have sorta outdated developers guides
<jcater> not outdated
<Vee2d2> there not really outdated
<jcater> just incomplete
<Vee2d2> the docs are pretty good, imo
<jcater> or sparse may be a better word
<Vee2d2> yea
<alandd> Vee2d2: it's not personal, really, but I don't want to take the announcement of it away from Derek.  I am helping him establish something and have done my part.  He can direct who gets told.
<Vee2d2> if anything, they're just incomplete
<alandd> OK, I will be starting to learn about it and playing with it so, thought I'd ask.
<chillywilly> ok, incomplete -- you win
<alandd> some say the source is the only real complete documentation anyway.  And the gnue source is all right there!
<chillywilly> haha
<Vee2d2> and pretty easy to read at that

<jcater> I have enough of my own code to deal with
<chillywilly> alrighty then
<chillywilly> hmmm, where's Vee2d2's code at?
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> check out gnue-sb
<jcater> and you can see
<jcater> :)
<Vee2d2> I should be making some commits this weekend I imagine.. 
<chillywilly> well I am really itching to do something with twisted
<Vee2d2> provided I finish this other project before then
<chillywilly> it looks very fun
<Vee2d2> hmm maybe time for a cup-a-joe
<chillywilly> I do gnue-sb every day in perl ;)
<chillywilly> yay
<chillywilly> if you were to intergrate mailing lists, irc, web message board, etc. all form of online communication...like a community what type of castegory would that kinda of thin fall under, Groupware?
<chillywilly> just curious
<chillywilly> eh, I suppose sf and savannah are almost like that except you have code too ;)
<chillywilly> just seems like it's a little looser though, not as integrated as it could be or that people may want

<alandd> LuftHans: so, you hang out here, do u?
<Vee2d2> is there any other place to hang?
<alandd> I keep coming around looking for dneighbo.
<alandd> yyyeeee...well...no.
<alandd> well, PLUG has two channels offered by members so they are a good place to hang.
<Vee2d2> so I take it you're in Phoenix, too.. 
<alandd> yep.
<alandd> it's a dry heat!
<alandd> i just wish it was a dry warm instead.
<Vee2d2> I'll be glad when ~october's here.. 
<Vee2d2> looking forward to fall.. and then spring.. and then fall.. ;)
<alandd> got that right.
<Vee2d2>  Current conditions at Fort Worth, Fort Worth Alliance Airport, TX, United States: It is 28 C (84 F), windspeed is 8.05 km/h, and visibility is 16.09 km. (Information current as of 2003.07.18 0253 UTC).
<alandd> humidity?
<Vee2d2> 58%
<alandd> ok.  I'll take the dry heat.
<alandd> Going to Illinois this coming week.  not looking forward to the humidity.  maybe it'll make me appreciate the dry heat.
<Vee2d2> I'm going to have to go west sometime if nothing else to understand this 'dry heat' first hand.. ;)
<alandd> turn on your oven to 150.  put your face down by the door.  Open rapidly and feel the heat blast up.  That is what it is like opening your front door on a 110+ day.
<alandd> but, the dry part is the moderator.  at least when you sweat, in evaporates and cools.  have to keep drinking water.
<LuftHans> alandd: two channels from PLUG?
<alandd> yea, one of the guys offered his sleuthlinux(?) channel for general PLUG/Linux use
<LuftHans> ah, the cop from .tx.us :)
<alandd> i guess, dont' remember his name now
<LuftHans> bah, dry heat isn't too bad
<alandd> LuftHans: check your dccchat requests...
<LuftHans> alandd: trying to figure out how to accept one :)

Action: alandd is away: Kid care again.
<dneighbo> see now we need a #phoenixlug here
<dneighbo> alandd: i got your email it sounds great
<dneighbo> i dont think i have conflicts that weekend :)
Action: dneighbo was worried about soccer games at first
Action: dneighbo might be back in a little bit not sure, debating going to bed or not.. i should be around tomorrow though
Action: alandd is back (gone 00:08:01)
<LuftHans> derek: I need to get gnue going or I'll be using PHP for the emr conversion :)
<alandd> AUGH! I missed dneighbo!!!
Action: alandd but he responded, precious!
<LuftHans> *my* precious!
<LuftHans> :)
<alandd> oops.
<dneighbo> im here still
Action: dneighbo wants to break whomever broke libspell in sid

<alandd> man, that was a pain!  I got dumped and couldn't come back.
<dneighbo> ouch
<alandd> dneighbo: The date and place is set, then.  u get to do the announcement and as much PR as you want.  Let me know what I can do to help.
<alandd> I've got one friend who wants to drop everything to come and another coworker that has expressed interest.
<dneighbo> you can do all that :)
Action: dneighbo is just kidding
<dneighbo> likely will get some announcement stuff going
<dneighbo> but probably will ask for some PR help
<alandd> the friend wants to help with whatever he can.  a very linux newbie but very willing.
<dneighbo> i think i have about 20 - 25 people on the list current that are interested (that i send update mails too)
<LuftHans> back
<LuftHans> derek: I'll be talking to Beth this weekend, so PR help might be available
<alandd> I'll bet we get 15 there.  the place has 20 computers so we'll have to plan ahead for what we want there.  They will wipe the HDs and install whatever we want for our session.
<alandd> I'll post to the PLUG web site when you get out any content.
<dneighbo> i wish i had a GNU Enterprise Knoppix cd
<dneighbo> Vee2d2: you know if jamest or jcater mentioned a release soon?
<Vee2d2> yes they did
<alandd> a cd like that would be cool!
<LuftHans> derek: that's something I need, so help me get gnue working and I'll have it on Knoppix :)
<dneighbo> GNU Enterprise works just fine
<dneighbo> its just doesnt like german speaking americans with long hair and beards ;)
<alandd> LuftHans: I don't have access to my email client right now or I would check myself.  Who is the PLUGger getting the knoppix CD ready for the show?  is he the same one making copies?  can he help here?
<LuftHans> derek: I've got it running and it even has multiple windows
<dneighbo> btw: that scares the hell out of me
<dneighbo> i.e. if they do a lousy job bundling that
<dneighbo> plug is then giving GNU/Linux a bad name
<dneighbo> would much rather see stock knoppix cd's handed out with plug labels on them (for now)
<dneighbo> until we can FULLY test a PLUG Knoppix CD
<dneighbo> imho
<dneighbo> but thats for antoher channel
<dneighbo> like #phoenixlug 
<LuftHans> alandd: Austin is doing the Knoppix CD
<alandd> OK
<LuftHans> derek: it'll be stock CD with PLUG images ( and welcome page if I can write it this weekend ), plus Austin's good, he's not likely to make a mistake
<LuftHans> #pfug :)
Action: LuftHans just passed up an op to go to a movie, so y'all better be entertaining ;-)
<alandd> dneighbo: do you really want a GNUe/Knoppix CD?  I'll explore that for you.
<dneighbo> what movie?
<dneighbo> well i think it would be nice
<dneighbo> i need some experienced folks to run a booth in San Francisco in August :)
<LuftHans> ${disney_ride_of_the_week_gone_movie}
<LuftHans> I was wondering if you're going up again this year
Action: dneighbo thinks they gave us one eventhough  i never asked
<dneighbo> i dont think i have the cash to go :(
<dneighbo> but would love to
<alandd> LuftHans: saw it.  not bad really.
<dneighbo> would love to escape with the wife
<LuftHans> I'm definitely short on cash, but if you help me earn some in the next few weeks I might be able to make it ;-)
<LuftHans> any docs on getting started on a project once you have the beast installed and running?
<alandd> i'm chewing up my vacation time next week.  it would be fun.  talking linux world, right?
Action: LuftHans has his connection setup with a cheesy db on the backend
<dneighbo> um sept 20th there will be a class on what to do when you have it up and running P:)
Action: alandd is away: Tuck in kid duty...
<LuftHans> derek: well that's too late for the gig and too late for the booth :(
<dneighbo> well i can have an earlier session maybe on the 23rd at aztech
<dneighbo> in the booth
<LuftHans> derek: OK, but I'll be working on it this weekend as well
Action: LuftHans looks at the GNUe forms document
<dneighbo> is this EMR stuff?
<LuftHans> by jove, this might actually be useful!!!  ;-)
<dneighbo> maybe i can just help you
Action: dneighbo isnt looking for money
<LuftHans> derek: yup, for emr.
<dneighbo> well actually some of that wouldnt hurt right now
<dneighbo> but i told kyle i would do pro bono if it helped the gospel of tux
<LuftHans> derek: I need to convert access muck to postgres, build an app around the data and possibly integrate it with sql-ledger
Action: alandd is back (gone 00:03:42)
<alandd> dneighbo: sept 20th is a class?  where?
<dneighbo> er
<dneighbo> august something
<dneighbo> sept 20th is day soccer starts
Action: dneighbo has too much going on in this brain
<alandd> and it's late, i know.
<alandd> you meant to refer to the date we now have?
<LuftHans> derek: don't do aug class the same time as LWE, bitte :)
<alandd> LWE?
<LuftHans> Linux World Expo
<LuftHans> G/LWE around here ;-)
<LuftHans> bah, that's in two weeks
Action: LuftHans is out.
<dneighbo> i think L(sic) WE is 1st week in august
<dneighbo> btw Linux (sic) World Expo is how FSF acknowledges it ;)
<alandd> 5th-7th
<LuftHans> yup, 4 - 7
<alandd> class is on the . . . should I say it?
<dneighbo> you can as i dont have right by me
