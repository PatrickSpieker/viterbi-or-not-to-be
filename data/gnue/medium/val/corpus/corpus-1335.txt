<alandd> LuftHans: still too late for you?
<alandd> that's when they had the room available.
<LuftHans> still too late for the current project, they need something ASAP ( isn't that always the case? )
<LuftHans> I'll work through docs and figure stuff out on my own for now, but will be bugging derek and other #gnuenterp denizens :)
Action: alandd ASAP.  I ahve been hearing that all week.  always the week before vacation.
<LuftHans> alandd: well, since you're leaving on vacation remind them that asap is at the earliest in two weeks ;-)
<alandd> well, it's just one week this time but, yea, they know, i got the emergency stuff done today but my main project is now suffering a 3 day deficit.
<LuftHans> alandd: well the week of vaca and this week, when you'll be preparing for time off not for new projects 
Action: LuftHans even switched to KDE to get GNUe working
<alandd> GNUe doesn't like GNOME?
Action: alandd i use kde anyway
<LuftHans> not when GNOME in testing is borken such that you can't resize windows
<alandd> i figure gnue is a "debian based" project.  How well does it do on Redhat
Action: alandd getting ready to duck.
<LuftHans> gute nacht alan
<alandd> no, really.  We have redhat servers at Adtron.  they know the name.  could I expect gnue to run on it?
<LuftHans> ah, I thought you meant go to bed :)
<LuftHans> alandd: I got gnue running from cvs because the debian packages are borken, the same should work on other GNU/Linux distros
<alandd> i hope to try it before the class.  the database on the back end will be new to me too.  fun! fun!
<LuftHans> I think that mysql is better setup using RH than postgresql
<LuftHans> derek will probably encourage the latter, though :)
<alandd> that will be my first learning curve.
<LuftHans> db stuff isn't too hard, even I can get them setup
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-126.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
Action: LuftHans restarts gfdes to get it in english
<LuftHans> lots of errors :(
<alandd> i'm not really worried about it. just new stuff.
<alandd> sorry im distracted.  still researching my trip.
<LuftHans> enjoy it
Action: LuftHans is working on a demo GNUe XML form. Good thing there's a 'using a text editor' section since gfdes isn't working
<alandd> gfdes is a german translator?  you are working on a german project?
<LuftHans> gnue form designer, the starting point for GNUe
<alandd> ok. Im getting in deep here in the maps of kansas city.  I better go.  Im excited about this class!
alandd (~alandd@h-66-167-42-94.PHNDAZ91.covad.net) left irc: " good night!"
<dneighbo> alan run off to bed already
<LuftHans> he's off checking out KC
<LuftHans> is there an XML syntax checker that will indicate what's wrong without all this traceback crap?
<dneighbo> mysql is a piece of crap
<dneighbo> seriously
<LuftHans> mysql? this is a python problem
mouns (mouns@62.212.97.112) joined #gnuenterprise.
<LuftHans> I need to know what the supposed syntax error was, not what fx() begat what fx() begat what fx()...
<dneighbo> what is wrong with designer
<dneighbo> last i heard it pretty close to having most bugs fixed
<dneighbo> plese note you need wxPython 2.4
<dneighbo> er please
<dneighbo> need the error to be of help
<LuftHans> designer throws errors when trying to 'continue' when choosing a data source, it's borking on the sample xml form. I think I have it done w/o typos
<dneighbo> did you make the xml file from hand
<LuftHans>  DB000: AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'supportedDataObjects'
Action: dneighbo isnt sure what exactly you have or havent done
<LuftHans> that's the last error from trying to continue after choosing a data source
Action: dneighbo truthfully hasnt done GNU Enterprise stuff for nearly a month :(
<LuftHans> created form by hand per the forms docs since designer isn't working
<dneighbo> probably your form is toast
Action: LuftHans is following the zipcodes example in the forms doc
<dneighbo> doing xml by hand is less than optimal (way easy to hose up)
<dneighbo> also if you copied something out of the docs likely they are inaccurate
<dneighbo> try as we might... development happens faster than documentation
<LuftHans> "DB000: KeyError: zipcode" is the open the gfd error, don't know what it means, the entries with zipcode seem to be correct per the forms doc
<LuftHans> well, I need a starting point :)
<dneighbo> do you have  a database 
<dneighbo> do you have a table
<dneighbo> does the table have zipcode field?
<LuftHans> wxPython 2.4.0.7
<LuftHans> yup, yup, yup
<LuftHans> select * from zipcodes;
<LuftHans>  zipcode | city | state
<dneighbo> can you /msg me the form
Action: LuftHans just tried a dcc send of the form.
<LuftHans> save that as /vmlinuz and reboot to get it to take effect ;-)
<dneighbo> dcc is evil will try it
<dneighbo> no luck with the dcc
<dneighbo> please email it
<LuftHans> it's in the mail :)
<LuftHans> doesn't the PHP thingy have a validator?
<dneighbo> ?
<dneighbo> php thingy
<LuftHans> the PHP parser for gfd docs
<dneighbo> stay away from that
<dneighbo> its not usuable for anything remotely close to production
<LuftHans> why? is it borken?
<dneighbo> unless you want to contribute code to make it work :)
<dneighbo> web apps are shite anyhow ;)
<LuftHans> hmm, I need web-based for this app, that's more important than stand-along
<LuftHans> s/ong/one/
<LuftHans> well, I can help with PHP :)
<dneighbo> is this the error you get
<dneighbo> DB000:   File "/home/dneighbo/cvs/gnue/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/forms/GFObjects/GFEntry.py", line 94, in initialize
<dneighbo> DB000:     raise "Entry references non-existent field '%s'" % self.field
<dneighbo> DB000: Entry references non-existent field 'zipcode'
<dneighbo> ah gack
<dneighbo> form spec has changed radically
<LuftHans> nope
<ajmitch> g'evning
<dneighbo> stopped editing dumb files by hand when designer got better
<dneighbo> forgot about the namespacing
<dneighbo> hans
<dneighbo> run
<dneighbo> cvs/gnue/forms/samples/zipcode/zipcode.gfd
<dneighbo> does that work?
<dneighbo> if not your setup is messed
<LuftHans> ok, that one opens *and* only a few Gdk-CRITICAL errors
<LuftHans> gc == garbage collection?
<dneighbo> that is wx stuff
<dneighbo> the Gdk-CRITICAL errors
<dneighbo> cause GNOME sux ass lately :(
<LuftHans> GNOME?
Action: LuftHans is running KDE because GNOME was borky, borky.
<dneighbo> hmm your first form has something goofy
<dneighbo> researching
<LuftHans> DB000: AttributeError: GFLabel instance has no attribute 'text'
<dneighbo> ok figured it out
<dneighbo> you still have original form you sent me?
<LuftHans> yup
<dneighbo> silly error
Action: dneighbo is not a huge block fan
<dneighbo> change
<dneighbo> <entry c:x="13" c:y="1" c:width="5" block="ZipBlock" field="zipcode"/>
<dneighbo> to be
<dneighbo> <entry c:x="13" c:y="1" c:width="5" block="ZipBlock" field="zipentry"/>

<dneighbo> to be
<dneighbo> <entry c:x="13" c:y="5" c:width="2" block="ZipBlock" field="stateentry"/>
<dneighbo> save form then try to run
<LuftHans> oooh, it opens :)
<LuftHans> how do I 'run' it?
<LuftHans> found a 'run form' under tools, whcih gives a bunch of errors
<LuftHans> gnue.common.datasources.drivers.postgresql.psycopg does not contain dbdrivers
<dneighbo> ?
<dneighbo> gnue-forms formname.gfd
<dneighbo> or
<LuftHans> that seems bad
<dneighbo> gfcvs formname.gfd
<dneighbo> or what ever it takes to 'run' it
<dneighbo> im not sure what you mean by RUN it
<dneighbo> i thought you were running it
<dneighbo> otherwise how did you get errors?
<LuftHans> no db driver for psycopg
<LuftHans> I've been in gfdes and looking at layout editor
<Vee2d2> apt-get -uf install python2.2-psycopg
<dneighbo> what Vee2d2 said
<dneighbo> Vee2d2: i just played with designer found 2 major bugs
Action: Vee2d2 -uf's out of habbit.. 
<Vee2d2> dneighbo: dont touch the trigger drop down on the code editor.. :) 
<dneighbo> a. in schema editor there is no 'scrollbar' so if you have say 100 tables no way to scroll down, if you use the keys it REALLY fubars things
<Vee2d2> and if you make an entry hidden, then touch the property editor you'll probably discover segfault or something.. but I think he fixed that one
<dneighbo> b. if you use the wizard it saves height attributes as "1.0" intead of "1" which errors out when running the form
<dneighbo> hans your form here is working like a little champ
<dneighbo> after those three lines of editing
<Vee2d2> dneighbo: is the schema nav a tree style widget?
<Vee2d2> dneighbo: because that should be fixed in cvs, I think. 
<LuftHans> user/passwd for GNUe is the user/passwd combo for the db?
<dneighbo> it is tree style widget
<dneighbo> i just updated cvs to no avail....
<dneighbo> LuftHans: yeah
<Vee2d2> dneighbo: I get a scroll bar.. weird
<dneighbo> i think my cvs is fooed
<dneighbo> i think i accidently got it as 'root' a few cycles back
<Vee2d2> tsh tsh
<dneighbo> no kidding
<dneighbo> crap
<dneighbo> did they turn cvs into modules?
<dneighbo> i.e. how do you checkout the whole mess now
<Vee2d2> yip
<LuftHans> ok, got the form to start and made an entry
Action: dneighbo goes to look at site
Action: dneighbo hates not being around
<Vee2d2> you dont read the list, or what? :)
<dneighbo> ah i knew i saw something somewhere
<dneighbo> too many list (er projects)
<LuftHans> for i in blah blah blah blah blah; do cvs co $i; done

<dneighbo> grrr i pull hair out
<dneighbo> they changed directory of base cvs
<dneighbo> and with it they munged my frelling pserver file
Action: dneighbo goes to dig around for ssh keys
Action: dneighbo put this off for last 3 years out of laziness :)

<dneighbo> ouchie didnt have wx2.4
<dneighbo> guess gnue-forms-wx was holding back the upgrade :)
<Vee2d2> IIRC there's like a "wowiee wow! wow!" difference between 5.0 designer and cvs
<Vee2d2> I dont remember if that happened prior to the cvs restructuring or not though
<LuftHans> did you get gnue-forms-wx to install from the unofficial deb?
<Vee2d2> s/5.0/0.5/ :)
Action: Vee2d2 envisions designer 5.0.. "wowiee wow! wow!"
<dneighbo> some before
<dneighbo> to answer Vee2d2
<dneighbo> hans our packages are screwed
<dneighbo> wait till next version
<dneighbo> cvs best option for now
<dneighbo> egads the fonts are horrible in deisgner now
<dneighbo> for some things
Action: dneighbo wonders where it is picking those up form
<dneighbo> yeah one of my bugs fixed :)
<dneighbo> the scrollbar is there now
<dneighbo> second bug fixed
<dneighbo> YEAH
<dneighbo> jcater you are my hero

<jbailey> Erm.  Isn't it in unstable?
<LuftHans> I only show 2.2 and 2.4 available, I have stable, testing and unstable in my sources ( viva la /etc/apt/preferences :)
<LuftHans> does it have to =2.3, could it =>2.3?
<jbailey> I don't know off hand.
<jbailey> If it needs to be changed to 2.4, I can certainly update it.
<LuftHans> it looks like it needs to be =2.4 or >=2.3

<chillywilly> anyone have recommendations for a good NIC that works with linux the cheap one I have sucks with this new driver and the old one times out all the time but it is faster
<dsmith> chillywilly: I've had good experiences with those nics that come up as dc0 in *bsd.  
<dsmith> chillywilly: Linksys perhaps?  One of the cheap ones you can get at compusa.
<chillywilly> havoc says geta Linksys LNE100TX
<dcmwai> chillywilly, Just get the one wit RTL8139 Chipset... it is widel use, cheap and work on linux :)

<Vee2d2> I've only bought a 'good' net card once, plopped down $100+ for it and it died about a year after I started using it.. was 3com, dont recall which.. 
<chillywilly> I don't mean expensive
<chillywilly> just soemthing that works better than this myson803 card that likes to timeout and now it seems they crippled it with the newer drivers so it'll only do 30k/s
