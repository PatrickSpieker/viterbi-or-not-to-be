<dcmwai> Vee2d2, Hello, is the cvs now stable enough?
<Vee2d2> dcmwai: enough for what? 
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, Stable... (Just if it is stable)
<Vee2d2> dcmwai: I think at the moment cvs is pretty stable, as long as you dont touch the trigger dropdown in designer.. ;)
<dcmwai> does this meant that.... I don't touch designer :)
<dcmwai> Ok Thank
<Vee2d2> nah, just not that dropdown in the code editor
<dcmwai> Now I'm really Free..
<dcmwai> jcater, What should be the 1st step I take?
Action: Vee2d2 made a personal timeclock this morning.. 
<Vee2d2> started one anyway
<dcmwai> Time clock?
<Vee2d2> woops.. 
<Vee2d2> yea, a way for me to record when I start and stop working
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, You are not getting pay with it right...
<Vee2d2> dcmwai: I do some contract programming for a company and get paid by the hour, so I made a form to keep up with my time
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, You are smart :)
<Vee2d2> heh
<dcmwai> So I'm ready to work... 
<dcmwai> Where to start :)
<Vee2d2> on gnue-sb?
<dcmwai> yes 
<Vee2d2> dcmwai: what do you want to work on? what's itching? :)
<dcmwai> damn I've forgotten about the translation of Enigmail.
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, Give me something easy first... I didn't touch python before..
<dcmwai> so something like schema and form design will be good :)
Action: dcmwai is a lazy guy...

<Vee2d2> dcmwai: I'm really not sure, I have an itch to get product (item) management to a state where I can: setup my product line, print a price list, and perhaps print brochures and or a catalog so I've been working to that end. 
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, Again...
<dcmwai> What you want to do actually.
<Vee2d2> dcmwai: perhaps it would be best to get yourself familiar with how the forms work by setting up and playing with the samples
<dcmwai> gnue-sb sample?
<Vee2d2> dcmwai: forms samples in the gnue-forms/samples directory of cvs
<Vee2d2> dcmwai: the Developers-Guide is a good read too, if you havent already
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, Sorry... Not yet...
<dcmwai> will read
<Vee2d2> I havent played with aria much.. well really, not at all.. 
<dcmwai> nvm...
<dcmwai> It is just a erp that is incomplete... and our objective is to complete every part of it.. and Joining with Gnue-sb will make things work without double work
<Vee2d2> right, I'm not sure what the roadmap for integration looks like though.. 
<dcmwai> We haen't have one yet...
<dcmwai> I think I should ask josh and Jcater to workout one.
<Vee2d2> and or derek
<dcmwai> oh yes him... Where is he right now?
<Vee2d2> if the schema is set, then you could probably work on forms to do what arias currently does
<Vee2d2> in the way of payroll, ap, ar, gl
<dcmwai> haha I'm having problem with the form again... don't tell me that I'll have to disable the key mapping again...
<Vee2d2> this needs discussion though, I think.
<dcmwai> ok..
<dcmwai> yes...

<ToyMan> how web-integrated is gnue these days?
<derek> not very
<derek> i.e. same as before
<ToyMan> hey derek
<derek> wrt to web interface
<derek> other than that
<ToyMan> hmmm.
<derek> its all xml and is highly usable as a backend for web store fronts
<ToyMan> we're doing a franchise operation...
<derek> really i cant imagine running a business off all web backend
<derek> i have seen it with peoplesoft 8
<ToyMan> looking for a way for franchisees to do their financials on-line
<derek> and its rather horrible
<derek> you could do with a GNU Enterprise front end
<ToyMan> and integrate their data into a franchise-wide view
<derek> that uses secure ssh (or vpn) to connect to a backend
<derek> or you could have them do all local and use vpn to 'pump' their data on regular basis
<ToyMan> anyway... how's the project coming along.. havn't checked in for a long time
<derek> depending on if you want consolidations or actually want to treat them like a 'extension of home'
<derek> pretty good
<ToyMan> we just got a new investor, and i'm interested in picking up our thread again
<ToyMan> you know I did my phone sys with bayonne, yes?

lxf (~agus_tea@202.73.120.115) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> who is peter?
<derek> btw: no websetup can convince me
<derek> i have seen some really good ones
<derek> the problem is the web makes for a HORRIBLY inefficient UI
<derek> unless you use java applets or activeX controls
<derek> but then you are not a 'web application' you are an application in a web browser 
<LuftHans> Peter is one of the Germans
<LuftHans> no js, no java
<derek> ie you lose all the good reasons to use a web app (as you have to deploy stuff client side)
<LuftHans> I think you know I hate web UIs more than you do :), but this one's pretty good
<derek> basically if its not java/activeX etc its stateless which makes for horridly inefficient refreshes
<derek> not saying there are ones that arent 'decent'
<derek> but not something i would want a large client running backend services on soley
<LuftHans> I'm certain he's using more bandwidth than he would be by using a local app with a tunnel to the back end, but it's damned quick, including popping up dozens of images of forms that have been scanned in
<LuftHans> most of his app is lookup with some notes being added, so it's workable
<derek> my problem is for example my online banking application
<LuftHans> even as quick as the interface is, it would suck for data entry/manipulation
<derek> it is rather killer
<derek> but when its a heavy traffic bank day
<derek> its 'stateless' refresh times are so horrible it's nearly unusable :(
<LuftHans> well, he's feeding small businesses with at most 3500 people to hit it
<derek> when i bank at middle of night when no one is around i think its best thing since slice bread
<derek> also im glad its web based as i can use it with GNU/Linux :)
<LuftHans> he's working on a contract that could take him over 50,000 employees to hit the system, don't know how well it will scale
<derek> so im not saying natively webapps are evil hell, just saying its not my favorite choice :)
<LuftHans> generally, I say they are evil hell ;-)
