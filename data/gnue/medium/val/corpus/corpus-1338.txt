<Vee2d2> what's the company do?
<thierry> consulting
<thierry> i'm python/C developer and zope expert

<Arturas> Hello
<thierry> hi Arturas
<Vee2d2> this is my first experience with python, but so far it's been rather transparent 
<Vee2d2> 'sup Arturas
<thierry> Vee2d2: python is very intuitive
<Vee2d2> thierry: oh, that's even more interesting.. :)
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-7.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<thierry> Vee2d2: :).. I'm developing some BO concepts on XMLRPC protocol
<thierry> like object transparent persistence in relational db,... 
<Vee2d2> thierry: I tried popy last week but had to revert back to psycopg because it breaks designer's schema navigator.. apparently because of the way it returns types.. like it was expecting oid to be returned as a int type but was getting a str, I think.. *shrug*
<thierry> it's complex to deal w/ oid type
<thierry> each table has an oid and lob are also using oid
<thierry> but it's strange that popy returns an str for oid.... :/
<Vee2d2> I'm only assuming it was a str.. :)
<Vee2d2> it wasnt an int
<Vee2d2> going in and doing a print "%d" on the var threw an error.. but %s worked
<thierry> could you send me a traceback to thierry@xtensive.com ?
<Vee2d2> of which? the original error?
<thierry> yep

<Vee2d2> morning ToyMan
<thierry> hi ToyMan
<thierry> Vee2d2: I would like to provide services for SB and associations in east of france
<thierry> but in asp mode
<Vee2d2> hmm.. I want a field to carry the last entry in the db in it.. something like select field from table order by id desc limit 1, 
Action: thierry is reading the Vee2d2's email...
Action: Vee2d2 adds an order_by= to his datasource
<thierry> from which table did you get 'oid' ?  could you paste me the select you do ?
<ToyMan> morning all
<Vee2d2> thierry: do you have cvs of gnue somewhere? 
<thierry> an old one...
<thierry> i can get the new one easily
<Vee2d2> gnue-common/src/datasources/drivers/postgresql/Base/Driver.py ~188 is where the error occurs, IIRC
<thierry> ok i'll get a look
<jamest> hello
<thierry> how are you jamest ?
<jamest> busy/tired
<jamest> but ok :)
<jamest> and you?
<thierry> hehe :)
<thierry> very well, busy too
<thierry> i changed company
<jamest> you were working on popy right?
<thierry> yep
<thierry> did you read the announce about pygresql/popy project merging ?
<jamest> nope
<jamest> i'm really out of touch w/ all things gnue at the moment
<jamest> don't think i've read by gnue/db mail in a few weeks
<jamest> yeah, i suck
<thierry> :)
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> for some reason my remote quota daemon bound itself to the port spamassass uses

SachaS_ (~Sacha@dialup-196-208.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Vee2d2> hmm.. this timeclock form works well with one exception.. my timestamp entries dont seem to respect the display masks
<Vee2d2> when I bring up records I only see the date
<thierry> Vee2d2: I saw what is the problem w/ popy
<Vee2d2> thierry: cool, so will it be fixed? :)
<thierry> right now!
<Vee2d2> irc is a beautiful thing
<thierry> popy tries to detect LOB and handles them transparently
<thierry> but as oid is used by tables, the automatic detection is impossible IMHO
<thierry> so, LOB are not handled by default by popy and oid too...
<jamest> just out of curiosity does popy deal with ' properly?
<jamest> i do things like 
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-7.wasp.net.au) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<jamest> execute("insert into foo values (%(keyName)s)",dictionaryVarContainingKey)
<jamest> i tested out some of my forms with pygresql and it did the right thing wrt strings that contained '
<jamest> however one of my users told me the other day that strings with ' in them choaked the form
<jamest> the only change I recall was going to popy
Action: jamest has hod 0 time to look at gnue's code, the users example, or anything
<jamest> so it could be user error but I figured since the popy author was here for abuse
<jamest> it was too good to pass up
<thierry> popy has problem with quoting
Action: Vee2d2 notes jamest's still holding the trout
<thierry> we are working on it and a better types converter
<derek> bonjour mon ami 
<jamest> ok, thanks as you've saved me some time
<thierry> bonjour derek, comment vas-tu ?
<jamest> thierry popy is quite good at dealing with timestamps though
<jamest> which is why i switched to it as the other driver would truncate the data returned
<thierry> jamest: i will try to do last patches to the actual popy driver before new project begins
<derek> comme ci comme ca
<thierry> what's up ?
<Vee2d2> hmm.. 
<derek> long temps ne voyez pas (man my french is RUSTY)
Action: Vee2d2 ponders how to get the form to display the time as well.. 
Action: derek hopes that said something like long time no see
Action: Vee2d2 borrows jamest's trout
<derek> Vee2d2: you have it all wrong...
<derek> trout are for people
<derek> hammers are for bad forms
Action: derek hands Vee2d2 a suitable hammer
Action: Vee2d2 throws his hands and just grabs derek instead
Action: derek runs screaming
<jamest> damn man
<jamest> swinging derek is going to take some serious upper body strength
<Vee2d2> :)
<Vee2d2> whatever it takes
<jamest> oooo, just have him hold still and swing the pc at him instead
<derek> rofl
<derek> jamest: remember what happens to pc's that get near me
<derek> better be willing to sacrifice that pc ;)
<Vee2d2> hmm.. looks like the gfd04to05.py link gets forgotten in the post-restructured setup-cvs.py
<Vee2d2> mine's still pointing to the old directory

<Vee2d2> ;)
<jcater> lol
<Vee2d2> you want the list just to make sure you arent missing any? :) I added one related to mysql yesterday
<Vee2d2> didnt have the patience to really find out why it happened so I just switched to postgresql

<Vee2d2> oh cool Block Tabs!
Action: Vee2d2 rushes to up
<jcater> I wonder what people would think of http://backtalk.sourceforge.net/
<jcater> I've debated about testing it out for almost a year now
<jcater> it's basically online book editing
Action: jcater is thinking the dev guide he's working on
<jcater> The Zope Book (http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Books/ZDG/current/index_html) uses it
<jcater> oops, http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Books/ZopeBook/2_6Edition is current url
<Vee2d2> if it's some sorta wiki thing I think that'd be cool.. I find the online php manual indespensible with all it's annotations from users.. 
Action: jcater goes back to coding, knowing full well he's going to get flaimed
<jcater> Vee2d2: yeah, it's a lot like the PHP manual
<Vee2d2> that'd rock.. 
<Vee2d2> flamed.. after those commits today? pushaw..

<Vee2d2> it's everything I dreamed it would be.. :)
<Vee2d2> the block tabs Rock! too.. 
<Vee2d2> I'm all for a 0.5.1 now.. you guys have my vote fwiw.. 
<jcater> I've hit a bug in forms I need fixed first
<jcater> if you mark an entry as non-navigable
<jcater> you can still click on it in the wxWindows-driver
<jcater> the wx focus changes
<jcater> but the forms focus doesn't change
<Vee2d2> I think I made mine nonnav and readonly
<Vee2d2> wasnt there a gsd tool in designer before?
<Vee2d2> what's the proper method for creating a gsd now?
<jcater> I think there is
<jcater> I created a .gsd for Arias using designer
<jcater> the wizards, iircx
<jcater> but there aren't really any good editing tools for .gsd in designer yet
<jcater> just creation
<Vee2d2> that's all I was looking for
<Vee2d2> aha
<Vee2d2> which answers another question I was brewing wrt creating reports.. ;)
<Vee2d2> I dont plan to ask any reports related questions until I've had a chance to fully delve into the gnue-reports directory..

<thierry> hi dcmwai
<dcmwai> I've found out the problem ... it is on my postgresql setting :(
<dcmwai> hello thierry
<Vee2d2> all that and it was the db?
<Vee2d2> ;)
<dcmwai> the bad news is that I haven't solve it yet...
<Vee2d2> dcmwai: so you're up, running, and happy now?
<Vee2d2> ahh..
<dcmwai> No... Oh do you know how can I change pg_hda.conf so that it will auth using the password for user?
<dcmwai> Now I'm using the trust Way (no password is needed)
<dcmwai> I've try password, md5 None of that is help full...
<Vee2d2> yea, I'm just using trust
<Vee2d2> for local connections.. havent verified how it works through tcp
<Vee2d2> it should be md5 though and only if it's on my local net
<dcmwai> I can help you with that... 
<dcmwai> (working throught tcp
Action: thierry afk
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, You using debian/
<Vee2d2> yip
<dcmwai> You know where is the startup script for postgres right? (in rh it is something like /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgres
<Vee2d2> well, I'm not saying it's not working.. rather it should be.. I just havent checked it.. :)
<dcmwai> oh I see..
<dcmwai> I know by adding a "-i" the TCP will work.
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, Bad news, I've to the same error again :(
<Vee2d2> from what I recall of the traceback it didnt appear to be db related.. 
<Vee2d2> I suspect the key mappings you mentioned or something similar
<dcmwai> Vee2d2, and the way to solve is ...
<Vee2d2> dcmwai: you are trying to get intro.gfd running first, right?

<derek> jbailey: any chance of fixing debs
<derek> seems we get about complaint a day lately (guess lots of new people looking at gnue)
<Vee2d2> I think we should just make a new release given all the commits that went in yesterday
<derek> though there should be a release around the corner
<derek> so it might make sense to wait though we have been saying that for about a week after 0.5.0 hit :)
<Vee2d2> I think jcater said he wanted to fix one more thing he found in forms.. 
<derek> is there anyway to make a gnue-forms-snapshot

<derek> so if some major stuff changed in cvs
<derek> we could run the script and have people grab debs to 'test'
<derek> this way when we are in a state where old version is too old
<derek> but cvs is close enough people coudl use
<derek> but not ready for 'release'
<derek> we could point them to a snapshot?
