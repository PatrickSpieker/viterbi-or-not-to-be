<jamest> hello
<Vee2d2> it's crazy how nice a machine you can build these days for ~$100
<jamest> ?
<jamest> the cheapest cpu i've seen is 30
<jamest> $30 case, $30 cpu
<jamest> doesn't leave much left for parts :)
<Vee2d2> who needs 'm.. ? ;)
<Vee2d2> all ya really need is a network card
<Vee2d2> I have a garage full of cases so wasnt thinking about that, but you could make one from about anything (Copper!)
<Vee2d2> for $18 a pop I could upgrade all my pentium boards to k6-2 500
<jamest> :)
<Vee2d2> another $20/pop and they'd each have 128M ram too.. well.. if they did sdram.. which I doubt they do.. wonder where the hell I could even find 72pin memory these days
<jamest> obsoleteAndExpensiveComputerEquipment.com?
<Vee2d2> yea.. might be more cost effective to simply upgrade the mb's which negates the point of getting all this crap out of my garage.. ;)
<jamest> lol
<Vee2d2> think I may just spend a day breaking it all down into boxes and stuff to throw away.. pack all the hard drives in a box.. all the network cards in another.. etc.. 
Action: Vee2d2 finds motivation to work on gnue-sb inventory module
<jamest> lol
<jamest> what class machines you pitching?
<Vee2d2> not sure.. 
<Vee2d2> I think the majority of the lot are 486's..
<Vee2d2> maybe I'll build new enclosures for 'em and make firewall/printserver things out of 'm..
<Vee2d2> several are retrofitted into XT cases
<jamest> 486s work for ltsp terminals
<Vee2d2> well, my problem there is non of them have very good video hw
<Vee2d2> so at best they'd be good remote consoles, which I dont have much use for.. 
<jamest> or you could do something like http://bofh.be/clusterknoppix/
<Vee2d2> hehe
<jamest> and have a cluster for compiling
Action: jamest really wants to try out ltsp/mosix setup
<Vee2d2> I bought it all for $1 and everyone pretty well laughed that anyone had bought it at all.. bunch of windows wankers they were, however.. I jokingly told them I would build a parallel network to combine all their power into one nice system..
<jamest> there you go
<jamest> clusterknoppix or openmosix alone would do that

<reinhard> just reading some interesting texts about the GFDL
<reinhard> I start to doubt seriously if the GFDL is the correct license for GNUe Documentation
<chillywilly> bah
<reinhard> http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
<reinhard> http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2003/debian-legal-200307/msg00108.html
<reinhard> especially the latter is quite interesting
<thierry> hi reinhard, chillywilly
<chillywilly> I've read the former
<reinhard> hi thierry
<chillywilly> reinhard: the latter is just someone whining and trying to place balme elsewhere...it is a sad fact in this day and age you have to jump through so mnay hoops in order to cover your backside legally, but I hardly blame it on the GFDL
<jbailey> reinhard: Please try hard to avoid the GFDL.  If you use it, please try hard to avoid invariant sections.
<jbailey> I'll be shortly moving Glibc's documentation to non-free in Debian.
<jbailey> I think GCC's documentation is already there.
<reinhard> chillywilly: if i write a documentation
<chillywilly> jbailey: too late
<reinhard> I _want_ it to be usable in manpages
<chillywilly> I think the GNU wya would be info pages ;)
<reinhard> chillywilly: i don't think it's too late
<reinhard> i can always relicense the stuff i wrote
<reinhard> especially to a "weaker" license
<chillywilly> didn't you assign copyright to FSF?
<reinhard> hmmm
<reinhard> yes true
<reinhard> you're right
<chillywilly> I think you get am exlcusively license on what you wrote though
<chillywilly> exclusive
<reinhard> so we would have to sort it out
<reinhard> with the FSF
<chillywilly> those assignment papers are sorta confusing
<chillywilly> I think Derek has a grasp on it though
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> i wonder if we can't license under 2 licenses
<jamest> since we're already gfdl
<jamest> covered by gfdl and "foo"
<chillywilly> however, if the FSF says it is ok to leave out the GFDL in evey man page or whatever they have the right to do so
<jamest> that's not binding
<jamest> "sure, you can take my car"
<jamest> "hello, 911 my car was stolen"
<chillywilly> they do have copyright don't they?
<chillywilly> that's my point
<chillywilly> they should probably reevaluate the GFDL...but I alos see RMS's point he doesn't want people changing the author's "opinion" either and making it easy to defraud them
<reinhard> the main point is
<reinhard> i don't see _any_ advantages for us
<reinhard> from the restrictions the gfdl places
<reinhard> but i see _many_ disadvantages for our users
<jbailey> reinhard: Keep in mind that the copyright holders can do whatever they'd like with the documents.  So you just need to figure out with the FSF what license the man pages should be under and write them.
<chillywilly> I would hope that a little more tact would be in order since we are part of GNU...like discussing with some FSF about what to do
<chillywilly> FSF folk
<reinhard> chillywilly: that's what i'm proposing
<chillywilly> yea...that was like the first thing you said ;) Sorry ;)

<jamest> this is still wack

<jamest> running 2.4.18 
<jbailey> Seems strange - I've never had one go.
<jamest> nor had i
Action: jbailey looks forward to the next Debian stable being out.
<jamest> good thing is i've only got all my critial systems setup like this
<jbailey> Hard to think that it's only been a year since woody released.
Action: jamest looks at list backport list
<jamest> ah, it's not that hard to think about it :)
<jbailey> Well, a year isn't that long, really.
<jbailey> So if it's 18 months between the releases, that's not too bad.

dsmith (~dsmith@mail.actron.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> true
<jamest> but is it on target for 18 months?
<jamest> and more importantly so you think it'll be as far out of date as woody was at release
<jamest> s/so/do
<jbailey> Hard to say.
<jbailey> I think there's a reasonable chance of it being on target.
<jbailey> The out-of-dateness is harder to predict.  Part of the problem with woody was that there were last minute delays when they realised the infrastructure wasn't able to cope with the release.
dsmith (~dsmith@mail.actron.com) left irc: "Client exiting"
<jbailey> In the fall, Gnome 2.4 will release, but it's hard to say whether that would make it.  I'm guess yes.  It's not as ugly as the gnome1->gnome2 transition from what I've read.
<jamest> well, i dont' mind gnome being out of date :)
<jbailey> I do.  I want to deploy it on several hundred desktops.  Right now I have to run unstable everywhere.

<jcater> reinhard: just read the logs
<jcater> and for what it's worth, I agree we should seriously re-evaluate our GFDL usage
Action: jcater imagines that's worth, oh, approximately this much: ><  
<jbailey> Well, the copyright holders can generally dictate the license.
<jbailey> One solution I've seen applied though is that folks have refused to add invariant clauses.
<jbailey> Basically telling the FSF that if they want them, they need to add it themselves.
high-peak-soft (~Eric@dupa110105.wright.edu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<high-peak-soft> I am considering implementing some web-accessible church management software (a species of CRM) to support the activities of a small missions organization.  If I do this, it will be my first open-source project and my first python project (though I have several years of experience with C++ and Java).  Before I start working on this I want to know if I have a chance or if I should just implement a less ambitious non-web scheme by myself in

<chillywilly> high-peak-soft: cool
<Vee2d2> high-peak-soft: you and dneighbo (derek) will have to chat.. I believe he does a fair bit of stuff for his church using gnue tools
<high-peak-soft> It sounds like you think it is a doable project.  From your experience with the gnuE tools, starting today, how long do you think it would take me to generate a about 5 tables, about 5 reports, and about 3 forms for data-entry, all of these being accessible to an http/html client?

<jbailey> The html forms stuff isn't done yet.  I have some sketches, but ran out of time. =(
Vee2d2 (~vin@c66.169.136.41.ts46v-07.otn-c1.ftwrth.tx.charter.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<high-peak-soft> jbailey: do you mean ran out of time before a release?
<jbailey> No, I ran out of time before I learned enough python to write it.
<high-peak-soft> What would need to be done to get it working? (or should I check the TODOs)
<jbailey> It depends on the difference between working and working right.
<jbailey> The basic HTML forms should use CSS layout to put it on the screen, but CSS doesn't provide a perfect grid to work with.
<jbailey> So fully working right needs to convince the gnuef people that laying things out on grids is suboptimal. =)
<jbailey> Also, there's no way to identify easily which tags are associated with which inputs, and that's another architecture change in designer.
<jbailey> So given ugly layout, and thumbing your nose at accessibility, I'm suspecting that a competant python programmer could have it displaying HTML in 20 to 30 hours of coding.
<jbailey> All the rest of your requirements are trivial.  Designer handles those nicely.
<high-peak-soft> That is nice to hear.
<high-peak-soft> Since, for my application, the downsides would be acceptable (at least temporarily), and since I have some time (at least temporarily) do you think it would be wise for me to try to "get it working"
<jbailey> In order to contribute to GNUe, you need to have assignment papers on file.  So, unless you'll have time in a couple of weeks, it's probably not worth going through the hassle.
<jbailey> That said - Does it have to be HTML?
<jbailey> There's a Win32 client, and a Unix client.
<jbailey> In general, native clients will suck less than web clients.
<high-peak-soft> I think HTML is a must.
<chillywilly> but the web is a nice common denominator
<high-peak-soft> My users will be accessing from machines that are not theirs
<high-peak-soft> So installing a client will be a problem.
<high-peak-soft> On second thought, though, I might have them download and run the client each time.  How big are the Win32 clients, and do they require any support files (shared libraries especially)?
