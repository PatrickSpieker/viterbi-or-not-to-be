<siesel> i.e. how do you write numbers? 100,0 100.0 ?

<siesel> hmmm. if its a local file. its quite ok, but if it is default config data stored in the programm itself, its not ok

<siesel> hi jcater, hi arturas
<siesel> half an hour ago, someone had problems with starting designer because of wrong conversion of string to float of gnue.conf options. 
<siesel> he didn't use gnue.conf, but the default value for borderPercentage is "100.0"  which return a ValueError in his locale 
<siesel> I cannot recreate that fault again, but the python manual says that the float function depends on the c library.

<Arturas> form client formed sql #1 and couldn't update data in database (postgress)
<Arturas> so it's interesting whether other databases supports float given as string
<siesel> Arturas: possibly forms write floats as strings when inserting rows and write floats as float when creating querys.

<Arturas> i don't know whether all databases supports taking floats as strings :/

<jamest_> hi
ToyMan (~stuq@65.167.123.51) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<jamest_> StyXman: about the toolbar
<jamest_> i wanted to add visible attributes to lots of stuff in forms
<jamest_> i was thinking of adding a visible attribute to the toolbar and a startup trigger to forms
<jamest_> so that they could do things like set the toolbar's visible attribute to false at startup
<jamest_> that eliminates the need from gfd changes and gives us the ability to activate/deactivate on the fly at any time 
<jamest_> plus it'd match my plans for other widgets so hiding a toolbar would have same syntax as hiding a entry widget
<jamest_> consistancy is a good thing :)
<Gedanken> visible attribute is always good to have ... I enjoyed it a long time ago when I worked with Borlands VCL library ... that used it quite often
<jamest_> in fact I think i started implementing this at one time
<jamest_> and the trigger sample prints something like 
<jamest_> if this worked then I would not be seen 
<jamest_> or something like that :)
ariel_ (~ariel@ppp-217-133-245-244.dialup.tiscali.it) left irc: "Uscita dal client"
<StyXman> jamest_:  why wait till code is run? set the toolbar optional by tag or attr. easier, and more consistent for the developer.
<jamest_> because all the other widgets will work like this too
<jamest_> right now you can set an entry to hidden in the gfd
<StyXman> meanwhile, yes, I like to be able to do things to widgets @ runtime (rt)
<jamest_> but i'm wanting to make it so you can flip that off and on
<StyXman> (and don forget disable)
<jamest_> yip disable too
<jamest_> there really wouldn't be that much of a difference to forms itself
<jamest_> but trigger wise the devleoper would be able to activate consistanly
<jamest_> so that the startup behaviour wouldn't be different than doing it later
<jamest_> i think your work w/ the toolbar would make this easy to implement
<StyXman> jamest_: you can always reach the widgets thru interface param @ _createWidget time

stbain (~GunAndGiz@ip68-10-44-170.rn.hr.cox.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest_> it should be that way now but IIRC it isn't working
<StyXman> and defining your own menubar *must* be done by xml, not triggers.
<jamest_> that way a named trigger can reference self to act on the widget that called it
<StyXman> jamest: we use it to calculate totals.
<StyXman> jamest_: but does not work, you say?
<jamest_> the self attribute in triggers
<StyXman> ah
<jamest_> the system was supposed to dynamically assign self to the widget calling the trigger
<StyXman> bt now, self points to the form, which is not a problem for us.
<jamest_> but I think I completely forgot to implement it
<StyXman> ah, ok
<jamest_> because named triggers and trigger libraries are useless if they have to have hardcoded references
<jamest_> well not useless
<jamest_> but less usefull :)
<jamest_> in triggers IIRC there should be a form.
<jamest_> to get to forms
<jamest_> but damn
<jamest_> it's been months since I coded that stuff
<jamest_> so I could be talking out my arse
Action: jamest_ has crappy memory
Action: StyXman has crappy hw.
<StyXman> anyway. again about <maintoolbar> or <option>...

<StyXman> jamest_: so, do you have time *now*?
<jamest_> a little 
<jamest_> I'm at my desk
<StyXman> ok. first, why do <options> (and not <option>s) exist?
<jamest_> you mean as a seperate tag?
<StyXman> yes. why does it exist? I mean. has no attributes
<jamest_> the gfd used to take attributes in several different forms
<jamest_> <tagname attr="foo">
<jamest_> or
<jamest_> <tagname>
<jamest_>   <option name='attr'>foo</option>
<StyXman> forms==ways
<StyXman> ?
<StyXman> forms==ways?
<jamest_> (yes forms==ways) and the options section was kinda global
<jamest_> for the form
<StyXman> yes, the parser says options are for forms
<jamest_> as IIRC the form tag didn't take attributes at all
<StyXman> but there are options for labels and such
<StyXman> now it has size and title
<jamest_> yes
<jamest_> we ended up scrapping that old way
<StyXman> aha. so <options> is callous code
<jamest_> and replacing with an <options> <option></option></options>
<jamest_> this was too IIRC allow for options values that were multiple lines in length
<jamest_> like a trigger
<jamest_> however triggers ended up different anyway :)
<StyXman> but trigger are not <option>s
<StyXman> so, what are <options> and <option>s for *now*?
<jamest_> so IIRC most of the <options><option> setups can be replaced by an attribute in the <tag > itself
<StyXman> yes, that's the way we think it should be
<jamest_> except for forms i think
<jamest_> this code is _old_
<StyXman> why?
<StyXman> which code?
<jamest_> so it's hard to recall the details
<jamest_> the option handlers
<StyXman> GFOptions and GFOoption
<jamest_> jcater: do I sound close to correct here?
<jcater> I *think* so
<jcater> options do serve a dual purpose
<jcater> a developer can also assign non-standard properties to objects in forms
<StyXman> please, explain me more.
<jamest_> ooooo
<jcater> that can be retrieved in triggers
<jamest_> that's right
Action: jamest_ completely forgot about that one
Action: madlocke is back (gone 05:27:22)
<jcater> that's why I don't want to get rid of options
<StyXman> interesting
<madlocke> hi
<jamest_> form specific attributes
<jcater> but in the cases where an option replaced a standard tag, I've never been really thrilled
<StyXman> jcater: but options are still just for forms
<jcater> StyXman: ?
<StyXman> madlocke: hello
<jcater> options are for all objects iirc
<jamest_> the old, old gfd parser allowed you to add attributes on the fly <tag someBS="foo">
<jamest_> the new parser sanity checks the gfd
<jcater> s/standard tag/standard attribute
<madlocke> <nick name="jamest"><option name="alternate nick" value="jamest_"/></nick>
<madlocke> ;)
<jamest_> so that a name="bar" didn't mistakenly get entered as nmae="bar"
<StyXman> jcater: according to GFParser, options' parentTags is just 'form'
<jcater> are we talking options in general
<jcater> or just the single <options> tag
<jcater> the <options> tag was added to forms to group all of form's options
<jcater> which in the beginning, there were a lot
<jcater> title
<jcater> version
<jcater> etc
<jamest_> yip
<StyXman> ugh.
<jamest_> pre-0.1.0 gfd changed constantly
<jamest_> it's settled down a bit since then :)
<StyXman> ok, I agree on <option> then, but I still have troubles thinking how GFOption should be
<StyXman> I mean, it should know in which context it was invoked
<jcater> I don't follow
<jcater> GFOption is a dumb tag
<jcater> it knows nothing
<jamest_> it's substituted out in the parser IIRC
<StyXman> that's why I didn't like it at first
<StyXman> gimme a sec...
<jamest_> and made an attribute of the object that represents the tag
<jamest_> IIRC
<jcater> all objects have a getOption() method
Action: StyXman is chasing code
<jcater> that retrieves any <option>s set on it
<StyXman> aha...
<jcater> getOption('myoption')
<jcater> so basically, any non-standard attributes would be options
<StyXman> ah, so the entry in xmlEmelents is just for dtd creation?
<jcater> um
<jcater> no
<jcater> there will actually be a GFOption object implicitly created
<jcater> iirc
<StyXman> so GFOption... how does the correct option goes to the correct object?
<StyXman> I realize that <options> is for gouping <option>s together
<jcater> um
<StyXman> but how does a <options> gets related to its parent? 
<jcater> I don't follow
<jcater> if a GFOption is a child element of an object
<jcater> then it belongs to its parent
<StyXman> but GFParser says that only <options> can be parents of <option>s and <options> parents are just <forms>
<madlocke> StyXman: really? tooltips for example are options, too...
<jcater>          'UsableBySiblings': 1,
<jcater> that indicates that the element is a trickle-down element, for lack of a better word
<madlocke> StyXman: ah, seeing what you are talking about...
<madlocke> the freedom is because the attribute 'ParentTags' is not interpreted yet ;)
<madlocke> but you are right. it is in the xmlElements definition
<jcater> actually, I see your point... the GFParser file isn't quite correct
alexey_ (~alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<StyXman> jcater: ah, I missed that
Action: Gedanken is away: lunch and errands
<StyXman> and singleinstance in <options>
<StyXman> (that was a question)
<jcater> that means a forms tag can only have one <options> element
<jcater> (or entry could only have one options section, etc)
<madlocke> but it is right the options talk would not be really needed. it's more a visual thing i think... right?
<madlocke> <options>
<StyXman> yeah, I realize that. what I say is if is not wrong
<StyXman> madlocke: I understand that no.
<StyXman> <option>s are for addig attributes to the things that you want to use internally.
<StyXman> in a local basis.
<madlocke> yep but for this you could write, too:
<madlocke> <label>
<madlocke>   <option name="bla">asd</option>
<madlocke>   <option name="asd">qwer</option>
<madlocke> </label>
<StyXman> madlocke: except that name is mandatory in label, yes
<madlocke> grrr. ;)
<madlocke> #defin label any_tag
<madlocke> #define #defin #define ;)
<StyXman> did you tried it? does it work?
<madlocke> i was not talking about if it is possible with GFParser now...
<madlocke> just about chances how to do things
<StyXman> well, I think it does work
<madlocke> if it was me i would like a way to add new tags but still being able to create valid dtds
Action: StyXman writes the exmaple
<madlocke> in the examples it is: <option name="asd" value="asd"/>
<madlocke> so you are forced to use  a single value for an option...
<madlocke> think if it is good to have something like <option name="asd"> some content </option>
<madlocke> some content could be a CDATA section
<madlocke> but still solves not the prob of new tags... but about this i will think later again :)
<StyXman> it does not.
<madlocke> so you could do for example:
<madlocke> <option name="tooltip">
<madlocke>   <text>This is a great tooltip</text>
<madlocke>   <fgcolor>black</fgcolor>
<madlocke>   <bgcolor>white</bgcolor>
<madlocke> </option>
<madlocke> just as an idea
<madlocke> would be a first step to make option more flexible...
<StyXman> uh
<StyXman> I see your point.
<StyXman> MB tooltip hould be a new tag. but I guess is not the way to go.
<madlocke> StyXman: i like the idea of new attributes/tags, too, but at the moment i cannot propose any good solution for this...
<StyXman> and I'm not a desition man.
<madlocke> maybe we should task delete all options, because options force men to make up decisions ;)
<StyXman> yes, sure :)
<madlocke> without the word "task"
<StyXman> :)) 
<madlocke> it's like with mirrors... when you look into it, it will always show you. you can't tell the mirror to show something you want to see. there is actually no option ;)
<madlocke> but ok you have the option to destroy the mirror ;)
<StyXman> wowo, that was deep. you'll teach me zen?
<madlocke> :)
<madlocke> StyXman: you are familiar with dtds?
<StyXman> madlocke: not a lot, but I can read them
<madlocke> ok... this week i have a lot of other things to do. will think about a way for new tags/attrs next week.
<reinhard> in case anyone here is going to visit linuxtag in karlsruhe
<reinhard> i would be happy to meet him at the fsfe booth (D22)
<madlocke> hm... shit... it ends before the 10th of this month, right?
<reinhard> yes
<StyXman> madlocke: I discovered why your example does not work: 
<madlocke> bad... i would like to come but before this date there is no time...
<madlocke> StyXman: ?
<StyXman> the tag should retrieve the option by hand.
<StyXman> label does not try to know about the "name" option...
<StyXman> because it's an extension and not core.
<madlocke> you are talking about the <text> child of option or of the attribute "name"?
<StyXman> it was 
<StyXman>       <label text="Nombre" x="1" y="1">
<StyXman>         <options>
<StyXman>           <option name="text" value="tonto"/>
<StyXman>           <option name="text" value="tontazo"/>
<StyXman>         </options>
<StyXman>       </label>
<madlocke> ah this example... :)
<madlocke> and you want to say that the <options> tag is required?
<StyXman> the parser says so, but I get no complain when I didn't use it.
<madlocke> the parser is not correctly implemented...
<madlocke> it ignores the ParentTags attribute of the xmlElements dict
<madlocke> ParentTags it's not an attribute, it's a key... sorry

<madlocke> http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci499008,00.html
<madlocke> if you want to know more...
<chillywilly> thanks, but I think there's a better way to compute and display a file size in human readbale form than use constants...so I am going to do it that way :)
<StyXman> those are not constants, are just multipliers.
<chillywilly> yea, but the one way I saw it done was lame
<chillywilly> 2^10 is a constant
<madlocke> hm...
<chillywilly> it always gives you the same number
Action: madlocke just thinks where to get his new 1pb hard drive ;)
<chillywilly> hehe
<chillywilly> why not a TB first?
<madlocke> 'cause i don't know a raid with 1000 hds ;)
<chillywilly> PB is bigger than a TB
<madlocke> yes... that's why i wrote it...
<madlocke> i need a pb hd because if i want a pb it is difficult to do is with tb hds
<madlocke> and i always want what i want.. erm :)
<madlocke> add a few letters then the sentence will be correct ;)
<StyXman> madlocke: think of this. if you add a tooltip, you'll need the widget to show it.
<StyXman> doing one time, two, five, all right.
<StyXman> but once you start to use it 10, 20, 100 times, you'll try to move the tooltip code to a clas.
<madlocke> i am thinking if this. that's why i want a solution for it...
<madlocke> because a tooltip is only one thing.
<madlocke> there will be other things too in the future
<StyXman> then is when you can say, well, why not add the class to the parser (actually, you'll need it to make your new things be of the new class)
<madlocke> so it would be good to a way that can handle this problem in general
<StyXman> and then is when you can say, well, this got pretty common, why not make them core (instead of <option>al)?
<StyXman> I guess the answer is: no, don't do it in general. that's what jcater or jamest said yesterday
<StyXman> do it case by case
<madlocke> the prob is that there is not a good solution for doing it in general now
<madlocke> if there is a good solution i think they won't complain...
<StyXman> again, don't do it in general. treat them case by case
<madlocke> for now of course...
<StyXman> but I think you better hear that from the responsibles.
<StyXman> not me. I'm just trying to help, just like you.
<madlocke> ... but i think it is ok if i think of different ways, too.
<madlocke> i am not changing anything without permission... i am making only suggestions
<madlocke> i understand their complaints about new tags/attrs that are not in the core very good
<madlocke> but as i already said... at the moment i unfortunately don't have enough time to think about it now...
<StyXman> madlocke: anyways, I'm not convinced that local extensions are bad. I mean, they're good as long as they stay local.
<StyXman> or may be we could wash our hands and see how 'patches' move around, just like kernel patches
<madlocke> or you make a forms-extra package or something like that....
<madlocke> one without support....
<madlocke> but again... next week...

<psu> hi all
<psu> dneighbo: yes, we do have quite a smattering of international players
<psu> which makes our dismal perf this season even more worrying
<psu> Danish goalie, USA captain, several Irish and the odd England irregular
<psu> but still finished one place off relegation
<StyXman> psu: what?!?
<psu> just replying to dneighbo's fusbol rant from several hours ago ;-)
<dneighbo>  :)
Action: dneighbo abhors penalty kicks
<dneighbo> both during and to decide ties
<dneighbo> they need to change teh rules
<dneighbo> its far to easy to make a goal on a penalty kick
<psu> during is fair enough
<dneighbo> denmark vs senegal is PERFECT example
<dneighbo> yes senegal did foul in the box
<psu> we used to have an ideal system for splitting ties
<dneighbo> but i do NOT think denmark had any hope for a goal on the play
<psu> it was called a replay
<psu> but we had to scrap those
<dneighbo> but they are awarded a penalty kick and an automatic goal
<psu> in an attempt to interest Americans in the game
<dneighbo> and end up tied 1-1 
<psu> (not full story, but part of it)
<dneighbo> when i think senegal beat the snot out of them
<dneighbo> now if a guy is one on one with goalie and gets nailed from behind
<psu> dneighbo: English team called Corinthian Casuals
<dneighbo> yes a penality kick is deserved
<psu> used to refuse to save penalties on principle when awarded against them
<psu> as it was the "gentlemanly" thing to do
<dneighbo> :)
<psu> we are talking 1800s here, however 
<dneighbo> mexico also won on a stupid penalty imho
<dneighbo> but i guess i can live with that
<dneighbo> deciding games on penalty shots after regulation is just horrid though
<psu> dneighbo: if it weren't for dodgy penalities, there'd be nothing to discuss in the pub afterwards
<dneighbo> psu: true
Action: psu used to like the replays in the FA Cup
<dneighbo> i say after regulation just play until someone gets a goal
<psu> you'd get one tie that would go to, say, 4 or 5 replays
<dneighbo> whether it be 5 minutes or 5 hours
<psu> so two teams would still be on 3rd Round 
<psu> & everyone else was on 5th Round
<psu> The team that eventually won usually lost the next round
<dneighbo> replays are wrong
<dneighbo> they just need to extend play
<psu> as they were knackered after all the replays
<dneighbo> eventually the players will exhaust enough to make dumb mistakes
<dneighbo> an example is american baseball
<dneighbo> rarely do games go past 10 innings
<dneighbo> (9 is regulation)
<psu> one practical issue of "bop till you drop" extra time
<dneighbo> because the teams pitchers are exhausted ot point where they start to bring in scrubs
<psu> is crowd safety 
<dneighbo> yeah i forget about hooligans
<psu> as the ground authorities like to know when match is going to finish
<dneighbo> the 10,000 that will show up to an MLS game here just dont get rowdy :)
<psu> rather than have an unexpected rush for the exit
<psu> Even in normal play, there have been fatalities because of this 
<dneighbo> i like the idea though
<dneighbo> as it PENALIZES teams that cant 'finish'
<dneighbo> i.e. a few overtimes that run 20 minutes over
<dneighbo> and it takes a toll on the team (which is good imho)
<dneighbo> as then teams that cant finish are penalized later in the tournament
<dneighbo> btw: as an american who loves soccer
<dneighbo> this is my #1 gripe
<dneighbo> with the sport
<dneighbo> not that there isnt enough scoring
<dneighbo> but that players and coaches a like are 'happy' with a tie
<dneighbo> hockey is like this too
<psu> as an informal supporter of the team that lost the most expensive penalty shootout ever
<dneighbo> and to an american that is just well un american
<psu> I guess I ought to agree ;-)
<dneighbo> even if a tie makes you 'advance'
<dneighbo> you should be bloody pissed off you didnt win
<psu> dneighbo: before they introduced 3 points for a win it was even worse
<dneighbo> psu: i 100% agree
<dneighbo> but i think that was a minor enhancement
<dneighbo> i think the only true solution is not have ties
<dneighbo> this is what hockey did
<dneighbo> during season they have ties
<dneighbo> in the playoffs no ties
<dneighbo> i think in the cup should be no ties even in early rounds
<psu> In the FA Cup, a tie can be a better result for a small team than a win
<dneighbo> to me it changes how the game is played
<dneighbo> because often times you play for a tie cause its all you need, or as good as a win
<psu> Say Piddlechester Albion get drawn at home to Manchester United
<psu> if by some miracle they beat them, they go on to play 
<dneighbo> so you end up with this boring ass sag soccer where they just sit on teh ball trying ot avoid getting scored on
<psu> Slightlylesspiddlechester in the next round
<psu> if they draw, they get a replay at Old Trafford
<psu> with a capacity crowd
<psu> and half the gate money
<psu> which is probably enuf for them to build a new stand
<dneighbo> :)
<psu> dneighbo: you never saw the Germany-Austria game in World Cup some years ago
<jcater>  /topic GNUe: For Up-to-the-date Soccer Coverage.... and how it relates to your Enterprise
<dneighbo> btw: the knock on americans is they wont watch soccer because its not 'high scoring'
<psu> when West Germany needed to win 1-0 for both teams to go thru'
<psu> Guess what the score was?
<dneighbo> i disagree and say they wont watch soccer because its not high action (historically)
<dneighbo> i remember in i think 86 maradonna was huge here
<psu> After that, they changed rules so final group matches are always simultaneous
<dneighbo> and in 90 it was schillachi (italy)
<dneighbo> because they were 'exciting'
<dneighbo> its not that they scored 10 goals a game
<dneighbo> its that every time they had the ball yo knew they were going to attack and it was going to be exciting
<dneighbo> even if they missed
<psu> the concept of an exciting 0-0 is an oxymoron to most people
<dneighbo> well to me it depends
<dneighbo> if there is lots of action and attacking
<dneighbo> and good defense and goalkeeping is why its 0-0 its exciting
<dneighbo> if its lousy offense, or this horrid tactic of sitting on the ball 'waiting' for an opprotunity
<dneighbo> then no its not exciting :)
<dneighbo> i think thats why lots of people like brazilian soccer
<dneighbo> they have a lot of players that 'make things exciting'
Action: psu will have to introduce dneighbo to cricket
<psu> some of the most skillful play I've seen 
<psu> has been batters stonewalling for a draw
<psu> and the bowlers trying to tempt them into something rash
<psu> a "great innings" might be, say, 30 runs over 6 hours if the situation requires it

<dneighbo> psu: btw: this morning on sports talk radio they were bagging on soccer
<dneighbo> and how they dont like that its in the paper and no one here likes it and such (which pisses me off)
<dneighbo> but get this
<dneighbo> they said 'soccer players aren't real athletes, they are just the guys who arent good enough to play football, baseball, basketball'
<dneighbo> i about died of laughter
<psu> maybe that is just about arguable for US
<psu> but anywhere but America, the richest sports stars are the football players
<dneighbo> well if their point was....
Action: psu can't remember what Beckham's new contract is meant to be worth
<psu> but say $100,000 a week
<dneighbo> the best AMERICAN athletes leave soccer for baseball, football, etc for more money i agree 100%
<dneighbo> but to say soccer players are not athletes and only people that cant succeed at other sports play soccer
<dneighbo> is just ignorant
<psu> sort of like (to bring back on-topic) "people only write free s/w
<psu> if they can't get paid to do it"
<Gedanken> oh, I don't know about that
<dneighbo> well there is that, but its laughable
<Gedanken> :-)
<dneighbo> look at say curt schilling arguably one of the best 'pitchers' in baseball
<dneighbo> is he an athlete?
<dneighbo> certainly
<dneighbo> could he last 20 minutes in a soccer, football or basketball game HELL NO
<dneighbo> same for the 400lb lineman in football
<dneighbo> i guess my point is that basketball and soccer are probalby the two sports where you HAVE to be fairly athletic to play
<dneighbo> football and baseball have 'specialities' much more so
<dneighbo> anyhow it was funny to me

<StyXman> is there any multiselect widget?
<chillywilly> I really wish that the commit list would use unified diffs
<chillywilly> context diffs suck
<jcater> StyXman: not yet
<StyXman> chillywilly: I agree.
<StyXman> jcater: are there plans? can I try to do one?
<StyXman> (for wx, I mean)
<jcater> um
<jcater> we need to think thru how we want it handled
<jcater> it'd be a block style
<StyXman> jcater: mb there's no need. a multiselect listbox?
<jcater> no need?
Action: jcater is confused
<StyXman> no need to be a block
<jcater> well, in my opinion, there is
<jcater> as a multi-select widget by definition isn't dealing with a single field
<jcater> but is dealing with multiple records
<StyXman> jcater: yes, the one I want deals with one field.
<jcater> and how can that be a multiselect?
<jcater> as a field can store a single value
<StyXman> I said one field but not one record.
<jcater> exactly
<StyXman> so?
<jcater> so it'd have to be tied to a datasource
<StyXman> yes
<jamest_> that implies block style
<jcater> back
Action: jcater always is thinking of "fallback"
<jcater> i.e., what would a UI driver fall back to
<jcater> if it doesn't support this nifty new feature
<jcater> I really need to think this thru more tho
<madlocke> jcater: which ui driver would not be able to support multiselect?
<jcater> that's not a valid question
<jcater> as we only have one at the moment
<madlocke> ok.
<dneighbo> still german speakers here?
<siesel> jcater: why not let a multi-select widget return a list of options like "optionA,optionB,optionC"
<madlocke> dneighbo: think so...
<jcater> siesel: true, but how would you tie that directly to a datasource?
Action: siesel can still speak german
<StyXman> jamest_: I now I understand. no, I think you mean that it should go in a block
<dneighbo> what does this mean?

<dneighbo> madlocke, thats what i thought
<StyXman> ho'...
<madlocke> first line: kind regards... bla
<jamest_> the one thing that sucks about putting it in a block is navigation
<dneighbo> it came to info@gnue.org as subj: request for account
<jamest_> as I have a similar need that I do via a block of dropdowns 
<siesel> jcater: it would be like the drop down list
<madlocke> something like: we bring offer and inquiry together
<jamest_> and it sucks as is
<StyXman> jcater: you have almost three
<dneighbo> but looked like spamn
<madlocke> "we make your business running"
<jcater> I have three?
<jcater> three what?
<jcater> three donuts?

<siesel> jcater: please fill up a. donuts  b. brain cells ;)
<StyXman> jcater: all of the abobe plus uidrivers
<madlocke> dneighbo: you have a url from this company?
<StyXman> ok, one is not a uidriver, but renders forms
<dneighbo>  /msg jamest_ unless navigator got good overnight i cant look
<jcater> navigator got REALLY good overnight
<jcater> think "Single Login Box"
<dneighbo> that came out wrong
<dneighbo> unless navigator got good before 24:00 CST
<dneighbo> i cant look :)
<jcater> oh
<jcater> rofl
<madlocke> dneighbo: it's an ecommerce company...
<jcater> we need a web screen for dneighbo:
<dneighbo> madlocke : many thanks
<dneighbo> webscreen?

<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> if you put a script in my home dir
<dneighbo> and give me proper perms
<dneighbo> i could live with that
<dneighbo> i tried to run it before, but stuff was in your home dir i think
<StyXman> dneighbo: did I thanked you for the papo announce i gnue.org?
<siesel> jcater: i thought of an  <entry name="state" field="state_code" x="17" y="2" width="15" visibleCount="15" foreign_key="validator.state" foreign_key_description="description" style="multiselect-dropdown">
<dneighbo> yeah, hope you guys are cool with it
<dneighbo> i left when you left
<dneighbo> and then got stuck here on phone
<dneighbo> so downloaded papo
<StyXman> multiselect dropdown
<dneighbo> and it installed really easy and ran
<dneighbo> so figured it was worthy of notification
<jcater> siesel: my problem with that is entry's correspond to single fields in single records
<jcater> so I'm not sure how it'd work conceptually
<jcater> btw, guys
<jcater> I *need* something similar too
<jcater> so I'm not arguing against such a thing
<dneighbo> im walkinginto a conversation here, but i think multiselect is less important
<StyXman> dneighbo: is that hit number real?
<dneighbo> that a good form
<dneighbo> er dialog
<StyXman> the one in the screenshot..
<dneighbo> as where i need multi select
<dneighbo> is say i have a company table
<dneighbo> and an item table
<dneighbo> i need a way to say xxxx items can be used by company x
<dneighbo> and the values get stored in an company_item table or such
<StyXman> dneighbo: I need one too.
<dneighbo> i.e. i dont need the multi select really 'in' a form
<dneighbo> but rather as a 'utility' to rapidly assign data
<dneighbo> once assigned it can be displayed in grid
<jamest_> l8r
<dneighbo> example once i selected items for the company in teh 'dialog'
jamest_ (~jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) left #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> it would update company_item table
<dneighbo> and then you could display
<dneighbo> company as master
<dneighbo> and item as detail using intermediate company_item 
<dneighbo> where items were in a grid
<dneighbo> jcater does that help make sense maybe how it could be used?
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> not as a form widget as much as a 'dialog' picker
<StyXman> dneighbo: here my example (I can't use my neurons for anything execpt chatting here). tell me if you can map this to you example
<jcater> that could work too
Action: jcater is envisioning 2 datasources being tied to whatever this thing is
<dneighbo> not saying we dont need a listbox in a form
<StyXman> I have a product, and I need to select all the mesurement types it can be mesured 'into'...
<jcater> 1) the datasource where the values are stored
<dneighbo> but i think the 'dialog' would work for a LOT of the cases and should be straightforward
<jcater> 2) the datasource containing all the valid vlaue
<jcater> s
<jcater> s/vlaue/values
<jcater> I think the dialog would work with every example I can think of that I'd need
<dneighbo> StyXman i dont know the linguistic of what you are saying but i would think you would have
<dneighbo> product table
<dneighbo> measurement_type table
<dneighbo> product_measurment table
<StyXman> dneighbo: forget abnout. I feel dizzy rigfht now. 
<dneighbo> you select a product (and snag its id)
<dneighbo> then you get a dialog
<dneighbo> on left side are all measurement types
<dneighbo> on right side is what types are valid for this product
<dneighbo> you move from left to right to define and click ok
ra3vat (ds@ics.elcom.ru) joined #gnuenterprise.
<madlocke> ra3vat: hi....
<ra3vat> hello
<dneighbo> then your product_measurement table is updated with valid entries of measurement_types for that product
<siesel> jcater: why not handle it as an normal entry with an additional datasource (containing all valid values).  The results would be stored in a field which can be stored in the datasource of the current block or which is used by a trigger
<madlocke> let me guess... you just got your connection back and running...
<dneighbo> 3 days laster you change your mind
<dneighbo> you open up that dialog
<dneighbo> the left side has types not picked and right side has ones you do have picked
<dneighbo> and then you move to be what you want click ok
<dneighbo> and the product_measurement table is updated
Action: dneighbo has no idea if that makes sense to what you are looking for
<ra3vat> madlocke: me?
<dneighbo> but it would highly helpful for me to have a 'dialog' that could perform this functionality
<madlocke> ra3vat: yep... because you come so late...
Action: Chipaca notes kde 1 on a hercules card sucks
<StyXman> dneighbo: slow down. i have too ppor sleep hours
<ra3vat> madlocke: i've just got back from moscow. glad to see the connection is OK all the time :)
Action: dneighbo wonders how you are going to stay up to watch the futbol match
<StyXman> dneighbo: heeh, I can sleep @ night
<StyXman> here's 19:18
<StyXman> go to sleep @ 22
<madlocke> ra3vat: maybe i will get a guest from moscow by the end of this month... think you know who :)
<StyXman> get up @ 8
<StyXman> 10 hours of sweet sleep
<ra3vat> madlocke: great!
<madlocke> ra3vat: you know if a "sakasnoe pismo" will be delivered faster than standard letters?
Action: jcater is away: dinner
<ra3vat> madlocke: I think it's a lottery, IMHO
<madlocke> hm. than i hope i have luck. from the last two normal letters, one did not yet arrive another took one month.
<StyXman> dneighbo: ah, like kde handles some things. I got it.
<madlocke> now i was printing address with big letter on the envelope so that they can read it really easy :)
<madlocke> it's for the invitation
<madlocke> big letters=big fonts
<StyXman> dneighbo: what I don't know is what we consider right. let me discuss it with the group.
<StyXman> I would prefer a muktiselect list box *the options are just a few in this particular case)
<Chipaca> StyXman: if they're really few, surely checkboxes are better?
Action: Chipaca doesn't know if checkboxes exist
<StyXman> Chipaca: yes, they exist
<dneighbo> well i have cvs commit access, a night home alone, and idea of exactly what *I* want, jcater is at dinner and jamest is gone, guess you get my implementation ;)
Action: Chipaca shudders
<StyXman> the problem in any case is how to move it yto the db.
Action: Chipaca carries on installing kde on his 486
<StyXman> I guess that neighbo's solution is pointong to solve that
<StyXman> dneighbo: :)
Action: StyXman congrats Chipaca for makin bo with kde1 run in that machine
Action: Chipaca bows

<madlocke> StyXman: why not anymore?
<StyXman> the only thing I didn't like was that it overwrited the conf @ close
<StyXman> madlocke: I use kde3
Action: madlocke used kde long time ago... then tried gnome... never tried kde again.
<StyXman> I used fluxbox when I put my hd on a p166 with 64 MB. kde3 is too much.
<madlocke> have to try it if there is more time...

<dneighbo> madlocke yes i use fluxbox on slow machines
