<dneighbo> fwiw: jcater: dcl does do attachments right just its not binding them right :)
<dneighbo> i.e. the patch is out in the /tmp dir :)
<dneighbo> just an fyi
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> hi dneighbo
<chillywilly> howdy masta
<dtm> whirred, gentlemen.
<chillywilly> jcater went bye bye
<chillywilly> hi dtm
<dtm> chillywilly: @#*)
<dtm> hi there
<ajmitch> argh, dtm
<dtm> chillywilly: nice of you to recommend our advice on fd-discuss ;)
<dtm> ajmitch: :-o
<ajmitch> dtm: you have to slap psu round a bit iirc
<dtm> ajmitch: whuh
<ajmitch> look at latest KC GNUe
<chillywilly> dtm: er, oh well you'll juts have to suffer the load of people lining up for your advice
<dtm> chillywilly: yay
<dtm> ajmitch: what's the url
<ajmitch> http://kw.zork.net/GNUe/latest.html
<ajmitch> sigh
<ajmitch> http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/latest.html
<chillywilly> dtm: was I in error in making such a suggestion?
<chillywilly> will I be beaten?
<dtm> chillywilly: no that's fine  :)  thanks
<dtm> ajmitch: what's the problem in specific sir?
Gedanken (~schatten@dv101s49.lawrence.ks.us) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> dtm: see section 20
<dtm> oh i just clicked on that  :)
<dtm> i see
<ajmitch> what do you see, good sir?
<dtm> this must be a REALLY tedious hobby of his  :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<dtm> i've never met David McWherter
<dtm> psu, fyi i'm Dan Bethe   thanks though :)
<chillywilly> ah, yea
<chillywilly> I noticed that too
<dtm> do you guys think my answer was at all coherent?
<chillywilly> ah well he tries his best
<dtm> i was really raeching :)
<chillywilly> I bet he will not call you by the wrong name again
<dtm> yeah i would definately not consider that a fun pastime at this juncture
<ajmitch> seems understandable
<chillywilly> he's good at ficing up things
<chillywilly> fixing
<dtm> oh i'm sure
<ajmitch> imagine reading thru all those logs....
Action: ajmitch will bbl
Action: chillywilly doesn't even read them anyway
<dtm> so what does this have to do with a kernel or a cousin?
<chillywilly> neither although some people here look like they have been spending too much time kissing their cousin(s)
Action: chillywilly runs away
<dtm> YAY
Action: chillywilly troutslaps dtm
<dtm> i done read me some storeys about tha-yat onna innurweb!!!! huhuhuhuhuh.
<chillywilly> rofl
<dtm> Huh.  huhuh.  huh.  huh huh.
<chillywilly> gown se my some naked lasies...www.com...clickity click click click
<chillywilly> ladies
Action: chillywilly 's best King of The Hill impersonation
<dtm> ever see that awesome Ren & Stimpy episode where the old boys sittin on the porch go "HAY!!  where done Sister Mama go at?"   "uhhhhhh   Ahhhh thank she done got et up by tha pigs!"
<dtm> that was some lad talkin to Brother Daddy
<dtm> or something
<dtm> etc
<chillywilly> Ren & Stimpy rules
<chillywilly> that is all...
<dtm> there was an awesome "kids in the hall" where one of em got kicked in the head by a cow or something
<dtm> that rewld
<chillywilly> hehe
<dtm> and he couldn't grab anything at the dinner table
<chillywilly> I likes the kids in the hall
<dtm> that was AWESOME
<chillywilly> liked
<dtm> until i moved into this apartment and disavowed cable tv, i watched it ever-day on Comedy Central
<chillywilly> I thought you had a house?
<Gedanken> The only reason why I have cable is because it is required to have a cable modem
Action: chillywilly had cable first
<chillywilly> then I got a cable modem connection
<Gedanken> well, I don't *have* have cable t.v. ... but if you don't you pay a $10 or $15 line fee ... 
<Gedanken> I have a really love/hate relationship with xml
<chillywilly> you love it and xml hates you? ;)
<chillywilly> s/it/xml
<Gedanken> working with XForms at the momment, trying to get a perl module to help ease the creation of them
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> I have been meaning to read the XForms spec
<Gedanken> it is interesting, the goal is to have it generic enough to render well on most everything
<Gedanken> in theory it would work for general application forms ... not just web
siesel (jan@dial-195-14-251-253.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> hi siesel
<siesel> hi chillywilly, hi all
<siesel> cw: are you still working on the IRC commdriver ?
<chillywilly> well yes
<chillywilly> slowly
<chillywilly> read all the relevant RFCs for kicks and downloaded python-irclib
<chillywilly> trying to make sense of the RPC stuff in common
<Gedanken> I really wish RPC had never been thought of ... as well as RMI
<siesel> if you have questions, please ask, I even thought of creating a commdriver stub where you can add the IRC things
Action: siesel really has to improve the documentation
<chillywilly> well I am reading a few things and going to try and make sense of xmlrpc first in order to get a jandle on the rest of it
<siesel> great!
Gedanken (~schatten@dv101s49.lawrence.ks.us) left irc: "sleep"
<chillywilly> am I correct in that SocketServer is synchronous and async_chat/async(whatever) is asynchronous?
<siesel> SocketServer is asynchronous too, (I think)
<siesel> if not its easy to make it asynchronous
<siesel> for IRC I think you need a dispatcher listening to IRC and starting up a new thread per method call (async)
<siesel> i dunno if there is already a function for that in the IRC lib
<chillywilly> the ssyncore/asynchat stuff uses select
<chillywilly> asyncore
<chillywilly> irclib is synchronous and blocking
<siesel> select ?
<chillywilly> yea, haven't you ever seen someone use select with non-blocking sockets to do i/o multiplexing?
<chillywilly> it has mostly the same advantages as threads
<chillywilly> without the added complexity
<chillywilly> man 2 select
<chillywilly> for the glibc function
<chillywilly> http://www.nightmare.com/medusa/medusa.html
<chillywilly> ttp://www.nightmare.com/medusa/programming.html
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> http://www.nightmare.com/medusa/programming.html
<chillywilly> even winders has a select() function
<chillywilly> but it onyl work with socets and nothing else
<chillywilly> er, sockets
<chillywilly> Beej's Guide to Network Programming has examples of usign select() in C too ;)
Action: chillywilly has all the bases covered
<chillywilly> btw, Medusa is now in the core python lib
<siesel> wow.
<chillywilly> you can always use threads though
<chillywilly> however, threads are claimed to be better for CPU bound operations
<siesel> you make me understand all the stuff I tried to use.
<chillywilly> not I/o bound
<siesel> at the moment pw_xmlrpc uses ThreadingTCPServer
<chillywilly> ah
<chillywilly> so the xmlrpc lib only handels doing the xml type stuff?
<siesel> yes.
<chillywilly> you implemented the networking stuff yourself?
<chillywilly> I would be curious to try the Ayncronous stuff once and compare performance
<siesel> one half of it, jcater begun it and i finished it.
<chillywilly> in _helpers?
<siesel> chillywilly. yes, it would be easy to switch it on per connections.conf option
<chillywilly> seems he started implementing an Async one too
<siesel> no, _helpers/Async... is not needed. There are 3-4 lines creating a MyHTMLServer at the top of ServerAdapter.py
<chillywilly> oh, ok ThreadingTCPServer is in the pythin lib
<chillywilly> python
<chillywilly> what is the point of the directory server?
<chillywilly> is this the methods repsitory thing that others have implemented?
<siesel> the GRPC file is parsed by the Parser and is building an object tree without binding information
<chillywilly> ok
<siesel> so directory server creates a dictonary indexed by method names containing binding, signature and helptext.
<chillywilly> ah yea
<chillywilly> like what the introspection methods return
<chillywilly> go on...
<siesel> yes.
<chillywilly> anything else?
<siesel> every server has a method call(..) or dispatch ... which checks for the method in the directory and calls it.
<chillywilly> ok
<siesel> at the moment this method is not in GCommbase or in DirectoryServer, but I think that it should go there, because it is similar in pw_xmlrpc and xmlrpc
<siesel> At the moment I try to implement dispatch handlers, to make the code more flexible and more readable
<chillywilly> the call method should go there?
<chillywilly> at any rate thanks for the info
<siesel> the server_loop receives a method request and calls the function "call" which is calling the requested function
<chillywilly> ok
<siesel> your welcome
<chillywilly> what is the pruprose of the Proxy object?
<chillywilly> to sit in the middle?
<siesel> its client side right?
<chillywilly> providing no network traffic
<chillywilly> ?
<chillywilly> I think it's like a short circuit thing
<chillywilly> but I'm not sure
<siesel> its the glue to make Donutspace.Backery.getStuff() working.
<chillywilly> btw
<chillywilly> hmmmm
<chillywilly> that's confusing
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> # NOTES:
<chillywilly> # This will be replaced with _helpers/AsyncSocketServer as soon
<chillywilly> # as it is operational. This SocketServer is not suitable for
<chillywilly> # production use -- it is a synchronous, blocking SocketServer
<chillywilly> # (i.e., it can handle one client at a time :)
<chillywilly> this is in DebugSocketServer.py
<chillywilly> seems like someone should hack on the Aysnc socket server
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: chillywilly just might have to play with that :)
<siesel> it builds up an object tree based on the request of the user. i.e. Donutspace.Backery.getStuff() will create a Backery object below that Donutspace object and a getStuff object at the bottom. getStuff will then call the method 'Donutspace.Backery.getStuff' using ClientAdapter.runMethod
<siesel> cw: I just forgot to remove DebugSocketServer.py from the repository :)
Action: chillywilly blinks
<chillywilly> hrrrm
<chillywilly> object tree?
<siesel> yes. a) server.request('Donutspace') will create an ProxyObject with the attrpath Donutspace.
<chillywilly> attrpath? you mean an atrribute? like ProxyObject.Donutspace?
<siesel> b) if you request Donutspace.sdfsdfsd the method ProxyObject.__getattr__ will be called, which is creating another proxyObject with the path 'Donutspace.sdfsdfsd' ...
<chillywilly> hmmm
<siesel> c) at the moment you call 'Donutspace.sdfsdfsd()' the method __call__ of that Proxyobject is executed. This method calls adapter.runMethod(attrpath) i.e. adapter.runMethod('Donutspace.sdfsdfsd') 
<chillywilly> k
<chillywilly> when you say below do you mean as an attribute of that object?
<chillywilly> i.e, it makes up the object/becomes a member of it
<chillywilly> proxy objects have to do with the bindings right?
<chillywilly> # bindings   A dictionary containing binding definitions. The dictionary
<chillywilly> #            is of the form: {server:handler} where:
<chillywilly> #              1) service: Name of the service being bound/exposed
<chillywilly> #              2) handler: Method that when called returns a class
<chillywilly> #                 instance i.e. {'DonutPlace',getDonutPlaceObj}
<chillywilly> #
<chillywilly> def bind(rpcdef, drivers, bindings):
<siesel> eeh, no, proxy objects just live on the client side
<chillywilly> oh sorry
<siesel> and do the 'direct access' to string mapping
<chillywilly> string mapping?
<chillywilly> you know what I should go to bed right now before it gets any later
<siesel> the binding stuff is all in directoryServer mapObjects
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> Sun Jun  9 03:10:02 CDT 2002
<chillywilly> ;P
<siesel> 'direct access' to 'string' mapping 
<chillywilly> ah
<chillywilly> and the string is the whatever.whatever.whatever type thing?
<siesel> yes 
<chillywilly> Donutspace.kickOutJcater()
<chillywilly> Donutspace.beforeHeEatsAllTheProfits()
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> hey now if you wanted geas ona  different machine than forms you would need common installed on both machines wouldn't you?
<siesel> chillywilly: ok, lets share the leftover Donuts
<chillywilly> :)
<siesel> yes, because common provides a) DB abstraction b) RPC abstraction
<chillywilly> and other utilities
<chillywilly> Parser, etc,
<siesel> GServerApp
<chillywilly> so proxy object is really like it sounds it is a proxy or "reference" to an object?
<chillywilly> like in the remote proxy design pattern
<chillywilly> where does the method call get marshalled out?
<chillywilly> er, that happens in the xmlrpc lib eh?
<chillywilly> nevermind, I keep answering my own questions
<siesel> it has two functions, a) Service to object mapping (started by the clientapp by parsing the Donutspace) b) stores information for dynamic objects. 
<siesel> cw: I like that. Continue answering ;)
<chillywilly> sorry, I know I ask too many questions
<siesel> in case of b its a kind of remote proxy object
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> it's not a remote handle is it
<chillywilly> bah
<siesel> hmm, don't know how to name it, but it just holds the object handle information.
<chillywilly> why is it needed?
<siesel> i.e. if you receive a dyn. object it returns a proxy Object with an attr like '[asdgadfgadfgdfhsdfg]'
<siesel> so if you call a method of that object like myObj.doSomething the following steps happen.
<siesel> 1. __getattr__('doSomething') creates a new proxyobject with the path '[asdgadfgadfgdfhsdfg].doSomething'
<chillywilly> oooooh
<siesel> 2. newproxyobj.__call__(params) execute adapter.runMethod(doSomething)
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> would somethgin like corba need a proxy object?
<chillywilly> shit dude
<chillywilly> I am going to bed now
<chillywilly> we can talk some other time
<chillywilly> or I'll email gnue-dev if it's that urgent ;)
<chillywilly> cya
<siesel> btw. appserver will need some functions in GNUeRPC to indicate which method call belongs to which session. So if you have some function in IRC for that please remeber them, or directly add some methods  
<siesel> ok, night
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> I'll keep it in mind
<chillywilly> night

<esands> dneighbo: sorry about that, but the cvs command I gave you "cvs rtag -b -r [oldtag] [newtag] [module]" required oldtag and newtag to be different.  Basically it was say, make all the files in module [module] with version at [oldtag] part of branch [newtag].  
<esands> That URL I mentioned explained it all.
ghunt (xavier@ppp-62-235-230-28.tiscali.be) left irc: Client Quit
<esands> If you wanted to change it so newtag was the same as oldtag, but a branch instead of non-branch tag, first you had to rename oldtag then create a branch (old)newtag (with the wanted old oldtag 8) on (-r) the (new)oldtag. 
<esands> The main difference between a tag and a branch tag is that branch adds a 1.rev.0.branch(... etc) version to the server RCS file.
<esands> you probably can 'fix' (change) things by removing the first xxx-stable tag and then renaming the xxx-branch to xxx-stable
<esands> ajmitch: Here an example of the state of the art for 'free' SME accounting in linux at the moment http://www.ncsysadmin.org/july2001/ncsa-gnucash-talk-4.html.  I use a method like this for my consulating company and its a damn chore at times compared to a proper 4GL system.

<esands> Hmm, this review (http://www.linuxjournal.com//article.php?sid=5669) meants a web interface for gnucash.  That might make things more accessiable.  Have to go hunting for it
<esands> The one good thing about gnucash is that it taught me how to deal with double entry and the accountants equation

mgedmin (~mg@bit.codeworks.lt) joined #gnuenterprise.
Action: dneighbo is away: bed
<dneighbo> hi mgedmin
<mgedmin> hi
<dneighbo> you work for m?
<mgedmin> yes
<dneighbo> you guys get things installed?
<mgedmin> what kinds of things?
<dneighbo> GNUe
<mgedmin> we built debs for gnue common, forms and designer 0.3
<dneighbo> cool
<dneighbo> i think 3 other people were working on them as well
Action: dneighbo didnt know that was something you all were looking at 
<dneighbo> if you post them and source others can help polish up
<mgedmin> i should probably put the changes we made somewhere
<mgedmin> one moment
<dneighbo> and we can give them to our debian maintainer so you can see them in sid(unstable)
<dneighbo> its late here 1:34 i was just getting ready to go to bed, but noticed the .lt domain
<dneighbo> did you have any questions before i run off?
<mgedmin> actually, yes
<mgedmin> I wonder if someone's working on problems with PostgreSQL numeric types
<dneighbo> what is the problem
<mgedmin> (SQL errors like "operator = not defined for numeric and double")
<mgedmin> (when trying to update a record containing a numeric field)
<dneighbo> do you have a sample form?
<mgedmin> I think I saw a message somewhere in the mailing list archives (can't remember exactly)
<dneighbo> and what postgres driver are you using
<mgedmin> psycopg
<mgedmin> actually the form you sent m as an example has this problem as well
Action: dneighbo always hates that half the time its our fault and half the time its bum db driver :)
<mgedmin> what postgres driver were you using?
<dneighbo> psycopg
<dneighbo> can you tell me what field in the form i sent you has the problem?
<mgedmin> if you try to update a field in the employee table, postgres complains
<mgedmin> Unable to identify an operator '=' for
<mgedmin> types 'numeric' and 'double precision'
<dneighbo> ok in the form i sent m?
<mgedmin> basically postgres wants explicit typecasts in statements like
<mgedmin> UPDATE employee SET foo=bar WHERE numericfield=123.4::numeric
<mgedmin> we also found that using
<mgedmin> UPDATE employee SET foo=bar WHERE numericfield='123.4'
<mgedmin> works too, but I'm not sure that's portable enough across databases
<dneighbo> you have lost me now
<mgedmin> okay
<dneighbo> please we must start at the problem, not what we think the answer is
<mgedmin> I run gnue-forms codeworks.gfd
<mgedmin> select a department that has employees
<mgedmin> change the title field
<mgedmin> click  "save all"
<mgedmin> and I get an error message at that point
<mgedmin> postgresql 7.2, psycopg 1.0.8
<dneighbo> ok give me like three minutes
<dneighbo> to update cvs and create the sample db and such 
<dneighbo> and i will get you an answer
<dneighbo> ok error is recreated here
<dneighbo> are you using cvs?
<dneighbo> or the official release?
Action: dneighbo thinks someone has introduced a bug in cvs OR the pyscopg driver in sid has been changed
<dneighbo> as when i ran this form before sending to m this problem didnt exist
Action: dneighbo is investigating
<dneighbo> btw: it appears the problem is AND department='1'
<dneighbo> i.e. department on the employee table should not have '' around its value
<mgedmin> hm
<mgedmin> currently I'm looking at the error message produced by 0.3.0
<mgedmin> but afair the same happened with cvs version on saturday
<mgedmin> the error message here reads
<mgedmin> ERROR: Unable to identify an operator '=' for types 'numeric' and 'double precision'\n  You will have to retype this query using an epxlicit cast
<mgedmin> Retrying the same SQL in psql results in the same error
<mgedmin> using
<dneighbo> correct same error i get
<dneighbo> but look at the query
<dneighbo> the last part will say
<dneighbo> AND department='somenumber'
<mgedmin> yes
<dneighbo> if you take that query and remove the '' around somenumber afer deptarment= i bet the query works
<dneighbo> in postgres
<mgedmin> don't think so
<mgedmin> quite the opposite
<dneighbo> it appeasrs someone has foobared the driver
<mgedmin> if we add '' around salary it starts working
<mgedmin> i'll doublecheck in a second
<mgedmin> yep, salary='400.4' works
<mgedmin> salary=400.4::numeric(9,3) works too
<mgedmin> plain salary=400.4 doesn't
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> something has changed here
<mgedmin> it's a PostgreSQL issue I think
Action: dneighbo cant get to work box from here but im 1000% positive this worked when i sent m the form
<dneighbo> and that was with our 0.3.0 release
<mgedmin> yes
Action: dneighbo has old postgres box here you have a minute
<dneighbo> i can try on it
<mgedmin> I've got all day
<mgedmin> it's morning here ;)
<dneighbo> its morning here too, EARLY morning :)

<mgedmin> I'm looking at a PostgreSQL book atm
<btami> hello
Action: derek is waiting for cvs to update on the laptop
<derek> hi btami
<btami> hi derek
<mgedmin> hello
<mgedmin> looks like PostgreSQL wants a typecast when it sees a numeric type in the WHERE part
<derek> grrrr
<derek> i get this on older box too
<derek> cvs
<derek> i swear this worked at the office
Action: derek goes to look at something
<mgedmin> it works fine when you try to add new records
<mgedmin> it fails when you try to update them
<mgedmin> or perform a query (no error messages, but no results either in that case)
<derek> maybe i didnt try to update one
<derek> i coudl swear i changed a salary though to test
<mgedmin> we found a workaround
<mgedmin> in DBSIG_DataObject._toSqlString
<mgedmin> replacing
<mgedmin>       elif type(value) == types.FloatType:
<mgedmin>         return str(value)
<mgedmin> with
<mgedmin>       elif type(value) == types.FloatType:
<mgedmin>         return "'%s'" % str(value)
<mgedmin> seems to help
<derek> thats where im looking now :)
<derek> BUT
<derek> how does that affect otehr db's
<mgedmin> I don't like that though
<derek> i.e. if it chokes other db's it needs to be in the postgres driver
<derek> and not DBSIG
<mgedmin> the Correct(TM) way according to PostgreSQL would be to return "'%s'::numeric(foo,bar)", where foo/bar depend on the schema
<mgedmin> oops
<mgedmin> s/'%s'::/%s::/
<mgedmin> although using just ::numeric seems to work fine too
<mgedmin> (for numeric fields -- didn't test with floats etc)
<mgedmin>  
<mgedmin> basically we do not need a solution right now, I just wanted to check if this problem was known
<derek> please submit this as a bug to common-support@gnuenterprise.org go ahead and attach your 'patch' (although its not good long term solution) and cc: info@gnue.org
<derek> i.e. this was not known problem
<mgedmin> okay
<derek> we should be able to produce a patch in the morning (your afternoon)
<mgedmin> I still don't feel comfortable with GNUe (ie don't know all the correct places to report problems etc)
<derek> i.e. official patch
<derek> worse case we put in the return "'%s'" until we can find a more elegant answer
<derek> btw: here is what broke it
<derek> http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/gnue/common/src/dbdrivers/_dbsig/DBdriver.py.diff?r1=1.48&r2=1.49&f=h
<derek>    elif type(value) == types.FloatType:           return str(value) was added 10 days ago
<derek> my box at work has cvs from more than 10 days probably not the 0.3.0 release so i bet it was working there
Action: derek really was starting to think i was nuts
<derek> it looks like jason was trying to fix an integer problem
<derek> i wonder if there is a types.IntType
<derek> or something
Action: derek wonders if you change salary to INT
<derek> if you have the same issue
<mgedmin> i want to experiment a bit with ints and floats before submitting a bug report
<derek> ok
<derek> ints work fine
<derek> change salary from numeric to int
<derek> in the .sql file
<derek> and rerun it and form works fine
<derek> so jcater hit an int and it blew up so he removed quotes
<derek> which fried the float
<derek> er numeric type
<derek> so need to find docs to see about types.XXXX
<mgedmin> there should be IntType and also LongType IIRC
<derek> to see if way we can isolate better to int instead of all number types
<mgedmin> BTW PostgreSQL accepts queries like "salary <> 100" but barfs on "salary <> 100.0"
<derek> yeah
<derek> i think it has to do with the .
Yurik (~yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> mgedmin: there are a few things happening here that i can see that are issues
<derek> best to address in the morning
<derek> example: when i turn the db field to int
<derek> the form appends a .0 to it
<derek> that causes issue
<derek> which i think is really the problem
<derek> i.e. jcater introduced a patch that says 'fixes integers'
<derek> i assume he had to do thsi because he was using forms type 'number' 
<derek> and it was appending the .0
<derek> which was hosing up integers
<derek> or somethign
<mgedmin> multiply that by # of different DBMSes, and different data types...
<mgedmin> yep this doesn't look like a trivial problem
<derek> i dont think its too bad really
<derek> i think its the UI entry widget that is causing the issue honestly
<mgedmin> the value has to be used in an SQL statement somewhere
<derek> mgedmin: let me explain what im seeing
<derek> in the form the entry is defined number
<derek> so regardless of if the db is int or float
<derek> its appending a .0 (if no decimal is defined)
<derek> the type(value)
<derek> isnt checking the DB field type
<derek> its checking the string contents
<mgedmin> OTOH the choice between 1.5, '1.5', 1.5::numeric depends on the DB/schema, not on UI
<derek> so that field will ALWAYS be float regardless of whether its int or not
<derek> we need to fix that
<derek> because if we fix that its a trivial problem
<derek> as you can if if type(value) == type.IntType or such do X
<derek> the way we have this implemented you simply put the most COMMON instance in dbsig
<derek> and anyone who isnt 'standard' you override in their driver
<derek> so i dont think the different db's doing different ways is that big a deal
<derek> its getting a way to define what the hell you actually are getting that has to be done :)
<derek> i hope that made sense
Action: derek really needs to go to bed its 03:00 and i have to be to work by 09:00
<derek> i will be back around then if you are still around send issue to email addresses i mentioned
<derek> and tell them to reference irc log as well
<derek> see you in the morning
Action: derek is away: sleep
<mgedmin> see you

alga (~alga@bit.codeworks.lt) joined #gnuenterprise.
<alga> morning
<alga> ;-)
<alga> I've a conceptual problem
<alga> we're trying to do XP 
<alga> that involves unit testing and functional testing of all the code written
<alga> the question is:  how do we test forms?
<alga> what to test in them?
meow-_ (~meow@212.199.198.11) joined #gnuenterprise.
<btami> hi alga
<btami> i think this is not a trivial task
<alga> yep
<btami> so try ask jcater/jamest later
<alga> OK
Nick change: meow-_ -> Luminion

<alga> we're ok with becoming gnue developers...
<alga> i've an impression, you have to be a gnue developer in order to do anything really useful with gnue
<btami> agree, but notice GNUe has only ver 0.3
<ra3vat> hello all
<mgedmin> hi
<mgedmin> if someone is interested in Debian packages of GNUe common/forms/designer 0.3.0, I've made diffs available at http://www.codeworks.lt/~mg/gnue/
<ra3vat> btami: but as I know tests in XP defined not upon developer's doc they should be defined on all steps of improving the code
<ra3vat> and the questions more how to use test packages (like pyunit?) with forms 
<btami> sorry, but i don't know to much about these 
<btami> just reading diveintopython yet
<esands> nickr and jbailey are the main guys working on the debs at the moment,  
<esands> they are doing some things to try and make the install mechanism more generic
<alga> ra3vat: pyunit is easily deployed, the problem is how to programmatically call/control the forms
<alga> we had an idea to write a special UI driver for that purpose, but later we dropped that
<alga> after all, we can always use the API the UI drivers use themselves
<mgedmin> actually, we with alga are still trying to decide what does it mean to 'test a form'
<mgedmin> ;)
<ra3vat> alga: ok, not tried it myself yet
<ra3vat> mgedmin: after testing some internals it should also simulate user interaction, is not it?
<ra3vat> mgedmin: do you also do a pair programming?
<mgedmin> yes
Action: mgedmin is away: lunchtime
Action: btami is away: lunch
<alga> pair programming is the fun part :-)
<ra3vat> alga: really? glad to hear that. Is it 100% mandatory thing for XP?

Gedanken (~schatten@typhon.eecs.ku.edu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> does XP mean XP (like windows or cross platform or extreme programming)?
<derek> re: other items, one should be able to do useful things with gnue w/o being a GNUe developer
<derek> BUT
<derek> i think they need to be a developer of some level to do something
<derek> i.e. they shouldnt have to be a GNUe tool developer, but they should have application development experience
<derek> re: testing
<derek> currently i have like 3 forms i use to 'test' things
<derek> as i find forms that 'break' things
<derek> i try to shovel them into my 'test' suite
<derek> i want to look at unit tester
<derek> that will test functions of GNUe w/o actually running forms
<derek> at some point we will need to build or find a free test suite to automate testing
<derek> at this point its burden of effort issue
<derek> i.e. not enough man hours
<ra3vat> extreme programming i think
<derek> as more people start to bring GNUe into production the more important test suite will come
<alga> true
<derek> has jcater come in yet?
<alga> derek, does it pay to test if the form can be loaded at all?
<alga> i mean, do forms often break on load?
<dneighbo> um yes an no
<dneighbo> as stated before a release i generally run about 5 or 10 different forms
<ra3vat> automate tests are what XP starts from 
<dneighbo> one is just simple no data form, with complex trigger
<jcater> dneighbo / dere: here
<dneighbo> jcater: can you read log
<dneighbo> re: db problem
<jcater> somewhat at least
<jcater> yeah, read it
<jcater> jamest just identified it
<jcater> it really p*sses me off that PostgreSQL 7.x can't handle implicit numeric conversions
<jcater> I mean, that's just down right backwards
<dneighbo> jcater: NO KIDDING
<Gedanken> erhm?
<jcater> something I'd expect from MySQL or something
<dneighbo> i about died when mgedmin
<Gedanken> What do you mean by implicit numeric conversions?
<alga> Gedanken: 1 > 2.0 breaks it
<alga> different types
Action: jcater *somewhat* understands int to double breaking it
<dneighbo> jcater: i started a patch, but i think the entry is causing issues as it makes the value FLOAT no matter what
<jcater> but one floating point to another floating point?
<Gedanken> alga: interesting, I have never experienced that
<jcater> dneighbo: yes, python "floats" are used for all our internal number storage
<dneighbo> other wise you could just use the type(value) == type.FloatType
<dneighbo> trick
<mgedmin> BTW I filed a bug report -- see ticket #54
<jcater> mgedmin: yeah, that was forwarded to me
<dneighbo> well let me rephrase that, postgres is the broken one here :)
<jcater> we originally had it always as strings
<jcater> i.e., "1.0"
<alga> Gedanken: no it doesn't
<Gedanken> no it doesn't what?
<alga> Gedanken: redev=> select 1 < 2.0;
<jcater> but that broke some databases
<alga> it works
<Gedanken> ah
<Gedanken> So what does break now?
<mgedmin> select 1::numeric < 2.0; breaks
<mgedmin> in realistic situations, "select foo from bar where baz = 1.0;" breaks when baz is of type numeric
<Gedanken> something about that bothers me and I think it is more of the SQL then anything
<Gedanken> At any rate, adding an operator shouldn't be too hard
<jcater> well, 
<jcater> adding an operator *may* not be too hard'
<jcater> it we have to do full-on introspection at form load time, that 
<jcater> could be a big performance hit
<Gedanken> I am talking about adding an operator to postgresql
<jcater> oh
Action: mgedmin too would like to hear something from postgresql side -- what is the purpose of this 'feature'
<Gedanken> the postgresql guys are pretty responsive, but Tom can be a dick some times
Action: dneighbo hopes this is a postgres bug, but doubts it
<dneighbo> as i have postgres 6.5.x here and it does same thing
<jcater> frankly, my opinion of PostgreSQL just took a dive southwards
<jcater> as any "reason" they can provide is a technical one that *should* be hidden from SQL users
Action: jcater is sure there is a "reason" behind it
<dneighbo> to me it makes NO sense either
<mgedmin> BTW, AFAICU forms currently perform the updates by constructing an SQL statement and listing *all* fields in WHERE clause.  Is there a way to use only the primary key instead?
<jcater> yeah, that's something we need to look at
<jcater> if updating a queried record (and not inserting a new record and then updating it in same session), then the 
<jcater> database's "row id" is used
<jcater> IF the database supports such a thing
<jcater> (I know Oracle's does)
aditya_gilra (~aditya@61.0.108.254) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> now what database wouldnt havve an oid?
<dneighbo> or uid?
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> ;)
<jcater> PostgreSQL 7.2
<dneighbo> ?
<dneighbo> it used to have oid?
<jcater> from 7.2 and beyond, oid's are optional
<dneighbo> you saying they removed that
<jcater> they made it optional
<dneighbo> sigh
<jcater> there's no guarantee any more
<dneighbo> guess people do stupid things to 'compete'
<Gedanken> nah, it is perfectly resonable
<jcater> there's a slight performance improvement, iirc
<Gedanken> not all tables need OIDS ..
<jcater> BUT
<jcater> err, nevermind
<jcater> I won't go there
<Gedanken> OID wrap around anyone?
<jcater> ?
<dneighbo> i guess i cant think of a good reason to not have an OID
<Gedanken> the issue was that OIDs could wrap around and thus not be unique
<dneighbo> true every table might not need one
<dneighbo> BUT
<Gedanken> which kinda invalidates that whole OID thing
<dneighbo> thast like saying i might not ever need a spare tire so why bog my car down with the extra weight
<Gedanken> of course this was for databases of a really really large size, but ... it exists
<derek> so we have a fix in the works for htis
<derek> if so what ? (me is curious) to the approach
<Gedanken> I could see why a implicit conversion between type numeric and type float doesn't exist
<Gedanken> er ... non-implicit
<aditya_gilra> God Remembrance
<aditya_gilra> Soory to interrrupt
<derek> well way i look at it, it doesnt matter much
<Gedanken> the numeric type is quite a bit different then float ... too much just to allow transient coversions
<derek> postgres is a db people will be using, we need to support their quirks whether we agree or disagree with them
<aditya_gilra> from India
<aditya_gilra> we're developing a production system
<aditya_gilra> few queries
<aditya_gilra> can i ask?
<jcater> Gedanken: my only issue with that is other major databases do it implicitly
<jcater> aditya_gilra: sure
<jcater> Gedanken: BECAUSE it's a technical detail that the average user of SQL shouldn't be concerned with
<jcater> but it's a moot argument
<Gedanken> jcater: I can understand that, but I would to see their definition of the SQL types
<jcater> because the PostgreSQL has already decided to implement it that way :(
<jcater> so we must support it :(
<aditya_gilra> we're trying to change the list of values in a dropdown entry from a trigger
<Gedanken> jcater: well yes at this point in time you have two options: 1) work around it using implicit casts or 2) write the operators and submit it for inclusion to the postgresql team
<aditya_gilra> we're able to update a datasource from a trigger 
<aditya_gilra> the block attached to that datasource updates itself
<aditya_gilra> BUT, a dropdown entry attached to a datasource does not update itself if
<aditya_gilra> we change the datasource via trigger eg. form.dtsAUTHOR_COMBO.createResultSet({"author_en":"Swamiji"})
<derek> aditya_gilra: correct, this is known issue
Action: derek needs to file a bug for it (i might have already)
<derek> oh wait you might be having different issue than what im thining
<derek> thinking
<derek> jcater: what if we made forms more descriptive?
<derek> i.e. what if instead of 'numeric' for type cast we had
<derek> 'float' (or double or whatever you want to label it)
<derek> and
<derek> 'integer'
<derek> instead of just numeric?
<jcater> derek: I was trying ****really**** hard to avoid that
<jcater> as it goes into support issues I didn't want to deal with
<aditya_gilra> here's a small sample of the form I'm having problems with
<derek> jcater: im not saying i like it
<derek> but only way im seeing it other than is db introspection
<aditya_gilra>     <block datasource="dtsbook" name="blkBOOK">
<aditya_gilra>       <entry field="new_code" name="inpNewCode" width="10" x="20" y="1"/>
<aditya_gilra>       <entry field="old_code" name="inpOldCode" width="10" x="20" y="2">
<aditya_gilra>         <trigger type="Pre-FocusOut">
<aditya_gilra>           print "Ram"
<aditya_gilra>           resultSet = form.dtsAUTHOR_COMBO.createResultSet({"author_en":"Swamiji"})
<aditya_gilra>           blkBOOK.inpAuthorTupleId = 1
<aditya_gilra>           print "Krishna"
<aditya_gilra>         </trigger>
<aditya_gilra>       </entry>

<derek> we dont have i18n working in forms yet do we?
<derek> Arturas ?
<derek> not in the .gfd part only in the tool right?
<aditya_gilra> Please note the trigger in entry inpOldCode
<aditya_gilra> It updates the form.dtsAUTHOR_COMBO datasource using a conditional
dneighbo (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<aditya_gilra> Now note the dropdown entry inpAuthorTupleId which uses the datasource we updated in the trigger namely dtsAUTHOR_COMBO
<aditya_gilra> However, the list in the dropdown entry doesn't get updated.
<derek> you didnt call any method to do so
<aditya_gilra> But if we have a block using the same datasource, it gets updated automatically
<derek> well thats because the block code is calling the event to refresh
Action: derek hasnt looked at this in a while, but i think you could instead do things via the block methods
<derek> instead of datasource methods
<aditya_gilra> Looking at the code, it seems to be registering itself with GFDataSource
<derek> and then the refreshing etc is called automagically
<derek> or if you call datasource directly then you have to call block refresh methods
<aditya_gilra> Block registers with GFDataSource but dropdown entry doesn't register
Action: derek still isnt a fan of block
<Arturas> derek: sorry for delay; no modifications on the way forms work with data
<Arturas> in i18n field
<derek> but as we are starting to move forward with some other things i think i might see some value 
<aditya_gilra> Basically we wan't a way to refresh the list in a dropdown
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-110.wasp.net.au) left irc: Connection timed out
<derek> you say we....
<derek> is there a mouse in your pocket ;) (sorry my mothers old expression)
<aditya_gilra> Can you tell us how to do it?
<derek> aditya_gilra: well currently part of the issue is this isnt supported even if you do NOT use triggers
<derek> i.e. the dropdowns get loaded at start time only
<derek> it is a problem for others as well, we have started to discuss best way to handle
<derek> as we dont want them updating all the time as that could be a large penalty hit
<derek> er s/penalty/performance penalty
<aditya_gilra> We're  able to update the recordset of a datasource and the block connected to it
<aditya_gilra> automatically updates because it's registered as a listener with GFDataSource
<aditya_gilra> But dropdown does not register as a listener with GFDataSource even though it is attached to
<derek> aditya_gilra: im talking contents of dropdown
<aditya_gilra> a datasource.
<derek> correct
<derek> this is known 'bug' / 'feature request'
<aditya_gilra> Maybe you caould tell us how to hack it to do the same?
<derek> it was designed to act this way and now we know it needs to be different
<aditya_gilra> could
<derek> just the executive decision hasnt been made on how to make the change
<derek> i.e. we dont want to change it so it ALWAYS updates
<derek> as for most forms dropdowns are static 
<derek> i.e. other things on the forms arent updating them
<derek> so to have them requery all the time would be bad performance
<aditya_gilra> two of us here - hence 'we'
<derek> my suggestion was at the entry level (or datasource level) to add an attribute called refresh
<derek> and if refresh is true then you refresh otherwise you dont
<derek> others had idea of menu option to do it

<derek> i dont remember if a way was decided
<derek> jamest was tackling the issue and he isnt in yet this morning
<derek> jcater: have you any opinino on the matter
Action: derek must run to work
<aditya_gilra> there doesn't seem to be anyway to do it in the present code
<derek> er drive to work
<Arturas> hm, another short question - in docs is written that <block> can have master, detail attributes; however, as i try to run form with such blocks and attributes, i get error:
<Arturas>  gnue.common.GParser.MarkupError: Error processing <block> tag [I do not recognize the "detail" attribute
<derek> aditya_gilra: i believe you are correct
<derek> Arturas: i think that stuff got moved to datasource
<Arturas> old docs?
<derek> yes i think so
<Arturas> thank you
yogurt2unge (~charlie@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
Action: derek hasnt tried to put detail/master in the block for some time so i cant say for certain
<derek> but that would be my gut reaction
<aditya_gilra> About i18n - we've made a few minor changes and forms works for Hindi in the data fields
Action: derek is away: work
<aditya_gilra> We've (two of us here, no mouse) also made a pygtk2 forms client
<aditya_gilra> gtk2 has good i18n support
<aditya_gilra> once the pygtk2 client is a bit more stable, we'll send it in
<aditya_gilra> A second query
<aditya_gilra> how to specify conditions either in the  datasource tag OR
<aditya_gilra> in a trigger
<aditya_gilra> I looked at a file called GFConditions.py but it seems a bit complicated
<aditya_gilra> Any documentation on conditions

<dneighbo> hmmm im only finding stockades
<dneighbo> to hard to code like that 
Action: dneighbo keeps digging
<siesel> Chipaca: you've tried phpforms
<siesel> ?
<dneighbo> hmm seems i have a few 5 day old loafs of Chipaca
<dneighbo> jamest if you try to escape im pelting you with them
<Chipaca> siesel: I tried to try phpforms
<Chipaca> siesel: actually, I started to try to try to try phpforms
<jamest> :)
<dneighbo> siesel since jamest is here.....
<dneighbo> you have an account on ash?
<siesel> yes.
<dneighbo> if so can you setup an instance of php forms there?
<StyXman> jamest: hi
<dneighbo> i would like to set up a sample
<dneighbo> of a few forms and from our webpage allow people to bang on it
<siesel> there is one already, just abit old version.
<StyXman> jamest: I'm planning the grid thing.
<StyXman> jamest: I want you advice
<siesel> i will updated it :)
<dneighbo> cool then if you can email derek@gnue.org on how to use it or where a sample is etc that i can build from that woudl be great
<StyXman> jamest: you still breathin', man?
<jamest> barely
<dneighbo> StyXman you trying to say i have his collar too tight?
<jamest> i just logged in so people would know I'm alive
<dneighbo> jamest were you briefed on teh postgres issue?
<dneighbo> and if so you have any response to handle?
<StyXman> jamest: ah, ok. then I'll try some hacks and then report anything I made work here, someday.
<jamest> postgres issue?
<jamest> no
<jamest> and I don't think i'm behind on mail
<jamest> (for once)
<jcater> jamest: basically,   ERROR:  Unable to identify an operator '=' for types 'double precision' and 'numeric'
<jcater> typecasting issues :(
<jamest> :(((
<jcater> see, I thought "psql" mean "Postgres + SQL"
<jcater> now I'm seeing that it means "Piece of Sh*t Query Language"
<jcater> as what other SQL implementation would require you to explicitly identify two numeric types to compare them
<Chipaca> jcater: psql doesn't, afaik
<jcater> Chipaca?
<jcater> that's the issue
<Chipaca> jcater: unless you're doing something way below sql
<jcater> no, dude
<Chipaca> jcater: let me check
<jcater> we are doing "select ... where mynumericfield = 1.0"
<jcater> it treats 1.0 as a double precision
<jcater> and mynumericfield as numeric
<jcater> and gives you that error
<Chipaca> drat!
Action: Chipaca hates it when he's wrong
<jcater> Chipaca: you don't know how much I WISH you were right
<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> believe me at about 7am my time you had about 6 people wishing you were right
<Chipaca> jcater: but it works with 'select * from thing where n>1'
<dneighbo> yeah thats what is so darn evil
<StyXman> jcater: can I ask you a question related to scrollbar?
<jcater> um
Action: jcater doesn't know too terribly much about scrollbar
<jcater> don't use them
Action: Chipaca looks at 'select * from test where cast(a as real) > 1.0;' and shudders
<jcater> gah!
<StyXman> jcater: no, scrolbars are empty, AFAIK. I want to know what you want from it.
<jcater> I'm not sure
<StyXman> I mean, what you intendit to do. I want to do a simple grid. but a much better grid.
Action: Chipaca looks at 'select * from test where a > cast(1.0 as numeric);' and shudders some more
<jcater> I haven't thought about them in a while
<jcater> they'd have to be bound to a block somehow
<StyXman> I'm looking wx's scrollbars for some info, but I don't know what should I do with it
<StyXman> jcater: yes, I'm thinking in a kind of block, that could have any amount and kind of entry's
<StyXman> you then say whow much rows want to sse at once, and the block should pass that info to its childre, i.e., the entry's
<StyXman> brb. nature calls
<dneighbo> that was jamest original intent iirc
<dneighbo> was to allow scrollbar to bind to block
<dneighbo> so when you did entry row="10"
<dneighbo> and did a scroll bar of 10
<dneighbo> it would act pretty much how a normal scroll bar does
<siesel> Chipaca: you can try out the database demo of phpforms at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jan/phpforms/gnue-forms.php?c=demo2 if you want. But the database less mode still has some issues. I will look over it again.
<StyXman> I'm back. jcater, you thought of something?
<jcater> StyXman: you see dneighbo's comments?
<dneighbo> siesel its ok, real mean dont do databaseless forms
<StyXman> I want them functional today, and I intend to hack what's needed.
<dneighbo> s/mean/men
<jcater> other than that, I don't know what else you need
<jamest> scrollbars where meant to tie to block as dneighbo said
Action: dneighbo pinches self?
<jamest> and simply do the next/prev records to make the blocks look nice
<jamest> er
<jamest> sorry
<dneighbo> did jamest and jcater both agree with me ?
<jamest> dneighbo doesn't know what he's talking about
<jamest> it's all tha AZ crack, just ignore him
<StyXman> well, I think then bound to blocks that will have entry's inside (as children).
<jamest> feel better now dneighbo?
<dneighbo> much
<StyXman> the block is who says how much rows will be shown.
<jcater> StyXman: yes
<StyXman> ok, now. where to start? I'm rather lost here. gimme just a hint, and I'll explore it.
<StyXman> again
<jamest> hmmmm
<StyXman> I'm looking wx's scrollbars for some info, but I don't know what should I do with it
<jamest> they are completely empty
<StyXman> yes
<jamest> nothing there to see really
<jcater> unfortunately, I really don't have time to think about scrollbars today 
<jcater> :(
<StyXman> not in uidrivers or GF.
<StyXman> ack. then I'll try something from wx's info.
<jamest> my quick and dirty scrollbars were going to do
<jamest>   look at the block/datasource to get record count and based upon the rows (visible) set the size of the scroller
<jamest>   then set the up/down of the scroolbar to only really do a next/prev record event
<StyXman> jamest: yes, but GF is still too empty. should I start adding 'standar' behaviour?
<jamest>   after each next/prev event have the scrollbar look at the top visible record and adjust the scroller position to be about right 
<StyXman> ok, keep saying ideas. I'll start to see.
<jamest> sure
<jamest> as there is no std behaviour yet :)
<jamest> so it's a clean slate to work with
<StyXman> ok, I'll hack a little and comment about progress.
<jamest> just make sure dneighbo doesn't like it and you'll be good to go
<jamest> whoops, i shouldn't have publicly admitted to jcater and my design philosophies
<dneighbo> StyXman i will make it easy for you
<dneighbo> i really hate the idea of a scrollbar
<dneighbo> i dont think we should have one
<dneighbo> even if it has minimal functionality its bad bad bad
<jcater> boing!
<dneighbo> no you cant go wrong
<StyXman> dneighbo: I think users are very uesd to them.
<dneighbo> er now
<dneighbo> StyXman im teasing
<StyXman> used
Action: StyXman is translating....
<dneighbo> as the joke is if i agree to it, it must be a bad idea so dont do it
<dneighbo> so im using reverse psychology :)
<jcater> gives new meaning to: RPN
<jcater> reverse psychology notation
<StyXman> but how much reverse it hould be? how much time should I reverse? I'm confused...
Action: StyXman grins
<dneighbo> i think where they come from its called
<dneighbo> muy loco gringo
<dneighbo> or somethign
<StyXman> tai chalao
<StyXman> (you're chalado, like you smoked something but not tobacco)
Action: StyXman grins again
<dneighbo> hmmm stoned/
<dneighbo> chalado == stoned
Action: dneighbo coudl like this
<dneighbo> no longer are we stuck with 'i must be on crack' to express oneself
<dneighbo> instead you could say
<dneighbo> man im muy chalado today
<StyXman> stoned, yes, but not the same semantic.
<StyXman> tai pirado.
<StyXman> tai del tomate
<StyXman> and so on...
<dneighbo> btw: did i tell you guys i started lobbying more poor local goverment?
<Chipaca> StyXman: go hack
Action: Chipaca grins evily
<dneighbo> and got very interesting response
<StyXman> warinig: that's basic cordobanian.
<dneighbo> they gave me some break downs on the 'discount rates'
<dneighbo> but this is classic
<dneighbo> they must decide by july 31st or m$ penalizes them
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> m$ still to this day hasnt told them what an agreement for the OS will cost
<dneighbo> only office
<dneighbo> Under the State Bid programthe costs for the service contracts are as follows; both require a minimum of a two (2) year
<dneighbo> contract, with an annual payment. Under Microsofts definition only the newest version of a release is considerred current. In
<dneighbo> the future (After July 31st) if an enterprise is not under a software maintenance plan there is no upgrade price and all
<dneighbo> software will be purchased as a full system.The below cost are on a per machine basis.
<dneighbo> Microsoft Office
<dneighbo>  *  Upgrade Advantage - for non current systems $ 231.00 for two years (This goes away, after July 31st)
<dneighbo>  *  Software Assurance - for current systems $ 85.29 per year with a two year minimum contract
<dneighbo> Operating Systems
<dneighbo>  *  This is the price were waiting for as it is still moving, it looks like about 1/2 of the above cost for the office product
<dneighbo>     or hopefully a little less,this only needs to be done on machines we plan on keeping in service and that need OS upgrades
<dneighbo>     allot of notebooks etc. will not need to be upgraded.
<dneighbo>  *  The main concern here will be the OS for Servers
<dneighbo> now how messed is that
<dneighbo> UPGRADE or DIE 
<dneighbo> ok whats it cost?
<dneighbo> i dont know.
<dneighbo> typical m$
<jamest> i was talking to wife about this some this weekend
<jamest> i'd love to see free software people do volunteer work to setup things like
<jamest> ltsp w/ openoffice and a killer main system
<dneighbo> we are doing that at schools here now
<jamest> at schools/govs etc
<dneighbo> with our LUG or trying
<dneighbo> i actually know the mayor on name basis 
<dneighbo> so i might approach him
<jamest> as i know here small dept can't afford to do free
<jamest> as they have noone to support it :)
<dneighbo> jamest: KSU doing Enterprise AGreement?
<dneighbo> if so do you have 'numbers'
<dneighbo> i.e. can you tell me what they are telling you an office
<StyXman> GF things are pretty plain. all the logic are in uidriver's?
<dneighbo> 'upgrade advantage' and 'software assurance' will cost
<dneighbo> as if its radically different i would be interested
<dneighbo> as supposedly one of teh selling points of this crap was m$ wasnt doing 'volume' discounts anymore
<jamest> n oidea
<StyXman> jamest: that answer goes for me?
<jamest> no idea to derek
<jamest> the UI drivers should be brain dead w/ all the logic in the GF*
<Gedanken> We have something interesting going on at KU ... the department pays a set amount and we have access to all Microsoft productivity products with unlimited license for use for academia ... not infrastructure

<jcater> if you had to choose between RedHat SuSe for a production server, which would you do?
<jamest> no that dress doesn't make you look fat
<jamest> (and turn off the webcam...please)
<jcater> jamest: but, but, but
<jcater> that's not what you said when I was trying the thongs out
<jamest> argh!
<jamest> :)
<jcater> if you had to choose between RedHat or SuSe for a production server, which would you do?
<jamest> My only experience with SuSe was in SF
<jamest> before I got debian to play nice on those IBms
<jamest> IIRC that was SuSe
<jamest> but I can tell you why I quit using RH
<jcater> well, 
Action: jcater quit using RedHat too :(
<jamest>   crappy QA - RH6.something shipped with par printer support broken
<jamest>   the RPM system
<jamest> don't recall what suse used
<jamest> IIRC it had some purdy graphical thingy to config/install/maintain system
<siesel> suse use RPM too
<siesel> :(
Action: jcater will probably go SuSE
<jamest> ew
<jamest> you poor bastard
<jcater> SIGH
<jcater> I'm torn
<jcater> as I hated RedHat
<jamest> but you know it :)
<jcater> BUT
<jcater> 1. I know it
<jcater> 2. It'll be on a Dell PowerEdge 6400 (4 proc smp)
<jcater> 3. Dell ships out RedHat on these things
Action: jamest is too jeallous to talk about this anyjmore
<jcater>   so you'd think RedHat is more likely to support the obscure RAID/etc controllers on the machine
<jcater> BUT
<jcater> Oracle develops on SuSE
<jcater> and SuSE is their preferred Linux 
<jamest> rofl
<jamest> just like solaris x86 eh?
Action: jamest runs
<jcater> don't go there, dude
<Gedanken> jcater: I predict Oracle will change to RedHat soon ... you did see the announcement between them, RH, and IBM right?
<jcater> Gedanken: I did not see that
Action: jcater tries to avoid Oracle news
<jcater> :)
<Gedanken> hehe
<Gedanken> probably safe that way
<jcater> if I could find Oracle 7 binaries for Linux
<jcater> I'd downgrade to that 
<jcater> and say to hell with this upgrade cycle
<Gedanken> uhm, that is just ... wrong

<jcater> and that's been 2 years
<dtm> jcater: why'd you "upgrade" then :)
<jamest> I'm sure oracle end of lifed his arse
<jcater> well
<jcater> basically, yes
<jcater> :(
<jcater> plus we had 7.x under SCO
<jcater> which also went the way of the dinosaur
<jcater> and we had to upgrade our capacity
<jcater> because of some acquisitions
<jcater> it's a touchy subject, to say the least
<dtm> jcater: istr this subject :)

<dneighbo> ok can i have an opinion
<dneighbo> PLEASE dont go SuSE
<dneighbo> they are entering into the United Linux thing
<dneighbo> and honestly it just looks shady
<dneighbo> i cant say they ahve done anything wrong yet
<dneighbo> but i would hate to see a good free software user like yourself support htem (monetarily now)
<dneighbo> and then really regret it later
<dneighbo> remember already SuSE doesnt offer binaries/ISO's and such to people
<dneighbo> i cant say i like redhat
<dneighbo> but i think it will be no better nor no worse than suse
<dneighbo> dell/redhat combo is probably pretty good for support combo

<chillywilly> why do banks have such hacks for software?
<jcater> because all the really good programmers do free software
<chillywilly> hell it should import all my past history since I ever had an account

<dneighbo> um its chillywilly 's fault
<dneighbo> that bozo did it

<chillywilly> dneighbo: nah, I think it is da masta's curse
<chillywilly> he looked at it funny
<chillywilly> it doesn't like thise title tags in your itemized list siesel
<siesel> why. Its absolute standart conformant. 
<chillywilly> I don't think it's allowed there

<^chewie> Well, I've been trying to figure out where the heck to start with GNUe ;-)
<^chewie> there's a real strength in the simple one-to-one relationship between forms and database
<jcater> siesel: gConfig is being reworked at the moment
<jcater> so don't do too much to it
<chillywilly> why not just make them sub sections?
<chillywilly> 1.5 Design Considerations
<chillywilly> 1.5.1 Reusability
<chillywilly> ....
<chillywilly> like that
<^chewie> but I can't seem to wrap my mind around the "master:detail" record idea and how it's supposed to be articulated in the .gfd
Action: siesel hides his head in shame (listitem have no title :( )
<^chewie> is there any definititive docs on how gfd's are laid out, their syntax, etc?
<chillywilly> or
<siesel> cw: would be ok.
<chillywilly> ok
<^chewie> I have this wonderfully normalized database, but can't seem to step through this little wizard to create a working form
<^chewie> so, I'm trying to find a point of entry to understand what's going on, any tips
<chillywilly> mater-detail is just like any 1 to 1 database relation, IIRC
<chillywilly> but I don't jnow how to make forms to cooperate with it ;)
<chillywilly> you'll have to ask jcater or dneighbo
<^chewie> hmm
<chillywilly> siesel: are you going yo change it or should I?
<chillywilly> btw, thanks for all the docs :)
<siesel> jcater: strike, I've outwitted GConf !!!! 
<siesel> cw: change what? the actual cvs version is error free ;)
<chillywilly> er?

<siesel> I've commited a foobulations.gpd some minutes ago, technical correct, but with a very poor grammar. Could be a start ... 
<siesel> cw: yes. access to child elements per _children to the parent element per _parent
<siesel> one object per xml elements, sub element -> children, attributs -> attributs, i.e. <tag name="itsme"> -> class tag, def name=itsme
<dneighbo> siesel im thinking of a single .gpd per sample dir
<dneighbo> then a .gpd at the root
<dneighbo> actually you know what i want to discuss this better
<dneighbo> for debs we have to pull samples away from the rest
<dneighbo> im thinking we need to do something similar to wx
<dneighbo> and have samples be separate tarball etc
<dneighbo> sep deb/rpm yada yada yada
<siesel> do you think we should seperate them in the cvs too?
<siesel>  s/the//
<dneighbo> probably
<dneighbo> i would love to see our docs
<dneighbo> and our www
<dneighbo> be separate cvs modules altogether
<dneighbo> but thats another discussion :)
<dneighbo> basically eventually i would like to see each tool be separate module as well
<dneighbo> as i forsee at some point
<dneighbo> giving person A access to say gnue-common cvs but perhaps not gnue-reports cvs
<dneighbo> especially if we go to something like what the linux kernel does
<dneighbo> where things go through a single maintain

<Arturas> Since stock RH7.2 installs Python 1.5.2 you will need to install Python2.1 and the Python2.1-devel package. This is easy because the RPMs are on Disc2. Install them with rpm -Uvh <package name>. Now this install doesn't remove Python 1.5.2 so we have to make sure that the right one gets used.
<Arturas> this is for RH7.2, but i guess it will go for RH7.3 too :)

Action: ^chewie readies the bucket
<Gedanken> ^chewie: laugavalin ...  ymmy
<derek_> at one time i was employed by a health and fitness club (gym/personal trainers/sauna/spa) outfit
<derek_> i started to do their membership management stuff with gnue
<^chewie> excellent job
<derek_> as some of the early proof of concept stuff 
Action: ^chewie nods
<derek_> i created the tracker item in samples/
<derek_> actually orginally it was REALLY simple and i was using to track assignments for GNUe to FSF
<derek_> i.e. name tracker and some of the fields there
<^chewie> k
<derek_> well then i started using DCL at work
<derek_> and really disliked how it handled contacts
Action: ^chewie nods
<derek_> i talked to mdean and he needed better contact support in dcl as well
<derek_> so we rewrote a contact spec (data dictionary)
Action: ^chewie nods
<derek_> which you will find as part of HEAD of DCL (note only HEAD has it)
Gedanken (~schatten@typhon.eecs.ku.edu) left irc: "coding at the coffee shop"
<derek_> and are in process of modifying DCL to use the new schema for contacts
<^chewie> under docs or something?
Action: ^chewie nods
<derek_> no its in scripts/ something
<derek_> it is THE schema
Action: ^chewie nods
<derek_> anyhow the FSF needed donor management and some tracking software
<derek_> they have decided to use DCL and as part of that im making some GNUe screens for contact management
Action: ^chewie nods
<derek_> that will have items to do donation management etc
<^chewie> sweet
<derek_> that is part of the fsf-contacts project on savannah
<derek_> the modified sql stuff and forms are in its cvs
<derek_> but that project is not public
<^chewie> is the DCL head at sf.net?
<derek_> its supposed to be, but loic hasnt fixed it yet :(
<derek_> yes dcl head at sf.net
<^chewie> the dclgw module?
<derek_> yes
<derek_> hey you know what just a second
<derek_> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/fsf/datadictionary.html
<derek_> i think thats pretty up to date
<^chewie> ok, I was going to say
<^chewie> it looks like they have NO contact mgmt separation in their tables in the DCL head
<derek_> it is separate in head
<derek_> that datadictionary was built from dcl cvs head
<^chewie> hmm
Action: ^chewie went to script/install/pgsql
<derek_> well it uses our magic new datatool
<derek_> where you define schema in xml
<derek_> and run an xslt to generate the create/insert scripts for each db
<derek_> and its creates the pretty html i gave you as the link
<^chewie> ah
<derek_> so its possible that hte pgsql file wasnt 'refreshed'
<derek_> http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/dcl/dclgw/scripts/install/xml/dcl.xml?rev=1.6&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup
<derek_> should be the xml version
<derek_> and you are indeed correct the createdb.sql script under scripts/install/pgsql/ is out of date
<derek_> if you have the cvs tree 
<derek_> you just need sablotron and pysablot
<^chewie> it looks better in teh xml
<derek_> then you can do i think 
<derek_> build.py dcl.xml pgsql.xsl createdb.sql
<derek_> or something similar and it will generate the file for you
<derek_> i really like the html output
<derek_> its nice and clean and easy to read :)
<derek_> i hope to get sometime today to work on this stuff
<derek_> especially if you are interested
<derek_> and get things organized
Action: ^chewie nods
<^chewie> definitely
<^chewie> the psyablot site on sf.net is way out of date
<^chewie> looks like the project is dead there
<^chewie> and I don't see a debian package for it
<jcater> ^chewie: http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/debian/
<derek_> its not ddead and we do have debs
<derek_> um what jcater said :)
<jcater> courtesy of nickr
<derek_> yes we need to get him to be maintainer of it so it gets in sid
<derek_> i think i had an action item there
<jcater> we need to get it renamed
<jcater> as proper name is python2.1-sablot
<derek_> ah the deb
Action: ^chewie nods
<^chewie> well, if you need a sponsor for the package, let me know
Action: ^chewie is chewie@debian.org
<^chewie> ;-)
Action: derek_ was thinking its not ours to rename, but the package yes we need renamed
<derek_> if you are willing to maintain/sponsor it please see nickr 
<derek_> it needs to be done
<derek_> anyhow that was the short/long story of contact management
<derek_> jcater: btw: this only reinforces the fact we need a good tutorial
<derek_> i have some canned stuff i do on demos and such to show
<derek_> problem is its ugly to 'write' up
<derek_> i wish i had a way to screen capture all my screen/voice while i worked
<derek_> so i could do a demo
<derek_> and capture as digital and we could post on website 
<derek_> as 'online' gnue class
<derek_> do you know of freesoftware that does that?
<^chewie> not of the top of my head
<StyXman> I just want to say: what an *ugly* hack you have done in GFObjects.
<StyXman> fro the correct value of 'you'
<StyXman> s/fro/for/
<^chewie> in comparison between your schema for contact mgmt and the one I cooked up, there are a few differences
<^chewie> one that makes it more difficult to manage in my case
<^chewie> e.g. I used a table to tie two data tables together: person, address, and person_address
<^chewie> i.e. fully normalized
<^chewie> however, this may get to be too much of a headache
<^chewie> the idea is that there's less duplication of address data
<^chewie> in retrospect, it's not that important
<^chewie> so, ease of mgmt should probably win out for a less normalized schema
<jcater> we had a long discussion about that exact example
<derek_> its just not logical there
<jcater> a month or two ago
<derek_> you are 100% correct
<derek_> in that from a compsci view
<jcater> and there's a point at which normalization becomes too academic
<jcater> and unimplementable
Action: ^chewie nods
<derek_> having the table is correct
Action: jcater is all for data normalization
<derek_> however in practice
<jcater> but have normalized myself to project death before
<derek_> what you gain is used to little that the overhead it puts on UI design
Action: ^chewie nods
<derek_> not only kills the developer but ultimately confuses the user
<derek_> i am all for normalizing and discussing if we missed normalization
<derek_> but we have to be practical 
<derek_> if that makes sense
<^chewie> the other thing I did was have one table for all phone, url, email, etc named comm
<^chewie> i.e. person_comm table w/a lookup for comm_type
<derek_> at one point i had that
<^chewie> it reduces the tables, but complicates things slightly
<^chewie> so, I don't disagree w/having a phone table
<derek_> i think i spread back out for 
<derek_> a. uncomplicating
<^chewie> I just wanted to avoid it
Action: ^chewie nods
<derek_> b. helping with size hopefully helping speed
<^chewie> The one thing I disagree with on the DCL schema is the separate tables for accounts v.s. contact v.s. personel
<derek_> im not sure i remember fully but i think i had similar problems
Action: ^chewie looks at the raw XML again
<derek_> i think they need to be separate tables 
<derek_> but all shoudl use contact
<derek_> example you should have an accoutn table
<derek_> but it doesn have first_name
<derek_> is points to a contact
<derek_> you have a personnel table
<derek_> and it points to a contact
<derek_> i.e. you only enter people in a contact table
<^chewie> I would go a step further
<^chewie> enter people in a person table
Action: derek_ looks back at it looks like that is what dcl is doing
<^chewie> a contact is really someone associated w/a particular organization, company, or account
<derek_> you have an account table
<derek_> account_addr table
<^chewie> yeah, they cleaned up the account table, but there's an account_addr table, too
<derek_> account_contact table
<^chewie> ah
<^chewie> there it is
<derek_> best i can tell contact really = person
<derek_> as it only has first/last/middle/active
<^chewie> there must be a reason for their duplication
<^chewie> otherwise, I see no reason for an account_phone or account_addr table
<derek_> for what duplication
<derek_> well account phone has account_id
<derek_> now true you could jus thave one addr table
<derek_> then have a table
<derek_> account_addr
<derek_> that had
<derek_> addr_id
<derek_> account_id
<derek_> but again there isnt a ton to be gained by this
<derek_> one could say sure change the company address and all employees change 
<derek_> but in theory its more likely sally sue moves fromt he denver to the san francisco branch
<derek_> some yo yo goes in and changes her contact record
<derek_> and viola now the whole denver branch has moved to the san francisco branch
<derek_> now you coul make it so the ui doesn allow somethign like this
<derek_> and while the tables support hte many to many the ui doesn
<derek_> but then it goes back to the 
<derek_> a. complexity
<derek_> b. less data in specialized tables = better performance
<derek_> exmaple i have 30,000 contacts (with 30,000 addresses)
<derek_> i avhe
<derek_> 10 companies (with 10 addresses)
robble (~I@dg-4-p42.winshop.com.au) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<derek_> now i run acompany report
<derek_> im having to pick that 10 ut of 30,000 each query
<derek_> now in that sample probably wont be a big deal but if i have 1,000,000 contact and 20 companies
<derek_> etc
<derek_> but anyhow
<derek_> im definitely open to discussion
Action: ^chewie nods
<^chewie> no arguments about your example
<derek_> its the classic
<derek_> 'finding the sweet spot'
Action: ^chewie nods
<derek_> i STRONGLY believe in normalization thats what RDBMS were designed for
Gedanken (~schatten@dv252s56.lawrence.ks.us) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek_> but i believe there is such a thing as over normalization as well
<derek_> the problem is its 'gray area'
<dtm> derek_: so do you go to other databases and say "You're not normal."    or maybe medicate them   LOCK THEM UP/!??  where *Exactly* do you draw the line, mister?!
<dtm> chase em outta town with some torches and pitchforks?
<derek_> well mysql is not normal and it should be locked up
<^chewie> I have no problem w/an unnormalized DB as long as there is a reason for the duplication
<dtm> OIC
<derek_> after the crap codeworks found in postgres if it doesnt deserve to be locked up it should definitely be on probation
<^chewie> I'm giving DCL the benefit of the doubt when I said, "There must be a reason why they picked to create account_address" instead of using the existing "contact_addr" table as a reference.
<Gedanken> that is what views are for ...
<dtm> ^chewie: well if you dont like that then you can convert it to beverage format.  Remember, "log in and have a double".
<^chewie> i.e. account_addr table contains: contact_addr_id
<derek_> ^chewie we discussed it some but not as much as we did re: the phone/address we started with
<^chewie> dtm: ;-)
<dtm> ^chewie: that'll perk ya up and set ya straight
<derek_> Gedanken good point, i think there was some concern many db's dont support views
<derek_> let me restate that many free software dbs
<dtm> derek_: so gnue is definately going to have a booth at LWCE, eh?
<derek_> i think that might be fixed now though and maybe its worth looking at
<derek_> yes, booth #6
<dtm> derek_: elite
<derek_> PLEASE help me man it
<dtm> derek_: i can herp choo
<dtm> derek_: i hope i'm not ill by then.  i feel ok but dont know about contagiousness.
<dtm> :}
<dtm> derek_: do you buy your own plane ticket?
<dtm> or are you driving
<dtm> derek_: do you need lodging
<dtm> i'll lodge ya somewhere!  ;)
<derek_> you can certainly use it as a forum to discuss the teleconferncing services you offer
<derek_> do you know if phpGroupware will be there
<derek_> i keep trying to talk to seek3r but miss him :(
<derek_> he is in part of california we visit several times a year
<derek_> and was hoping we could hook up there sometime
<dtm> i dont know
<dtm> yeah he mentioned that
<derek_> i will be going through that part of town on my way to SF
<dtm> OIC
<dtm> you'll be driving then
<derek_> so if he isnt going to LWE i could see him then
<^chewie> so, if we go about packaging a Contact Management package/module for GNUe, how should we go about it?
Action: derek_ hopes he will be going to LWE
<dtm> derek_: maybe you could pick him up ;)
<derek_> my wife is coming with me, so lodging is iffy
<^chewie> would you like to adopt the build.py scripts DCL is using for their schema generators?
<dtm> derek_: iffy in what way
<derek_> dtm: i could probalby do that
<dtm> derek_: are you allergic to cats/dogs
<derek_> in that there are two of me
<derek_> not allergic
<derek_> ^chewie that is what is tough
<dtm> derek_: well then i have a place for ya
<derek_> and has been my ultimate worry
<dtm> derek_: i have a queen bed, 2 or so inflatable beds, and a couch.
<derek_> as we need a way to do like 'base' module with add-on's
<derek_> i.e. dcl would usge gnue-crm base module
<derek_> and the fsf contact system would use gnue-crm base model
<derek_> for now i have basically been doing duplicate work :(
<derek_> i have a fsf-contacts cvs tree
<derek_> and there is the dcl cvs tree
<derek_> pretty much the fsf-contacts one is identical to dcl
<derek_> only it just contains the schema
<derek_> and i put the forms in there
Action: ^chewie nods
<dtm> derek_: all i can say is that i vote for your CRM to in some way integrate with phpgw, and to have a migration tool away from phpgw's Addressbook and Infolog.
<derek_> we need to fix this though
<derek_> dtm: im all for that
<dtm> derek_: or else I'll....  oh you are?  :) 
<derek_> dtm: if you are serious i might take you up on the lodging part
<dtm> derek_: sure thing dewd
<derek_> the wife will is kind of squemish about such things
<derek_> but i will run it by her
<derek_> i owe her a few nights a luxury hotel though
<dtm> derek_: i'm ~60 mins from SF, by car or BART
<derek_> so it would probably only be for a day or two
Action: derek_ would prefer bart
<dtm> derek_: hehehe   luxury hotel  :-o
<dtm> i'll come stay in your hotel  ;)
<derek_> i am odd in that i like to experience the city when i travel
<dtm> yeah
<derek_> however the wife might not want to use bart :)
<dtm> well hey you're not gonna get much closer contact with the TRUE ESSENCE of the area than riding BART and a trolley!
<^chewie> hmm, one small thing on naming fields
<derek_> in NYC i had more fun riding the bus around town and walking the streets than anything else
<derek_> ^chewie shoot
<dtm> derek_: ok well my place is petite but clean... my mom lives here...  I have nothing which could be blatantly considered a weapon, no criminal record..
<^chewie> personally, I find it a little redundant to name a field after the tablename plus "ID", i.e. table == person, field == person_id
<^chewie> why not just person.id
<^chewie> ;-)
<^chewie> let the context of the table name itself give the field meaning
<derek_> i agree 100% on this one
<^chewie> k
<derek_> im not sure i like dcl_xxx as table names either
<derek_> some of this stuff will fall under 'standards' for gnue applications
<derek_> i just havent been too worried about it yet
Action: ^chewie nods
<^chewie> You know, if normalization of a database isn't a 100% requirement, then using Python introspection to define and translate class objects into RDBMS representation becomes much easier
ToyMan (~stuq@65.167.123.51) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<derek_> well that is another argument for another day 
<derek_> the old GEAS did somethign like this
Action: ^chewie nods
<derek_> there are pluses and minuses
<derek_> for now i need something ASAP
<derek_> i cant wait for an object/relational mapper to come around 
<Gedanken> wow, very hard concept
<Gedanken> btw, are you guys going to have perl bindings for your stuff?
<derek_> but i expect one to materialize (newer versions of appserver)
<derek_> and a migration tool will exist
<derek_> Gedanken yes an no
<derek_> i expect that the trigger engine will eventually support perl
<derek_> if someone writes the perl hookup
<Gedanken> hmmmm
<jcater> if anyone wants to tackle that
<jcater> look at zope's Perl Script support
<Gedanken> I might do it
<derek_> the gnue-common might someday support other languages
<jcater> as they have perl bindings for python
<derek_> if when its more mature it is deemed laudible to expend the efforts to port it to C or such that would allow that
<jcater> pyperl iirc is the name
<derek_> read: we are not against such a thing
<Gedanken> I still am looking over your guys work
<derek_> but are limited on resources so its not high priority as of yet
<derek_> i hate to steer people away (really, but im honest)
<derek_> if you really like perl
<derek_> there is a project very similar to gnue-forms
<derek_> but nearly as geared towards db's
<derek_> or crossplatform work
<derek_> called entity (http://www.entity.cx) i think
<derek_> and iirc its all in perl
<Gedanken> Scripting languages supported include Perl, Python, Tcl, Javascript and C (compiled and loaded at startup). 
<^chewie> ok, maybe the type-less nature of Python will throw a monkey wrench into my last statement ;-)
<Gedanken> Intersesting
<^chewie> I see why there's been talk about ODMG and why gcd was necessary
<^chewie> derek_: do you want to head up some sort of gnue-cmr, then?  How should we go about organizing this?
<^chewie> derek_: there are certainly other holes for me to fill so I don't duplicate your work
<dtm> derek_: heheh i just realized that if you're staying here and picking up Seek3r then that means seek3r would be staying here too  ;)
<derek_> um yes i would like to start the gnue crm package
<derek_> the problem is to do that we need to probably use the module proposal template yada yada yada
<derek_> and put out for review and such
<derek_> which is great and i want to do that, but i have time constraints for FSF
<derek_> so im torn
<derek_> you around tonight at all
<^chewie> maybe
<^chewie> I usually try to leave work behind, if you know what I mean

Chipaca (~john@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) left irc: "ircII EPIC4-1.0.1 -- Are we there yet?"
Action: ^chewie hypothesizes about using reference counters in normalized DB's to help in decision making while avoiding costly adhoc "count" queries.
<^chewie> relational DB's get pretty hairy when trying to apply object concepts to them
<StyXman> jamest or jcater, you hear me?
Action: StyXman notes that jamest does the same ;)
<chillywilly> what are you talking about ^chewie?
<^chewie> I was musing on the complexity that RDBMS's introduce to an application when you have a normalized database
<chillywilly> okey dokey
<^chewie> we were discussing the idea that an address record shared between personal and the company benefit from being edited once and changed everywhere, but if the UI is designed under the presumption that data is atonomous of eachother, than someone could open up the editor and change the data incorrectly
<^chewie> so, two ways to combat that at the application layer
<chillywilly> btw, this is always a nice doc on relational design --> http://www.utexas.edu/cc/database/datamodeling/index.html
<^chewie> 1) even though the DB is normalized, you never let people share records between themselves or between companies
<^chewie> 2) implement a before-commit trigger that counts references to a given address record and confirm with the user that it will indeed change for a number of users
<^chewie> 3) de-normalize the database
<^chewie> cool, I'll look at it
<chillywilly> I see
<^chewie> if 1, then you bypass one of the benefits of a normailzed DB
<chillywilly> what about record locking?
<^chewie> how would you conditionalize that?
<^chewie> that has potential, actually
<chillywilly> you tell them they can't play with it because someone else is modifying it
<^chewie> different problem
<chillywilly> in the appserver I think we wil be locking the objects
<^chewie> however, you can lock it w/a special field saying "I'm referenced multiple times"
<chillywilly> how is it different?
<^chewie> and then apply the logic based on that "state" field
<^chewie> it's different because multiple aren't really editing it
<^chewie> you and I work for the same company, let's say
<chillywilly> ok
<^chewie> we each have a person_addr record that references address.id
<^chewie> that is also referernced in the org_addr table under address_id.
<^chewie> so, two reference tables, one detail record in address
<^chewie> The context to the address is delivered by the reliationship table
<^chewie> i.e. person_addr.addr_type
<^chewie> for me, it may be "mailing"
<^chewie> for you, it may be "billing"
dsmith (dsmith@oh-strongsvillecadent1-1aa-222.clvhoh.adelphia.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<^chewie> and for the company, it may be "personel"
<chillywilly> yea, I get it you have an adress that can be referenced from many different places
Action: ^chewie nods
<chillywilly> it si "shared"
Action: ^chewie nods
<chillywilly> to reduce redundant data
Action: ^chewie nods
<chillywilly> i.e., make it "normalized"
<^chewie> if it changes, it changes everywhere
<^chewie> obviously, not a light operation, responsibility-wise
<^chewie> there has to be a way, under that circumstance, to confirm with the user (editor) that the change is indeed what they want to do
<jcater> and the issue I presume you are talking about is: what happens if a person has as his work address the corporate headquarters
<jcater> and he moves to another branch
<jcater> well, if his address is "shared"
<jcater> and you went to change it
<^chewie> you change the "id"
<jcater> you'd also change the corporate one
<^chewie> you create a new record in person_addr for the new person->addr relationship
<^chewie> instead of changing it
<jcater> ^chewie: as long as your users understand when to change the id, or when to change an address
<jcater> and that is a tall order
Action: ^chewie nods
<^chewie> exactly
Action: jcater has had this problem
<jcater> repeatedly :(
<chillywilly> I see, so you want to make this more friendly to clueless people ;)
<^chewie> the UI must be able to either hide the logic or reflect it accurately
<jcater> chillywilly: it's not as simple as that
<jcater> i.e., be careful with the term "clueless"
<jcater> as in this example, the screen will get very complex
<derek_> a few items and i breached them earlier
<derek_> is you must fix the ui which makes it complex
<derek_> which means people get confused
<derek_> which means they make mistakes
<derek_> now you can 'trap' it with lots of exceptions and messages (complex)
<derek_> then users freak and mess up
<derek_> so then you make it so that only certain users can do X
<derek_> and pretty soon you are in pain
<jcater> chillywilly: as in this example, the screen will get very complex
<chillywilly> I am joking, but what I was saying is you want to hide the nitty gritty but still let them know somehow so they are surprised that it happened
<jcater> damn
<^chewie> this is where you need to hide the logic in calls to object-layer methods
<jcater> that was an old message
<derek_> i.e. if you have a rule that says the user can change the address
<derek_> BUT
<derek_> if the address belongs to more than one person it throws a message (hey dummy this is a shared address by X people)
<derek_> one of two things happens
<derek_> a. the user doesnt care and just hits ok
<derek_> b. the user panics and clicks no and tells the customer, sorry i cant change your address
<derek_> c. they create the new address (when there is no need)
Action: ^chewie nods
<derek_> so you decide to game the system
<derek_> and instead of doing this if you change a 'shared' address you need access level of X
<jcater> what usually happens is they get in the habit of doing "c" because in their mind, that causes the least damage
<derek_> so now only a few 'clued' peopel can perform this function
<derek_> yada yada yada
<derek_> im going to say in principle it sounds like the greatest idea
<derek_> in practice i think you would have to work pretty hard to make it really solid
<derek_> that and shared addresses should be the EXCEPTION
<derek_> not the rule
Action: ^chewie nods
<jcater> I have one more opinion to throw out here
<derek_> i.e. there generally isnt a lot of address sharing
<jcater> extending what derek_ is saying
<derek_> i.e. there are lots of employees in a company
<derek_> but you point them to the company record to get the address
<jcater> imho, about the only time you'd use this sharing feature is with autopopulated sources
<derek_> in a sense
<^chewie> derek_: which, is to say that the direct relationship between person->company address isn't necessary
<chillywilly> i think it is more important to encapsulate the "employee" functionality then it is to reduce redundant in that case
<derek_> ^chewie right
<derek_> person->company->company_address
<chillywilly> cause it makes life difficult if you try to share
<^chewie> ah, there's a phrase I remember popping up years ago, "autopopulated sources"
Action: ^chewie grins
<derek_> im not convinced sharing is evil
<derek_> i think its rather good
<derek_> but its rather an implementation issue
<derek_> im all for expirementing with it
<derek_> but for now i need something quick
<derek_> robust but not over engineered
<^chewie> chillywilly: yes, the employee table referencing a person.id record as person_id foreign key is fine.  The data in person isn't going to change often, and when it does, you WANT everyone to know.
<chillywilly> btw, anyone looking for a good jabber server that has a AIM transport can use mine at frell.dyndns.org :)

<jcater> wassup?
<ajmitch> not much :)

<MicahY> hi all........
<MicahY> anyone wanna give me a quick tip in installing on RH 7.3?
<MicahY> [root@eclipse GNUe-Forms-0.3.0]# python2 setup.py install
<MicahY> [...]  mx DateTime.... No
<MicahY> rpm -q egenix-mx-base
<MicahY> egenix-mx-base-2.0.3-py2.2_1
<MicahY> anyone home?
Action: ajmitch is
<ajmitch> but i'm yet another debian user
<MicahY> hmm. that's forgiveable I guess.
<MicahY> I tried to install debian a couple months ago but couldn't get X to work...
<ajmitch> ah
<MicahY> have a G400.  Didn't try *REALLY* hard.  Red Hat is OK for me.
Action: ajmitch never had problems, probably due to older, supported hardware
<robble> ajmitch: are the woody debs of gnue reasonably up to date ?
<ajmitch> robble: i doubt it :)
<MicahY> anyway, I had GNUe working a year or so ago.  Am now wanting to hack on it again, and build an app.
<MicahY> buy why the heck doesn't python see the installed egenix stuff?
Action: ajmitch looks

<ajmitch> there might be a separate datetime package?
<MicahY> hmmm....
<MicahY> no, looks like DateTime is included in this RPM I have installed.
<MicahY> is there an evn variable I can set to point Python to the right dir?
<ajmitch> from mx.DateTime import DateTime
<ajmitch> yep, should be, where is the DateTime pkg at the moment?
<MicahY> /usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages/mx/DateTime/DateTime.py
<MicahY> hmm... RPMs aren't supposed to go in /urs/local!!!!
<ajmitch> is python2 symlinked to python2.2?
<ajmitch> yeah, that looks broken
<MicahY> no symlink, but it's 2.2
<ajmitch> export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.2:$PYTHONPATH
<ajmitch> that might get it to see stuff in /usr/local
<MicahY> should..... but it's not... :(
<ajmitch> or even try export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.2:/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
<MicahY> yep that did it!
<MicahY> thanks...
<ajmitch> great
Action: ajmitch would rather place messy symlinks in /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages

<MicahY> I just made a script to set the environment....  needed to add the /usr/local/gnue/lib/python to it anyway.
<MicahY> now I'm not seeing the forms client executable installed anywhere....?
<ajmitch> gnue-forms?
Action: ajmitch really prefers to use setup-cvs.py
<ajmitch> since it installs symlinks in /usr/local/bin, sets up the python path, etc
<MicahY> ah there it is... I was looking in /usr/local/gnue....
<MicahY> ok, got the hello form running!
<ajmitch> great
<ajmitch> you should play with designer :)
<MicahY> yeah, last time I used GNUe that didn't exist.  Need to install it next....

<derek> quirky?
<derek> jcater: you here?
<MicahY> quirky... yeah...... right now it's not letting me edit anything in the prop editor
<derek> um i think this a wx bug
<derek> make the property editor big enough the scroll bar goes away
<derek> and then you should be able to edit
<MicahY> no scroll bar in the way.  I just keep clicking on an entry and banging on keys, and don't get an edit cursor
<MicahY> I did at one point, not sure what changed
<jcater> MicahY: do you have a hi-res screen?
<MicahY> ok, I maximized it and can edit!
<MicahY> 19"
<MicahY> 1024X768
<jcater> did you have the prop editor in lower right corner of screen?
<MicahY> uh..... right middle
<jcater> oh
Action: jcater had the weirdest issue one time that if it was in the lower-right corner, it wouldn't respond
<MicahY> ok, restored to size it just was and it lets me edit now!
<jcater> move it anywhere else, and it would work
<jcater> was the d@mnest thing
<derek> its a fun wx'ism isnt it ;)
<MicahY> ooh, clicked on another field now it's broke again
<MicahY> yeah OK, this is reproducible!
<MicahY> doesn't work -> maximize -> it works -> restore -> it works -> click on another widget -> doesn't work
<MicahY> hmm maybe not.... but close
<derek> im telling you
<derek> make the scroll disappear and your problems will go away
<derek> i.e. move the property inspector all the way to the left upper corner
<derek> make it wide enough so no scroll bar on bottom
<MicahY> horizontal or vertical scroll?
<MicahY> no horizontal scroll now and it's not working
<derek> then make it long enough scroll bar goes bye bye 
<derek> and it will work
<MicahY> no vertical and it works
<derek> i find if you put it in the upper left corner generally the problem doesnt occur nearly as much
<derek> but once the problem starts the only way to rectify it w/o restarting is to make it long enough vert scroll goes bye bye
<MicahY> yeah it does appear to relate to scrollbars
<MicahY> but what if the object has too many properties?
<MicahY> then you're screwed!
<derek> um virtual desktops :)
<MicahY> derek: any guesstimate on how many man-hours it would take to build something like Kardia on GNUe?
<derek> thas how i solved it
<derek> um if you already had the sql schema
<derek> based on what i saw
<derek> less than one night
<MicahY> crap
<MicahY> yeah, I have Centrallix and Kardia installed here as a test.  I think the Sybase schema is in there.
<MicahY> I could certainly do it in Postgres quickly enough, I think
<derek> we work with sybase :)
<MicahY> oh, and what's the URL for DCL?  I couldn't find it....
<MicahY> yeah, but I don't want to... :)
<MicahY> sybase sucks
<derek> dcl.sf.net
<derek> MicahY: i wont argue that, just stating we work with it :)
<MicahY> thanks
<MicahY> actually they're planning to write a PG driver for Centrallix eventually
<MicahY> but I looked at the Sybase driver code and it's MONSTER.  They said it will be non trivial
<MicahY> you really think DCL will be a drop in program for a typical helpdesk?
<MicahY> I'm not entirely sure what they want
<MicahY> but I'll run it by them
<MicahY> hmmm.... this SQL has quite a bit of sybase-isms in it
<MicahY> looks like stored procs, etc
<derek> i think its a stronger projects/work order system than a help desk
<derek> but i think it does helpdesk ok
<derek> and you have the code :)
<derek> btw: i also think they probably will end up using the other features a lot
<MicahY> so how does it link with GNUe?  Or does it?  I heard the projects merged.
<derek> they merged
<derek> currently we are gutting the contact management for next realease
<derek> that will be the base for a gnue crm 
<derek> that fsf will be using
<derek> already in cvs for working version there are gnue screens
<derek> i am adding more as well
<MicahY> what's a crm?
<MicahY> so it will basically what I see there, but with a GNUe Forms interface?
<derek> Customer Relationship Managment
<derek> yip
<derek> i have some reporting stuff at work with it too
<derek> i.e. using gnue reports
<derek> to generate things from dcl data integrated into the dcl interface
<MicahY> cool
<MicahY> only problem is this is a sticky social situation.
<MicahY> I think GNUe looks clearly better than Centrallix for what they're doing
<MicahY> but Greg and some Taylor U students have put a LOT of work into Centrallix
<jcater> well, we've put many manyears into gnue too :)
<MicahY> and it IS impressive -- just a little clunky in its use of JavaScript and Sybase
<derek> its sick number of hours put in gnue actually
<jcater> hey!
<MicahY> I'm sure it is!
<jcater> I didn't call in sick to work for all the hours I put into GNUe
<jcater> just most of them
<derek> i didnt mean more is expected
<MicahY> any idea when the new DCL+GNUe will be ready?
<derek> someday
Action: derek has learned not to 'predict'
<derek> jcater: you have any opinions on packaging and such
<derek> like this crm kind of stuff
<jcater> err
<derek> have you thought about it at all?
<jcater> do I need to read the back logs?
<jcater> as I haven't really been following along today
<jcater> or product packaging in general?
<derek> um
<derek> how best to describe....
<derek> i have discussed in length with neilt from time to time
<derek> but there are a few issues
<derek> first issue bundling
<derek> as packages have overlap
<derek> dcl for example needs contact info
<derek> as would say invoicing (vendors) etc etc etc
<derek> as would salesforce automation
<derek> but each needs 'varying' degrees
<derek> at one time it was discussed we would have base packages
<derek> much like common is to the tools
<derek> that had things that were widely common
<derek> then other packages like inventory and invoicing
<derek> might have overlap
<derek> but you could run invoicing without inventory or vice versa
<derek> i.e. you could mix and match gnue packages with other third party stuff
<derek> but do to do that schemas and such would have be done properly to break apart and such
<derek> im thinking im going to hit this what is giong on now
<derek> as DCL uses contacts but isnt a contact manager
<derek> fsf needs contact manager and wants to use dcl
<derek> so i was going to build contact stuff for dcl
<derek> then add what i needed outside of dcl for fsf
<derek> but if chewie needs something
<derek> then maybe its time to do it more 'officially'
<derek> im just not sure the best approach i have lots of ideas
<derek> but i think most of them will require we have something like apt/dpkg only specifically for gnue
<derek> to manage dependencies and such
<jcater> python-based, of course :)
<jcater> um
<derek> um yes
<jcater> I've only minimally thought about it
<jcater> and my mind things in relational, 2-tier fashion
<jcater> s/things/thinks
<derek> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/oldstuff/GNUePackaging.png
<derek> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/oldstuff/GNUePackagingExample.png
<derek> were some really old diagrams
<derek> jcater: to me the concept of packaging is no different
<derek> you have
<derek> rules(2tier=triggers,ntier=methods(triggerengine)
<derek> reports(same)
<derek> forms(same)
<derek> schemas(2tier=sqlschema,ntier=object defs)
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/ExtendingGNUe.txt
<jcater> was my very first stab at it
<jcater> actually, my very first proposal
<jcater> before the days of reports, and designer, and common :)
<jcater> but that only addresses updating schemas
<jcater> not dependencies
<jcater> conversions
<jcater> upgrades
<derek> yummy
<derek> My proposal is to keep the database definitions separate from the creation 
<derek> logic.  Table definitions should be kept in a standard (XML) marked-up file 
<derek> and this file should be loaded into a database-specific "preprocessor(?)"
<derek> that interprets the standard definition file into database-specific 
<derek> create (or alter) statements.
<derek> we do this right now
<derek> so we are on right track
<jcater> yeah
<derek> adding the other items in your example wouldnt be tough
<jcater> note that I haven't touched this in 15 months
<derek> i think just seeing this sparked the revelation i was needing
<derek> my fear was defining items over and over and over
<jcater> so this predates the DCL schema XML thingy
<derek> but with xml it solves the problem
<derek> as the table and fields can be done
<derek> and then meta data placed aroudn them to say wen to use what
<derek> obvioulsy its vastly more complex than this
<derek> but its a start
Action: derek is thinking out loud which could be dangerous
<derek> but say you have
<jcater> what is really cool
<jcater> is we could do this with GObjects
<derek> a person table defined in xml
<jcater> and actually tie triggers to these XML objects
<derek> and a company table
<derek> etc etc
<jcater> so you could have a "pre-install" trigger
<jcater> and a "pre-dependency-check" trigger
<derek> then you would have a package xml file
<jcater> :)
<derek> and all it does is point to the master table xml file
<derek> then define what tables to use or fields
<derek> kind of thing
<derek> hmmm someday soon we will need to look at this :)
