mgedmin (~mg@bit.codeworks.lt) joined #gnuenterprise.
Action: dneighbo is away: bed
<dneighbo> hi mgedmin
<mgedmin> hi
<dneighbo> you work for m?
<mgedmin> yes
<dneighbo> you guys get things installed?
<mgedmin> what kinds of things?
<dneighbo> GNUe
<mgedmin> we built debs for gnue common, forms and designer 0.3
<dneighbo> cool
<dneighbo> i think 3 other people were working on them as well
Action: dneighbo didnt know that was something you all were looking at 
<dneighbo> if you post them and source others can help polish up
<mgedmin> i should probably put the changes we made somewhere
<mgedmin> one moment
<dneighbo> and we can give them to our debian maintainer so you can see them in sid(unstable)
<dneighbo> its late here 1:34 i was just getting ready to go to bed, but noticed the .lt domain
<dneighbo> did you have any questions before i run off?
<mgedmin> actually, yes
<mgedmin> I wonder if someone's working on problems with PostgreSQL numeric types
<dneighbo> what is the problem
<mgedmin> (SQL errors like "operator = not defined for numeric and double")
<mgedmin> (when trying to update a record containing a numeric field)
<dneighbo> do you have a sample form?
<mgedmin> I think I saw a message somewhere in the mailing list archives (can't remember exactly)
<dneighbo> and what postgres driver are you using
<mgedmin> psycopg
<mgedmin> actually the form you sent m as an example has this problem as well
Action: dneighbo always hates that half the time its our fault and half the time its bum db driver :)
<mgedmin> what postgres driver were you using?
<dneighbo> psycopg
<dneighbo> can you tell me what field in the form i sent you has the problem?
<mgedmin> if you try to update a field in the employee table, postgres complains
<mgedmin> Unable to identify an operator '=' for
<mgedmin> types 'numeric' and 'double precision'
<dneighbo> ok in the form i sent m?
<mgedmin> basically postgres wants explicit typecasts in statements like
<mgedmin> UPDATE employee SET foo=bar WHERE numericfield=123.4::numeric
<mgedmin> we also found that using
<mgedmin> UPDATE employee SET foo=bar WHERE numericfield='123.4'
<mgedmin> works too, but I'm not sure that's portable enough across databases
<dneighbo> you have lost me now
<mgedmin> okay
<dneighbo> please we must start at the problem, not what we think the answer is
<mgedmin> I run gnue-forms codeworks.gfd
<mgedmin> select a department that has employees
<mgedmin> change the title field
<mgedmin> click  "save all"
<mgedmin> and I get an error message at that point
<mgedmin> postgresql 7.2, psycopg 1.0.8
<dneighbo> ok give me like three minutes
<dneighbo> to update cvs and create the sample db and such 
<dneighbo> and i will get you an answer
<dneighbo> ok error is recreated here
<dneighbo> are you using cvs?
<dneighbo> or the official release?
Action: dneighbo thinks someone has introduced a bug in cvs OR the pyscopg driver in sid has been changed
<dneighbo> as when i ran this form before sending to m this problem didnt exist
Action: dneighbo is investigating
<dneighbo> btw: it appears the problem is AND department='1'
<dneighbo> i.e. department on the employee table should not have '' around its value
<mgedmin> hm
<mgedmin> currently I'm looking at the error message produced by 0.3.0
<mgedmin> but afair the same happened with cvs version on saturday
<mgedmin> the error message here reads
<mgedmin> ERROR: Unable to identify an operator '=' for types 'numeric' and 'double precision'\n  You will have to retype this query using an epxlicit cast
<mgedmin> Retrying the same SQL in psql results in the same error
<mgedmin> using
<dneighbo> correct same error i get
<dneighbo> but look at the query
<dneighbo> the last part will say
<dneighbo> AND department='somenumber'
<mgedmin> yes
<dneighbo> if you take that query and remove the '' around somenumber afer deptarment= i bet the query works
<dneighbo> in postgres
<mgedmin> don't think so
<mgedmin> quite the opposite
<dneighbo> it appeasrs someone has foobared the driver
<mgedmin> if we add '' around salary it starts working
<mgedmin> i'll doublecheck in a second
<mgedmin> yep, salary='400.4' works
<mgedmin> salary=400.4::numeric(9,3) works too
<mgedmin> plain salary=400.4 doesn't
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> something has changed here
<mgedmin> it's a PostgreSQL issue I think
Action: dneighbo cant get to work box from here but im 1000% positive this worked when i sent m the form
<dneighbo> and that was with our 0.3.0 release
<mgedmin> yes
Action: dneighbo has old postgres box here you have a minute
<dneighbo> i can try on it
<mgedmin> I've got all day
<mgedmin> it's morning here ;)
<dneighbo> its morning here too, EARLY morning :)

<mgedmin> I'm looking at a PostgreSQL book atm
<btami> hello
Action: derek is waiting for cvs to update on the laptop
<derek> hi btami
<btami> hi derek
<mgedmin> hello
<mgedmin> looks like PostgreSQL wants a typecast when it sees a numeric type in the WHERE part
<derek> grrrr
<derek> i get this on older box too
<derek> cvs
<derek> i swear this worked at the office
Action: derek goes to look at something
<mgedmin> it works fine when you try to add new records
<mgedmin> it fails when you try to update them
<mgedmin> or perform a query (no error messages, but no results either in that case)
<derek> maybe i didnt try to update one
<derek> i coudl swear i changed a salary though to test
<mgedmin> we found a workaround
<mgedmin> in DBSIG_DataObject._toSqlString
<mgedmin> replacing
<mgedmin>       elif type(value) == types.FloatType:
<mgedmin>         return str(value)
<mgedmin> with
<mgedmin>       elif type(value) == types.FloatType:
<mgedmin>         return "'%s'" % str(value)
<mgedmin> seems to help
<derek> thats where im looking now :)
<derek> BUT
<derek> how does that affect otehr db's
<mgedmin> I don't like that though
<derek> i.e. if it chokes other db's it needs to be in the postgres driver
<derek> and not DBSIG
<mgedmin> the Correct(TM) way according to PostgreSQL would be to return "'%s'::numeric(foo,bar)", where foo/bar depend on the schema
<mgedmin> oops
<mgedmin> s/'%s'::/%s::/
<mgedmin> although using just ::numeric seems to work fine too
<mgedmin> (for numeric fields -- didn't test with floats etc)
<mgedmin>  
<mgedmin> basically we do not need a solution right now, I just wanted to check if this problem was known
<derek> please submit this as a bug to common-support@gnuenterprise.org go ahead and attach your 'patch' (although its not good long term solution) and cc: info@gnue.org
<derek> i.e. this was not known problem
<mgedmin> okay
<derek> we should be able to produce a patch in the morning (your afternoon)
<mgedmin> I still don't feel comfortable with GNUe (ie don't know all the correct places to report problems etc)
<derek> i.e. official patch
<derek> worse case we put in the return "'%s'" until we can find a more elegant answer
<derek> btw: here is what broke it
<derek> http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/gnue/common/src/dbdrivers/_dbsig/DBdriver.py.diff?r1=1.48&r2=1.49&f=h
<derek>    elif type(value) == types.FloatType:           return str(value) was added 10 days ago
<derek> my box at work has cvs from more than 10 days probably not the 0.3.0 release so i bet it was working there
Action: derek really was starting to think i was nuts
<derek> it looks like jason was trying to fix an integer problem
<derek> i wonder if there is a types.IntType
<derek> or something
Action: derek wonders if you change salary to INT
<derek> if you have the same issue
<mgedmin> i want to experiment a bit with ints and floats before submitting a bug report
<derek> ok
<derek> ints work fine
<derek> change salary from numeric to int
<derek> in the .sql file
<derek> and rerun it and form works fine
<derek> so jcater hit an int and it blew up so he removed quotes
<derek> which fried the float
<derek> er numeric type
<derek> so need to find docs to see about types.XXXX
<mgedmin> there should be IntType and also LongType IIRC
<derek> to see if way we can isolate better to int instead of all number types
<mgedmin> BTW PostgreSQL accepts queries like "salary <> 100" but barfs on "salary <> 100.0"
<derek> yeah
<derek> i think it has to do with the .
Yurik (~yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> mgedmin: there are a few things happening here that i can see that are issues
<derek> best to address in the morning
<derek> example: when i turn the db field to int
<derek> the form appends a .0 to it
<derek> that causes issue
<derek> which i think is really the problem
<derek> i.e. jcater introduced a patch that says 'fixes integers'
<derek> i assume he had to do thsi because he was using forms type 'number' 
<derek> and it was appending the .0
<derek> which was hosing up integers
<derek> or somethign
<mgedmin> multiply that by # of different DBMSes, and different data types...
<mgedmin> yep this doesn't look like a trivial problem
<derek> i dont think its too bad really
<derek> i think its the UI entry widget that is causing the issue honestly
<mgedmin> the value has to be used in an SQL statement somewhere
<derek> mgedmin: let me explain what im seeing
<derek> in the form the entry is defined number
<derek> so regardless of if the db is int or float
<derek> its appending a .0 (if no decimal is defined)
<derek> the type(value)
<derek> isnt checking the DB field type
<derek> its checking the string contents
<mgedmin> OTOH the choice between 1.5, '1.5', 1.5::numeric depends on the DB/schema, not on UI
<derek> so that field will ALWAYS be float regardless of whether its int or not
<derek> we need to fix that
<derek> because if we fix that its a trivial problem
<derek> as you can if if type(value) == type.IntType or such do X
<derek> the way we have this implemented you simply put the most COMMON instance in dbsig
<derek> and anyone who isnt 'standard' you override in their driver
<derek> so i dont think the different db's doing different ways is that big a deal
<derek> its getting a way to define what the hell you actually are getting that has to be done :)
<derek> i hope that made sense
Action: derek really needs to go to bed its 03:00 and i have to be to work by 09:00
<derek> i will be back around then if you are still around send issue to email addresses i mentioned
<derek> and tell them to reference irc log as well
<derek> see you in the morning
Action: derek is away: sleep
<mgedmin> see you

<alga> morning
<alga> ;-)
<alga> I've a conceptual problem
<alga> we're trying to do XP 
<alga> that involves unit testing and functional testing of all the code written
<alga> the question is:  how do we test forms?
<alga> what to test in them?
meow-_ (~meow@212.199.198.11) joined #gnuenterprise.
<btami> hi alga
<btami> i think this is not a trivial task
<alga> yep
<btami> so try ask jcater/jamest later
<alga> OK
Nick change: meow-_ -> Luminion

<alga> we're ok with becoming gnue developers...
<alga> i've an impression, you have to be a gnue developer in order to do anything really useful with gnue
<btami> agree, but notice GNUe has only ver 0.3
<ra3vat> hello all
<mgedmin> hi
<mgedmin> if someone is interested in Debian packages of GNUe common/forms/designer 0.3.0, I've made diffs available at http://www.codeworks.lt/~mg/gnue/
<ra3vat> btami: but as I know tests in XP defined not upon developer's doc they should be defined on all steps of improving the code
<ra3vat> and the questions more how to use test packages (like pyunit?) with forms 
<btami> sorry, but i don't know to much about these 
<btami> just reading diveintopython yet
<esands> nickr and jbailey are the main guys working on the debs at the moment,  
<esands> they are doing some things to try and make the install mechanism more generic
<alga> ra3vat: pyunit is easily deployed, the problem is how to programmatically call/control the forms
<alga> we had an idea to write a special UI driver for that purpose, but later we dropped that
<alga> after all, we can always use the API the UI drivers use themselves
<mgedmin> actually, we with alga are still trying to decide what does it mean to 'test a form'
<mgedmin> ;)
<ra3vat> alga: ok, not tried it myself yet
<ra3vat> mgedmin: after testing some internals it should also simulate user interaction, is not it?
<ra3vat> mgedmin: do you also do a pair programming?
<mgedmin> yes
Action: mgedmin is away: lunchtime
Action: btami is away: lunch
<alga> pair programming is the fun part :-)
<ra3vat> alga: really? glad to hear that. Is it 100% mandatory thing for XP?

Gedanken (~schatten@typhon.eecs.ku.edu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> does XP mean XP (like windows or cross platform or extreme programming)?
<derek> re: other items, one should be able to do useful things with gnue w/o being a GNUe developer
<derek> BUT
<derek> i think they need to be a developer of some level to do something
<derek> i.e. they shouldnt have to be a GNUe tool developer, but they should have application development experience
<derek> re: testing
<derek> currently i have like 3 forms i use to 'test' things
<derek> as i find forms that 'break' things
<derek> i try to shovel them into my 'test' suite
<derek> i want to look at unit tester
<derek> that will test functions of GNUe w/o actually running forms
<derek> at some point we will need to build or find a free test suite to automate testing
<derek> at this point its burden of effort issue
<derek> i.e. not enough man hours
<ra3vat> extreme programming i think
<derek> as more people start to bring GNUe into production the more important test suite will come
<alga> true
<derek> has jcater come in yet?
<alga> derek, does it pay to test if the form can be loaded at all?
<alga> i mean, do forms often break on load?
<dneighbo> um yes an no
<dneighbo> as stated before a release i generally run about 5 or 10 different forms
<ra3vat> automate tests are what XP starts from 
<dneighbo> one is just simple no data form, with complex trigger
<jcater> dneighbo / dere: here
<dneighbo> jcater: can you read log
<dneighbo> re: db problem
<jcater> somewhat at least
<jcater> yeah, read it
<jcater> jamest just identified it
<jcater> it really p*sses me off that PostgreSQL 7.x can't handle implicit numeric conversions
<jcater> I mean, that's just down right backwards
<dneighbo> jcater: NO KIDDING
<Gedanken> erhm?
<jcater> something I'd expect from MySQL or something
<dneighbo> i about died when mgedmin
<Gedanken> What do you mean by implicit numeric conversions?
<alga> Gedanken: 1 > 2.0 breaks it
<alga> different types
Action: jcater *somewhat* understands int to double breaking it
<dneighbo> jcater: i started a patch, but i think the entry is causing issues as it makes the value FLOAT no matter what
<jcater> but one floating point to another floating point?
<Gedanken> alga: interesting, I have never experienced that
<jcater> dneighbo: yes, python "floats" are used for all our internal number storage
<dneighbo> other wise you could just use the type(value) == type.FloatType
<dneighbo> trick
<mgedmin> BTW I filed a bug report -- see ticket #54
<jcater> mgedmin: yeah, that was forwarded to me
<dneighbo> well let me rephrase that, postgres is the broken one here :)
<jcater> we originally had it always as strings
<jcater> i.e., "1.0"
<alga> Gedanken: no it doesn't
<Gedanken> no it doesn't what?
<alga> Gedanken: redev=> select 1 < 2.0;
<jcater> but that broke some databases
<alga> it works
<Gedanken> ah
<Gedanken> So what does break now?
<mgedmin> select 1::numeric < 2.0; breaks
<mgedmin> in realistic situations, "select foo from bar where baz = 1.0;" breaks when baz is of type numeric
<Gedanken> something about that bothers me and I think it is more of the SQL then anything
<Gedanken> At any rate, adding an operator shouldn't be too hard
<jcater> well, 
<jcater> adding an operator *may* not be too hard'
<jcater> it we have to do full-on introspection at form load time, that 
<jcater> could be a big performance hit
<Gedanken> I am talking about adding an operator to postgresql
<jcater> oh
Action: mgedmin too would like to hear something from postgresql side -- what is the purpose of this 'feature'
<Gedanken> the postgresql guys are pretty responsive, but Tom can be a dick some times
Action: dneighbo hopes this is a postgres bug, but doubts it
<dneighbo> as i have postgres 6.5.x here and it does same thing
<jcater> frankly, my opinion of PostgreSQL just took a dive southwards
<jcater> as any "reason" they can provide is a technical one that *should* be hidden from SQL users
Action: jcater is sure there is a "reason" behind it
<dneighbo> to me it makes NO sense either
<mgedmin> BTW, AFAICU forms currently perform the updates by constructing an SQL statement and listing *all* fields in WHERE clause.  Is there a way to use only the primary key instead?
<jcater> yeah, that's something we need to look at
<jcater> if updating a queried record (and not inserting a new record and then updating it in same session), then the 
<jcater> database's "row id" is used
<jcater> IF the database supports such a thing
<jcater> (I know Oracle's does)
aditya_gilra (~aditya@61.0.108.254) joined #gnuenterprise.
<dneighbo> now what database wouldnt havve an oid?
<dneighbo> or uid?
<jcater> well
<dneighbo> ;)
<jcater> PostgreSQL 7.2
<dneighbo> ?
<dneighbo> it used to have oid?
<jcater> from 7.2 and beyond, oid's are optional
<dneighbo> you saying they removed that
<jcater> they made it optional
<dneighbo> sigh
<jcater> there's no guarantee any more
<dneighbo> guess people do stupid things to 'compete'
<Gedanken> nah, it is perfectly resonable
<jcater> there's a slight performance improvement, iirc
<Gedanken> not all tables need OIDS ..
<jcater> BUT
<jcater> err, nevermind
<jcater> I won't go there
<Gedanken> OID wrap around anyone?
<jcater> ?
<dneighbo> i guess i cant think of a good reason to not have an OID
<Gedanken> the issue was that OIDs could wrap around and thus not be unique
<dneighbo> true every table might not need one
<dneighbo> BUT
<Gedanken> which kinda invalidates that whole OID thing
<dneighbo> thast like saying i might not ever need a spare tire so why bog my car down with the extra weight
<Gedanken> of course this was for databases of a really really large size, but ... it exists
<derek> so we have a fix in the works for htis
<derek> if so what ? (me is curious) to the approach
<Gedanken> I could see why a implicit conversion between type numeric and type float doesn't exist
<Gedanken> er ... non-implicit
<aditya_gilra> God Remembrance
<aditya_gilra> Soory to interrrupt
<derek> well way i look at it, it doesnt matter much
<Gedanken> the numeric type is quite a bit different then float ... too much just to allow transient coversions
<derek> postgres is a db people will be using, we need to support their quirks whether we agree or disagree with them
<aditya_gilra> from India
<aditya_gilra> we're developing a production system
<aditya_gilra> few queries
<aditya_gilra> can i ask?
<jcater> Gedanken: my only issue with that is other major databases do it implicitly
<jcater> aditya_gilra: sure
<jcater> Gedanken: BECAUSE it's a technical detail that the average user of SQL shouldn't be concerned with
<jcater> but it's a moot argument
<Gedanken> jcater: I can understand that, but I would to see their definition of the SQL types
<jcater> because the PostgreSQL has already decided to implement it that way :(
<jcater> so we must support it :(
<aditya_gilra> we're trying to change the list of values in a dropdown entry from a trigger
<Gedanken> jcater: well yes at this point in time you have two options: 1) work around it using implicit casts or 2) write the operators and submit it for inclusion to the postgresql team
<aditya_gilra> we're able to update a datasource from a trigger 
<aditya_gilra> the block attached to that datasource updates itself
<aditya_gilra> BUT, a dropdown entry attached to a datasource does not update itself if
<aditya_gilra> we change the datasource via trigger eg. form.dtsAUTHOR_COMBO.createResultSet({"author_en":"Swamiji"})
<derek> aditya_gilra: correct, this is known issue
Action: derek needs to file a bug for it (i might have already)
<derek> oh wait you might be having different issue than what im thining
<derek> thinking
<derek> jcater: what if we made forms more descriptive?
<derek> i.e. what if instead of 'numeric' for type cast we had
<derek> 'float' (or double or whatever you want to label it)
<derek> and
<derek> 'integer'
<derek> instead of just numeric?
<jcater> derek: I was trying ****really**** hard to avoid that
<jcater> as it goes into support issues I didn't want to deal with
<aditya_gilra> here's a small sample of the form I'm having problems with
<derek> jcater: im not saying i like it
<derek> but only way im seeing it other than is db introspection
<aditya_gilra>     <block datasource="dtsbook" name="blkBOOK">
<aditya_gilra>       <entry field="new_code" name="inpNewCode" width="10" x="20" y="1"/>
<aditya_gilra>       <entry field="old_code" name="inpOldCode" width="10" x="20" y="2">
<aditya_gilra>         <trigger type="Pre-FocusOut">

<derek> we dont have i18n working in forms yet do we?
<derek> Arturas ?
<derek> not in the .gfd part only in the tool right?
<aditya_gilra> Please note the trigger in entry inpOldCode
<aditya_gilra> It updates the form.dtsAUTHOR_COMBO datasource using a conditional
dneighbo (~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<aditya_gilra> Now note the dropdown entry inpAuthorTupleId which uses the datasource we updated in the trigger namely dtsAUTHOR_COMBO
<aditya_gilra> However, the list in the dropdown entry doesn't get updated.
<derek> you didnt call any method to do so
<aditya_gilra> But if we have a block using the same datasource, it gets updated automatically
<derek> well thats because the block code is calling the event to refresh
Action: derek hasnt looked at this in a while, but i think you could instead do things via the block methods
<derek> instead of datasource methods
<aditya_gilra> Looking at the code, it seems to be registering itself with GFDataSource
<derek> and then the refreshing etc is called automagically
<derek> or if you call datasource directly then you have to call block refresh methods
<aditya_gilra> Block registers with GFDataSource but dropdown entry doesn't register
Action: derek still isnt a fan of block
<Arturas> derek: sorry for delay; no modifications on the way forms work with data
<Arturas> in i18n field
<derek> but as we are starting to move forward with some other things i think i might see some value 
<aditya_gilra> Basically we wan't a way to refresh the list in a dropdown
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-110.wasp.net.au) left irc: Connection timed out
<derek> you say we....
<derek> is there a mouse in your pocket ;) (sorry my mothers old expression)
<aditya_gilra> Can you tell us how to do it?
<derek> aditya_gilra: well currently part of the issue is this isnt supported even if you do NOT use triggers
<derek> i.e. the dropdowns get loaded at start time only
<derek> it is a problem for others as well, we have started to discuss best way to handle
<derek> as we dont want them updating all the time as that could be a large penalty hit
<derek> er s/penalty/performance penalty
<aditya_gilra> We're  able to update the recordset of a datasource and the block connected to it
<aditya_gilra> automatically updates because it's registered as a listener with GFDataSource
<aditya_gilra> But dropdown does not register as a listener with GFDataSource even though it is attached to
<derek> aditya_gilra: im talking contents of dropdown
<aditya_gilra> a datasource.
<derek> correct
<derek> this is known 'bug' / 'feature request'
<aditya_gilra> Maybe you caould tell us how to hack it to do the same?
<derek> it was designed to act this way and now we know it needs to be different
<aditya_gilra> could
<derek> just the executive decision hasnt been made on how to make the change
<derek> i.e. we dont want to change it so it ALWAYS updates
<derek> as for most forms dropdowns are static 
<derek> i.e. other things on the forms arent updating them
<derek> so to have them requery all the time would be bad performance
<aditya_gilra> two of us here - hence 'we'
<derek> my suggestion was at the entry level (or datasource level) to add an attribute called refresh
<derek> and if refresh is true then you refresh otherwise you dont
<derek> others had idea of menu option to do it

<derek> i dont remember if a way was decided
<derek> jamest was tackling the issue and he isnt in yet this morning
<derek> jcater: have you any opinino on the matter
Action: derek must run to work
<aditya_gilra> there doesn't seem to be anyway to do it in the present code
<derek> er drive to work
<Arturas> hm, another short question - in docs is written that <block> can have master, detail attributes; however, as i try to run form with such blocks and attributes, i get error:
<Arturas>  gnue.common.GParser.MarkupError: Error processing <block> tag [I do not recognize the "detail" attribute
<derek> aditya_gilra: i believe you are correct
<derek> Arturas: i think that stuff got moved to datasource
<Arturas> old docs?
<derek> yes i think so
<Arturas> thank you
yogurt2unge (~charlie@modem117-adsl.capfed2.sinectis.com.ar) joined #gnuenterprise.
Action: derek hasnt tried to put detail/master in the block for some time so i cant say for certain
<derek> but that would be my gut reaction
<aditya_gilra> About i18n - we've made a few minor changes and forms works for Hindi in the data fields
Action: derek is away: work
<aditya_gilra> We've (two of us here, no mouse) also made a pygtk2 forms client
<aditya_gilra> gtk2 has good i18n support
<aditya_gilra> once the pygtk2 client is a bit more stable, we'll send it in
<aditya_gilra> A second query
<aditya_gilra> how to specify conditions either in the  datasource tag OR
<aditya_gilra> in a trigger
<aditya_gilra> I looked at a file called GFConditions.py but it seems a bit complicated
<aditya_gilra> Any documentation on conditions

<dneighbo> hmmm im only finding stockades
<dneighbo> to hard to code like that 
Action: dneighbo keeps digging
<siesel> Chipaca: you've tried phpforms
<siesel> ?
<dneighbo> hmm seems i have a few 5 day old loafs of Chipaca
<dneighbo> jamest if you try to escape im pelting you with them
<Chipaca> siesel: I tried to try phpforms
<Chipaca> siesel: actually, I started to try to try to try phpforms
<jamest> :)
<dneighbo> siesel since jamest is here.....
<dneighbo> you have an account on ash?
<siesel> yes.
<dneighbo> if so can you setup an instance of php forms there?
<StyXman> jamest: hi
<dneighbo> i would like to set up a sample
<dneighbo> of a few forms and from our webpage allow people to bang on it
<siesel> there is one already, just abit old version.
<StyXman> jamest: I'm planning the grid thing.
<StyXman> jamest: I want you advice
<siesel> i will updated it :)
<dneighbo> cool then if you can email derek@gnue.org on how to use it or where a sample is etc that i can build from that woudl be great
<StyXman> jamest: you still breathin', man?
<jamest> barely
<dneighbo> StyXman you trying to say i have his collar too tight?
<jamest> i just logged in so people would know I'm alive
<dneighbo> jamest were you briefed on teh postgres issue?
<dneighbo> and if so you have any response to handle?
<StyXman> jamest: ah, ok. then I'll try some hacks and then report anything I made work here, someday.
<jamest> postgres issue?
<jamest> no
<jamest> and I don't think i'm behind on mail
<jamest> (for once)
<jcater> jamest: basically,   ERROR:  Unable to identify an operator '=' for types 'double precision' and 'numeric'
<jcater> typecasting issues :(
<jamest> :(((
<jcater> see, I thought "psql" mean "Postgres + SQL"
<jcater> now I'm seeing that it means "Piece of Sh*t Query Language"
<jcater> as what other SQL implementation would require you to explicitly identify two numeric types to compare them
<Chipaca> jcater: psql doesn't, afaik
<jcater> Chipaca?
<jcater> that's the issue
<Chipaca> jcater: unless you're doing something way below sql
<jcater> no, dude
<Chipaca> jcater: let me check
<jcater> we are doing "select ... where mynumericfield = 1.0"
<jcater> it treats 1.0 as a double precision
<jcater> and mynumericfield as numeric
<jcater> and gives you that error
<Chipaca> drat!
Action: Chipaca hates it when he's wrong
<jcater> Chipaca: you don't know how much I WISH you were right
<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> believe me at about 7am my time you had about 6 people wishing you were right
<Chipaca> jcater: but it works with 'select * from thing where n>1'
<dneighbo> yeah thats what is so darn evil
<StyXman> jcater: can I ask you a question related to scrollbar?
<jcater> um
Action: jcater doesn't know too terribly much about scrollbar
<jcater> don't use them
Action: Chipaca looks at 'select * from test where cast(a as real) > 1.0;' and shudders
<jcater> gah!
<StyXman> jcater: no, scrolbars are empty, AFAIK. I want to know what you want from it.
<jcater> I'm not sure
<StyXman> I mean, what you intendit to do. I want to do a simple grid. but a much better grid.
Action: Chipaca looks at 'select * from test where a > cast(1.0 as numeric);' and shudders some more
<jcater> I haven't thought about them in a while
<jcater> they'd have to be bound to a block somehow
<StyXman> I'm looking wx's scrollbars for some info, but I don't know what should I do with it
<StyXman> jcater: yes, I'm thinking in a kind of block, that could have any amount and kind of entry's
<StyXman> you then say whow much rows want to sse at once, and the block should pass that info to its childre, i.e., the entry's
<StyXman> brb. nature calls
<dneighbo> that was jamest original intent iirc
<dneighbo> was to allow scrollbar to bind to block
<dneighbo> so when you did entry row="10"
<dneighbo> and did a scroll bar of 10
<dneighbo> it would act pretty much how a normal scroll bar does
<siesel> Chipaca: you can try out the database demo of phpforms at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jan/phpforms/gnue-forms.php?c=demo2 if you want. But the database less mode still has some issues. I will look over it again.
<StyXman> I'm back. jcater, you thought of something?
<jcater> StyXman: you see dneighbo's comments?
<dneighbo> siesel its ok, real mean dont do databaseless forms
<StyXman> I want them functional today, and I intend to hack what's needed.
<dneighbo> s/mean/men
<jcater> other than that, I don't know what else you need
<jamest> scrollbars where meant to tie to block as dneighbo said
Action: dneighbo pinches self?
<jamest> and simply do the next/prev records to make the blocks look nice
<jamest> er
<jamest> sorry
<dneighbo> did jamest and jcater both agree with me ?
<jamest> dneighbo doesn't know what he's talking about
<jamest> it's all tha AZ crack, just ignore him
<StyXman> well, I think then bound to blocks that will have entry's inside (as children).
<jamest> feel better now dneighbo?
<dneighbo> much
<StyXman> the block is who says how much rows will be shown.
<jcater> StyXman: yes
<StyXman> ok, now. where to start? I'm rather lost here. gimme just a hint, and I'll explore it.
<StyXman> again
<jamest> hmmmm
<StyXman> I'm looking wx's scrollbars for some info, but I don't know what should I do with it
<jamest> they are completely empty
<StyXman> yes
<jamest> nothing there to see really
<jcater> unfortunately, I really don't have time to think about scrollbars today 
<jcater> :(
<StyXman> not in uidrivers or GF.
<StyXman> ack. then I'll try something from wx's info.
<jamest> my quick and dirty scrollbars were going to do
<jamest>   look at the block/datasource to get record count and based upon the rows (visible) set the size of the scroller
<jamest>   then set the up/down of the scroolbar to only really do a next/prev record event
<StyXman> jamest: yes, but GF is still too empty. should I start adding 'standar' behaviour?
<jamest>   after each next/prev event have the scrollbar look at the top visible record and adjust the scroller position to be about right 
<StyXman> ok, keep saying ideas. I'll start to see.
<jamest> sure
<jamest> as there is no std behaviour yet :)
<jamest> so it's a clean slate to work with
<StyXman> ok, I'll hack a little and comment about progress.
<jamest> just make sure dneighbo doesn't like it and you'll be good to go
<jamest> whoops, i shouldn't have publicly admitted to jcater and my design philosophies
<dneighbo> StyXman i will make it easy for you
<dneighbo> i really hate the idea of a scrollbar
<dneighbo> i dont think we should have one
<dneighbo> even if it has minimal functionality its bad bad bad
<jcater> boing!
<dneighbo> no you cant go wrong
<StyXman> dneighbo: I think users are very uesd to them.
<dneighbo> er now
<dneighbo> StyXman im teasing
<StyXman> used
Action: StyXman is translating....
<dneighbo> as the joke is if i agree to it, it must be a bad idea so dont do it
<dneighbo> so im using reverse psychology :)
<jcater> gives new meaning to: RPN
<jcater> reverse psychology notation
<StyXman> but how much reverse it hould be? how much time should I reverse? I'm confused...
Action: StyXman grins
<dneighbo> i think where they come from its called
<dneighbo> muy loco gringo
<dneighbo> or somethign
<StyXman> tai chalao
<StyXman> (you're chalado, like you smoked something but not tobacco)
Action: StyXman grins again
<dneighbo> hmmm stoned/
<dneighbo> chalado == stoned
Action: dneighbo coudl like this
<dneighbo> no longer are we stuck with 'i must be on crack' to express oneself
<dneighbo> instead you could say
<dneighbo> man im muy chalado today
<StyXman> stoned, yes, but not the same semantic.
<StyXman> tai pirado.
<StyXman> tai del tomate
<StyXman> and so on...
<dneighbo> btw: did i tell you guys i started lobbying more poor local goverment?
<Chipaca> StyXman: go hack
Action: Chipaca grins evily
<dneighbo> and got very interesting response
<StyXman> warinig: that's basic cordobanian.
<dneighbo> they gave me some break downs on the 'discount rates'
<dneighbo> but this is classic
<dneighbo> they must decide by july 31st or m$ penalizes them
<dneighbo> BUT
<dneighbo> m$ still to this day hasnt told them what an agreement for the OS will cost
<dneighbo> only office
<dneighbo> Under the State Bid program the costs for the service contracts are as follows;  both require a minimum of a two (2) year
<dneighbo> contract, with an annual payment.  Under Microsofts definition only the newest version of a release is considerred current.  In
<dneighbo> the future (After July 31st) if an enterprise is not under a software maintenance plan there is no upgrade price and all
<dneighbo> software will be purchased as a full system. The below cost are on a per machine basis. 
<dneighbo> Microsoft Office
<dneighbo>  *  Upgrade Advantage -  for non current systems      $ 231.00        for two years (This goes away, after July 31st) 
<dneighbo>  *  Software Assurance - for current systems            $  85.29         per year with a two year minimum contract
<dneighbo> Operating Systems
<dneighbo>  *  This is the price were waiting for as it is still moving,  it looks like about 1/2 of the above cost for the office product
<dneighbo>     or hopefully a little less, this only needs to be done on machines we plan on keeping in service and that need OS upgrades
<dneighbo>     allot of notebooks etc. will not need to be upgraded.
<dneighbo>  *  The main concern here will be the OS for Servers
<dneighbo> now how messed is that
<dneighbo> UPGRADE or DIE 
<dneighbo> ok whats it cost?
<dneighbo> i dont know.
<dneighbo> typical m$
<jamest> i was talking to wife about this some this weekend
<jamest> i'd love to see free software people do volunteer work to setup things like
<jamest> ltsp w/ openoffice and a killer main system
<dneighbo> we are doing that at schools here now
<jamest> at schools/govs etc
<dneighbo> with our LUG or trying
<dneighbo> i actually know the mayor on name basis 
<dneighbo> so i might approach him
<jamest> as i know here small dept can't afford to do free
<jamest> as they have noone to support it :)
<dneighbo> jamest: KSU doing Enterprise AGreement?
<dneighbo> if so do you have 'numbers'
<dneighbo> i.e. can you tell me what they are telling you an office
<StyXman> GF things are pretty plain. all the logic are in uidriver's?
<dneighbo> 'upgrade advantage' and 'software assurance' will cost
<dneighbo> as if its radically different i would be interested
<dneighbo> as supposedly one of teh selling points of this crap was m$ wasnt doing 'volume' discounts anymore
<jamest> n oidea
<StyXman> jamest: that answer goes for me?
<jamest> no idea to derek
<jamest> the UI drivers should be brain dead w/ all the logic in the GF*
<Gedanken> We have something interesting going on at KU ... the department pays a set amount and we have access to all Microsoft productivity products with unlimited license for use for academia ... not infrastructure

<jamest> but it was 400+ for non students :)
<jamest> yeah
<jamest> I'm slowly getting my users to OpenOffice
<jamest> our accountant was OpenOffice exclusively

<Gedanken> well, the international versions of the office documents do have some unique properties
<Gedanken> I ran into trouble with the Excel format ... was using a perl module to parse excel files ... the guy who wrote it lives in Japan and it found something in the U.S. versions that it didn't like

<jcater> if you had to choose between RedHat SuSe for a production server, which would you do?
<jamest> no that dress doesn't make you look fat
<jamest> (and turn off the webcam...please)
<jcater> jamest: but, but, but
<jcater> that's not what you said when I was trying the thongs out
<jamest> argh!
<jamest> :)
<jcater> if you had to choose between RedHat or SuSe for a production server, which would you do?
<jamest> My only experience with SuSe was in SF
<jamest> before I got debian to play nice on those IBms
<jamest> IIRC that was SuSe
<jamest> but I can tell you why I quit using RH
<jcater> well, 
Action: jcater quit using RedHat too :(
<jamest>   crappy QA - RH6.something shipped with par printer support broken
<jamest>   the RPM system
<jamest> don't recall what suse used
<jamest> IIRC it had some purdy graphical thingy to config/install/maintain system
<siesel> suse use RPM too
<siesel> :(
Action: jcater will probably go SuSE
<jamest> ew
<jamest> you poor bastard
<jcater> SIGH
<jcater> I'm torn
<jcater> as I hated RedHat
<jamest> but you know it :)
<jcater> BUT
<jcater> 1. I know it
<jcater> 2. It'll be on a Dell PowerEdge 6400 (4 proc smp)
<jcater> 3. Dell ships out RedHat on these things
Action: jamest is too jeallous to talk about this anyjmore
<jcater>   so you'd think RedHat is more likely to support the obscure RAID/etc controllers on the machine
<jcater> BUT
<jcater> Oracle develops on SuSE
<jcater> and SuSE is their preferred Linux 
<jamest> rofl
<jamest> just like solaris x86 eh?
Action: jamest runs
<jcater> don't go there, dude
<Gedanken> jcater: I predict Oracle will change to RedHat soon ... you did see the announcement between them, RH, and IBM right?
<jcater> Gedanken: I did not see that
Action: jcater tries to avoid Oracle news
<jcater> :)

<Gedanken> probably safe that way
<jcater> if I could find Oracle 7 binaries for Linux
<jcater> I'd downgrade to that

<jcater> we still haven't fully recovered

<dtm> jcater: why'd you "upgrade" then :)
<jamest> I'm sure oracle end of lifed his arse
<jcater> well
<jcater> basically, yes
<jcater> :(
<jcater> plus we had 7.x under SCO
<jcater> which also went the way of the dinosaur
<jcater> and we had to upgrade our capacity

<dneighbo> ok can i have an opinion
<dneighbo> PLEASE dont go SuSE
<dneighbo> they are entering into the United Linux thing
<dneighbo> and honestly it just looks shady
<dneighbo> i cant say they ahve done anything wrong yet
<dneighbo> but i would hate to see a good free software user like yourself support htem (monetarily now)
<dneighbo> and then really regret it later
<dneighbo> remember already SuSE doesnt offer binaries/ISO's and such to people
<dneighbo> i cant say i like redhat
<dneighbo> but i think it will be no better nor no worse than suse

<chillywilly> grrrr
<chillywilly> why do banks have such hacks for software?
<jcater> because all the really good programmers do free software
<chillywilly> hell it should import all my past history since I ever had an account
<jcater> <cough>
<chillywilly> whatever
<nickr> because banks don't consider online banking really important to their core business

<siesel> jcater, btw. who had the idea for adding gConfig to the global namespace, you, or jamest?

<chillywilly> siesel: you sgml has butt loads of errors
<chillywilly> s/you/your

<dneighbo> um its chillywilly 's fault
<dneighbo> that bozo did it
<dneighbo> btw: jcater i loved the 'all the good developers write free software line' it was a beauty
<chillywilly> dneighbo: nah, I think it is da masta's curse
<chillywilly> he looked at it funny
<chillywilly> it doesn't like thise title tags in your itemized list siesel
<siesel> why. Its absolute standart conformant. 
<chillywilly> I don't think it's allowed there
<chillywilly> otherwise it wouldn't complain

<^chewie> Well, I've been trying to figure out where the heck to start with GNUe ;-)
<^chewie> there's a real strength in the simple one-to-one relationship between forms and database
<jcater> siesel: gConfig is being reworked at the moment
<jcater> so don't do too much to it
<chillywilly> why not just make them sub sections?
<chillywilly> 1.5 Design Considerations
<chillywilly> 1.5.1 Reusability
<chillywilly> ....
<chillywilly> like that
<^chewie> but I can't seem to wrap my mind around the "master:detail" record idea and how it's supposed to be articulated in the .gfd
Action: siesel hides his head in shame (listitem have no title :( )
<^chewie> is there any definititive docs on how gfd's are laid out, their syntax, etc?
<chillywilly> or
<siesel> cw: would be ok.
<chillywilly> ok
<^chewie> I have this wonderfully normalized database, but can't seem to step through this little wizard to create a working form
<^chewie> so, I'm trying to find a point of entry to understand what's going on, any tips
<chillywilly> mater-detail is just like any 1 to 1 database relation, IIRC
<chillywilly> but I don't jnow how to make forms to cooperate with it ;)
<chillywilly> you'll have to ask jcater or dneighbo
<^chewie> hmm
<chillywilly> siesel: are you going yo change it or should I?
<chillywilly> btw, thanks for all the docs :)
<siesel> jcater: strike, I've outwitted GConf !!!! 
<siesel> cw: change what? the actual cvs version is error free ;)
<chillywilly> er?
<chillywilly> change those to be subsections

<siesel> I've commited a foobulations.gpd some minutes ago, technical correct, but with a very poor grammar. Could be a start ... 
<siesel> cw: yes. access to child elements per _children to the parent element per _parent
<siesel> one object per xml elements, sub element -> children, attributs -> attributs, i.e. <tag name="itsme"> -> class tag, def name=itsme
<dneighbo> siesel im thinking of a single .gpd per sample dir
<dneighbo> then a .gpd at the root
<dneighbo> actually you know what i want to discuss this better
<dneighbo> for debs we have to pull samples away from the rest
<dneighbo> im thinking we need to do something similar to wx
<dneighbo> and have samples be separate tarball etc
<dneighbo> sep deb/rpm yada yada yada
<siesel> do you think we should seperate them in the cvs too?
<siesel>  s/the//
<dneighbo> probably
<dneighbo> i would love to see our docs
<dneighbo> and our www
<dneighbo> be separate cvs modules altogether
<dneighbo> but thats another discussion :)
<dneighbo> basically eventually i would like to see each tool be separate module as well
<dneighbo> as i forsee at some point
<dneighbo> giving person A access to say gnue-common cvs but perhaps not gnue-reports cvs
<dneighbo> especially if we go to something like what the linux kernel does
<dneighbo> where things go through a single maintain
