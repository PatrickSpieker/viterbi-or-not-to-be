<lupo_> hi
<siesel> hi lupo_
<lupo_> hey siesel :)
<lupo_> what are you doing at the moment regarding gnue?
<siesel> I design some formulars and need the trigger system, and unicode support.
<lupo_> good
<lupo_> i don't know whether reinhard told you already
<siesel> what?
<lupo_> i have organized money to host a european gnue developers meeting
<siesel> cool.
<lupo_> so, i have already found a good place, about 300km from you, 300km from reinhard, and 100km from me which is about the shortest way for each of us. i don't know whether our baltic developers can join.
<siesel> The baltic developers, thats Arturas, ...?
<lupo_> yep
<lupo_> what country were they from? lithuania?
<siesel> yes.
<lupo_> the only problem is that a lufthansa economy class flight (vilnius-ffm) costs about 5000Eur :(

<Arturas> Hello
<siesel> Hi Arturas
<SachaS> hi siesel. thanks for your guiding through the intallation last night
<SachaS> siesel: it works fine and designer is working.
<siesel> your welcome.
<SachaS> siesel: had a look at couple samples. samples are fine. did not try the database in the background yet.
<siesel> you will use mysql ?
<SachaS> siesel: i guess so. i dont have a concrete project so try the easiest one
<siesel> I would recommend to use postgresql instead, its not much more complicated than mysql, and many samples work better using postgresql

reinhard (~rm@M690P020.adsl.highway.telekom.at) joined #gnuenterprise.
<SachaS> how come? should be transparent, shouldn't it?
<siesel> the forms access is transparent, but most samples have database creation scripts which are written for postgresql
<SachaS> ok. fair enough
<siesel> there are just a few ones, which are using the new GSD format.
<SachaS> the property inspector seems to not let me change values, easaly, sometimes. did you notice?
<siesel> yes, thats an wx python bug. You have to make the property window so large, that the scrollbar disapears. Then you can change values again.
<SachaS> argh. at least you know the bug.
<SachaS> cool yes is working.
<SachaS> oops. segmentation fault
<SachaS> gnue-designer --debug-level 5 might help next time
<siesel> are you using the cvs version?
<SachaS> yes cvs version
<siesel> designer is under heavy development in cvs, so it will segfault sometimes :(
<SachaS> actually i updated my local files with cvs update. there are some g???cvs files i do not understand what they are for.
<SachaS> thats ok then.
<siesel> that are the scripts to start gnue programs directly from cvs source tree.
<siesel> gfcvs is for gnue-forms, gfdes for gnue-designer ...
<SachaS> from the local cvs source tree?
<siesel> yes. So you just ddon't have to install every package after every cvs update
<SachaS> dont understand but will try.
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<SachaS> siesel. what should i do if i find a problem. i know i should fix it :)

<SachaS> thank you
<lupo_> aha :)
<lupo_> anyone seen david sugar in the recent days ?
<SachaS> lupo_ where shall i send a report concerning designer?
<lupo_> email it to designer-support at gnuenterprise.org, with version and OS information
JohannesV (~jve@M689P012.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<lupo_> a good idea is to send a patch :)
<SachaS> lupo_ i know. first time i try desginer :)
<lupo_> i wouldn't worry. the code is quite understandable, even if you are not a python crack and wxPython guru, you will grasp the code quite fast

<derek> um if you sent to gnue-devel@gnu.org thats not a valid address
<derek> i think its gnue-dev
<derek> http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnue-dev
<lupo_> ah yes - of course :)
<perlhead> derek: thanks, I sent it to the wrong address indeed.
<perlhead> Only different: I did send it to gnue-dev, but for some reason I put @gnue.org instead of gnu.org
<perlhead> There it goes again...
<derek> perlhead: i will attempt to get all patches applied tonight
<derek> please (i know you guys have done several times) send all patches to me at derek@gnue.org today
<derek> so i know i dont miss anything
lupo_ (~lupo@p3EE1D2AB.dip.t-dialin.net) left irc: "using sirc version 2.211+KSIRC/1.1"
<perlhead> derek: thank you for the offer.
<perlhead> However, my mail has broader implications than just applying the patches.
<perlhead> My guys have been preparing patches repeatedly, only to find that they become outdated before they get applied.
<derek> i will respond to the email, but in fairness doing your own cvs tree really hurts
<perlhead> And even if they manage to create valid recent patches for our current needs, and you manage to apply them tonight, we still have the problem of what will happen with our future patches.
<derek> you cant make changes to a ton of files
<derek> and then submit giant patches and expect quick turn times
<derek> a patch should only include code specific to the thing its fixing
<derek> and so many of the patches you sent of course were way out of date to the cvs tree as you were using a different cvs tree
<derek> a major server issue hasnt helped things
<derek> but in future small bite sized patches will get applied more quickly
<derek> this is no different than say the linux kernel
<perlhead> derek: I know the separate tree hurts. We don't like it, and I hope I made it clear in the mail. It hurts *us*.
<perlhead> The problem is that our patches didn't start being this huge.
<perlhead> They began life as simple things (save for some major functionality improvements)
<perlhead> But as time went by without them being incorporated, they accreted.
<perlhead> Most of them could have been incorporated as small fixes, only time conspired against it.
<derek> i thihk we can work this out
<derek> i hope that jcater responds
<perlhead> Let me stress this: *we want to kill our branch* *we don't like it* *we did it because we had no other choice*
<perlhead> As to the comparison with the linux kernel, you are right, it's not that different.
<perlhead> But as far as I know, major contributors to the kernel have commit privileges to their areas of activity.
<perlhead> Trust me, Vía Libre will continue to contribute to GNUe in a major way.
<derek> that is our problem
<derek> we dont have yet 'areas of activity'
<perlhead> We want GNUe to succeed as a coherent project. The success of our own project depends from it.
<derek> we have one giant cvs tree that has no discrimination
<derek> that is high on our list to break cvs into smaller modules
<derek> so we can give commit access by module and such
<perlhead> If we wait for that, hell will freeze over. You guys are overworked as it is. You don't have the *time* to the segmentation.
<perlhead> There are more important things in the queue.
<derek> then we have to continue with patches i think
<derek> we have been burned on more than one occassion doing differently
<derek> even in patches via libre has done, things were discussed in irc and everyone seemed in agreement
<derek> yet it was coded in way that was not agreed
<derek> jcater can give specifics
<derek> now certainly it was just a communication breakdown (so not criticizing coding or coding techniques)
<derek> but the idea behind patches is that stuff like that gets caught pre checkin not post checkin
paq (~paq@202.155.120.221) joined #gnuenterprise.
<perlhead> Sorry, I can't comment on that as I don't have the specifics, but I doubt the patches were coded in a way that was agreed to be *not* the right way.
<perlhead> I'm absolutely sure the intent is to do things the right way.
<derek> correct

<StyXman> suppise I have no record that math my query
<jamest> ok
<StyXman> suppise I click in the 3rd lookup
<StyXman> suppose I have a keyb with the correct labells
<StyXman> suppose I have a keyb that works
<StyXman> suppose I start writing in this 3rd entry.
<StyXman> the focus is 'there', even the 'cursor' (that '|' thingy)
<StyXman> but as you write the leters appear in the 1st (!!!) enry
<StyXman> (entry)
<jamest> ouch
<StyXman> yeap. ouch. cpouldn't find where to fic that. I'm totally *lost*
ra3vat (~ds@ics.elcom.ru) joined #gnuenterprise.
<StyXman> indeed, the focus get to the last entry a 'could' be written to. in my example, as there's no matches, it goes into 'inser' mode and writes in the first row.
<StyXman> if I click in the 5th row, I get the same. if I have 3 mattches and try to writte in tthe 5th, the 4th gets the data. and so on.

<LuftHans> tach
<Suit> Right, I am probably a clueless newbie to you all, but I am checking out GNUe and to get started fast I am getting the windows forms and designer and Sap-db. Are there any caveats with this combo or will it be fairly straight forward?
<siesel> It should be quite straight forward and easy :)
<siesel> The most difficult part is to edit the connections.conf file to setup Sap-db as your favourite db
<Suit> siesel: I take it an example will be in connections.conf?
<siesel> possibly no example for sap-db, but one for postgres etc., you just have to set "provider = sabdb"
<Suit> I have followed some discussions in the GNUe weekly digest and on slashdot about sap-db and gnue, I have come to believe that sap-db is one of the developers' favorites, so I expect it is well integrated with designer?
Nick change: SachaS -> Sacha_dinner
<siesel> almost every database which supports introspection should work well with designer
<siesel> although there are many developers which want to make sapdb as a standart, most work has be done with postgresql in the past.
<siesel> Hmmm, actually I forgot, if the sapdb driver was bundled with the windows installers for forms and designer :(
<siesel> If it doesn't work, you should ask derek (alias dneighbo). he is the sapdb specialist.
<btami> i think: not boundled with
<siesel> do you know how to append it to the python directory build with the installer?
<btami> don't know
<btami> i never used SAP-DB before
<btami> i'm using firebird on my winxp box
<btami> with kinterbasdb
<btami> both have bin versions for win32
<Suit> hmm, well, currently installing sapdb, will see what happens
<Suit> is it necessaty to install the sap webtools?

<Suit> DB000: gnue.common.GConnections.AdapterNotInstalled: Driver not installed: sapdb
<Suit> :-)
<Suit> api for SAP-DB 7.x
<ajmitch> you'd need a python sapdb driver, i guess
<Suit> Just dl it from sapdb.org, checking where to copy what version
<Suit> looks like version 21 and copy both in forms and designer dirs.
<Suit> Ok, I got a login promp when choosing connect
<Suit> DB000: Exception exceptions.AttributeError: "Connection instance has no attribute '_Connection__connection'" in <method Connection.close of Connection instance at 012EF24C> ignored
<Suit> And login does not work, same username does make me connect to database using sapdb tools

<ajmitch> how annoying

<wedniatnuom> jcater/jamest had an interesting problem dont know if there is a good solution
<wedniatnuom> i have table1 - department
<wedniatnuom> table2 - account number
<wedniatnuom> i then have table3 - which has deptnum, accountnum whereby its a control table to say what departments get what accounts
<wedniatnuom> so whip up a simple form
<wedniatnuom> that points to table3
<wedniatnuom> and two fields one for dept and one for acct
<wedniatnuom> both those fields are foreign key lookup (combo boxes)
<wedniatnuom> pointing back to table 1 and table 2
<psu> in effect a master-detail-master
<wedniatnuom> all that is a dream no problem
<wedniatnuom> psu : no master detail
<wedniatnuom> just normal table that has fk support
<wedniatnuom> the kicker is that in table 2
<wedniatnuom> the account table
<wedniatnuom> there is a column 'account type'
<wedniatnuom> turns out that account is not informative enough they want to know on that form what hte account type is
<wedniatnuom> so i dropped a table 4 (acct type)
<wedniatnuom> and made it a slave to the account table (beign used for lu)
<wedniatnuom> and the form craps itself hard

<lupo> DB000: ValueError: invalid literal for float(): 100.0
<lupo> when i start gfdes
<lupo> hey, according to my config file, this and the option below are outdated
<chillywilly> HEH
<lupo> laugh on me
<chillywilly> hey I didn't do it ;)
<wedniatnuom> what version of gnue?
<wedniatnuom> did you install over old version?
<chillywilly> hi wedniatnuom
<lupo> CVS head
<chillywilly> wtf is wedniatnuom anyway?
<wedniatnuom> i would  try  mv gnue.conf bak.gnue.conf
<wedniatnuom> or such then rerun
<chillywilly> wedniatnuom: are you using some CGI based irc client?
<wedniatnuom> gnueconf iirc is no longer necessary
<wedniatnuom> chilly read back wards and you will find the answer
<lupo> it's commented out already in the conf file. the conf file has a comment which states that the option is outdated.
<chillywilly> nevermind
<chillywilly> the power of CTCP ;)
<wedniatnuom> lupo: im stating actally that all of  gnue.conf is iirc deprecated
<wedniatnuom> so just move it out of the way
<wedniatnuom> and try and see if you still get the error
<wedniatnuom> that or remove the comment from your existing one and see if it fixes thngs.
<lupo> nope, same error
Action: Mr_You also wonders what a wedniatnuom is also.
<lupo> okay, works. but the option is officially outdated.
<chillywilly> wedniatnuom: what server are you using?
<chillywilly> that is hosting CGI:IRC
<Mr_You> oh I see.
<chillywilly> btw, 4ODS is pretty kewl
<chillywilly> an ODMG 3.0 implementation
<lupo> chillywilly: url
<chillywilly> it is part of 4suite
<chillywilly> http://4suite.org
<lupo> huh, quite functional
<chillywilly> psu: the IRC page should say irc.freenode.net as this is FreeNode the official IRC network of the GNU project :)
<lupo> what is dublin core? i've  heard that before ...
<chillywilly> ?
<Mr_You> well bbl
Action: Mr_You &
<lupo> sounds like a band
<lupo> oh
<chillywilly> where'd you get dublin core from?
<lupo> it's a metadata standard
<chillywilly> ok...
<chillywilly> 4suite is doing some pretty interesting work
<lupo> somewhere in the usage examples
<chillywilly> all 100% python
<chillywilly> they are doing like an enterprise data repository thing
<lupo> it looks like zope on dope, the xml way
<lupo> chillywilly: a possible candidate for the "document store"?
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> possibly
<chillywilly> they use a non-cpyleft license
<lupo> which?
<chillywilly> all their code is cpyright FourThought Inc.
<chillywilly> one very similar to the Apache license
<chillywilly> of course they had to do their own :(
<chillywilly> give it some other name
<chillywilly> click on the License link
<lupo> ah
<chillywilly> the 4suite License
<lupo> what a pity
<chillywilly> ;-P
<lupo> looks that some clauses are a bit nasty
<chillywilly> This license is based on the Apache Software License, Version 1.1,
<chillywilly> Copyright (c) 2000-2001 The Apache Software Foundation.  All rights reserved.
Action: chillywilly looks at the GNU license page
<lupo> btw, i've rewritten my home page in 100% xhtml. input: xhtml. processed with xslt. it was real fun.
<chillywilly> The Apache License, Version 1.1.
<chillywilly>     This is a permissive non-copyleft free software license with a few requirements that render it incompatible with the GNU GPL.
<chillywilly> We urge you not to use the Apache licenses for software you write. However, there is no reason to avoid running programs that have been released under this license, such as Apache. 
<chillywilly> kewl
<lupo> but they said "based on", which means that some of the clauses could have been added and may render it non-free.
<chillywilly> er, about your homepage not that license stuff
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> I am going t see if I can find details
<lupo> oh
<lupo> :)
<chillywilly> doesn't say anything
<chillywilly> I dunno why it is GPL-imcompatible
<chillywilly> incompatible*
<lupo> okay
<lupo> i've checked apache.org, and it seems that they have only replaced the names and addresses.
<lupo> so it is an apache license.
<chillywilly> yep
<lupo> regarding the incompatibility, i also don't understand that
<chillywilly> perhaps it is incompatible because of the advertising clause and naming crud
<lupo> quite possible, because the rest looks like mod.BSD license
Action: psu is back
<chillywilly> http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#6
<lupo> i don't understand why someone would want such a clause, but whatever
<chillywilly> very similar t rigianl BSD license

<wedniatnuom> 4suite probably thought they were protecting their 'intellectual property' (sic)
<chillywilly> yep
<wedniatnuom> you are 100% correct that trademark law and copyright law are two different things
<chillywilly> I commented on how stupid it is that lawyers lump it all into "IP"
<wedniatnuom> i could basically ASSIGN copyright to you on something
<wedniatnuom> but if i have it trademarked you couldnt use the name
<chillywilly> exactly
<wedniatnuom> and patent the receipe
<chillywilly> so what's the point in hacing a n advertising clase in a software license?
<chillywilly> er, having

<Sacha_dinner> you are talking about 4suite. i wonder why they did not take libxml and libxslt and enhanced those :( 
<chillywilly> I dunno
<chillywilly> what license do those libs have
<chillywilly> ?
<Sacha_dinner> i think gpl
<Sacha_dinner> but not sure.
<chillywilly> I told them the advertising clase was lame because it makes it GPL cmpatible, then thy main guy proceeded to tell me he thinks the GPL is lame...
<chillywilly> er incompatible
<chillywilly> then I left the channel shortly after
<chillywilly> they use their version of the Apache 1.1 license which is VERY similar to the original BSD license
<chillywilly> has the same advertising clause problems
<Sacha_dinner> i read your discussion.

<bt> 1. fo.xsl some ">" chars missing
<bt> 2. this fo.xsl was written for a modifyed monthly.grd
<bt> 3. i sended a little patch for sablotron adapter.py before

<filc> any news with the app server?
<btami> jcater: have you got any ideas about standard output tags for reports?
<jcater> filc: ?
<btami> i'm always asking this :)
<jcater> btami: formatting-type tags?
<btami> yes
<btami> last question was: why not FO
<filc> jcater: the replacement for geas
<jcater> filc: it's being worked on
<jcater> siesel is main coder for that at the moment
<jcater> I can't really say where it is
<jcater> I know he's making tremendous strides, though
<filc> do you know what the new geas is called, and if it is in cvs
<jcater> yes, is in cvs
<jcater> as /appserver/
<btami> and chilly is working on some odmg thing
<jcater> btami: do you have a good link for FO
<filc> jcater: thanks I'll take a look into it... currently reading Learning Python!!!
<jcater> cool
<jcater> good book
<btami> http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/ 
<btami> filc: read diveintopython.org too
<btami> jcater: i'v read a tutorial in http://www.antennahouse.com
<jcater> have you used FO much?
<btami> no, i'm just learning
<btami> i'm learning python, xml, linux, oop :)
<btami> i'm just a matematik, not a real programmer :)
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> best I can tell, FO specifies physical formatting properties (much like an XML version of PCL or Postscript) such as fonts, margins, font sizes, colors, etc
<jcater> as opposed to a functional markup (like docbook, latex, etc)
<jcater> is that fair?
<jcater> (that's from me reading 5 minutes)
<btami> yes, i know this
<jcater> ok
<jcater> just making sure I'm understanding FO correctly
<btami> yes, it is for "cosmetics" formatting
<btami> but reports needs this too
<btami> and <reporthead>, <grouphead> ... too
<btami> i think the decision is missing about this tags
<btami> i want to write another report wizard, but with this tags
<jcater> so are you thinking we take the FO elements that we need and add them to our spec
<jcater> or just use all of FO as it sits?
<jcater> i.e., "borrow" their ideas
<jcater> or use exactly their speciifcation?
<btami> i don't know, maybe it's too complex for a business report
<jcater> I'm torn
<jcater> of course
<jcater> the GNUe Reports engine could output FO markups right now
<jcater> currently, we have the SimpleTabulation style
<jcater> we could easily add a FormattingObjects style
<jcater> that is nothing but XSL-FO
<jcater> so the out: tags would actually be
<jcater> FO tags
<btami> i can't imagine how designer will work with complexity of FO...
<jcater> nor can I 
<jcater> of course, I can't imagine how designer's going to handle any reports yet :)

<jcater> btami: one thing about using FO
<jcater> if we go that route
<jcater> I'd want us to commit resources to doing a free python-based implementation
<jcater> I have issues with depending on a java program
<derek> i wont depend on FO from java (end of story)
<derek> i will write my own python FO 
<derek> or i will use reportlabs or such and go straight from xml to native pdf or such
<derek> sorry im just picky, i wont use java :)
<btami> if we go xml -> whatever, we need some formatting tags again
<btami> and this decision is missing

In other words, this would allow, if     we ever so desired, to write a PDF (or HTML or TeX) formatting     engine (instead of an external XSLT script) for reports of type     GNUe:Reports:Standard that the engine could load.  Instead of     physically creating an XML output stream, it creates a stream     of events to this engine, which would und
<btami> but this needs "standardize" these tags
<btami> the original monthly.grd was good enough for a sample, but wasn't declared as a gnue standard

<siesel> hi chillywilly
<Remosi> the FSF wanted a contact manager program written in GnuE didn't they?
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> bbl :)
<Remosi> did anything come of that?
<chillywilly> dunno, that's da masta's domain
<Remosi> are there any production quality apps for GNUe yet?
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> not yet
<chillywilly> ppl have various 2-tier systems in place
<chillywilly> like jcater and jamest do, iirc
<chillywilly> no real apps/packages though
<chillywilly> you can use our nice accounting system or anything like that
<chillywilly> er, can't
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> no place to enter invoices yet ;)

<Remosi> trying to find a list of things of why people would want a Linux server in their small business :)
<chillywilly> freedom ;)
<chillywilly> their systems don't drop off like flies
<chillywilly> their admins are happier ;)
<Remosi> heh
<Remosi> yeah, I know those ones
<Remosi> just trying to think of practical apps
<siesel> yes, exactly.
Action: chillywilly jst went through hell last night fixing mom's winblows for her
<chillywilly> admining winders is like kicking yourself in the nuts
<siesel> there is nothing to administrate, you just can install it and reinstall it and reinstall it :(
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> problem it is having
<chillywilly> it hangs on power save mode
<chillywilly> it wa set t just turn off the monitor
<chillywilly> it still doesn't wake up
<chillywilly> so I turned it off
<chillywilly> bt that's not what took me all night
<chillywilly> I took the whole thing apart and cleaned it good
<siesel> Remosi: there is an version of a kind of contact manager in forms/samples/track
<chillywilly> plled everything out of the case except the mobo

<chillywilly> it helps when you overclock it ;)

<siesel> btw. do you know how to check which package was updated in debian/unstable between today and yesterday?
<chillywilly> apt-get update; apt-get [dist-]upgrade ;)
<chillywilly> with th one option turned on
<chillywilly> or your apt.conf configured properly
<chillywilly> ;)
<siesel> I mean without using apt or dselect 
<chillywilly> I know
<chillywilly> I was being a smart ass
<chillywilly> I dunno I don't worry about it
<chillywilly> I just ask the apt bot and see if there's anything broke

<chillywilly>  /msg apt news #debian
<chillywilly> news read 1
<chillywilly> news read 2

<siesel> I just would like to know if libwxgtk2.2-python is updated soon. 
<chillywilly> ah yea
<chillywilly> well lemme see
<chillywilly> I jst upgraded a while ago
<chillywilly> btw, incoming.debian.org has stff waiting to go into the archive
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> Sorry, but the following packages have unmet dependencies:
<chillywilly>   libwxgtk2.2-python: Depends: python (< 2.2) but 2.2.1-10 is to be installed
<chillywilly> E: Sorry, broken packages
<chillywilly> this blows
<chillywilly> no forms
<chillywilly> :(
<siesel> yes, since monday, I have to live with dpkg -i --force-depends libwxgtk2.2-python.deb :(
<chillywilly> does it work?
<chillywilly> if so thenI wouldn't sweat it
<chillywilly> it sucks but you can live with it

<chillywilly> that one
<chillywilly> er, http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue79/divakaran.html
<siesel> yep, 
<chillywilly> scky thing is yu have to read the input in as a big string to pass in, it won't take streamable objects like sockets or files
<chillywilly> it doesn't do LALR either
<chillywilly> but it seems easier to use
<chillywilly> LALR(1) that is

<terr> In block2 I think the variables will correspond to a single sepcific record at any point in time. right?
<terr> If so - then is there some way that trigger code can fetch a value  from the "previous" reocrd for block2 or the "next" record?
<terr> OR can more than one record be referenced by block2 and if so how are the block.variables mapped into the database records?
<ra3vat> what is block2?
<ra3vat> what are you trying to do?
<terr> just a block that hold variables corresponding to a table in the databse where multiple entries exist.
<terr> well say I had line items in an invoice with a line# that is stored - not the real example but easy to understand.
<terr> when block2 is on say line item#4 I want to know if the values in lines other than 4 can be referenced
<terr> In this case block1 woudl hold the header infor for the invoice incl an invoice# while block2 corresponds to all the line items.  One can have several line items on any given invoice of couirse
<ra3vat> trying to fing you something useful
<terr> ra - hey thanks.  
<terr> I coun't see any reference in the syntax in the docs that would lead me to beleive that a variable in block2 can refer to other than a single record from table2.
