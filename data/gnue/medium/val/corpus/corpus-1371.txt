<btami> hi psu
<btami> any news about tickets in dclgw?
<btami> why not simply take the working backup
<psu> I know there were some tech problems, because of conflicts between restoring backup

<SachaS> hi everyone.
<siesel> hi SachaS
<SachaS> are the gnue dependencies fine with python2.2?
<SachaS> hi siesel
<SachaS> siesel i am about to install designer on a gnu/debian testing machine
Action: siesel is using gnue on debian testing at the moment :)
<SachaS> siesel! excellent!
<siesel> there is a problem with the wxpython package, which only exist for python 2.1 at the moment
<SachaS> do you use the debian packages (of python, orbit etc) or from source?
<siesel> debian packages.
<SachaS> oh did you solve the problem with wxpython package?
<siesel> yes. I use python2.1 and install wxpython per dpkg -i --force-depends
<siesel> I tried to build wxpython from source, but it didn't worked... :(
<SachaS> so you suggest to not install python2.2. do you have a list of debian packages I need ?
<SachaS> ok.
<siesel> python2.1-xml python2.1-egenix-* python2.1-postgresql ...
<siesel> I try again: python2.1-egenix-mxdatetime python2.1-egenix-mxtools python2.1-xml python2.1-mysqldb python2.1-pgsql python2.1-psycopg  should be sufficient
<siesel> If you want to use appserver you have to install python2.1-xmlrpc too.
<SachaS> ok. if i use mysql i only need python2.1-mysqldb, no python2.1-g*
<SachaS> sorry
<SachaS> ok. if i use mysql i only need python2.1-mysqldb, no python2.1-p*
<siesel> yep.
<SachaS> thanks.
<SachaS> doing a apt-get now
<siesel> btw. do you remeber how to do a query in a trigger? 
<SachaS> sorry no
<siesel> Hmmm, found it: datasource.simpleQuery({attr:val}) 
<SachaS> siesel: which debian package is for wxpython ?
jamest (~jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<SachaS> libwxgtk2.2-python ?
<siesel> SachaS: sorry, I forgot the most important one: libwxgtk2.2-python
<siesel> hi jamest, can you help me with a trigger problem?
<jamest> maybe, i haven't been in the code in months
<siesel> I have a list of entries and I want to press a button fill the list with records 
<siesel> the records should be selected with a condition like "fieldname==NULL"
<siesel> now I've used the datasource.simpleQuery({"fieldname":None}) command
<siesel> but it just creates a query like SELECT * FROM DTSRC WHERE fieldname='None';
<siesel> so what to do? Is simpleQuery the right command, and if it is how should I call it, or how should I modify it? 
<jamest> the button performs a query on the form w/ specific values in the query mask?
<jamest> is that what you are saying?
<siesel> yes. 
<siesel> But the button should build the query mask. not the user
<jamest> hmmmm
<jamest> are you going to have multiple buttons each w/ different query....if not queryDefault attrib on entry fields may get you want you want
<jamest> if that isn't the case we'll need to add trigger functions for putting the form in query mode and executing the query, probably to the form object
<jamest> i don't think it'll be hard to do, but i'm pretty out of touch w/ the code
<jamest> i'm going to be bug hunting today in there so I can take a look
<siesel> can I send you the form I'm actualy developing?
<jamest> sure
<ra3vat> hi all
<ra3vat> jamest: can you tell how costly is win4lin terminal server?
<jamest> it was 499 for a 5 user license (plus the cost of the 5 windows licenses)
<jamest> that was a sale price
<ra3vat> costly enough, how it helps then to save money on licenses, or what another advantages?
<ariel_> hi siesel
<SachaS> siesel: also needed python2.1-dev
<ariel_> this issue of updating a query (i.e. a dropdown list) was previosly discussed with derek and others
<SachaS> siesel: common installed without problems.
<ariel_> try to search in kernel cousin
<ariel_> is a feature that also the guys of papo are waiting for
siesel (jan@xunzi.sinologie.uni-bonn.de) left irc: "has to run :)"
<jamest> it allows me to migrate users to just about any platform
<jamest> one of my win4lin users is running on a 486 w/ 16MB of ram and no hard drive
<jamest> it is vastly more stable for some reason
<jamest> and it allows my windows only users to migrate to *nix solutions yet still keep the win software they need today to get work done
<jamest> another reason I did it was security
<jamest> i looked at upgrading to winXP to get users to stop installing crap on their PC
<jamest> that required major hardware upgrades and a fair cost for the XP liceneses (you have to pay extra for the privilage of upgrading past XP when something new comes out)
<jamest> with my current setup my receptionists log in via a diskless terminal and type win
<jamest> i wrote a script that figures out which group they belong to then uses rsync to create a fresh windows install just for them
<jamest> the next time they log in it gives them a fresh install, they can no longer install whatever crap they wanted on the system
Action: ra3vat keeps listening :)
<jamest> I'd tried to use security features in NT once to prevent those kind of things from happening
<jamest> but that was a nitemare
<SachaS> anyone: installed common, forms, desinger (its a breeze) 
<SachaS> anyone: gnue-designer runs! Congratulations. Damn you are good! 
<jamest> you installed everything, hardened the machine (a major task), put it in place 
<jamest> over time new software installs and security patches would undo the hardening (it seems)
<jamest> once I logged in and found a web server and the gimp installed on a system we'd done nothing to except for windows update
<jamest> those systems now run KDE and I'd be impressed if the grads can install crap on them now
<jamest> :)
<jamest> anyway, on win4lin, short term cost savings wasn't the issue
<jamest> my office needs windows software today to work
<jamest> the two full time windows users now w/ win4lin setups think KDE rocks
<jamest> and both are slowly finding replacements for their windows software in KDE
<jamest> last week one switched from Corel Calendar to Korginizer
<jamest> the newest one said "So, anything I can do in unix I'll quit doing in windows"
<jamest> I'm still working thru the new setup pains but all in all I'm having less support issues now
<ra3vat> jamest: oh, two users, it deserves to spend any money
<jamest> i mis stated that

<jamest> the rest have multiple users
<jamest> 2 of those 4 are now linux boxes
<jamest> those were the 2 full time windows users
<jamest> the other 2 would switch but we use peoplesoft and the setup requires IPX which win4lin won't do
<jamest> anyway, hideously off topic but it's great software

<dj_mad_goat> anyone know how to get an address of a raid controller?
Action: dj_mad_goat is fighting a compaq proliant 1500
<dj_mad_goat> unfortunately Debian is the odd duck out for support of this thing (SMART2) controller
<dj_mad_goat> their kernel doesnt natively support it, but they have some rescue disks that do
<dj_mad_goat> the problem is in order to boot them you need to give the address of the controller
<dj_mad_goat> and i cant find any where the hell you can find that
<jcater> dj_mad_goat: http://www.wicca.com/celtic/divination/cball.htm
<jcater> is this a [E]ISA card?
<jcater> if so, you'll probably need the utility disk for the controller
<jcater> if not, then I'm not sure why you'd need to pass an address
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> you know what model of raid controller?
Action: jcater is thinking back
<jcater> a lot of them had a "Press Ctrl+<some character> for setup" prompt
<jcater> before doing the bus-scan
<jcater> those screens would usually tell you
<jcater> aside from that, you're gonna have to get more specific wrt what raid controller you have
<dj_mad_goat> for edification of others
<dj_mad_goat> its a direct map = EISA slot = location
<dj_mad_goat> i.e.
<dj_mad_goat> slot1 = 0x1000
<dj_mad_goat> slot2 = 0x2000
<dj_mad_goat> and so on
<dj_mad_goat> only problem is cracked case to see what slot we were on and lo and behold our card is PCI not EISA
<dj_mad_goat> gack and i cant find instructions for how to do PCI instead of EISA
<dj_mad_goat> we have all tools for the controller
<dj_mad_goat> and configured according to specs (however that was when we thought it was EISA)
<dj_mad_goat> http://www.joelschneider.net/compaq_proliant_1500_debian_potato.html
<dj_mad_goat> is doc we were going from
<dj_mad_goat> if we try to do it without passing anything
<dj_mad_goat> it fails to find it
<dj_mad_goat> let me get exact model number and such
<jcater> do you have woody isos?
<dj_mad_goat> yes
<jcater> you may need to do what I had to do with my ALR
<jcater> install woody, not debian
<jcater> but at the boot: prompt
<jcater> don't press <enter> or type install
<jcater> but type bf24 <enter>
<jcater> instead
<jcater> and it will ask for a preload floppy
<jcater> http://people.debian.org/~blade/install/preload/
<jcater> grab the image there and put on a floppy
<jcater> if this combination works, then it'll ease installation
<jcater> (that's a 2.4.18 kernel, btw, so it probably has better support for Compaq SMART/2 than the 2.2 kernels)
<jcater> actually, if you look at that link I just gave
<jcater> it lists all the SCSI chipsets it supports
<dj_mad_goat> hmmm
<dj_mad_goat> i dont think it supports smart2
<dj_mad_goat> will give it a whirl
<dj_mad_goat> maybe i will just send the tech to this channel :)
<jcater> it might support smart2

<jcater> he should've called it Ye Ole Definition Language

<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> I don't like your parser
<chillywilly> why not se xml.dom?
<chillywilly> s/se/use/
<chillywilly> I think that lives in pyxml
<chillywilly> and/or xml.minidom
Action: chillywilly looks into the python dom api
<jcater> um
<jcater> many reasons
<jcater> first of which
<jcater> dom requires you to load the entire thing into memory before using
<jcater> which could become a biggie for really big projects
<jcater> and 2
<jcater> and this is really important, so listen carefully
<jcater> DOM licks the bag
<jcater> any questions?
<chillywilly> eh...
<chillywilly> I know about the reading in the document thing, why does it lick the bag though?
<chillywilly> just becase of that?
Action: jcater is more an event-driven guy
<jcater> not a tree-driven one
<jcater> it just works out better that way
<chillywilly> aren't you building your own tree?
<jcater> exactly
<jcater> but we do more than that
<jcater> what do you have against SAX?
<chillywilly> oh well...it's not a big deal I'll just see which is easier to use ;)
<chillywilly> making this dictionary and forcing my xml to be flatter is what I don't like
<jcater> that has nothing to do with SAX or DOM
<jcater> that has to do with us keeping our stuff simple
<jcater> we made up that dictionary thing
<jcater> to serve our needs
<chillywilly> what else does it do?
<chillywilly> initialization?
<jcater> ya
<jcater> default values
<jcater> initialization
<jcater> conversion from old, deprecated formats to current format
<jcater> importing
<jcater> oh
<jcater> and all Designer needs is that dictionary
<jcater> to be able to support the basics of a product
<jcater> that was the biggie
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> as I don't want to have to code a product twice
<jcater> once for the actual runtime and once for the designer module
<jcater> that's why I cringe everytime I hear "why not use DTD instead of the GFParser.py dictionary?"
<jcater> um, because our dictionary is doing more than parsing XML
<jcater> :)
Action: chillywilly actually likes schemas better
<chillywilly> DTDs are old skewl
<chillywilly> but anyway
<chillywilly> I don;t want to make life harde fr designer
<chillywilly> but I figure appserver will have an metaobject api (operations to add classes, methods to existing classes, etc.) and/or you can modify the xml files directly

<chillywilly> ths we can als use the SAX parser to create metaobjects straight from the xml
<chillywilly> for the appserver

<chillywilly> otherwise yo have to create 2 trees
<nickr> Or you could use DOM internally for the objects :)
<chillywilly> which is how it is
<chillywilly> er..well
<chillywilly> we create a tree of GObjs directly

<chillywilly> but I see your point
<chillywilly> hmmm
<nickr> sax is good if your object model isn't much like the XML tree, or you don't want to deal with the overhead in your model
<chillywilly> and ours is exactly like an xml tree
<chillywilly> HEH
<chillywilly> at least from what I am told
<chillywilly> I haven't looked deeply into the code
<nickr> well why not use dom then
<nickr> serialization and loading is trivial then
<chillywilly> maybe jc will come back
<nickr> Indeed there are likely to be lots of reasons not to
<chillywilly> then I can harass him some more ;)
<chillywilly> well the reasons he gave were not quite adiquate
<chillywilly> becase if they build their own tree
<chillywilly> what's the point in not using the DOM?
<nickr> yep
<nickr> maybe less control over the objects in the dom tree?
<chillywilly> well when you build a tree of arbitrary objects they can do lts of different things can't they?
<chillywilly> don't you normally derive from Node though?

<dj_mad_goat> hey is there  an smp kernel for p133's
<dj_mad_goat> but its mad slow
<dj_mad_goat> i.e. its dual p133 w/ 160mb RAM
<dj_mad_goat> compared to a p233MMX w/ 64mb RAN
<dj_mad_goat> er RAM
<dj_mad_goat> one has X and tons of stuff installed (the p233)
<dj_mad_goat> the dual has only postgres/apache and basic install from debian (like 80 packages or such)
<dj_mad_goat> tomorrow i imagine i will solict some performance tuning :)

<lupo_> what are you doing at the moment regarding gnue?
<siesel> I design some formulars and need the trigger system, and unicode support.
<lupo_> good
<lupo_> i don't know whether reinhard told you already
<siesel> what?
<lupo_> i have organized money to host a european gnue developers meeting
<siesel> cool.
<lupo_> so, i have already found a good place, about 300km from you, 300km from reinhard, and 100km from me which is about the shortest way for each of us. i don't know whether our baltic developers can join.
<siesel> The baltic developers, thats Arturas, ...?
<lupo_> yep
<lupo_> what country were they from? lithuania?
<siesel> yes.

<Arturas> Hello
<siesel> Hi Arturas
<SachaS> hi siesel. thanks for your guiding through the intallation last night
<SachaS> siesel: it works fine and designer is working.
<siesel> your welcome.
<SachaS> siesel: had a look at couple samples. samples are fine. did not try the database in the background yet.
<siesel> you will use mysql ?
<SachaS> siesel: i guess so. i dont have a concrete project so try the easiest one
<siesel> I would recommend to use postgresql instead, its not much more complicated than mysql, and many samples work better using postgresql

reinhard (~rm@M690P020.adsl.highway.telekom.at) joined #gnuenterprise.
<SachaS> how come? should be transparent, shouldn't it?
<siesel> the forms access is transparent, but most samples have database creation scripts which are written for postgresql
<SachaS> ok. fair enough
<siesel> there are just a few ones, which are using the new GSD format.
<SachaS> the property inspector seems to not let me change values, easaly, sometimes. did you notice?
<siesel> yes, thats an wx python bug. You have to make the property window so large, that the scrollbar disapears. Then you can change values again.
<SachaS> argh. at least you know the bug.
<SachaS> cool yes is working.
<SachaS> oops. segmentation fault
<SachaS> gnue-designer --debug-level 5 might help next time
<siesel> are you using the cvs version?
<SachaS> yes cvs version
<siesel> designer is under heavy development in cvs, so it will segfault sometimes :(
<SachaS> actually i updated my local files with cvs update. there are some g???cvs files i do not understand what they are for.
<SachaS> thats ok then.
<siesel> that are the scripts to start gnue programs directly from cvs source tree.
<siesel> gfcvs is for gnue-forms, gfdes for gnue-designer ...
<SachaS> from the local cvs source tree?
<siesel> yes. So you just ddon't have to install every package after every cvs update
<SachaS> dont understand but will try.

<derek> please (i know you guys have done several times) send all patches to me at derek@gnue.org today

lupo_ (~lupo@p3EE1D2AB.dip.t-dialin.net) left irc: "using sirc version 2.211+KSIRC/1.1"
<perlhead> derek: thank you for the offer.
<perlhead> However, my mail has broader implications than just applying the patches.
<perlhead> My guys have been preparing patches repeatedly, only to find that they become outdated before they get applied.
<derek> i will respond to the email, but in fairness doing your own cvs tree really hurts
<perlhead> And even if they manage to create valid recent patches for our current needs, and you manage to apply them tonight, we still have the problem of what will happen with our future patches.
<derek> you cant make changes to a ton of files
<derek> and then submit giant patches and expect quick turn times
<derek> a patch should only include code specific to the thing its fixing
<derek> and so many of the patches you sent of course were way out of date to the cvs tree as you were using a different cvs tree
<derek> a major server issue hasnt helped things
<derek> but in future small bite sized patches will get applied more quickly
<derek> this is no different than say the linux kernel
<perlhead> derek: I know the separate tree hurts. We don't like it, and I hope I made it clear in the mail. It hurts *us*.
<perlhead> The problem is that our patches didn't start being this huge.
<perlhead> They began life as simple things (save for some major functionality improvements)
<perlhead> But as time went by without them being incorporated, they accreted.
<perlhead> Most of them could have been incorporated as small fixes, only time conspired against it.
<derek> i thihk we can work this out
<derek> i hope that jcater responds
<perlhead> Let me stress this: *we want to kill our branch* *we don't like it* *we did it because we had no other choice*
<perlhead> As to the comparison with the linux kernel, you are right, it's not that different.
<perlhead> But as far as I know, major contributors to the kernel have commit privileges to their areas of activity.
<perlhead> Trust me, Vía Libre will continue to contribute to GNUe in a major way.
<derek> that is our problem
<derek> we dont have yet 'areas of activity'
<perlhead> We want GNUe to succeed as a coherent project. The success of our own project depends from it.
<derek> we have one giant cvs tree that has no discrimination
<derek> that is high on our list to break cvs into smaller modules
<derek> so we can give commit access by module and such
<perlhead> If we wait for that, hell will freeze over. You guys are overworked as it is. You don't have the *time* to the segmentation.
<perlhead> There are more important things in the queue.
<derek> then we have to continue with patches i think
<derek> we have been burned on more than one occassion doing differently
<derek> even in patches via libre has done, things were discussed in irc and everyone seemed in agreement
<derek> yet it was coded in way that was not agreed
<derek> jcater can give specifics
<derek> now certainly it was just a communication breakdown (so not criticizing coding or coding techniques)
<derek> but the idea behind patches is that stuff like that gets caught pre checkin not post checkin
paq (~paq@202.155.120.221) joined #gnuenterprise.
<perlhead> Sorry, I can't comment on that as I don't have the specifics, but I doubt the patches were coded in a way that was agreed to be *not* the right way.
<perlhead> I'm absolutely sure the intent is to do things the right way.
<derek> correct

<LuftHans> tach
<Suit> Right, I am probably a clueless newbie to you all, but I am checking out GNUe and to get started fast I am getting the windows forms and designer and Sap-db. Are there any caveats with this combo or will it be fairly straight forward?
<siesel> It should be quite straight forward and easy :)
<siesel> The most difficult part is to edit the connections.conf file to setup Sap-db as your favourite db
<Suit> siesel: I take it an example will be in connections.conf?
<siesel> possibly no example for sap-db, but one for postgres etc., you just have to set "provider = sabdb"
<Suit> I have followed some discussions in the GNUe weekly digest and on slashdot about sap-db and gnue, I have come to believe that sap-db is one of the developers' favorites, so I expect it is well integrated with designer?
Nick change: SachaS -> Sacha_dinner
<siesel> almost every database which supports introspection should work well with designer
<siesel> although there are many developers which want to make sapdb as a standart, most work has be done with postgresql in the past.
<siesel> Hmmm, actually I forgot, if the sapdb driver was bundled with the windows installers for forms and designer :(
<siesel> If it doesn't work, you should ask derek (alias dneighbo). he is the sapdb specialist.
<btami> i think: not boundled with
<siesel> do you know how to append it to the python directory build with the installer?
<btami> don't know
<btami> i never used SAP-DB before
<btami> i'm using firebird on my winxp box
<btami> with kinterbasdb
<btami> both have bin versions for win32
<Suit> hmm, well, currently installing sapdb, will see what happens
<Suit> is it necessaty to install the sap webtools?

<Suit> api for SAP-DB 7.x
<ajmitch> you'd need a python sapdb driver, i guess
<Suit> Just dl it from sapdb.org, checking where to copy what version
<Suit> looks like version 21 and copy both in forms and designer dirs.
<Suit> Ok, I got a login promp when choosing connect
<Suit> DB000: Exception exceptions.AttributeError: "Connection instance has no attribute '_Connection__connection'" in <method Connection.close of Connection instance at 012EF24C> ignored

<wedniatnuom> jcater/jamest had an interesting problem dont know if there is a good solution
<wedniatnuom> i have table1 - department
<wedniatnuom> table2 - account number
<wedniatnuom> i then have table3 - which has deptnum, accountnum whereby its a control table to say what departments get what accounts
<wedniatnuom> so whip up a simple form
<wedniatnuom> that points to table3
<wedniatnuom> and two fields one for dept and one for acct
<wedniatnuom> both those fields are foreign key lookup (combo boxes)
<wedniatnuom> pointing back to table 1 and table 2
<psu> in effect a master-detail-master
<wedniatnuom> all that is a dream no problem
<wedniatnuom> psu : no master detail
<wedniatnuom> just normal table that has fk support
<wedniatnuom> the kicker is that in table 2
<wedniatnuom> the account table
<wedniatnuom> there is a column 'account type'
<wedniatnuom> turns out that account is not informative enough they want to know on that form what hte account type is
<wedniatnuom> so i dropped a table 4 (acct type)
<wedniatnuom> and made it a slave to the account table (beign used for lu)
<wedniatnuom> and the form craps itself hard
<wedniatnuom> i can understand why (as this is an odd way of doing things
<wedniatnuom> so the question is 
<wedniatnuom> a. is there a better way to do this
<wedniatnuom> b. do we plan on supporting this if we deem there isnt a better way
<psu> a view, he said w/o much conviction
<wedniatnuom> psu: doh
Action: wedniatnuom pulls head out of ass

<chillywilly> hey I didn't do it ;)
<wedniatnuom> what version of gnue?
<wedniatnuom> did you install over old version?
<chillywilly> hi wedniatnuom
<lupo> CVS head
<chillywilly> wtf is wedniatnuom anyway?
<wedniatnuom> i would  try  mv gnue.conf bak.gnue.conf
<wedniatnuom> or such then rerun
<chillywilly> wedniatnuom: are you using some CGI based irc client?
<wedniatnuom> gnueconf iirc is no longer necessary
<wedniatnuom> chilly read back wards and you will find the answer
<lupo> it's commented out already in the conf file. the conf file has a comment which states that the option is outdated.
<chillywilly> nevermind
<chillywilly> the power of CTCP ;)
<wedniatnuom> lupo: im stating actally that all of  gnue.conf is iirc deprecated
<wedniatnuom> so just move it out of the way
<wedniatnuom> and try and see if you still get the error
<wedniatnuom> that or remove the comment from your existing one and see if it fixes thngs.
<lupo> nope, same error
Action: Mr_You also wonders what a wedniatnuom is also.
<lupo> okay, works. but the option is officially outdated.
<chillywilly> wedniatnuom: what server are you using?

<lupo> it looks like zope on dope, the xml way
<lupo> chillywilly: a possible candidate for the "document store"?
<chillywilly> hmmm
<chillywilly> possibly
<chillywilly> they use a non-cpyleft license
<lupo> which?
<chillywilly> all their code is cpyright FourThought Inc.
<chillywilly> one very similar to the Apache license
<chillywilly> of course they had to do their own :(

<lupo> ah
<chillywilly> the 4suite License
<lupo> what a pity

<lupo> looks that some clauses are a bit nasty

<chillywilly>     This is a permissive non-copyleft free software license with a few requirements that render it incompatible with the GNU GPL.
<chillywilly> We urge you not to use the Apache licenses for software you write. However, there is no reason to avoid running programs that have been released under this license, such as Apache. 
<chillywilly> kewl
<lupo> but they said "based on", which means that some of the clauses could have been added and may render it non-free.
<chillywilly> er, about your homepage not that license stuff
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> I am going t see if I can find details
<lupo> oh
<lupo> :)
<chillywilly> doesn't say anything
<chillywilly> I dunno why it is GPL-imcompatible
<chillywilly> incompatible*
<lupo> okay
<lupo> i've checked apache.org, and it seems that they have only replaced the names and addresses.
<lupo> so it is an apache license.
<chillywilly> yep
<lupo> regarding the incompatibility, i also don't understand that
<chillywilly> perhaps it is incompatible because of the advertising clause and naming crud
<lupo> quite possible, because the rest looks like mod.BSD license
Action: psu is back

<Sacha_dinner> i think gpl
<Sacha_dinner> but not sure.
<chillywilly> I told them the advertising clase was lame because it makes it GPL cmpatible, then thy main guy proceeded to tell me he thinks the GPL is lame...
<chillywilly> er incompatible
<chillywilly> then I left the channel shortly after
<chillywilly> they use their version of the Apache 1.1 license which is VERY similar to the original BSD license
<chillywilly> has the same advertising clause problems

<bt> hi all
<bt> is jcater around?
<jcater> yip
<bt> thanks for applying patches
<bt> but some notices:
<bt> 1. fo.xsl some ">" chars missing
<bt> 2. this fo.xsl was written for a modifyed monthly.grd
<bt> 3. i sended a little patch for sablotron adapter.py before
<bt> it needs 'file://' in PySablot.Processfiles(...) line
<bt>     PySablot.ProcessFiles('file://'+xslfile,'file://'+self.infile,outfile)
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> that breaks http:// references
<jcater> hmm
Action: jcater will look into that
<jcater> I'm guessing without the file://
<bt> ok
<jcater> that c:\whatever references break?
<jcater> is that the issue?
<bt> yes
<jcater> ok
<jcater> I have some code somewhere else 
<jcater> that deals with that
<jcater> I'll track it down
<jcater> and add here too
<bt> ok, thanks again
Nick change: bt -> btami
<filc> any news with the app server?
<btami> jcater: have you got any ideas about standard output tags for reports?
<jcater> filc: ?
<btami> i'm always asking this :)
<jcater> btami: formatting-type tags?
<btami> yes
<btami> last question was: why not FO
<filc> jcater: the replacement for geas
<jcater> filc: it's being worked on
<jcater> siesel is main coder for that at the moment
<jcater> I can't really say where it is
<jcater> I know he's making tremendous strides, though
<filc> do you know what the new geas is called, and if it is in cvs
<jcater> yes, is in cvs
<jcater> as /appserver/
<btami> and chilly is working on some odmg thing
<jcater> btami: do you have a good link for FO
<filc> jcater: thanks I'll take a look into it... currently reading Learning Python!!!
<jcater> cool
<jcater> good book
<btami> http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/ 
<btami> filc: read diveintopython.org too
<btami> jcater: i'v read a tutorial in http://www.antennahouse.com
<jcater> have you used FO much?
<btami> no, i'm just learning
<btami> i'm learning python, xml, linux, oop :)
<btami> i'm just a matematik, not a real programmer :)
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> best I can tell, FO specifies physical formatting properties (much like an XML version of PCL or Postscript) such as fonts, margins, font sizes, colors, etc
<jcater> as opposed to a functional markup (like docbook, latex, etc)
<jcater> is that fair?
<jcater> (that's from me reading 5 minutes)
<btami> yes, i know this
<jcater> ok
<jcater> just making sure I'm understanding FO correctly
<btami> yes, it is for "cosmetics" formatting
<btami> but reports needs this too
<btami> and <reporthead>, <grouphead> ... too
<btami> i think the decision is missing about this tags
<btami> i want to write another report wizard, but with this tags
<jcater> so are you thinking we take the FO elements that we need and add them to our spec
<jcater> or just use all of FO as it sits?
<jcater> i.e., "borrow" their ideas
<jcater> or use exactly their speciifcation?
<btami> i don't know, maybe it's too complex for a business report
<jcater> I'm torn
<jcater> of course
<jcater> the GNUe Reports engine could output FO markups right now
<jcater> currently, we have the SimpleTabulation style
<jcater> we could easily add a FormattingObjects style
<jcater> that is nothing but XSL-FO
<jcater> so the out: tags would actually be
<jcater> FO tags
<btami> i can't imagine how designer will work with complexity of FO...
<jcater> nor can I 
<jcater> of course, I can't imagine how designer's going to handle any reports yet :)
<btami> :) :)
<derek> did the papo patches get applied?
<btami> maybe derek can :)
<btami> hi derek

ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jcater> btami: one thing about using FO
<jcater> if we go that route
<jcater> I'd want us to commit resources to doing a free python-based implementation
<jcater> I have issues with depending on a java program
<derek> i wont depend on FO from java (end of story)
<derek> i will write my own python FO 
<derek> or i will use reportlabs or such and go straight from xml to native pdf or such
<derek> sorry im just picky, i wont use java :)
<btami> if we go xml -> whatever, we need some formatting tags again
<btami> and this decision is missing

In other words, this would allow, if     we ever so desired, to write a PDF (or HTML or TeX) formatting     engine (instead of an external XSLT script) for reports of type     GNUe:Reports:Standard that the engine could load.  Instead of     physically creating an XML output stream, it creates a stream     of events to this engine, which would und
<btami> but this needs "standardize" these tags

<terr> In block2 I think the variables will correspond to a single sepcific record at any point in time. right?
<terr> If so - then is there some way that trigger code can fetch a value  from the "previous" reocrd for block2 or the "next" record?
<terr> OR can more than one record be referenced by block2 and if so how are the block.variables mapped into the database records?
<ra3vat> what is block2?
<ra3vat> what are you trying to do?
<terr> just a block that hold variables corresponding to a table in the databse where multiple entries exist.
<terr> well say I had line items in an invoice with a line# that is stored - not the real example but easy to understand.
<terr> when block2 is on say line item#4 I want to know if the values in lines other than 4 can be referenced
<terr> In this case block1 woudl hold the header infor for the invoice incl an invoice# while block2 corresponds to all the line items.  One can have several line items on any given invoice of couirse
<ra3vat> trying to fing you something useful
<terr> ra - hey thanks.

<psu> "The UK's only location for Enterprise Linux computing"
<ajmitch> hi reinhard
<reinhard> good morning
<reinhard> offtopic question
<reinhard> can anybody explain in a few words the difference between mono and dotgnu?
<ajmitch> i can try
<ajmitch> mono is looking for mainly .NET framework compatibility, with the associated tools
<ajmitch> DotGNU looks to include that stuff, but to have a more genereic webservices platform with other tools, as well as supplying some webservices
<psu> so sorta dotgnu is like "GNU's not .NET", whereas mono is more like lindows?
<ajmitch> the .NET-compatible stuff is getting the main focus in DotGNU at the moment, but there is work underway that's not related to that stuff, like authentication & VRS
<ajmitch> psu: yeah
<ajmitch> DotGNU will be using the higher-level mono stuff where appropriate, no point redoing the wheel for everything :)
<ajmitch> hmm, that's the second time in 1/2 an hour that i've answered the mono vs dotgnu question ;)
<psu> ajmitch: time for an X-chat macro? ;)
<ajmitch> hehe
<reinhard> ajmitch: thanks
<reinhard> ajmitch: seriously i would have expected an answer to this question somewhere on dotgnu.org but didn't find it
<ajmitch> heh, i'll see if i can get someting added
<derek> reinhard: that would break FSF norm of making things difficult
<derek> you make things too clear and people might try to help and that becomes more work than its worth ;)
<derek> much better to make barrier to entry high enough that only the most elite participate ;)
<ajmitch> like GNUe? ;)
<ajmitch> i think that the GNUe website is too clear on things
<psu> I can rot13 the whole site if that would help ;-)
<ajmitch> double-rot13
<psu> double rot13 = clear text?
<ajmitch> gotta be extra careful!
<ajmitch> yeah ;)
<derek> we have a website?
<ajmitch> hmm why is bayonne under tools yet dcl under packages?
<ajmitch> derek: yeah, the one with the ugly colours :)
<derek> thats outta control, next thing you know some nutty englisman will go and read these logs and post summaries to the internet
<ajmitch> don't want to have that happening
<dtm> derek: what's up
<derek> picking my nose
<ajmitch> hi dtm
<derek> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/tools.php
<ajmitch> yes?
<derek> ajmitch: thats where bayonne is
<derek> werent you asking?
Action: derek is horribly delayed in response :)
<ajmitch> derek: no
<ajmitch> i was asking why DCL was not listed on that page, yet bayonne is
<psu> 'cause DCL is a package, not a tool 
<ajmitch> how so? :)
<psu> Fine shades of distinction, I know
<ajmitch> grr, something is broken here
<ajmitch> DB000:   File "/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/MySQLdb/connections.py", line 115, in __init__

<derek> jas;kldfjsa;lkj;klasdfj
<derek> aljd;kfjas;lkdfj
<derek> i hate mysql driver
<derek> bastards can never decide how they want to do thigns :)
<psu> The reason I list DCL as a package is that, although at the moment, it is in effect a package that includes its own tools
<ajmitch> i don't think it's the driver's fault
Action: derek doesnt have mysql anymore to test
<derek> ajmitch: in this case its not
<derek> psu: im with you
<derek> dcl is a package
<psu> eventually it should become a "normal" package using the main GNUe tools
<psu> w/ the PHP front end as an option
<derek> i.e. it is an producitity application w/o doing anything
<derek> bayonne is a tool
<derek> installing bayonne doesnt do anything useful for you
<derek> until you write applications with it
<ajmitch> ok
<derek> much like forms and such
<ajmitch> ok, psycopg driver just worked with dcl forms
<ajmitch> good thing that gtk2 driver was committed, i broke my wxpython installation
<derek> rofl
<derek> does it look nice the gtk2 one?
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise ("work time...").
<derek> and what did you ahve to do?
<derek> i.e. im interested in trying gtk2 but nervous
<derek> can i run gtk2 and gtk at same time
<ajmitch> well i've got all gnome 2 stuff compiled with garnome, installed into ~/garnome
<ajmitch> yes, it's designed to work together
<ajmitch> the sid wxpython package only compiled for python 2.1, 2.2 is default now
<derek> i dont compile
<derek> i quit a while back
<derek> 12 step program and all 
<derek> it really got me cured
<ajmitch> hehe
Action: ajmitch will bbiab
<derek> 1. We admitted we were powerless over compiling - that our computer systems had become unmanageable.
<derek> 2. Came to believe that a packaging system greater than compiling could restore us to sanity.
<derek> 3. Made a decision to turn our makefiles and our compilers over to the care of Debian as we understood it.
<derek> 4. Made a searching and fearless inventory of apt-cache.
<derek> 5. Admitted to #gnuenterprise, to ourselves the exact nature of our compiling.
<derek> 6. Were entirely ready to have Debian remove all these source on our computer systems.
<derek> 7. Humbly asked Debian to remove our makefiles.
<derek> 8. Made a list of all applications we had compiled, and became willing to use packages for them all.
<derek> 9. Made direct packages for such applications wherever packages didnt exit, except when to do so would produce non free packages.
<derek> 10. Continued to use packages and when we didnt promptly admitted it.
<derek> 11. Sought through apt-get and dpkg to improve our computer systems with Debian as we understood it, asking only for knowledge of Debian's package for us and the power to install them.
<derek> 12. Having had a philosophical awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to compiler freaks and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

<ajmitch> i don't know too much about that, perhaps look at some of the sample forms
<SachaS> yep.
<SachaS> ajmitch: i have a question about cvs: - i download the source from cvs (cvs update) and install it each time. how does the other way work, with the cvs scripts? 
<ajmitch> what cvs scripts?
<SachaS> i "cvs updated" a couple day ago and run the setup scripts in common, forms and designer
<ajmitch> ah
<ajmitch> ./setup-cvs.py is easier
<SachaS> there is another way siesel told me.
<ajmitch> much easier, in fact :)
<SachaS> does setup-cvs.py download the source code as well?
<ajmitch> no
<SachaS> no?
<ajmitch> cvs update grabs the source
<ajmitch> you've got to have source for it to install
<SachaS> ok. what does setup-cvs?
<ajmitch> setup-cvs.py makes scripts that let you use the cvs copy of gnue
<SachaS> o
<ajmitch> and sets up the conf dir
<SachaS> ok. the cvs copy of gnue.

<ajmitch> it's an ugly way of doing it

<StyXman> uh, yes, that happens. I never found why

<chillywilly> ok, and have you had problems with GNU/Linux's scalability?
<chillywilly> why would IBM put it on mainframes if it sucked?
<jcater> wtf are you talking about?
<jcater> I'm talking about just because a file system is being ported from another OS that doesn't mean it's inherently stable on Linux
<jcater> just because it was stable on that other OS
Action: jcater was not talking anything about stability
<jcater> although
<jcater> since you bring it up
<jcater> don't think for a second that IBM is converting it's mainframes from AIX to linux
<jcater> they are offering a linux "module" (or whatever they call it) 
<jcater> to people who need it
<jcater> there's a big difference
<Mr_You> IIRC, the mainframes run OS/390
<Mr_You> not AIX
<chillywilly> if it is relatively the same code for the filesystem them obviously it comes down to the underlying filesystem interfaces/code (the VFS in Linux's case)
<jcater> and that in know way knocks linux
<jcater> Mr_You: true dat
Action: jcater hasn't had all my caffeine yet
<Mr_You> Linux is the answer to a dying OS/390
<jcater> IBM isn't replacing OS/390
<jcater> linux isn't a mainframe OS
<Mr_You> mainframes are dying, so is OS/390
<chillywilly> they are running virtual Linux's on top of it, why would thye do such a crazy thing?
<Mr_You> its not a mainframe OS right,  but running Linux on a mainframe extends its life
<Mr_You> chillywilly: cause thats the best way they could get it working?
<chillywilly> yea, but I mean what's the point of doing that?
<Mr_You> to run non-OS/390 apps I assume, to get your monies worth from the hardware/investment
<Mr_You> to extend the life of OS/390/IBM mainframes.. ie. enabling more (new) applications to run on these dying geezers
<chillywilly> ok, but doe shtis say anything about Linux's scalability?
<chillywilly> er, does this
<chillywilly> or am I smoking good crackk?
Action: chillywilly takes a hit on the crack pipe
Action: chillywilly passes it around
<Mr_You> well.. linux is multiplatform..
<chillywilly> has anyone seen this hyper threading technology that they are hacking into the Linux kernel?
<Mr_You> its scalable to some extent
<chillywilly> er, read about it
<chillywilly> oh well my circular logic befuddles me
<Mr_You> scability is determined by "hardwired" file system sizes and processors
<Mr_You> and memory
<chillywilly> true dattttt

<Mr_You> processor scability isn't a problem with server farms, but you don't get real memory scability
<Mr_You> requires shared memory across a cluster

<chillywilly> we have no IRC client
<Mr_You> I've seen users with "GNU Enterprise  User" as their realname.

<chillywilly> they changes it to be that way then
<chillywilly> changed
<chillywilly> with some client

<Mr_You> pretty neat
<StyXman> jcater: uh, what did you understood by 'names'? I meant objectnames, as in the 'name' attribute.
<jcater> StyXman: yes
<Mr_You> bout time someone wrote a decent IRC client
<Mr_You> using CGI
<StyXman> I realized that my question was very ambiguos...
<StyXman> what are the parameters used for in reports?
<chillywilly> Mr_You der_edoc doesn;t think it is decent....he was bitcing baout it the other day
<chillywilly> about
<jcater> StyXman: well, reports can use them 2 ways
<jcater> 1) in the conditions for datasources
<Mr_You> undernet has a java app, I think, which is pretty cool
<jcater> so you can run gnue-reports myreports begindate=09/02/02 enddate=09/03/02
<chillywilly> I ain't doing sheeit at work!?!?!?!!!
<jcater> 2) the conditions can just appear in the output of reports
<chillywilly> woooooo
<jcater> i.e., 
<jcater> gnue-reports myreports custom_title="My Sales Report"
<jcater> I would foresee forms using it similarly
<StyXman> uh, I'll try to guess how does it do it.
<jcater> i.e., it could use them in datasources to limit a query
<jcater> or it could be values that trigger code could access
<StyXman> yes, it's what we need.
<jcater> datasources inherently support parameters
<jcater> but only reports currently passes them
<jcater> it should be trivial to get forms to
<jcater> it just hasn't happened yet
<StyXman> yes, that one too. indeed, we're thinking about a kind of 'app' that would integrate a lot of forms into one single app.
<StyXman> in a different way that navigator does. it would also handle app config and, more specifically, users and roles.

<der_edoc> rather than cowboy up your own, its better to discuss
<der_edoc> i.e. navigator is supposed to handle at somepoint role based access control to things
<der_edoc> and also tools are discussed to do things like manage connections.conf and such
<psu> Actually, if connections.conf was XML, we could use DEsigner to edit it ;-)
<psu> then it really would be "the emacs of GNUe"...

Chipaca (~john@200.59.86.80) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> hi all
<siesel> hi ariel_, I'm here
<StyXman> hi Chipaca 
<siesel> hi Chipaca
<ariel_> siesel: i'm reviewing the code in _featuretest and i'm asking
<ariel_> why the field type in geas_meta_object is varchar
<ariel_> and not another table/object such as 'geas_meta_type'?
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<ariel_> then type in geas_meta_object would be an int referring, as foreign key, the oid of geas_meta_type. 
<ariel_> vantages: 
<ariel_> 1) less waste of space.
<ariel_> 2) only 'known' types can be inserted
<ariel_> 3) specific info on the type can be stored in other fields of geas_meta_type, for example if type is 'function' the language or wathsoever
<siesel> The idea was to only use one table at the beginning, and split it up into multiple tables later.
<ariel_> another question:
<siesel> ok
<ariel_> now geas_meta_object is filled 'by hand' 
<siesel> btw. derek: you can use gtk and gtk2 together without problems on debian/unstable.
<siesel> just uncomment the two lines in the uidriver to "require gtk2"
<ariel_> i guess tomorrow a parser will do the job, but which language will be used? gsd, idl, odl, godl or what?
stbain (~stbain@66.207.65.76) left irc: "Ni!"
<psu> since chillywilly isn't here, I guess it falls to me to say "ODMG"
<siesel> there will be many parsers which can fill the internal structures
<siesel> hehe :)
Action: jcater thwaps psu
<der_edoc> psu  i think that means odl
<der_edoc> can i take step back and say can geas not focus on objects until it can get basics done?
Action: psu is just trying to fill up his GNUe Buzzword Bingo card
<der_edoc> thats the problem
<der_edoc> geas always seems to want to play buzzword bingo
<der_edoc> instead of focusing on just working :)
<siesel> since I 'm not 100% conviced that odl/odmg 3.0 ... is the best choice for internal structures etc. I would prefer a own format first. I think using .gsd as a start would be ok. 
<siesel> we can later add all that ODMG features to appserver and to the godl / odl parsers
ra3vat_ (~ds@ics.elcom.ru) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> The main drawback of odl IMHO is that code and definitions are seperated. I would like to have a file format which combines both
<siesel> like putting kind of <trigger> or <method> sections in a extended .gsd file

<ariel_> separation of code and definitions is not a bad thing, it improves reusability
<ariel_> you can improve the code for a single method without reloading/recompiling the whole thing
Chipaca (~john@200.59.86.80) left irc: "ircII EPIC4-1.0.1 -- Are we there yet?"
<siesel> I don't think, that putting code and definition together is a must, but it makes things much easier.
<siesel> btw. appserver could provide a "load new code into function X" method, which solves that problem.
<siesel> I just want to program like in f.e. python and not in the way like C, where I always have to change two file (.h, .c) if I modify the interfaces
<ariel_> what about the old 'gcd'
<siesel> I've started writing a parser for it, but there seems to be a heaps of reasons not to use 'gcd', I just don't remeber :)
chillywilly (danielb@mke-24-167-202-50.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> hi Daniel
<chillywilly> ello
<ariel_> can i improve gcdparser.py just to convert all the Neil's work into gsd?
<siesel> yes, that should be possible. 
<siesel> Not only possible, that would be great :)
Action: chillywilly has been reading the bison manual
<chillywilly> gcd schmecd
<ariel_> i will do, but since is a 'use and throw' job may be i will use old geas code to do it (in c) since that parser is more complete
<ariel_> what we need is only the output, i.e the gsd's
<chillywilly> can anyone reach http://www.dotster.com?
<Mr_You> use
<Mr_You> yes
<chillywilly> blah I hate my ISP
<psu> works for me - redirects to web.dotster.com
<siesel> ariel_: yes, it would be much easier to use geas to build up its db structure and then use designer to create a gsd out of it
Action: ariel_ is away: sleep
<siesel> ariel: night
<chillywilly> fucking shit
<chillywilly> that's it I am going to kick their a$$
<chillywilly> ;)
<ariel_> not sure it will work, because 'type' in gcd doesn't create classes but just reusable definitions
<ariel_> anyway i' m really tired, later...
<siesel> the_edoc: what do you think about a special dbdriver to edit the connections.conf in gnue-forms
<StyXman> why GRSources.prepare is marked as 'please go bye bye'? 
<jcater> because it will go away at some point
<jcater> :)
<siesel> jcater: what do you think about using forms itself to edit its own config files?
<jcater> I'd thought about that before
<chillywilly> anyone know ff hand the name of the website (OASIS group) that has the DTD and such for dcbook, etc.
Action: jcater even considered making IMAP and POP3 dbdrivers for gnue-common
<jcater> but then the more I thought about it
<chillywilly> I don't think I could ever reach their website either
<jcater> the more I thought that might be hellacious to maintain
<jcater> for the little benefit derived
<siesel> i.e. you think that writing a seperate app, or config dialog to do this is easier?
<chillywilly> www.oasis-open.org
<jcater> I think a popup dialog in Designer to do this may be best
<jcater> I'm honestly not sure
<jcater> I'm torn in several directions
<der_edoc> i think making a python app to do it is fine

<nickr> what is a Dot, exactly?
<nickr> some sort of new street drug?
<nickr> spank? horse? the snake?
<jcater> Reports has a GRParameter class
<jcater> that subclasses common's GParameter

<chillywilly> blah

<chillywilly> well that's the only evidence I have of brokenness

<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> I think there's a bnd link along the way
<sshack> What does a traceroute say?
<StyXman> chillywilly: mb you better use mtr
<sshack> Okay, question. Are the re any subprojects in gnue that need an extra developer?

<StyXman> yes, I saw the part where sys.argv convers into self.PARAMETERS or the like an then they're copied all over the code till they become GRParameters...

<StyXman> you say that GDataSources will look for them and use them if found?
<ajmitch> hmm, appserver?
<StyXman> (those were for jcater)

<ajmitch> chillywilly: have you retried yet?
<StyXman> chillywilly: they may be dropping echo requests... our uni does that

<chillywilly> echo is a ping right?
<sshack> chillywilly: Yes.
<ajmitch> icmp & udp
<StyXman> chillywilly: yeap
<sshack> ICMP echo == ping.
<chillywilly> pign works though
<ajmitch> traceroute apparantly uses udp echo by default
<StyXman> chillywilly: that's why: you better use mtr
<chillywilly> haha
<chillywilly> that worked ajmitch
<ajmitch> hmm, what a guess :)
<chillywilly> so what's the issue with that?
<chillywilly> and how can I make sure it is always disabled?
<ajmitch> it's a kernel option, can probably be set elsewhere in debian
<chillywilly> so I get notified of ECN and then it can't connect or what?
Action: ajmitch larts chillywilly with the rtfm stick ;)
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<chillywilly> there is no damn manual ;)

<chillywilly> do you know how it works?
<ajmitch> no, if i did i wouldn't be telling you to look at google
<chillywilly> where did you hear about that issue?

<chillywilly> someone should change the topic
Action: jcater doesn't have a sound card
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> why not?
<chillywilly> you're gonna miss derek's interview ;)
<jcater> but
<jcater> I don't have my wading boots anyway
<jcater> ;)
<chillywilly> lol
Action: derek is back (gone 11:27:28)
<derek> boots? im angry you said that
<ajmitch> heh
<derek> when i talk you need waders dang it
<derek> wear boots and you will be wiping it off your pants ;)
<ajmitch> ready for your moment of glory?
<derek> not really
<derek> im hungry must find food
<derek> is wopn streaming right now?
<ajmitch> yes
<derek> grr xmms crapped on em
<derek> says
<derek> couldnt open audio
<derek> 1. correct output selected
<derek> 2. no other programs blocking
Action: LuftHans gets in from yoga and tunes in wopn
<derek> 3. sound card configured
<derek> what is nuts is im not finding anything else using it
<derek> it worked fine yesterday
<LuftHans> ogg123 -d esd http://stream.wopn.org:10000/wopn-broadband.ogg
<derek> and if i shut it down and open frozenbubble the sound on frozen bubble works so it aint the sound card
<derek> grrr
<ajmitch> esd?
<ajmitch> that's just wrong
<derek> ok have it working
<derek> somehow my setting go changed from oss to esd in xmms
<derek> how odd
<LuftHans> ajmitch: why?
<ajmitch> esd is basically unmaintained, not very good with latency
<ajmitch> i'm using a soundcard now that allows hardware mixing
<LuftHans> well, it's default for debian, so it can't be bad :)
<LuftHans> my card doesn't do hardware mixing, that would be cool
<derek> LuftHans: i would agree, BUT
<derek> they install LILO by default too ;)
<ajmitch> default for debian?
<LuftHans> oh, and I suppose you think we should be using grub
<derek> ajmitch: yip unless you use progeny
<derek> um yeah i do suppose that ;)
<LuftHans> it's only good if you want to multi-boot with lesser OSen :)
<ajmitch> default for gnome, perhaps
<derek> LuftHans: not ture
<derek> er true
<chillywilly> LuftHans: the Hurd is lesser?
<derek> LuftHans: see the light
<chillywilly> grub rules
<LuftHans> ah, OK, Hurd would be OK.
<chillywilly> :)
<derek> http://gnue.org/~dneighbo/notes/java_plugin.html
<derek> oops
<derek> http://gnue.org/~dneighbo/notes/grub.html
<LuftHans> derek: as I said before, I couldn't get grub working.
<LuftHans> yeah, I need to use that and try it again.
<chillywilly> hey I have a debian kernel mini howto I wrote
<chillywilly> (i.e., make a deb of the kernel you compiled)
<LuftHans> using kernel-package?
<chillywilly> ajmitch: thanks again dewd setting that ECN thing to 0 has really imprved my connection speed
<ajmitch> cool
<chillywilly> well actually I think these packages are cahced on my server (doh)...but the other ones weren't
<derek> LuftHans: im utterly disguisted you seconded quickbooks online
<chillywilly> LuftHans: yes
<LuftHans> derek: get NOLA working, then bitch :)
<derek> not only is it far from free software
<derek> but its an ASP
<derek> the evil twin of prop software
<derek> if i get NOLA working will azoto use it?
<derek> btw: i wont say anything on the list
<derek> i figured i could rib you here in irc 
<LuftHans> I'm planning on it. I even hope to help with being part of the drive to get it working.
<LuftHans> I figure we can get Carl to use something else, but it's one of the few business apps things for which I could have input.
<LuftHans> BTW, if we get NOLA working under similar circumstances I can probably get that CPA to start using it :).
<derek> im not concerned per say with what carl uses :) (though i would like to see him preserve his freedom)
<derek> but AZOTO should really practice what they preach :)
<chillywilly> what/who is azoto?
<derek> AriZona evil word Technology Orginzation ;)
<chillywilly> they preach Free Software?
<LuftHans> ariel zenon offers technology OOpisms
<LuftHans> if you can provide the trillions of dollars we'd need to do Free Hardware, we'll do it. Until then it's Free Software and Open Technology :)
<LuftHans> derek: I didn't say that's what AZOTO will be using, did I?
<LuftHans> short term, we might, but I intended not to indicate that
<derek> LuftHans: i read half an email out of 30 with that subject
<derek> i just saw (the cpa uses it)
<derek> and so figured you were talking about azoto
<derek> i think 'kimi' said something about using it
<LuftHans> currently there aren't any Free Software packages, so we'll have to use a non-free package until one is
<LuftHans> that or just not track accounting stuff, which is what we currently do
<derek> paper/pencil
<derek> or large marker ;
<derek> )
<LuftHans> derek: we need a tool kimi can use

<esands> hey
<chillywilly> ho
<chillywilly> heeeeey
<chillywilly> hooooo
<chillywilly> heeeeey
[22:43] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<chillywilly> hooooo
<esands> sounding like a house, Mr Ed.
<chillywilly> it's mr chillywilly to you ;)
<ajmitch> hi esands, 
<esands> hey
<ajmitch> ltns
<chillywilly> derek: when you up homey?
<esands> yeah, been busy. Then my desktop had issues - both a faulty new PSU and case 
<chillywilly> when, when wheeeen!
<chillywilly> damn these packages 
<chillywilly> damn them all to hell
<esands> Had a go with the cvs version of gnucash and the new business conponents.  Now I'm fiddling around with acclite to see what thats like.
<ajmitch> ok
<esands> how is acclite at the moment?  
<derek> chillywilly: 9:15 i think
<derek> esands: its going
<derek> esands: what did you think of the gnucash stuff
Action: derek is curious, i have considered reviewing but have been too busy
<esands> I can send you the debs if you wish.  Although I need to get my desktop going first. 
Action: esands considers ...
<esands> I think the business part of gnucash is functional
<derek> um hmm
<derek> i suppose if you have them it might be worth looking at
<esands> It has promising and is usable
<esands> However, if you've used gnucash before you'll know when I says its very manual.
<esands> Still that's probably because Derek (the guy developing it) is designed it so far mostly for his own use
<chillywilly> derek: you need to school the WOPN boyz on Free Software ;)
<derek> esands: to me its nothing more than a toy, until it reads/writes to SQL database
<derek> i.e. flatfiles are just not suitable for business (imho)
<esands> I figure its current target is home size businesses  
<derek> to me its a quickbooks replacement (or sounds like)
<derek> which there is a market for, but not market persay that gnue is going after
<esands> I agree for most companys. However I've used it for my personal company for a while.  That said my personal company is very small, and I must admit in the last 6 months I've had difficults using it effective. 
<esands> It does have a sql feature though.  Unfortunately its out of date, and currently doesn;t work with the cvs version.
<esands> Definitely gnue and gnucash target different markets.  The big different though between the two products is that gnucash is stable having reached MILESTONE 1. 
<esands> Gnue is still work in progress. Useful no doubt, but still needing further work.  
<derek> we have really hit past our milestone one
<derek> as our first milestones were for the framework
<derek> not the applications
<derek> and soon now, we will enter first phase of application development
<derek> expect working goodies within the month
<derek> and kick butt goodies within 6 months
<esands> My personally experience between the two so far: I've used gnucash (although only tested the business component side of things) and I've _tried_ to use (unsucessfully) gnue for a couple spreadsheet replacement needs I have
<chillywilly> derek: you ready?!?
<derek> ?
<esands> Sure, you know what I mean by MILESTONE though. I a sense gnucash is a finished/sellable product at the moment. Gnue is quite there yet.
<chillywilly> you're next dewd
<chillywilly> interview time
<chillywilly> ;)
<derek> hmm odd i have sold it to a few customers last month alone
<derek> there is this fixation that 'shrinkwrap' means good and complete
<derek> oh well different markets i suppose
<LuftHans> derek: when he asks you to moo respond with gnu: :)
<chillywilly> LuftHans: :)
<chillywilly> I like that idea
<LuftHans> or even just gnu
<chillywilly> gnooooooooo!
<sshack> Good evening all.
<chillywilly> derek: guh-noooooo!
<derek> gary guh noooooooooooooo
<esands> Sure, but you are a core developer. Consider the part-developer who spends a lot of time doing business stuff (ie. me ;). I'm ready to do some work (hell I've compiled gnucash cvs to for myself) but I don't have a lot of time to spend trying to get things going. Or at least that's been my experience so far with gnue.  Of course since its a FS/OSS type project I've missed much in the last three months.  Things are probably different aga
Action: derek is not quite sure what to expect
<chillywilly> hehe
<esands> Hm
<esands> Something I can use. ;)
Action: chillywilly feels confident in derek's ability to articulate all that is gnu(e)
<ajmitch> have jcater & jamest been hiding lately, or just busy?
<derek> esands: what distro are you running?
<derek> ajmitch: busy
Action: chillywilly slaps jcater around
<esands> debian of course. 8)
<derek> esands: on a BLANK debian install gnue takes no longer than say 20 minutes to install (including postgres)
<chillywilly> :)
<derek> on redhat/mandrake then yes its hell, but i cant help crappy packaging ;)
<esands> sure, but the lack of documentation make it tricky to use.  Although I haven't checked the document in the last couple months.
<derek> yes docs are not quite there
<esands> I use the cvs version away.
<derek> problem is its a framework
<derek> not an application
<esands> Sure
<derek> so making docs is difficult
<LuftHans> esands: ask in here and you can get it working
<derek> as there is a certain amount of given one needs to know
<esands> but even framework needs docs, otherwise its difficult for outsiders to use.  Of course its a moving target at the moment.
<sshack> derek: Not entirely. Depends who your documentation is targeted towards.
<derek> until we get a real users manual
<derek> esands: i agree 1000%
<derek> to both comments
<sshack> api level documentation for developers using the framework is more difficult than developer level docs.
<derek> just docs for a framework (that covers all users) is a HUGE task
<derek> and we dont want our developers doing it
<derek> and we havent had volunteers :)
<esands> sshack: Its the most important though, otherwise its difficult to build a community interest in USE, not development
<esands> anyway, these are just comments for my personal experience so far.
<derek> yes i agree
<derek> we are selfish as of late
<esands> s/for/from/
<derek> we have personal needs for gnue
<derek> and so we are concentrating on the tools and our needs
<derek> we would love someone to help with docs
<esands> itches too scratch are the reason projects like this exist.  Wouldn't be fun for you to do it otherwise
<derek> as LuftHans said we are more than willing to help via irc
<sshack> derek: Why not document everything once a question or problem has arisen?
<derek> yeah
<derek> sshack: we try to
<derek> its a big job
<sshack> It is.
<derek> its on my list to finish a tutorial
<sshack> But once you start doing it, it starts to become natural.
<derek> but i am swamped have real clients need gnue applications
<sshack> ahh.
<esands> You guys probably need something like a wiki/fom.  Make document in the first instance a communitity task
Action: LuftHans plans on helping with the docs probs once he gets a couple of projects done and can move on to gnue
<derek> no wiki's suck
<esands> 8P.
<derek> actually wiki's are good for informal documentation
<derek> and throwing ideas around
<derek> but i dont think they shoudl be a documentation substitution
<esands> TWiki is pretty cool.  Of course I'm bais.  
<sshack> wiki's are perfect for informal stuff.
<LuftHans> docs with room for comments on the end are better, they're semi-wiki
<sshack> but you don't want to have to search through a wiki to find an answer to your problems.
<derek> the biggest problem you will find is we are business guys that know how to code
<esands> I think though at the moment you don't really have any formal document. Something that's easy keep up to date is more important than something that is 'formal'.
<derek> and as such we like to deal with thing slike we do in business world
<derek> i.e. get up and go to someones desk
<LuftHans> you then need someone(s) to go through comments and put the suggestions into the dos.
<derek> in our world the equivalent is IRC
<LuftHans> s/dos/docs/
<derek> once a community is big enough i encourage wiki and such
<derek> and will probalby help with getting content into it
<derek> dont expect other gnue core folks to though
<derek> as its not their style (and rightfully so, as it would only slow down their production) ;)
<esands> Actually I disagree. Business process is important to document. Otherwise if you have outsides/newbies entering a business unit without knowledge of how tasks are processed its harder to bring them up to speed without effective resources
<derek> you misunderstood me
Maniac (~User@h24-82-132-209.wp.shawcable.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> i didnt say business process was unimportant to document
<derek> at work we have a professional technical writer that comes to our meetings
<sshack> Development steaming forward is good. But everyonce in a while you need to stop and checkpoint everything.
Action: chillywilly thinks derek will have to be *untangled* soon for his interview ;)
<derek> and translates our development process
<derek> i dont have that here ;)
<sshack> or else the only one's who know anything will be those in the loop/cabal/inner circle.
<derek> unless someone wants to volunteer
<esands> heh.
<derek> btw: psu does this to a degree with his kernel cousins and i adore him dearly for it
<esands> I guess you need some professional doc writes in the gnue team then. 8)
<chillywilly> core people can't do everything
<derek> chillywilly: i think thats what im trying to drive at ;)
<chillywilly> :)
<esands> definitely. kc is the only reason I'm able to follow what's happening with gnue sometimes
<sshack> Something the quality of gnu octave or gnu scientific library docs would be very useful.
<sshack> Actually the octave docs are slightly better than gsl.
<chillywilly> they are also further along
<esands> just a note outside the current discussion, its probably worth changing the acclite footer to point at the gnue web site instead of the nola site.  Its not polite otherwise.
<chillywilly> much further
<chillywilly> gsl rocks
<derek> not polite?
<derek> i figured not giving them attribution was worse
<derek> fwiw: the idea is not to have a fork
<derek> just to finish our regutting and give back to noguska
<derek> at which point if they dont like we fork
<esands> Sure, but for the purposes of bug reports acclite is not their problem.  Since its not their development
<sshack> chillywilly: I've got the dead tree books for gsl and octave. octave has by far the better manual.
<sshack> gsl is a good reference, but not a great manual.
<chillywilly> well I use gsl in a pet project of mine
<chillywilly> gsl and gnu common c++
<esands> sshack: how much they able to copy from matlab though?
<chillywilly> I have used octave too, but not fr a long while (not since I was in college)
<sshack> esands: I don't know, i've never actually seen a matlab manual. I'm a mathematica guy.
<derek> esands: good point, though it was never meant as public consumption
<derek> short of gnue folks helping us review our changes :)
<chillywilly> I jsut submitted a big patch to gnu common c++ like last weeks or so
<derek> it kind of grew into more than that, because we were slow getting changes back to nola
<jcater> ajmitch: both jamest and my jobs deal with schools
<derek> i will make the changes and commit 
<esands> sure, but having a link to the snapshots from kc makes it reasonablely public.  
<ajmitch> jcater: ok
<derek> jcater you live
<jcater> ajmitch: so come September
<jcater> jcater: all hell breaks loose for both of us
<ajmitch> oh lovely 
<jcater> s/jcater/ajmitch
<chillywilly> *joy*
<ajmitch> back to a resemblance of sanity soon?
<chillywilly> that sorta bites the big one jcater ;)
<jcater> ajmitch: yip
<jcater> ajmitch: about January 2, or so
<chillywilly> :(
<chillywilly> that's a ways away
<ajmitch> yeah, a long way
<jcater> fsck
Action: jcater just got another desupport notice from Oracle
<jcater> happy, happy, joy, joy
<derek> poop
<chillywilly> desupport?
<jcater> chillywilly: ya
<jcater> the latest round of "if you are still using this old, old version, we won't support you any more
<jcater> old, old version = 18 months, maybe
<chillywilly> ah
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> what crap
<jcater> funny enough, Win98 and WinNT are desupported
<jcater> permanently
<chillywilly> you can get someone else to support you though, can't you?
<ajmitch> this isn't FS :)
<jcater> chillywilly: nah
<jcater> only reason to be supported (imho) 
<jcater> is you get free upgrades
<chillywilly> yea, but you can't get the code anyway
<chillywilly> ah
<jcater> yearlyt support contracts w/free upgrades
<chillywilly> gayness
<jcater> are much cheaper than waiting a few years and repurchasing
<esands> is there a bug with adding users in acclite?
<ajmitch> you can add users?
<jcater> beats me
<LuftHans> jcater: sounds like an excuse to move to SAPdb :)/
<jcater> LuftHans: no kidding
<jcater> but we have to much legacy code at the moment
Action: LuftHans will be calling about an Oracle job after the dneighbo i/view on WOPN, though.
<chillywilly> M$ will provide you with support s yo don't hurt yourself when they bend you over 
<jcater> (hence the reason I joined gnue 18 months ago :)
<ajmitch> derek!!!!
<esands> ajmitch: other than the default admin:password user
<ajmitch> he's on WOPN
<jcater> sigh

<jcater> I wish we could get a transcript
<ajmitch> http://stream.wopn.org:10000/wopn-broadband.ogg
Action: jcater is really curious what kind of promises derek is making that we will have to deliver
<jcater> :)
<esands> is there a way to get acclite to debug log sql commands to a file?
<jcater> "Oh, yeah; the GNUe-Sanitizer module will clean out your refrigerator and sanitize your toilet"
<ajmitch> it'll be archived, so you could get a transcript
<sshack> oh dear god. pc jr.
<sshack> The power.
<jcater> "And the GNUe-Carpenter can do additions, but the GNUe-Electrical module isn't yet functional"
<jcater> "But give us 2 months and she'll be able to do electrical wiring too"
