<btami> hi psu
<btami> any news about tickets in dclgw?
<btami> why not simply take the working backup
<psu> I know there were some tech problems, because of conflicts between restoring backup

<SachaS> hi everyone.
<siesel> hi SachaS
<SachaS> are the gnue dependencies fine with python2.2?
<SachaS> hi siesel
<SachaS> siesel i am about to install designer on a gnu/debian testing machine
Action: siesel is using gnue on debian testing at the moment :)
<SachaS> siesel! excellent!
<siesel> there is a problem with the wxpython package, which only exist for python 2.1 at the moment
<SachaS> do you use the debian packages (of python, orbit etc) or from source?
<siesel> debian packages.
<SachaS> oh did you solve the problem with wxpython package?
<siesel> yes. I use python2.1 and install wxpython per dpkg -i --force-depends
<siesel> I tried to build wxpython from source, but it didn't worked... :(
<SachaS> so you suggest to not install python2.2. do you have a list of debian packages I need ?
<SachaS> ok.
<siesel> python2.1-xml python2.1-egenix-* python2.1-postgresql ...
<siesel> I try again: python2.1-egenix-mxdatetime python2.1-egenix-mxtools python2.1-xml python2.1-mysqldb python2.1-pgsql python2.1-psycopg  should be sufficient
<siesel> If you want to use appserver you have to install python2.1-xmlrpc too.
<SachaS> ok. if i use mysql i only need python2.1-mysqldb, no python2.1-g*
<SachaS> sorry
<SachaS> ok. if i use mysql i only need python2.1-mysqldb, no python2.1-p*
<siesel> yep.
<SachaS> thanks.
<SachaS> doing a apt-get now
<siesel> btw. do you remeber how to do a query in a trigger? 
<SachaS> sorry no
<siesel> Hmmm, found it: datasource.simpleQuery({attr:val}) 
<SachaS> siesel: which debian package is for wxpython ?
jamest (~jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) joined #gnuenterprise.
<SachaS> libwxgtk2.2-python ?
<siesel> SachaS: sorry, I forgot the most important one: libwxgtk2.2-python
<siesel> hi jamest, can you help me with a trigger problem?
<jamest> maybe, i haven't been in the code in months
<siesel> I have a list of entries and I want to press a button fill the list with records 
<siesel> the records should be selected with a condition like "fieldname==NULL"
<siesel> now I've used the datasource.simpleQuery({"fieldname":None}) command
<siesel> but it just creates a query like SELECT * FROM DTSRC WHERE fieldname='None';
<siesel> so what to do? Is simpleQuery the right command, and if it is how should I call it, or how should I modify it? 
<jamest> the button performs a query on the form w/ specific values in the query mask?
<jamest> is that what you are saying?
<siesel> yes. 
<siesel> But the button should build the query mask. not the user
<jamest> hmmmm
<jamest> are you going to have multiple buttons each w/ different query....if not queryDefault attrib on entry fields may get you want you want
<jamest> if that isn't the case we'll need to add trigger functions for putting the form in query mode and executing the query, probably to the form object
<jamest> i don't think it'll be hard to do, but i'm pretty out of touch w/ the code
<jamest> i'm going to be bug hunting today in there so I can take a look
<siesel> can I send you the form I'm actualy developing?
<jamest> sure
<ra3vat> hi all
<ra3vat> jamest: can you tell how costly is win4lin terminal server?
<jamest> it was 499 for a 5 user license (plus the cost of the 5 windows licenses)
<jamest> that was a sale price
<ra3vat> costly enough, how it helps then to save money on licenses, or what another advantages?
<ariel_> hi siesel
<SachaS> siesel: also needed python2.1-dev
<ariel_> this issue of updating a query (i.e. a dropdown list) was previosly discussed with derek and others
<SachaS> siesel: common installed without problems.
<ariel_> try to search in kernel cousin
<ariel_> is a feature that also the guys of papo are waiting for
siesel (jan@xunzi.sinologie.uni-bonn.de) left irc: "has to run :)"
<jamest> it allows me to migrate users to just about any platform
<jamest> one of my win4lin users is running on a 486 w/ 16MB of ram and no hard drive
<jamest> it is vastly more stable for some reason
<jamest> and it allows my windows only users to migrate to *nix solutions yet still keep the win software they need today to get work done
<jamest> another reason I did it was security
<jamest> i looked at upgrading to winXP to get users to stop installing crap on their PC
<jamest> that required major hardware upgrades and a fair cost for the XP liceneses (you have to pay extra for the privilage of upgrading past XP when something new comes out)
<jamest> with my current setup my receptionists log in via a diskless terminal and type win
<jamest> i wrote a script that figures out which group they belong to then uses rsync to create a fresh windows install just for them
<jamest> the next time they log in it gives them a fresh install, they can no longer install whatever crap they wanted on the system
Action: ra3vat keeps listening :)
<jamest> I'd tried to use security features in NT once to prevent those kind of things from happening
<jamest> but that was a nitemare
<SachaS> anyone: installed common, forms, desinger (its a breeze) 
<SachaS> anyone: gnue-designer runs! Congratulations. Damn you are good! 
<jamest> you installed everything, hardened the machine (a major task), put it in place 
<jamest> over time new software installs and security patches would undo the hardening (it seems)
<jamest> once I logged in and found a web server and the gimp installed on a system we'd done nothing to except for windows update
<jamest> those systems now run KDE and I'd be impressed if the grads can install crap on them now
<jamest> :)
<jamest> anyway, on win4lin, short term cost savings wasn't the issue
<jamest> my office needs windows software today to work
<jamest> the two full time windows users now w/ win4lin setups think KDE rocks
<jamest> and both are slowly finding replacements for their windows software in KDE
<jamest> last week one switched from Corel Calendar to Korginizer
<jamest> the newest one said "So, anything I can do in unix I'll quit doing in windows"
<jamest> I'm still working thru the new setup pains but all in all I'm having less support issues now
<ra3vat> jamest: oh, two users, it deserves to spend any money
<jamest> i mis stated that

<jamest> the rest have multiple users
<jamest> 2 of those 4 are now linux boxes
<jamest> those were the 2 full time windows users
<jamest> the other 2 would switch but we use peoplesoft and the setup requires IPX which win4lin won't do
<jamest> anyway, hideously off topic but it's great software

<dj_mad_goat> anyone know how to get an address of a raid controller?
Action: dj_mad_goat is fighting a compaq proliant 1500
<dj_mad_goat> unfortunately Debian is the odd duck out for support of this thing (SMART2) controller
<dj_mad_goat> their kernel doesnt natively support it, but they have some rescue disks that do
<dj_mad_goat> the problem is in order to boot them you need to give the address of the controller
<dj_mad_goat> and i cant find any where the hell you can find that
<jcater> dj_mad_goat: http://www.wicca.com/celtic/divination/cball.htm
<jcater> is this a [E]ISA card?
<jcater> if so, you'll probably need the utility disk for the controller
<jcater> if not, then I'm not sure why you'd need to pass an address
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> you know what model of raid controller?
Action: jcater is thinking back
<jcater> a lot of them had a "Press Ctrl+<some character> for setup" prompt
<jcater> before doing the bus-scan
<jcater> those screens would usually tell you
<jcater> aside from that, you're gonna have to get more specific wrt what raid controller you have
<dj_mad_goat> for edification of others
<dj_mad_goat> its a direct map = EISA slot = location
<dj_mad_goat> i.e.
<dj_mad_goat> slot1 = 0x1000
<dj_mad_goat> slot2 = 0x2000
<dj_mad_goat> and so on
<dj_mad_goat> only problem is cracked case to see what slot we were on and lo and behold our card is PCI not EISA
<dj_mad_goat> gack and i cant find instructions for how to do PCI instead of EISA
<dj_mad_goat> we have all tools for the controller
<dj_mad_goat> and configured according to specs (however that was when we thought it was EISA)
<dj_mad_goat> http://www.joelschneider.net/compaq_proliant_1500_debian_potato.html
<dj_mad_goat> is doc we were going from
<dj_mad_goat> if we try to do it without passing anything
<dj_mad_goat> it fails to find it
<dj_mad_goat> let me get exact model number and such
<jcater> do you have woody isos?
<dj_mad_goat> yes
<jcater> you may need to do what I had to do with my ALR
<jcater> install woody, not debian
<jcater> but at the boot: prompt
<jcater> don't press <enter> or type install
<jcater> but type bf24 <enter>
<jcater> instead
<jcater> and it will ask for a preload floppy
<jcater> http://people.debian.org/~blade/install/preload/
<jcater> grab the image there and put on a floppy
<jcater> if this combination works, then it'll ease installation
<jcater> (that's a 2.4.18 kernel, btw, so it probably has better support for Compaq SMART/2 than the 2.2 kernels)
<jcater> actually, if you look at that link I just gave
<jcater> it lists all the SCSI chipsets it supports
<dj_mad_goat> hmmm
<dj_mad_goat> i dont think it supports smart2
<dj_mad_goat> will give it a whirl
<dj_mad_goat> maybe i will just send the tech to this channel :)
<jcater> it might support smart2

<jcater> he should've called it Ye Ole Definition Language

<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> I don't like your parser
<chillywilly> why not se xml.dom?
<chillywilly> s/se/use/
<chillywilly> I think that lives in pyxml
<chillywilly> and/or xml.minidom
Action: chillywilly looks into the python dom api
<jcater> um
<jcater> many reasons
<jcater> first of which
<jcater> dom requires you to load the entire thing into memory before using
<jcater> which could become a biggie for really big projects
<jcater> and 2
<jcater> and this is really important, so listen carefully
<jcater> DOM licks the bag
<jcater> any questions?
<chillywilly> eh...
<chillywilly> I know about the reading in the document thing, why does it lick the bag though?
<chillywilly> just becase of that?
Action: jcater is more an event-driven guy
<jcater> not a tree-driven one
<jcater> it just works out better that way
<chillywilly> aren't you building your own tree?
<jcater> exactly
<jcater> but we do more than that
<jcater> what do you have against SAX?
<chillywilly> oh well...it's not a big deal I'll just see which is easier to use ;)
<chillywilly> making this dictionary and forcing my xml to be flatter is what I don't like
<jcater> that has nothing to do with SAX or DOM
<jcater> that has to do with us keeping our stuff simple
<jcater> we made up that dictionary thing
<jcater> to serve our needs
<chillywilly> what else does it do?
<chillywilly> initialization?
<jcater> ya
<jcater> default values
<jcater> initialization
<jcater> conversion from old, deprecated formats to current format
<jcater> importing
<jcater> oh
<jcater> and all Designer needs is that dictionary
<jcater> to be able to support the basics of a product
<jcater> that was the biggie
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> as I don't want to have to code a product twice
<jcater> once for the actual runtime and once for the designer module
<jcater> that's why I cringe everytime I hear "why not use DTD instead of the GFParser.py dictionary?"
<jcater> um, because our dictionary is doing more than parsing XML
<jcater> :)
Action: chillywilly actually likes schemas better
<chillywilly> DTDs are old skewl
<chillywilly> but anyway
<chillywilly> I don;t want to make life harde fr designer
<chillywilly> but I figure appserver will have an metaobject api (operations to add classes, methods to existing classes, etc.) and/or you can modify the xml files directly

<chillywilly> ths we can als use the SAX parser to create metaobjects straight from the xml
<chillywilly> for the appserver

<chillywilly> otherwise yo have to create 2 trees
<nickr> Or you could use DOM internally for the objects :)
<chillywilly> which is how it is
<chillywilly> er..well
<chillywilly> we create a tree of GObjs directly

<chillywilly> but I see your point
<chillywilly> hmmm
<nickr> sax is good if your object model isn't much like the XML tree, or you don't want to deal with the overhead in your model
<chillywilly> and ours is exactly like an xml tree
<chillywilly> HEH
<chillywilly> at least from what I am told
<chillywilly> I haven't looked deeply into the code
<nickr> well why not use dom then
<nickr> serialization and loading is trivial then
<chillywilly> maybe jc will come back
<nickr> Indeed there are likely to be lots of reasons not to
<chillywilly> then I can harass him some more ;)
<chillywilly> well the reasons he gave were not quite adiquate
<chillywilly> becase if they build their own tree
<chillywilly> what's the point in not using the DOM?
<nickr> yep
<nickr> maybe less control over the objects in the dom tree?
<chillywilly> well when you build a tree of arbitrary objects they can do lts of different things can't they?
<chillywilly> don't you normally derive from Node though?

<chillywilly> All of the components of an XML document are subclasses of Node.

<ajmitch> chillywilly: see one of the latest posts on the GNUe list? ;)
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> er, you mean abot e-gov?
<chillywilly> or something else?
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> see Mr Stanco's name mentioned there? ;)
Action: ajmitch is not surprised at all that GNUe is left out
Action: chillywilly either
<chillywilly> I commented n it earlier when I first got home
<chillywilly> in this here channel
<ajmitch> ok
<dj_mad_goat> hey is there  an smp kernel for p133's
<dj_mad_goat> but its mad slow
<dj_mad_goat> i.e. its dual p133 w/ 160mb RAM
<dj_mad_goat> compared to a p233MMX w/ 64mb RAN
<dj_mad_goat> er RAM
<dj_mad_goat> one has X and tons of stuff installed (the p233)
<dj_mad_goat> the dual has only postgres/apache and basic install from debian (like 80 packages or such)
<dj_mad_goat> tomorrow i imagine i will solict some performance tuning :)
<dj_mad_goat> or some way to get that smp to be used efficiently
Action: dj_mad_goat suspects its only using 1 cpu or something
