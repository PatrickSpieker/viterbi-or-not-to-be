<lupo_> hi
<siesel> hi lupo_
<lupo_> hey siesel :)
<lupo_> what are you doing at the moment regarding gnue?
<siesel> I design some formulars and need the trigger system, and unicode support.
<lupo_> good
<lupo_> i don't know whether reinhard told you already
<siesel> what?
<lupo_> i have organized money to host a european gnue developers meeting
<siesel> cool.
<lupo_> so, i have already found a good place, about 300km from you, 300km from reinhard, and 100km from me which is about the shortest way for each of us. i don't know whether our baltic developers can join.
<siesel> The baltic developers, thats Arturas, ...?
<lupo_> yep
<lupo_> what country were they from? lithuania?
<siesel> yes.
<lupo_> the only problem is that a lufthansa economy class flight (vilnius-ffm) costs about 5000Eur :(

<Arturas> Hello
<siesel> Hi Arturas
<SachaS> hi siesel. thanks for your guiding through the intallation last night
<SachaS> siesel: it works fine and designer is working.
<siesel> your welcome.
<SachaS> siesel: had a look at couple samples. samples are fine. did not try the database in the background yet.
<siesel> you will use mysql ?
<SachaS> siesel: i guess so. i dont have a concrete project so try the easiest one
<siesel> I would recommend to use postgresql instead, its not much more complicated than mysql, and many samples work better using postgresql

reinhard (~rm@M690P020.adsl.highway.telekom.at) joined #gnuenterprise.
<SachaS> how come? should be transparent, shouldn't it?
<siesel> the forms access is transparent, but most samples have database creation scripts which are written for postgresql
<SachaS> ok. fair enough
<siesel> there are just a few ones, which are using the new GSD format.
<SachaS> the property inspector seems to not let me change values, easaly, sometimes. did you notice?
<siesel> yes, thats an wx python bug. You have to make the property window so large, that the scrollbar disapears. Then you can change values again.
<SachaS> argh. at least you know the bug.
<SachaS> cool yes is working.
<SachaS> oops. segmentation fault
<SachaS> gnue-designer --debug-level 5 might help next time
<siesel> are you using the cvs version?
<SachaS> yes cvs version
<siesel> designer is under heavy development in cvs, so it will segfault sometimes :(
<SachaS> actually i updated my local files with cvs update. there are some g???cvs files i do not understand what they are for.
<SachaS> thats ok then.
<siesel> that are the scripts to start gnue programs directly from cvs source tree.
<siesel> gfcvs is for gnue-forms, gfdes for gnue-designer ...
<SachaS> from the local cvs source tree?
<siesel> yes. So you just ddon't have to install every package after every cvs update
<SachaS> dont understand but will try.
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<SachaS> siesel. what should i do if i find a problem. i know i should fix it :)

<SachaS> thank you
<lupo_> aha :)
<lupo_> anyone seen david sugar in the recent days ?
<SachaS> lupo_ where shall i send a report concerning designer?
<lupo_> email it to designer-support at gnuenterprise.org, with version and OS information
JohannesV (~jve@M689P012.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<lupo_> a good idea is to send a patch :)
<SachaS> lupo_ i know. first time i try desginer :)
<lupo_> i wouldn't worry. the code is quite understandable, even if you are not a python crack and wxPython guru, you will grasp the code quite fast

<derek> um if you sent to gnue-devel@gnu.org thats not a valid address
<derek> i think its gnue-dev
<derek> http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnue-dev
<lupo_> ah yes - of course :)
<perlhead> derek: thanks, I sent it to the wrong address indeed.
<perlhead> Only different: I did send it to gnue-dev, but for some reason I put @gnue.org instead of gnu.org
<perlhead> There it goes again...
<derek> perlhead: i will attempt to get all patches applied tonight
<derek> please (i know you guys have done several times) send all patches to me at derek@gnue.org today
<derek> so i know i dont miss anything
lupo_ (~lupo@p3EE1D2AB.dip.t-dialin.net) left irc: "using sirc version 2.211+KSIRC/1.1"
<perlhead> derek: thank you for the offer.
<perlhead> However, my mail has broader implications than just applying the patches.
<perlhead> My guys have been preparing patches repeatedly, only to find that they become outdated before they get applied.
<derek> i will respond to the email, but in fairness doing your own cvs tree really hurts
<perlhead> And even if they manage to create valid recent patches for our current needs, and you manage to apply them tonight, we still have the problem of what will happen with our future patches.
<derek> you cant make changes to a ton of files
<derek> and then submit giant patches and expect quick turn times
<derek> a patch should only include code specific to the thing its fixing
<derek> and so many of the patches you sent of course were way out of date to the cvs tree as you were using a different cvs tree
<derek> a major server issue hasnt helped things
<derek> but in future small bite sized patches will get applied more quickly
<derek> this is no different than say the linux kernel
<perlhead> derek: I know the separate tree hurts. We don't like it, and I hope I made it clear in the mail. It hurts *us*.
<perlhead> The problem is that our patches didn't start being this huge.
<perlhead> They began life as simple things (save for some major functionality improvements)
<perlhead> But as time went by without them being incorporated, they accreted.
<perlhead> Most of them could have been incorporated as small fixes, only time conspired against it.
<derek> i thihk we can work this out
<derek> i hope that jcater responds
<perlhead> Let me stress this: *we want to kill our branch* *we don't like it* *we did it because we had no other choice*
<perlhead> As to the comparison with the linux kernel, you are right, it's not that different.
<perlhead> But as far as I know, major contributors to the kernel have commit privileges to their areas of activity.
<perlhead> Trust me, Vía Libre will continue to contribute to GNUe in a major way.
<derek> that is our problem
<derek> we dont have yet 'areas of activity'
<perlhead> We want GNUe to succeed as a coherent project. The success of our own project depends from it.
<derek> we have one giant cvs tree that has no discrimination
<derek> that is high on our list to break cvs into smaller modules
<derek> so we can give commit access by module and such
<perlhead> If we wait for that, hell will freeze over. You guys are overworked as it is. You don't have the *time* to the segmentation.
<perlhead> There are more important things in the queue.
<derek> then we have to continue with patches i think
<derek> we have been burned on more than one occassion doing differently
<derek> even in patches via libre has done, things were discussed in irc and everyone seemed in agreement
<derek> yet it was coded in way that was not agreed
<derek> jcater can give specifics
<derek> now certainly it was just a communication breakdown (so not criticizing coding or coding techniques)
<derek> but the idea behind patches is that stuff like that gets caught pre checkin not post checkin
paq (~paq@202.155.120.221) joined #gnuenterprise.
<perlhead> Sorry, I can't comment on that as I don't have the specifics, but I doubt the patches were coded in a way that was agreed to be *not* the right way.
<perlhead> I'm absolutely sure the intent is to do things the right way.
<derek> correct

<StyXman> suppise I have no record that math my query
<jamest> ok
<StyXman> suppise I click in the 3rd lookup
<StyXman> suppose I have a keyb with the correct labells
<StyXman> suppose I have a keyb that works
<StyXman> suppose I start writing in this 3rd entry.
<StyXman> the focus is 'there', even the 'cursor' (that '|' thingy)
<StyXman> but as you write the leters appear in the 1st (!!!) enry
<StyXman> (entry)
<jamest> ouch
<StyXman> yeap. ouch. cpouldn't find where to fic that. I'm totally *lost*
ra3vat (~ds@ics.elcom.ru) joined #gnuenterprise.
<StyXman> indeed, the focus get to the last entry a 'could' be written to. in my example, as there's no matches, it goes into 'inser' mode and writes in the first row.
<StyXman> if I click in the 5th row, I get the same. if I have 3 mattches and try to writte in tthe 5th, the 4th gets the data. and so on.

<Mr_You> oh, hmm I gots an idea
<ajmitch> uh oh...
<Grantbow> lol
<derek> um variables like $this are HIGHLY acceptable
<derek> seriously
<derek> its an 'instance' of an object
<Mr_You> I can't read that code
<Mr_You> no big deal, I like writing my own
<derek> i havent looked at the code so i cant commen t:)
<Mr_You> I've never done OOP
<Mr_You> will do that some other time
<Mr_You> I want somethin workin first ;-)
<Mr_You> wow, this country restricts the names of babies
<ajmitch> heh
<Mr_You> this guy wants his son named after OSBL
<Mr_You> germany 
<LuftHans> Mr_You: yeah, it has to have been previously used. About the only way to get new names allowed is via naturalization of foreigners. Schtupid.

Topic changed on #gnuenterprise by derek!~dneighbo@cpe-24-221-112-50.az.sprintbbd.net: Login to http://www.linuxfund.org and put your penguin pesos where your pie hole is and vote for GNUe!
<ajmitch> we need to advertise it outside of the small GNUe community
<derek> im not sure highest vote wins
<derek> i think it might be simply it helps their board decide
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> gnue is far more important than some silly game
<derek> i think so, but certainly those workign on the game dont :)
<ajmitch> and how many are working on the game?
<ajmitch> i know of one arrogant person who annoys #wopn with his advertising
