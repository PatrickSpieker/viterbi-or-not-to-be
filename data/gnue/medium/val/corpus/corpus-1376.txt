<LuftHans> tach
<Suit> Right, I am probably a clueless newbie to you all, but I am checking out GNUe and to get started fast I am getting the windows forms and designer and Sap-db. Are there any caveats with this combo or will it be fairly straight forward?
<siesel> It should be quite straight forward and easy :)
<siesel> The most difficult part is to edit the connections.conf file to setup Sap-db as your favourite db
<Suit> siesel: I take it an example will be in connections.conf?
<siesel> possibly no example for sap-db, but one for postgres etc., you just have to set "provider = sabdb"
<Suit> I have followed some discussions in the GNUe weekly digest and on slashdot about sap-db and gnue, I have come to believe that sap-db is one of the developers' favorites, so I expect it is well integrated with designer?
Nick change: SachaS -> Sacha_dinner
<siesel> almost every database which supports introspection should work well with designer
<siesel> although there are many developers which want to make sapdb as a standart, most work has be done with postgresql in the past.
<siesel> Hmmm, actually I forgot, if the sapdb driver was bundled with the windows installers for forms and designer :(
<siesel> If it doesn't work, you should ask derek (alias dneighbo). he is the sapdb specialist.
<btami> i think: not boundled with
<siesel> do you know how to append it to the python directory build with the installer?
<btami> don't know
<btami> i never used SAP-DB before
<btami> i'm using firebird on my winxp box
<btami> with kinterbasdb
<btami> both have bin versions for win32
<Suit> hmm, well, currently installing sapdb, will see what happens
<Suit> is it necessaty to install the sap webtools?
<Suit> -t+r
<Suit> Well, according to the sap manual I have to reboot, let's see

<btami> wb Suit, how goes?
<Suit> DB000: gnue.common.GConnections.AdapterNotInstalled: Driver not installed: sapdb
<Suit> :-)
<Suit> api for SAP-DB 7.x
<ajmitch> you'd need a python sapdb driver, i guess
<Suit> Just dl it from sapdb.org, checking where to copy what version
<Suit> looks like version 21 and copy both in forms and designer dirs.
<Suit> Ok, I got a login promp when choosing connect
<Suit> DB000: Exception exceptions.AttributeError: "Connection instance has no attribute '_Connection__connection'" in <method Connection.close of Connection instance at 012EF24C> ignored
<Suit> And login does not work, same username does make me connect to database using sapdb tools
<Suit> :-(
<ajmitch> how annoying
<Suit> very
<Suit> So, anyone any pointers as to where I could go looking to solve this?
<btami> what was the error msg (all) ?
<Suit> btami:  sapdb.SQLError: [-4008] [at 1] Unknown user name/password combination
<Suit> And the other I pasted earlier
<Suit> huh hold on for a moment
<Suit> Hmm, login in to db with sapdb tools an lowercase username an pw worked. Doing the same with designer not. But than uname and pw in Uppercase and it worked !
<btami> anyway, you win :)
<Suit> Hmm, wouldn't I be able to select a table for my form and add some of the fields for it?

<Suit> btami: I am not especcially hung on sap-db, atm I will try anything that works, but as I read you correctly I should go and get CVS and all deps and run it on my linux box
<siesel> Suit: you should run it on a Debian GNU/linux box :) :)
<Suit> Aaarrrggh, pleas no Debian !! :-) :-) ;-)
<btami> you can try CVS on win32 too
<Suit> I always use SuSE :-) I have installed gnue  on that one quite a while ago, ... dependency hell,
<ajmitch> debian is best tho
<Suit> hmm, I cygwin here, so I propably need that to access CVS,  guess I need python too
<Suit> ajmitch: debian is ok, suse is ok, even redhat or lycoris is OK. maybe even Debian ;-) as long as they get to be usable quickly after poppin'in the first CD on my b*** akward desktop
<btami> if you use CVS, you need wxpython and egenix-mx too

<siesel> there is a description to install gnue on suse in gnue kernel cousine #43 or #42

<wedniatnuom> jcater/jamest had an interesting problem dont know if there is a good solution
<wedniatnuom> i have table1 - department
<wedniatnuom> table2 - account number
<wedniatnuom> i then have table3 - which has deptnum, accountnum whereby its a control table to say what departments get what accounts
<wedniatnuom> so whip up a simple form
<wedniatnuom> that points to table3
<wedniatnuom> and two fields one for dept and one for acct
<wedniatnuom> both those fields are foreign key lookup (combo boxes)
<wedniatnuom> pointing back to table 1 and table 2
<psu> in effect a master-detail-master
<wedniatnuom> all that is a dream no problem
<wedniatnuom> psu : no master detail
<wedniatnuom> just normal table that has fk support
<wedniatnuom> the kicker is that in table 2
<wedniatnuom> the account table
<wedniatnuom> there is a column 'account type'
<wedniatnuom> turns out that account is not informative enough they want to know on that form what hte account type is
<wedniatnuom> so i dropped a table 4 (acct type)
<wedniatnuom> and made it a slave to the account table (beign used for lu)
<wedniatnuom> and the form craps itself hard
<wedniatnuom> i can understand why (as this is an odd way of doing things
<wedniatnuom> so the question is 
<wedniatnuom> a. is there a better way to do this
<wedniatnuom> b. do we plan on supporting this if we deem there isnt a better way

<chillywilly> but that makes no sense to me as copyright and trademark are different issues all together...I don't see how letting someone freely modify and redistribute the code effects trademark/branding
<chillywilly> no one else can come along and use your trademarked name even if they have all your code
<chillywilly> I suppose it could be difficult trying to work with/use code from some project/people who have serious philosophical differences

<wedniatnuom> chilly its because people are ignorant in understanding law
<wedniatnuom> 4suite probably thought they were protecting their 'intellectual property' (sic)
<chillywilly> yep
<wedniatnuom> you are 100% correct that trademark law and copyright law are two different things
<chillywilly> I commented on how stupid it is that lawyers lump it all into "IP"
<wedniatnuom> i could basically ASSIGN copyright to you on something
<wedniatnuom> but if i have it trademarked you couldnt use the name
<chillywilly> exactly
<wedniatnuom> and patent the receipe
<chillywilly> so what's the point in hacing a n advertising clase in a software license?
<chillywilly> er, having
<chillywilly> clause
<wedniatnuom> and then turn around and give you the receipe and exlcude the patent
<wedniatnuom> and you could make the same lemonade and call it chillys ice code lemonade
<wedniatnuom> sigh this irc software sucks
<chillywilly> HEH
<wedniatnuom> it hacked most of what i siad
<chillywilly> can you ssh into a box?
<wedniatnuom> um yeah
<wedniatnuom> i just like to use crappy irc clients so i can comlain about them 
<chillywilly> HEH
