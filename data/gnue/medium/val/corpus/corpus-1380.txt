<ajmitch> hi siesel
<siesel> hi ajmitch, hi all 
<chillywilly> hey jan
<siesel> hi chillywilly
<Remosi> the FSF wanted a contact manager program written in GnuE didn't they?
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> bbl :)
<Remosi> did anything come of that?
<chillywilly> dunno, that's da masta's domain
<Remosi> are there any production quality apps for GNUe yet?
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> not yet
<chillywilly> ppl have various 2-tier systems in place
<chillywilly> like jcater and jamest do, iirc
<chillywilly> no real apps/packages though
<chillywilly> you can use our nice accounting system or anything like that
<chillywilly> er, can't
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> no place to enter invoices yet ;)
<Remosi> heh
<Remosi> trying to find a list of things of why people would want a Linux server in their small business :)
<chillywilly> freedom ;)
<chillywilly> their systems don't drop off like flies
<chillywilly> their admins are happier ;)
<Remosi> heh
<Remosi> yeah, I know those ones
<Remosi> just trying to think of practical apps
<siesel> yes, exactly.
Action: chillywilly jst went through hell last night fixing mom's winblows for her
<chillywilly> admining winders is like kicking yourself in the nuts
<siesel> there is nothing to administrate, you just can install it and reinstall it and reinstall it :(
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> problem it is having
<chillywilly> it hangs on power save mode
<chillywilly> it wa set t just turn off the monitor
<chillywilly> it still doesn't wake up
<chillywilly> so I turned it off
<chillywilly> bt that's not what took me all night
<chillywilly> I took the whole thing apart and cleaned it good
<siesel> Remosi: there is an version of a kind of contact manager in forms/samples/track
<chillywilly> plled everything out of the case except the mobo
<chillywilly> man it was dirty
<siesel> Yea, one reason to use water cooling, is to have a CLEAN case :)
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> it helps when you overclock it ;)
Action: chillywilly just used a vacuum with a hose attachment
<siesel> btw. do you know how to check which package was updated in debian/unstable between today and yesterday?
<chillywilly> apt-get update; apt-get [dist-]upgrade ;)
<chillywilly> with th one option turned on
<chillywilly> or your apt.conf configured properly
<chillywilly> ;)
<siesel> I mean without using apt or dselect 
<chillywilly> I know
<chillywilly> I was being a smart ass
<chillywilly> I dunno I don't worry about it
<chillywilly> I just ask the apt bot and see if there's anything broke
<chillywilly>  /j #debian
<chillywilly>  /msg apt news #debian
<chillywilly> news read 1
<chillywilly> news read 2
<chillywilly> news read ...
<chillywilly> if all is well I upgrade
<siesel> I just would like to know if libwxgtk2.2-python is updated soon. 
<chillywilly> ah yea
<chillywilly> well lemme see
<chillywilly> I jst upgraded a while ago
<chillywilly> btw, incoming.debian.org has stff waiting to go into the archive
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> Sorry, but the following packages have unmet dependencies:
<chillywilly>   libwxgtk2.2-python: Depends: python (< 2.2) but 2.2.1-10 is to be installed
<chillywilly> E: Sorry, broken packages
<chillywilly> this blows
<chillywilly> no forms
<chillywilly> :(
<siesel> yes, since monday, I have to live with dpkg -i --force-depends libwxgtk2.2-python.deb :(
<chillywilly> does it work?
<chillywilly> if so thenI wouldn't sweat it
<chillywilly> it sucks but you can live with it
<chillywilly> siesel: wasn't it you that mention PLR and gave me a link to an article about it?
<chillywilly> mentioned PLY that is
<chillywilly> ttp://www.linuxgazette.com/issue79/divakaran.html
<chillywilly> that one
<chillywilly> er, http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue79/divakaran.html
<siesel> yep, 
<chillywilly> scky thing is yu have to read the input in as a big string to pass in, it won't take streamable objects like sockets or files
<chillywilly> it doesn't do LALR either
<chillywilly> but it seems easier to use
<chillywilly> LALR(1) that is
<chillywilly> does SLR parsing
<chillywilly> crud, I need to go to bed
<chillywilly> night siesel
<chillywilly> nigt all

<terr> Is the the developers group or the users group?
<terr> Anyone?
<Sacha_away> hi terr
<Sacha_away> some are developpers here. (me not :)
<terr> Still here.
<terr> I was reading up on vide.  Oh - so much to learn.
<terr> Sacha - I read the docs on GNUe forms.  I'm familiar with Oracle SQL*FORMS and PLSQL.  When I read the GNUe forms docs it looks as if some things are similar.

<ra3vat> terrell: hi
<Sacha_away> terrell yes.
<Sacha_away> terrell: i install gnue (including common, forms and designer) two nights ago. give it a try, maybe
<terrell> did you get any of the questions I was trying to ask?  My system disconnected
<ra3vat> terrell: main forms developers jamest and jcater also users (former?) of Oracle Forms
<terrell> sacha - I jsut want to ask how one specific thing is handled - if it is nadles that is.
<Sacha_away> the only question i got: if oracles sql*forms and plsql is similar to gnue forms. i dont know oracles form.
<Sacha_away> terrell: ra3vat is your man :)

<terr> arrgh
<terr> In block2 I think the variables will correspond to a single sepcific record at any point in time. right?
<terr> If so - then is there some way that trigger code can fetch a value  from the "previous" reocrd for block2 or the "next" record?
<terr> OR can more than one record be referenced by block2 and if so how are the block.variables mapped into the database records?
<ra3vat> what is block2?
<ra3vat> what are you trying to do?
<terr> just a block that hold variables corresponding to a table in the databse where multiple entries exist.
<terr> well say I had line items in an invoice with a line# that is stored - not the real example but easy to understand.
<terr> when block2 is on say line item#4 I want to know if the values in lines other than 4 can be referenced
<terr> In this case block1 woudl hold the header infor for the invoice incl an invoice# while block2 corresponds to all the line items.  One can have several line items on any given invoice of couirse
<ra3vat> trying to fing you something useful
<terr> ra - hey thanks.  
<terr> I coun't see any reference in the syntax in the docs that would lead me to beleive that a variable in block2 can refer to other than a single record from table2.
<terr> Something whipped by
