<derek> hi
<derek> dang netsplit
Action: psu likes netsplits 
<psu> well, sorta
<psu> I look at a day's log and see it says 95k & get depressed 
<ajmitch> but 90k is from netsplits?
<psu> & cheer up
<psu> ;)
Action: psu got a flyer for LinuxExpoUK2002 
<psu> will see if I can go
<psu> Far too late to get a GNUe stall
<psu> & I'm not sure they have a ".org pavillion"-type area anyway
<psu> but could still be interesting
<ajmitch> hmm

<psu> "The UK's only location for Enterprise Linux computing"
<ajmitch> hi reinhard
<reinhard> good morning
<reinhard> offtopic question
<reinhard> can anybody explain in a few words the difference between mono and dotgnu?
<ajmitch> i can try
<ajmitch> mono is looking for mainly .NET framework compatibility, with the associated tools
<ajmitch> DotGNU looks to include that stuff, but to have a more genereic webservices platform with other tools, as well as supplying some webservices
<psu> so sorta dotgnu is like "GNU's not .NET", whereas mono is more like lindows?
<ajmitch> the .NET-compatible stuff is getting the main focus in DotGNU at the moment, but there is work underway that's not related to that stuff, like authentication & VRS
<ajmitch> psu: yeah
<ajmitch> DotGNU will be using the higher-level mono stuff where appropriate, no point redoing the wheel for everything :)
<ajmitch> hmm, that's the second time in 1/2 an hour that i've answered the mono vs dotgnu question ;)
<psu> ajmitch: time for an X-chat macro? ;)
<ajmitch> hehe
<reinhard> ajmitch: thanks
<reinhard> ajmitch: seriously i would have expected an answer to this question somewhere on dotgnu.org but didn't find it
<ajmitch> heh, i'll see if i can get someting added
<derek> reinhard: that would break FSF norm of making things difficult
<derek> you make things too clear and people might try to help and that becomes more work than its worth ;)
<derek> much better to make barrier to entry high enough that only the most elite participate ;)
<ajmitch> like GNUe? ;)
<ajmitch> i think that the GNUe website is too clear on things
<psu> I can rot13 the whole site if that would help ;-)
<ajmitch> double-rot13
<psu> double rot13 = clear text?
<ajmitch> gotta be extra careful!
<ajmitch> yeah ;)
<derek> we have a website?
<ajmitch> hmm why is bayonne under tools yet dcl under packages?
<ajmitch> derek: yeah, the one with the ugly colours :)
<derek> thats outta control, next thing you know some nutty englisman will go and read these logs and post summaries to the internet
<ajmitch> don't want to have that happening
<dtm> derek: what's up
<derek> picking my nose
<ajmitch> hi dtm
<derek> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/tools.php
<ajmitch> yes?
<derek> ajmitch: thats where bayonne is
<derek> werent you asking?
Action: derek is horribly delayed in response :)
<ajmitch> derek: no
<ajmitch> i was asking why DCL was not listed on that page, yet bayonne is
<psu> 'cause DCL is a package, not a tool 
<ajmitch> how so? :)
<psu> Fine shades of distinction, I know
<ajmitch> grr, something is broken here
<ajmitch> DB000:   File "/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/MySQLdb/connections.py", line 115, in __init__

<derek> jas;kldfjsa;lkj;klasdfj
<derek> aljd;kfjas;lkdfj
<derek> i hate mysql driver
<derek> bastards can never decide how they want to do thigns :)
<psu> The reason I list DCL as a package is that, although at the moment, it is in effect a package that includes its own tools
<ajmitch> i don't think it's the driver's fault
Action: derek doesnt have mysql anymore to test
<derek> ajmitch: in this case its not
<derek> psu: im with you
<derek> dcl is a package
<psu> eventually it should become a "normal" package using the main GNUe tools
<psu> w/ the PHP front end as an option
<derek> i.e. it is an producitity application w/o doing anything
<derek> bayonne is a tool
<derek> installing bayonne doesnt do anything useful for you
<derek> until you write applications with it
<ajmitch> ok
<derek> much like forms and such
<ajmitch> ok, psycopg driver just worked with dcl forms
<ajmitch> good thing that gtk2 driver was committed, i broke my wxpython installation
<derek> rofl
<derek> does it look nice the gtk2 one?
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise ("work time...").
<derek> and what did you ahve to do?
<derek> i.e. im interested in trying gtk2 but nervous
<derek> can i run gtk2 and gtk at same time
<ajmitch> well i've got all gnome 2 stuff compiled with garnome, installed into ~/garnome
<ajmitch> yes, it's designed to work together
<ajmitch> the sid wxpython package only compiled for python 2.1, 2.2 is default now
<derek> i dont compile
<derek> i quit a while back
<derek> 12 step program and all 
<derek> it really got me cured
<ajmitch> hehe
Action: ajmitch will bbiab
<derek> 1. We admitted we were powerless over compiling - that our computer systems had become unmanageable.
<derek> 2. Came to believe that a packaging system greater than compiling could restore us to sanity.
<derek> 3. Made a decision to turn our makefiles and our compilers over to the care of Debian as we understood it.
<derek> 4. Made a searching and fearless inventory of apt-cache.
<derek> 5. Admitted to #gnuenterprise, to ourselves the exact nature of our compiling.
<derek> 6. Were entirely ready to have Debian remove all these source on our computer systems.
<derek> 7. Humbly asked Debian to remove our makefiles.
<derek> 8. Made a list of all applications we had compiled, and became willing to use packages for them all.
<derek> 9. Made direct packages for such applications wherever packages didnt exit, except when to do so would produce non free packages.
<derek> 10. Continued to use packages and when we didnt promptly admitted it.
<derek> 11. Sought through apt-get and dpkg to improve our computer systems with Debian as we understood it, asking only for knowledge of Debian's package for us and the power to install them.
<derek> 12. Having had a philosophical awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to compiler freaks and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

<SachaS> their own syntax.
<ajmitch> i don't know too much about that, perhaps look at some of the sample forms
<SachaS> yep.
<SachaS> ajmitch: i have a question about cvs: - i download the source from cvs (cvs update) and install it each time. how does the other way work, with the cvs scripts? 
<ajmitch> what cvs scripts?
<SachaS> i "cvs updated" a couple day ago and run the setup scripts in common, forms and designer
<ajmitch> ah
<ajmitch> ./setup-cvs.py is easier
<SachaS> there is another way siesel told me.
<ajmitch> much easier, in fact :)
<SachaS> does setup-cvs.py download the source code as well?
<ajmitch> no
<SachaS> no?
<ajmitch> cvs update grabs the source
<ajmitch> you've got to have source for it to install
<SachaS> ok. what does setup-cvs?
<ajmitch> setup-cvs.py makes scripts that let you use the cvs copy of gnue
<SachaS> o
<ajmitch> and sets up the conf dir
<SachaS> ok. the cvs copy of gnue.
<SachaS> what is the cvs copy of gnue?
Action: ajmitch shoots SachaS
<SachaS> please donts shoot.
<ajmitch> the cvs copy is the source that you're playing with :)
<ajmitch> the directory in which you do cvs update
<SachaS> ok. so i want to get the latest source code. i do a cvs update then i go into common, forms and designer and do a setup in each. thats a way to get up-to-date. right?
<ajmitch> it's an ugly way of doing it
<SachaS> but a way, right?
<ajmitch> i do cvs update, then just run setup-cvs.py
<ajmitch> yes, it is one way
<SachaS> ok.

<StyXman> uh, yes, that happens. I never found why

<chillywilly> hi folks
Action: chillywilly prefers XFS filesystem
<chillywilly> but you gotta patch your kernel ;)
<jcater> chillywilly: ya, and how many of those do you run in production? ;)
<chillywilly> 1
<chillywilly> my server is damn productive
<chillywilly> XFS has been around for a long time and used extensively by SGI
<jcater> err
<jcater> that's misleading
<chillywilly> you know they do those hard core graohics type things
<chillywilly> graphics
<jcater> JFS has been used by IBM for ages as well
<jcater> :)
<jcater> but not under linux
<chillywilly> why should that matter?
Action: jcater guesses IBM's AIX kernel is a different code base than Linux's
<jcater> and SGI's UNIX OS was a separate code base than Linux
<chillywilly> ok, and have you had problems with GNU/Linux's scalability?
<chillywilly> why would IBM put it on mainframes if it sucked?
<jcater> wtf are you talking about?
<jcater> I'm talking about just because a file system is being ported from another OS that doesn't mean it's inherently stable on Linux
<jcater> just because it was stable on that other OS
Action: jcater was not talking anything about stability
<jcater> although
<jcater> since you bring it up
<jcater> don't think for a second that IBM is converting it's mainframes from AIX to linux
<jcater> they are offering a linux "module" (or whatever they call it) 
<jcater> to people who need it
<jcater> there's a big difference
<Mr_You> IIRC, the mainframes run OS/390
<Mr_You> not AIX
<chillywilly> if it is relatively the same code for the filesystem them obviously it comes down to the underlying filesystem interfaces/code (the VFS in Linux's case)
<jcater> and that in know way knocks linux
<jcater> Mr_You: true dat
Action: jcater hasn't had all my caffeine yet
<Mr_You> Linux is the answer to a dying OS/390
<jcater> IBM isn't replacing OS/390
<jcater> linux isn't a mainframe OS
<Mr_You> mainframes are dying, so is OS/390
<chillywilly> they are running virtual Linux's on top of it, why would thye do such a crazy thing?
<Mr_You> its not a mainframe OS right,  but running Linux on a mainframe extends its life
<Mr_You> chillywilly: cause thats the best way they could get it working?
<chillywilly> yea, but I mean what's the point of doing that?
<Mr_You> to run non-OS/390 apps I assume, to get your monies worth from the hardware/investment
<Mr_You> to extend the life of OS/390/IBM mainframes.. ie. enabling more (new) applications to run on these dying geezers
<chillywilly> ok, but doe shtis say anything about Linux's scalability?
<chillywilly> er, does this
<chillywilly> or am I smoking good crackk?
Action: chillywilly takes a hit on the crack pipe
Action: chillywilly passes it around
<Mr_You> well.. linux is multiplatform..
<chillywilly> has anyone seen this hyper threading technology that they are hacking into the Linux kernel?
<Mr_You> its scalable to some extent
<chillywilly> er, read about it

<Mr_You> hmm newsforge is down for me
<der_edoc> chilly dont i have to format it?
<jcater> StyXman: that's still up for debate
<chillywilly> create a filesystem on there yes
<Mr_You> where is this GNUe IRC client?
Action: chillywilly was going to write an IRC rpc driver
<Mr_You> anyone?
<jcater> Mr_You: bitchx | gnue-forms
<jcater> ?
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> did you not read what I be typing?
<chillywilly> niggie
<chillywilly> we have no IRC client
<Mr_You> I've seen users with "GNU Enterprise  User" as their realname.
<Mr_You> IRCNAME
<chillywilly> they changes it to be that way then
<chillywilly> changed
<chillywilly> with some client
<Mr_You> username "www-data".. sure looks like a web-based IRC client
<chillywilly> ssssh
<Mr_You> was thinking someone set somethin up
<chillywilly> he's iding out
<chillywilly> he's using a CGI based one
<chillywilly> do a /ctcp version once

<Mr_You> arrgghh wtf is broke with DNS?!?
<chillywilly> ?
<chillywilly> whose dns?
<Mr_You> zonealarm is confused
<chillywilly> isn't that a winblows firewall software?
<stbain> yes
Action: chillywilly is ashamed he knows that
<Mr_You> pretty neat
<StyXman> jcater: uh, what did you understood by 'names'? I meant objectnames, as in the 'name' attribute.
<jcater> StyXman: yes
<Mr_You> bout time someone wrote a decent IRC client
<Mr_You> using CGI
<StyXman> I realized that my question was very ambiguos...
<StyXman> what are the parameters used for in reports?
<chillywilly> Mr_You der_edoc doesn;t think it is decent....he was bitcing baout it the other day
<chillywilly> about
<jcater> StyXman: well, reports can use them 2 ways
<jcater> 1) in the conditions for datasources
<Mr_You> undernet has a java app, I think, which is pretty cool
<jcater> so you can run gnue-reports myreports begindate=09/02/02 enddate=09/03/02
<chillywilly> I ain't doing sheeit at work!?!?!?!!!
<jcater> 2) the conditions can just appear in the output of reports
<chillywilly> woooooo
<jcater> i.e., 
<jcater> gnue-reports myreports custom_title="My Sales Report"
<jcater> I would foresee forms using it similarly
<StyXman> uh, I'll try to guess how does it do it.
<jcater> i.e., it could use them in datasources to limit a query
<jcater> or it could be values that trigger code could access
<StyXman> yes, it's what we need.
<jcater> datasources inherently support parameters
<jcater> but only reports currently passes them
<jcater> it should be trivial to get forms to
<jcater> it just hasn't happened yet
<StyXman> yes, that one too. indeed, we're thinking about a kind of 'app' that would integrate a lot of forms into one single app.
<StyXman> in a different way that navigator does. it would also handle app config and, more specifically, users and roles.

<der_edoc> rather than cowboy up your own, its better to discuss
<der_edoc> i.e. navigator is supposed to handle at somepoint role based access control to things
<der_edoc> and also tools are discussed to do things like manage connections.conf and such
<psu> Actually, if connections.conf was XML, we could use DEsigner to edit it ;-)
<psu> then it really would be "the emacs of GNUe"...

Chipaca (~john@200.59.86.80) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Chipaca> hi all
<siesel> hi ariel_, I'm here
<StyXman> hi Chipaca 
<siesel> hi Chipaca
<ariel_> siesel: i'm reviewing the code in _featuretest and i'm asking
<ariel_> why the field type in geas_meta_object is varchar
<ariel_> and not another table/object such as 'geas_meta_type'?
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<ariel_> then type in geas_meta_object would be an int referring, as foreign key, the oid of geas_meta_type. 
<ariel_> vantages: 
<ariel_> 1) less waste of space.
<ariel_> 2) only 'known' types can be inserted
<ariel_> 3) specific info on the type can be stored in other fields of geas_meta_type, for example if type is 'function' the language or wathsoever
<siesel> The idea was to only use one table at the beginning, and split it up into multiple tables later.
<ariel_> another question:
<siesel> ok
<ariel_> now geas_meta_object is filled 'by hand' 
<siesel> btw. derek: you can use gtk and gtk2 together without problems on debian/unstable.
<siesel> just uncomment the two lines in the uidriver to "require gtk2"
<ariel_> i guess tomorrow a parser will do the job, but which language will be used? gsd, idl, odl, godl or what?
stbain (~stbain@66.207.65.76) left irc: "Ni!"
<psu> since chillywilly isn't here, I guess it falls to me to say "ODMG"
<siesel> there will be many parsers which can fill the internal structures
<siesel> hehe :)
Action: jcater thwaps psu
<der_edoc> psu  i think that means odl
<der_edoc> can i take step back and say can geas not focus on objects until it can get basics done?
Action: psu is just trying to fill up his GNUe Buzzword Bingo card
<der_edoc> thats the problem
<der_edoc> geas always seems to want to play buzzword bingo
<der_edoc> instead of focusing on just working :)
<siesel> since I 'm not 100% conviced that odl/odmg 3.0 ... is the best choice for internal structures etc. I would prefer a own format first. I think using .gsd as a start would be ok. 
<siesel> we can later add all that ODMG features to appserver and to the godl / odl parsers
ra3vat_ (~ds@ics.elcom.ru) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> The main drawback of odl IMHO is that code and definitions are seperated. I would like to have a file format which combines both
<siesel> like putting kind of <trigger> or <method> sections in a extended .gsd file

<ariel_> separation of code and definitions is not a bad thing, it improves reusability
<ariel_> you can improve the code for a single method without reloading/recompiling the whole thing
Chipaca (~john@200.59.86.80) left irc: "ircII EPIC4-1.0.1 -- Are we there yet?"
<siesel> I don't think, that putting code and definition together is a must, but it makes things much easier.
<siesel> btw. appserver could provide a "load new code into function X" method, which solves that problem.
<siesel> I just want to program like in f.e. python and not in the way like C, where I always have to change two file (.h, .c) if I modify the interfaces
<ariel_> what about the old 'gcd'
<siesel> I've started writing a parser for it, but there seems to be a heaps of reasons not to use 'gcd', I just don't remeber :)
chillywilly (danielb@mke-24-167-202-50.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> hi Daniel
<chillywilly> ello
<ariel_> can i improve gcdparser.py just to convert all the Neil's work into gsd?
<siesel> yes, that should be possible. 
<siesel> Not only possible, that would be great :)
Action: chillywilly has been reading the bison manual
<chillywilly> gcd schmecd
<ariel_> i will do, but since is a 'use and throw' job may be i will use old geas code to do it (in c) since that parser is more complete
<ariel_> what we need is only the output, i.e the gsd's
<chillywilly> can anyone reach http://www.dotster.com?
<Mr_You> use
<Mr_You> yes
<chillywilly> blah I hate my ISP
<psu> works for me - redirects to web.dotster.com
<siesel> ariel_: yes, it would be much easier to use geas to build up its db structure and then use designer to create a gsd out of it
Action: ariel_ is away: sleep
<siesel> ariel: night
<chillywilly> fucking shit
<chillywilly> that's it I am going to kick their a$$
<chillywilly> ;)
<ariel_> not sure it will work, because 'type' in gcd doesn't create classes but just reusable definitions
<ariel_> anyway i' m really tired, later...
<siesel> the_edoc: what do you think about a special dbdriver to edit the connections.conf in gnue-forms
<StyXman> why GRSources.prepare is marked as 'please go bye bye'? 
<jcater> because it will go away at some point
<jcater> :)
<siesel> jcater: what do you think about using forms itself to edit its own config files?
<jcater> I'd thought about that before
<chillywilly> anyone know ff hand the name of the website (OASIS group) that has the DTD and such for dcbook, etc.
Action: jcater even considered making IMAP and POP3 dbdrivers for gnue-common
<jcater> but then the more I thought about it
<chillywilly> I don't think I could ever reach their website either
<jcater> the more I thought that might be hellacious to maintain
<jcater> for the little benefit derived
<siesel> i.e. you think that writing a seperate app, or config dialog to do this is easier?
<chillywilly> www.oasis-open.org
<jcater> I think a popup dialog in Designer to do this may be best
<jcater> I'm honestly not sure
<jcater> I'm torn in several directions
<der_edoc> i think making a python app to do it is fine

<jcater> wtf have you been using dotNet prior to a month a go
<StyXman> jcater: I just can't follow the code. how does exactly reports pass parameters to the datasoures?
<nickr> what is a Dot, exactly?
<nickr> some sort of new street drug?
<nickr> spank? horse? the snake?
<jcater> Reports has a GRParameter class
<jcater> that subclasses common's GParameter
<jcater> so it all happens automatically
<jcater> we just need some code in the gfclient.py code
<jcater> that takes the parameters from the command lines

<ajmitch> it's broken

<chillywilly> blah
<ajmitch> dunno
<chillywilly> well that's the only evidence I have of brokenness
<ajmitch> check that you don't have broken ECN settings
<chillywilly> what's that? ;)
<ajmitch> cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn
<chillywilly> alrighty
<ajmitch> it used to be a prblem
<chillywilly> frell:~# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn
<chillywilly> 1
<ajmitch> ahah
<ajmitch> set that to 0, and retry
<sshack> ajmitch: He can't have "broken" ecn settings.
<ajmitch> sshack: broken for accessing these sites ;)
<sshack> ajmitch: Someone between him and the remote host can have a broken router that doesn't know how to handle ecn.
<chillywilly> wtf is ECN anyway
<sshack> ajmitch: That's not his problem though, it's theirs. 
<ajmitch> still amounts to brokenness somewhere
<sshack> chillywilly: Explicit congestion notification.
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> I think there's a bnd link along the way
<sshack> What does a traceroute say?
<StyXman> chillywilly: mb you better use mtr
<sshack> Okay, question. Are the re any subprojects in gnue that need an extra developer?
<ajmitch> all of them
<ajmitch> :)
<chillywilly> frell:~# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn
<chillywilly> 0
<StyXman> yes, I saw the part where sys.argv convers into self.PARAMETERS or the like an then they're copied all over the code till they become GRParameters...
<sshack> Which one most needs an extra developer?
<StyXman> you say that GDataSources will look for them and use them if found?
<ajmitch> hmm, appserver?
<StyXman> (those were for jcater)
<chillywilly> sshack: traceroute dies after so many hops
<chillywilly> spits out lines like
<chillywilly>  15 * * *
<chillywilly> etc.
<sshack> chillywilly: There you are then.
<chillywilly> yep
<chillywilly> :)
<ajmitch> i dunno...
<chillywilly> someone shit is fbarred
<ajmitch> you can ping the box
<chillywilly> yes I can ping it
<sshack> ajmitch: I shall look into appserver then.
<ajmitch> i get a large number of no replies
<ajmitch> yet i can load the page
<ajmitch> chillywilly: have you retried yet?
<StyXman> chillywilly: they may be dropping echo requests... our uni does that
<chillywilly> not yet
<chillywilly> echo is a ping right?
<sshack> chillywilly: Yes.
<ajmitch> icmp & udp
<StyXman> chillywilly: yeap
<sshack> ICMP echo == ping.
<chillywilly> pign works though
<ajmitch> traceroute apparantly uses udp echo by default
<StyXman> chillywilly: that's why: you better use mtr
<chillywilly> haha
<chillywilly> that worked ajmitch
<ajmitch> hmm, what a guess :)
<chillywilly> so what's the issue with that?
<chillywilly> and how can I make sure it is always disabled?
<ajmitch> it's a kernel option, can probably be set elsewhere in debian
<chillywilly> so I get notified of ECN and then it can't connect or what?
Action: ajmitch larts chillywilly with the rtfm stick ;)
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<chillywilly> there is no damn manual ;)
<ajmitch> i'm sure i saw it in the kernel configuration somewhere...
<chillywilly> actally where could I look? run the frelling kernek config program and read the help?
<ajmitch> dunno
<chillywilly> do you know how it works?
<ajmitch> no, if i did i wouldn't be telling you to look at google
<chillywilly> where did you hear about that issue?
<chillywilly> perhaps there's a fe more lists I need to subscribe to or something
<ajmitch> a year or so ago

<LuftHans> I figure we can get Carl to use something else, but it's one of the few business apps things for which I could have input.
<LuftHans> BTW, if we get NOLA working under similar circumstances I can probably get that CPA to start using it :).
<derek> im not concerned per say with what carl uses :) (though i would like to see him preserve his freedom)
<derek> but AZOTO should really practice what they preach :)
<chillywilly> what/who is azoto?
<derek> AriZona evil word Technology Orginzation ;)
<chillywilly> they preach Free Software?
<LuftHans> ariel zenon offers technology OOpisms
<LuftHans> if you can provide the trillions of dollars we'd need to do Free Hardware, we'll do it. Until then it's Free Software and Open Technology :)
<LuftHans> derek: I didn't say that's what AZOTO will be using, did I?
<LuftHans> short term, we might, but I intended not to indicate that
<derek> LuftHans: i read half an email out of 30 with that subject
<derek> i just saw (the cpa uses it)
<derek> and so figured you were talking about azoto
<derek> i think 'kimi' said something about using it
<LuftHans> currently there aren't any Free Software packages, so we'll have to use a non-free package until one is
<LuftHans> that or just not track accounting stuff, which is what we currently do
<derek> paper/pencil
<derek> or large marker ;
<derek> )
<LuftHans> derek: we need a tool kimi can use

<esands> hey
<chillywilly> ho
<chillywilly> heeeeey
<chillywilly> hooooo
<chillywilly> heeeeey
[22:43] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<chillywilly> hooooo
<esands> sounding like a house, Mr Ed.
<chillywilly> it's mr chillywilly to you ;)
<ajmitch> hi esands, 
<esands> hey
<ajmitch> ltns
<chillywilly> derek: when you up homey?
<esands> yeah, been busy. Then my desktop had issues - both a faulty new PSU and case 
<chillywilly> when, when wheeeen!
<chillywilly> damn these packages 
<chillywilly> damn them all to hell
<esands> Had a go with the cvs version of gnucash and the new business conponents.  Now I'm fiddling around with acclite to see what thats like.
<ajmitch> ok
<esands> how is acclite at the moment?  
<derek> chillywilly: 9:15 i think
<derek> esands: its going
<derek> esands: what did you think of the gnucash stuff
Action: derek is curious, i have considered reviewing but have been too busy
<esands> I can send you the debs if you wish.  Although I need to get my desktop going first. 
Action: esands considers ...
<esands> I think the business part of gnucash is functional
<derek> um hmm
<derek> i suppose if you have them it might be worth looking at
<esands> It has promising and is usable
<esands> However, if you've used gnucash before you'll know when I says its very manual.
<esands> Still that's probably because Derek (the guy developing it) is designed it so far mostly for his own use
<chillywilly> derek: you need to school the WOPN boyz on Free Software ;)
<derek> esands: to me its nothing more than a toy, until it reads/writes to SQL database
<derek> i.e. flatfiles are just not suitable for business (imho)
<esands> I figure its current target is home size businesses  
<derek> to me its a quickbooks replacement (or sounds like)
<derek> which there is a market for, but not market persay that gnue is going after
<esands> I agree for most companys. However I've used it for my personal company for a while.  That said my personal company is very small, and I must admit in the last 6 months I've had difficults using it effective. 
<esands> It does have a sql feature though.  Unfortunately its out of date, and currently doesn;t work with the cvs version.
<esands> Definitely gnue and gnucash target different markets.  The big different though between the two products is that gnucash is stable having reached MILESTONE 1. 
<esands> Gnue is still work in progress. Useful no doubt, but still needing further work.  
<derek> we have really hit past our milestone one
<derek> as our first milestones were for the framework
<derek> not the applications
<derek> and soon now, we will enter first phase of application development
<derek> expect working goodies within the month
<derek> and kick butt goodies within 6 months
<esands> My personally experience between the two so far: I've used gnucash (although only tested the business component side of things) and I've _tried_ to use (unsucessfully) gnue for a couple spreadsheet replacement needs I have
<chillywilly> derek: you ready?!?
<derek> ?
<esands> Sure, you know what I mean by MILESTONE though. I a sense gnucash is a finished/sellable product at the moment. Gnue is quite there yet.
<chillywilly> you're next dewd
<chillywilly> interview time
<chillywilly> ;)
<derek> hmm odd i have sold it to a few customers last month alone
<derek> there is this fixation that 'shrinkwrap' means good and complete
<derek> oh well different markets i suppose
<LuftHans> derek: when he asks you to moo respond with gnu: :)
<chillywilly> LuftHans: :)
<chillywilly> I like that idea
<LuftHans> or even just gnu
<chillywilly> gnooooooooo!
<sshack> Good evening all.
<chillywilly> derek: guh-noooooo!
<derek> gary guh noooooooooooooo
<esands> Sure, but you are a core developer. Consider the part-developer who spends a lot of time doing business stuff (ie. me ;). I'm ready to do some work (hell I've compiled gnucash cvs to for myself) but I don't have a lot of time to spend trying to get things going. Or at least that's been my experience so far with gnue.  Of course since its a FS/OSS type project I've missed much in the last three months.  Things are probably different aga
Action: derek is not quite sure what to expect
<chillywilly> hehe
<esands> Hm
<esands> Something I can use. ;)
Action: chillywilly feels confident in derek's ability to articulate all that is gnu(e)
<ajmitch> have jcater & jamest been hiding lately, or just busy?
<derek> esands: what distro are you running?
<derek> ajmitch: busy
Action: chillywilly slaps jcater around
<esands> debian of course. 8)
<derek> esands: on a BLANK debian install gnue takes no longer than say 20 minutes to install (including postgres)
<chillywilly> :)
<derek> on redhat/mandrake then yes its hell, but i cant help crappy packaging ;)
<esands> sure, but the lack of documentation make it tricky to use.  Although I haven't checked the document in the last couple months.
<derek> yes docs are not quite there
<esands> I use the cvs version away.
<derek> problem is its a framework
<derek> not an application
<esands> Sure
<derek> so making docs is difficult
<LuftHans> esands: ask in here and you can get it working
<derek> as there is a certain amount of given one needs to know
<esands> but even framework needs docs, otherwise its difficult for outsiders to use.  Of course its a moving target at the moment.
<sshack> derek: Not entirely. Depends who your documentation is targeted towards.
<derek> until we get a real users manual
<derek> esands: i agree 1000%
<derek> to both comments
<sshack> api level documentation for developers using the framework is more difficult than developer level docs.
<derek> just docs for a framework (that covers all users) is a HUGE task
<derek> and we dont want our developers doing it
<derek> and we havent had volunteers :)
<esands> sshack: Its the most important though, otherwise its difficult to build a community interest in USE, not development
<esands> anyway, these are just comments for my personal experience so far.
<derek> yes i agree
<derek> we are selfish as of late
<esands> s/for/from/
<derek> we have personal needs for gnue
<derek> and so we are concentrating on the tools and our needs
<derek> we would love someone to help with docs
<esands> itches too scratch are the reason projects like this exist.  Wouldn't be fun for you to do it otherwise
<derek> as LuftHans said we are more than willing to help via irc
<sshack> derek: Why not document everything once a question or problem has arisen?
<derek> yeah
<derek> sshack: we try to
<derek> its a big job
<sshack> It is.
<derek> its on my list to finish a tutorial
<sshack> But once you start doing it, it starts to become natural.
<derek> but i am swamped have real clients need gnue applications
<sshack> ahh.
<esands> You guys probably need something like a wiki/fom.  Make document in the first instance a communitity task
Action: LuftHans plans on helping with the docs probs once he gets a couple of projects done and can move on to gnue
<derek> no wiki's suck
<esands> 8P.
<derek> actually wiki's are good for informal documentation
<derek> and throwing ideas around
<derek> but i dont think they shoudl be a documentation substitution
<esands> TWiki is pretty cool.  Of course I'm bais.  
<sshack> wiki's are perfect for informal stuff.
<LuftHans> docs with room for comments on the end are better, they're semi-wiki
<sshack> but you don't want to have to search through a wiki to find an answer to your problems.
<derek> the biggest problem you will find is we are business guys that know how to code
<esands> I think though at the moment you don't really have any formal document. Something that's easy keep up to date is more important than something that is 'formal'.
<derek> and as such we like to deal with thing slike we do in business world
<derek> i.e. get up and go to someones desk
<LuftHans> you then need someone(s) to go through comments and put the suggestions into the dos.
<derek> in our world the equivalent is IRC
<LuftHans> s/dos/docs/
<derek> once a community is big enough i encourage wiki and such
<derek> and will probalby help with getting content into it
<derek> dont expect other gnue core folks to though
<derek> as its not their style (and rightfully so, as it would only slow down their production) ;)
<esands> Actually I disagree. Business process is important to document. Otherwise if you have outsides/newbies entering a business unit without knowledge of how tasks are processed its harder to bring them up to speed without effective resources
<derek> you misunderstood me
Maniac (~User@h24-82-132-209.wp.shawcable.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> i didnt say business process was unimportant to document
<derek> at work we have a professional technical writer that comes to our meetings
<sshack> Development steaming forward is good. But everyonce in a while you need to stop and checkpoint everything.
Action: chillywilly thinks derek will have to be *untangled* soon for his interview ;)
<derek> and translates our development process
<derek> i dont have that here ;)
<sshack> or else the only one's who know anything will be those in the loop/cabal/inner circle.
<derek> unless someone wants to volunteer
<esands> heh.
<derek> btw: psu does this to a degree with his kernel cousins and i adore him dearly for it
<esands> I guess you need some professional doc writes in the gnue team then. 8)
<chillywilly> core people can't do everything
<derek> chillywilly: i think thats what im trying to drive at ;)
<chillywilly> :)
<esands> definitely. kc is the only reason I'm able to follow what's happening with gnue sometimes
<sshack> Something the quality of gnu octave or gnu scientific library docs would be very useful.
<sshack> Actually the octave docs are slightly better than gsl.
<chillywilly> they are also further along
<esands> just a note outside the current discussion, its probably worth changing the acclite footer to point at the gnue web site instead of the nola site.  Its not polite otherwise.
<chillywilly> much further
<chillywilly> gsl rocks
<derek> not polite?
<derek> i figured not giving them attribution was worse
<derek> fwiw: the idea is not to have a fork
<derek> just to finish our regutting and give back to noguska
<derek> at which point if they dont like we fork
<esands> Sure, but for the purposes of bug reports acclite is not their problem.  Since its not their development
<sshack> chillywilly: I've got the dead tree books for gsl and octave. octave has by far the better manual.
<sshack> gsl is a good reference, but not a great manual.
<chillywilly> well I use gsl in a pet project of mine
<chillywilly> gsl and gnu common c++
<esands> sshack: how much they able to copy from matlab though?
<chillywilly> I have used octave too, but not fr a long while (not since I was in college)
<sshack> esands: I don't know, i've never actually seen a matlab manual. I'm a mathematica guy.
<derek> esands: good point, though it was never meant as public consumption
<derek> short of gnue folks helping us review our changes :)
<chillywilly> I jsut submitted a big patch to gnu common c++ like last weeks or so
<derek> it kind of grew into more than that, because we were slow getting changes back to nola
<jcater> ajmitch: both jamest and my jobs deal with schools
<derek> i will make the changes and commit 
<esands> sure, but having a link to the snapshots from kc makes it reasonablely public.  
<ajmitch> jcater: ok
<derek> jcater you live
<jcater> ajmitch: so come September
<jcater> jcater: all hell breaks loose for both of us
<ajmitch> oh lovely 
<jcater> s/jcater/ajmitch
<chillywilly> *joy*
<ajmitch> back to a resemblance of sanity soon?
<chillywilly> that sorta bites the big one jcater ;)
<jcater> ajmitch: yip
<jcater> ajmitch: about January 2, or so
<chillywilly> :(
<chillywilly> that's a ways away
<ajmitch> yeah, a long way
<jcater> fsck
Action: jcater just got another desupport notice from Oracle
<jcater> happy, happy, joy, joy
<derek> poop
<chillywilly> desupport?
<jcater> chillywilly: ya
<jcater> the latest round of "if you are still using this old, old version, we won't support you any more
<jcater> old, old version = 18 months, maybe
<chillywilly> ah
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> what crap
<jcater> funny enough, Win98 and WinNT are desupported
<jcater> permanently
<chillywilly> you can get someone else to support you though, can't you?
<ajmitch> this isn't FS :)
<jcater> chillywilly: nah
<jcater> only reason to be supported (imho) 
<jcater> is you get free upgrades
<chillywilly> yea, but you can't get the code anyway
<chillywilly> ah
<jcater> yearlyt support contracts w/free upgrades
<chillywilly> gayness
<jcater> are much cheaper than waiting a few years and repurchasing
<esands> is there a bug with adding users in acclite?
<ajmitch> you can add users?
<jcater> beats me
<LuftHans> jcater: sounds like an excuse to move to SAPdb :)/
<jcater> LuftHans: no kidding
<jcater> but we have to much legacy code at the moment
Action: LuftHans will be calling about an Oracle job after the dneighbo i/view on WOPN, though.
<chillywilly> M$ will provide you with support s yo don't hurt yourself when they bend you over 
<jcater> (hence the reason I joined gnue 18 months ago :)

Action: jcater is really curious what kind of promises derek is making that we will have to deliver
<jcater> :)
<esands> is there a way to get acclite to debug log sql commands to a file?
<jcater> "Oh, yeah; the GNUe-Sanitizer module will clean out your refrigerator and sanitize your toilet"
<ajmitch> it'll be archived, so you could get a transcript
<sshack> oh dear god. pc jr.
<sshack> The power.

<ajmitch> hehhe
<ajmitch> new release anyday?
<ajmitch> now that's something new... ;)
<sshack> The host is so bloody bored with him.
--- Tue Sep 10 2002
Action: chillywilly thinks derek ran out of gas there at the end
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> it is late
Action: sshack thought the interview questions were a little to generic.
<derek> chillywilly: got nervous :)
Action: chillywilly has a bone to pick with Barbicane
<derek> ?
<sshack> derek: Blah, did fine.
<chillywilly> I gave him some funny things to ask to break the ice and he didn't ask nto one of them
<chillywilly> derek: you did a great job, imho
<ajmitch> what did you give him to ask?
<sshack> The interviewer seemed a little miffed when you didn't get his jokes or respond to his comments though.
<sshack> I don't know any history here, but I thought that seemed a little inappropriate.
<derek> didnt bother me
<derek> i felt silly as i had never listend to an interview on there before
<sshack> owww!!!
<chillywilly> barbicane is a fly-by-the-seat-f-your-pants-kinda-guy
<sshack> Hammer docs!
<chillywilly> derek: case you have a life ;)?!?
<ajmitch> i don't often listen in
Action: chillywilly <-- no life
Action: LuftHans thinks derek did fine
<derek> no i just found out about wopn like 2 weeks ago and have caught it twice but never an interview
Action: chillywilly listens to it all the time
<ajmitch> yeah, first time i heard interviews tiday
<chillywilly> it's like crack
<chillywilly> :)
<LuftHans> barbicane didn't forget he was there as with happned with chipx86 earlier today :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> barbicane was off today
Action: derek is horrified to hear the stream later and sound how horridly dumb i sounded
<chillywilly> you would think he would've got in sooner to be prepared

<chillywilly> derek: you did a good job and helped provide direction for us misguided souls ;)
<sshack> derek: I got the sample running, it's complaining about ui frameworks now (no config setup) but I think I should do this tomorrow.
<sshack> I have to be up at 6:45 tomorrow.

<ajmitch> chillywilly: you still got wxpython installed?
<chillywilly> derek: I *loved* your answer to "what do yo hate to do?"
<chillywilly> nope

<chillywilly> can't install it
<chillywilly> bitches abot python
<chillywilly> about

<derek> not mine
<jcater> rofl
<jcater> did you plug us?
<chillywilly> cool
<derek> um oh yeah

siesel (jan@dial-213-168-97-135.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> ?
<perlhead> I reported it via IRC a few months ago.
Action: fixe would like to announce the new AxisGroupware.Org portal. Please take a moment to check it out. It pertains to everyone interested in communication and collaborative software integration. Thank You.
<jcater> I don't monitor the irc logs very much
<perlhead> it's in gnue/forms/uidrivers/wx/UIdriver.py
dres (~dres@mail.lewismoss.org) joined #gnuenterprise.
<perlhead> the initForm routine doesn't specify an encoding for the UI's strings
<perlhead> in order to get it to work in my environment, I must change it to read:
<perlhead> widget.SetFont(wxFont(int(gConfig('pointSize')),wxMODERN,wxNORMAL,wxNORMAL,0,"",wxFONTENCODING_ISO8859_1))
<perlhead> Of course, a hardwired encoding like this is a bad thing.
<siesel> perlhead: are you using 0.3.0 or cvs?
<perlhead> Should be configurable in etc/gnue.conf
<jcater>       wxNORMAL,FALSE,'',encodings[gConfig('formFontEncoding')]))
<jcater> looks like you just need to set formFontEncoding=iso8859-1
<jcater> in your gnue.conf file
<perlhead> OK, maybe this is *again* due to the fact that we're using an older version because our patches aren't in yet.
<jcater> we need to discuss the patches
<jcater> as in your email
<jcater> you imply that they weren't discussed
<jcater> when in fact they were
<jcater> and problems were addressed
Action: jcater is busy at the moment
<perlhead> I thought that, since this was so long ago, we would have gotten there already.
<perlhead> Maybe you misunderstood what I wrote, or I failed to communicate.
<perlhead> I didn't say they weren't discussed. On the contrary, I know they *were* discussed.
<perlhead> That's why it's so frustrating that they take months to get their way into the trunk.
Action: StyXman sigh
<StyXman> ...s
<perlhead> I am not aware of any thechnical or legal issues holding the incorporation of the patches.
<perlhead> If there are, please do tell us.
<perlhead> If I undestand it correctly, the problem is that you guys are too overwhelmed with work.
<perlhead> In fact, I'm a bit surprised that nobody answered my mail.
Action: jcater was working on an answer
<jcater> but to be honest
<jcater> it took me by surprise
<jcater> and I gave myself a few days to cool off
<jcater> before responding
<perlhead> Would you care to comment what made you heat up in the first ploace?
<perlhead> place
<jcater> as that's quite a harsh/heated email to be sending to the main discussion email list
<jcater> at least I read it that way
<perlhead> I mean, I sure didn't mean to offend anybody.
<jcater> well, like I said, I gave myself a few days to cool off :)
<jcater> just in case I was taking it the wrong way
<perlhead> Beleive me, either you read it the wrong way, or I failed completely to communicate properly.
<perlhead> I tried my best to make the e-mail as matter-of-fact as possible.
<perlhead> And made sure that I wasn't throwing blames around.
<jcater> I wholy admit that we are not handling the patches in the best manner possible
<jcater> as they shouldn't sit around for a month or two
<perlhead> All the mail says is, in short: "folks, we have a problem, let's find a way to solve it"
<jcater> BUT by the same token
<jcater> some of the patches we receive were discussed
<jcater> and problems raised
<jcater> but submitted anyways as if no problem existed
<jcater> take <mainmenubar> for instance
<jcater> or <scrollbar>
<jcater> those were even discussed on gnue-dev
<jcater> in irc, I was really concerned that adding <mainmenubar> tags were inappropriate for our model, that perhaps an attribute was more appropriate
Action: jcater thinks that was ignored
<perlhead> I must admit I'm not up-to-date with the minute details of the patches.
<StyXman> jcater: may be I'm too stupid yet
Action: perlhead nods
<jcater> and there was concern with how a <scrollbox> (or was it <scrollbar>) would fit in with our model
<jcater> StyXman: no
<jcater> I'm not trying to say that
<jcater> I *fully* admit we've been careless
<StyXman> jcater: uh, <scrollbox>'es were dropped.
<jcater> and haven't given you guys the attention you need
<StyXman> jcater: no, I'm admiting that
Action: jcater thought they were in the latest patchsets I got
<jcater> did you notice we got the netrc patch in this weekend?
<StyXman> now, theer's a <scrollbar>, but I think I didn't submited patches
<perlhead> I think we have two issues here:
<perlhead> Or better, two kinds.
<perlhead> Technical issues are, IMO, the least pressing.
<perlhead> We *are* aligned with GNUe's direction.
<perlhead> Of course, this doesn't mean that we won't ever have diverging views.
<perlhead> We like to think that we are at least able to contribute some original thinking.
<perlhead> This will most likely cause a few discussions and disagreements in the future.
<perlhead> But that's for the good of the project.
<perlhead> No dissens at all is bad for a project's health.
<perlhead> Anyway, we *won't* do stuff that hasn't been agreed upon.
<jcater> I agree
<jcater> with everything you said
<jcater> and I admit
<perlhead> So any technical issues that arise in the future will be discussed, and settled, and that's that.
<jcater> we have a problem
<jcater> but where do we go from here?
<perlhead> Another typical day in free software development.
<perlhead> The problem that looks harder to solve is of a more practical nature.
<perlhead> You guys are *swamped*.
<StyXman> jcater: well, now we're trying to resync with *the* gnue and then, I guess, resubmitt the patches...
<perlhead> You do great work, and have created an amazing project. That takes a lot of effort.
<perlhead> We acknowledge that, we know that you are not ignoring our patches.

<siesel> jcater: it seems, that parameters can be defined correctly in a gfd file, because <cparam> just take a "name" and no "value" attribute.
<siesel> If it should be that way, how can I define a default value?
<jcater> hrm
<jcater> in reports, I had a separate <parameter> tag
<jcater> that defined valid parameters and any default values
Action: jcater didn't think about default values w/forms
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> cparam is a place holder
<jcater> for parameters to be substituted in Conditions
Action: jcater was reading technote 00003.txt
<jcater> or by adding a <cparam> tag to the gnue forms definition file.
<jcater> <cparam> does not set a parameter
<jcater> a prime example
<jcater> (an example of how I use it)
<siesel> yes, but just defining that we will use a parameter X doesn't make much sense for me, why not import the parameter from report definition?
<jcater> huh?
<jcater> oh
<jcater> yeah
<siesel> sorry, I mean why not use the same tag in forms as in reports.
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> we should
<siesel> I just saw, that the <parameter> tag in report has quite a few attributs.
<siesel> I don't know if we could use/need/implement all of them ( 'name' 'required' 'limited' 'default' 'description' 'source' 'type' )
<jcater> we at least need 'type' and 'default'
<siesel> 'description' would be good too. (although we have to provide a "--show-user-parameters" command line option :(
<jcater> true
<jcater> geeze, siesel
<jcater> are you trying to make me work :)
<siesel> thats my job, isn't it? ;)
<siesel> btw. what does "limited" and "source" means?
<jcater> that is primarily for reports
<jcater> I don't see that being a use for forms
<jcater> but in reports
<jcater> the plan was to have a gnue-reports client
<jcater> that would prompt for the parameters
<jcater> if they weren't specified on the command like
<jcater> and source= could point to a datasource that would give valid values
<jcater> and limited= would specify the valid values
<jcater> (neither of those 2 options are implemented)
<siesel> ah. 
Action: siesel sees a light :)
<siesel> we still could use "source" in forms, because like in the example in 0003.txt,  the exchangerate parameter could be f.e. provided by a database. It would be great if the parameter code could be shared between reports and forms, even if the normal forms user never will use <parameter> tags in form files
<siesel> using parameter tags with source attributs could be a SQL less solution replacing "simpleQuery" commands in triggers
<jcater> erm
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> that wasn't my intention
<jcater> imho that's making parameters too complex
<jcater> i.e., then you have a datasource
<jcater> not a parameter
<siesel> sorry, I misunderstood "jcater] and source= could point to a datasource that would give valid values"
<jcater> siesel: but that was not for runtime
<siesel> I just read "source=  could point  to a datasource that would provide values"
<jcater> that was to prompt the user for a value to pass to the reports engine
<siesel> possibly its better to have a command line option like "--read-parameter-from"
<siesel> nevertheless, I think the main usage for parameters in forms is to send information from a main form to a popup subform.
<jcater> I agree
<siesel> IMHO its just would be easier to share the parameter definition with reports than create a new one
<siesel> dunno how much work it is to combine it with forms :)

<psu> hi Mr_You
<Mr_You> have some quick UI driver questions
<Mr_You> lemme know if this is documented..
<Mr_You> I'm looking for comments on what I might "seperate" in my code.. which would be used in the perl module/library.
<Mr_You> for others
<filc> Hi psu
<Mr_You> for example, should I put "everything" except the actual UI rendering?
<siesel> jcater: that 100% ok for me. btw. what do you think about that reload parameter in the allowedValues(reload=0) trigger function (see 0003.txt). 
<Mr_You> so that way other perl people can make their own interfaces..
<Mr_You> hmm
<Mr_You> this is gonna  be wicked..
<Mr_You> heh
<siesel> I haven't fully tested it (and I don't think, that it will work with dropdown entries at the moment), but If you think that it make sense then I have a small patch to implemet it

<Mr_You> functionality
<Mr_You> I'm working on a GNUe Forms Client perl module.. then I'll have code that uses that.. so I'm just trying to seeif anyone has any general comments on what would be put in the module.
<Mr_You> like, obviously I would put the "get gfd" function in the module
<Mr_You> somehow I would need to put some widget stuff in there.. or hmm
<Mr_You> but I have to consider the most efficient method of integrating the module with user code
<Mr_You> understand?

Action: jcater is back (gone 01:56:16)
<sshack> Well, <= -8 really
<psu> Mr_You: I think the key message is to think about how much you have to do in perl and 
<psu> how much you can reuse 
<Mr_You> I guess the best way to explain might be.. I'm isolating GNUe perl functions in the module so that multiple interfaces could be created from that module.
<psu> i.e. I would definantly re-use GNUe Common 
<Mr_You> exactly psu
<psu> and you might get 90% of what you want for 10% of the effort by just teaching 
<Mr_You> oh ok, how would I use GNUe Common?
Action: psu is hoist by his own petard
<psu> there's some docs somewhere, I'm sure
<psu> jamest wrote something for reinhard when we decided to make appserver use common
<psu> and you might get 90% of what you want for 10% of the effort by just teaching 
<psu> the python version of forms to handle wrapped perl triggers
<Mr_You> hmm 
<psu> but, this is free s/w and it's your itch ;-)
<filc> is ther an LXR for gnue at the moment?
<Mr_You> the php forms client has its owncommon
<Mr_You> hmm I see
<jcater> filc: there was, but I don;t think it's working right
<psu> does it? I thought siesel had decided to use the python one
<filc> jcater: thanks... thought it might be just me...
<Mr_You> it has a common.php file: # DESCRIPTION:
<Mr_You> # database abstraction part for phpforms 
<Mr_You> # (a bit like gnue-common, but using php)
<Mr_You> I don't see where it might attempt to link against something else.

<chillywilly> but I could be trumped on all of this
<chillywilly> siesel and reinhard are da appserver "gurus"
Action: chillywilly <-- wannabe with cvs write access ;)
Action: filc <-- wannabe without cvs write access :)
<LuftHans> do whap, do whap
<dsmith> chillywilly!
<dsmith> chillywilly: What's been happening with gnue lately?
<chillywilly> hi
<chillywilly> ummm, we do have kernel cousins ;)
<chillywilly> where have you been anway?!? ;)
<dsmith> Working in Michigan.  Releasing mod_guile.  Backpacking.
<jcater> mod_guile?
<jcater> are you sick?
<jcater> ;)
<der_edoc> obviously
<der_edoc> he likes to climb mountains and use lisp
<jcater> at the same time?
<dsmith> Yes!
<der_edoc> opposed to climbing mountain dews and using python
<chillywilly> der_edoc: yo so laaaaaazy
<der_edoc> im not lazy
<chillywilly> hah
<der_edoc> im atively challenged
<chillywilly> that's up for debate
<chillywilly> lol
<jcater> atively?
<LuftHans> yeah, yeah, yer just drawn that way
<der_edoc> s/atively /actively
<jcater> atively = peaceful coexistance with software bugs?
<jcater> so you are atively challenged
Action: jcater would buy that
<der_edoc> what do they call bug geeks again?
<der_edoc> entomologists
<jcater> bug geeks?
<der_edoc> or something
<jcater> oh, you mean gnome hackers?
<der_edoc> jcater: no comment on that one
<chillywilly> jcater: what a cheap shot
<jcater> well, I could do an expensive shot
<jcater> but last time I tried to overnight a trout to you
<jcater> the fedex clerk had a cow
<jcater> so I try to stick with the cheap shots now
Action: chillywilly sends rock filled donuts to jcater
<LuftHans> midletons makes a good, expensive shot.
<chillywilly> wassat?
<LuftHans> single-malt whiskey. $10-20/shot depending on the bar. Worth the $10-20.
<chillywilly> I don't drink
<jcater> chillywilly: but don't you get dehydrated?
<chillywilly> nope...there's plenty of ice around
<LuftHans> good, save yourself. If you decide to loes your sanity, though, do it with midletons ;-)
<chillywilly> no thanks
<chillywilly> I don't need to dull my senses in order to cope with the realities of life ;)
<filc> what's wrong with 8 pints down the local every friday and saturday night?
<LuftHans> I agree with you on that. Unfortunately I really like a couple of alcoholic beverages. I don't drink much and I never drink and drive, so I think I'm in pretty good shape.
<reinhard> filc: I highly appreciate your patch
<reinhard> we have defined it as incorrect to use the acronym "GEAS" outside the code
<reinhard> to clearly distinguish between (old) GEAS and (new) appserver

<filc> ... downloaded from cvs, but seem to be missing objectserver/setup.py 
<filc> ... infact anything in objectserver ;(
<filc> is it dead?
<nickr> I kilt it
<nickr> and 'ate it
<filc> ok... 
<der_edoc>  its dead
<der_edoc> objectserver and geas dirs i think are dead
<jcater> yes
<jcater> you should be in appserver/ :)

<filc> yup  need new versions of wxPython and co for RedHat 7.3 :(
<filc> s/yup/yuck/
<der_edoc> ?
<der_edoc> why would you need new versions of wxPython?
<der_edoc> on the redhat disks there should be python and wxpython
<filc> I'm getting errors like:
<filc> DB000:   import wxc
<filc> DB000: /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/wxPython/__init__.py:20: RuntimeWarning: Python C API version mismatch for module printfwc: This Python has API version 1011, module printfwc has version 1010.
<filc> ??? is there???
Action: filc looks
<der_edoc> which are compatiable if not tehn REd Hat is worse than i thought
<der_edoc> i.e. shipping incompatiable producs
<der_edoc> you running gnue with python2.2?
<filc> I was using the stuff from the redhat7.2 docs on gnue website... didn't check redhat7.3 disks
<filc> yep python2.2
<der_edoc> i would look on your redhat7.3 disks
<der_edoc> btw: wxPython i sdependednt on similar wxwindows and python
<der_edoc> i.e. you can use wxPython for pyton 2.0 and use with python 2.2
<der_edoc> and such
<der_edoc> so make sure if you downloaded wxPython you download the correct one for your version of python
Action: der_edoc gets red hat rpm flashbacks everytime i walk someone through an install of gnue on redhat, so forgive me if i start convulsing ;)
Action: der_edoc really needs to get our rpms working again so at least it will give dependency errors
<filc> Not finding any RPMS on the ftp mirrors of redhat....
<der_edoc> i think some are on my website

<der_edoc> crud looks like i didnt move over the python2.2 stuff only the 2.1 stuff
<der_edoc> i will soon have to download the 2.2 stuff and post there
<chillywilly> my gnome is sooooo broken
<der_edoc> well thats what you get for sticking your gnome in every hole you see
<filc> I've got wxPython for 2.2  ... not sure if the existing wxGTK* wxBase will work.. but here goes!!
<der_edoc> btw: i made this for you and ajmitch...

<filc> der_edoc... do you want me to send you the dependencies if I get it working?
<der_edoc> sure derek@gnue.org
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-225.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<filc> der_edoc: working and I've updated the install guide for redhat 7.3.  I'll send all those to you now.
<der_edoc> cool
<filc> sent
<filc> is gfclient always known as gnue-forms on all platforms?
<der_edoc> i beleive it is now
<der_edoc> that was a recent name change
<der_edoc> as some other tool was shipping with name gfclient i think
<filc> OK... I'm just going through the tree updating all the places where it's used...
<filc> ... is there anyone else doing this before i finish and submit a patch?
<der_edoc> so we figured doing gnue- on all binaries was a better long term move
<filc> good idea
<der_edoc> filc i thought it was already done
gontran_work (~gontran@str-room.biology.ualberta.ca) left irc: "'bye'"
<filc> not on the cvs I downloaded tonight ;/
<der_edoc> if you were using 0.3.0 i woudl say not eveyrthing got fixed but i thought cvs tree was updated with this....
<der_edoc> i dont have tree in front of me so i cant  speak to it
<der_edoc> you download cvs tarball?
<der_edoc> or get cvs from cvs?
<der_edoc> better yet how did you install cvs?
<der_edoc> did you do setup.py in each individual package dir?
<der_edoc> or did you run setup-cvs.py in the root cvs dir?
<filc> nap... looking on cvs web still says gfclient for forms/sample/intro
<filc> I ran setup.py in each individual package.. per 7.2
<der_edoc> ah for cvs probably wiser to run setup-cvs.py
<der_edoc> gives you lot more control :)
<der_edoc> plus then you can run production and cvs in parallel
<filc> booger.  I'm gonna have to install it again, using this method and update the docs I've just sent you
<der_edoc> psu: im hearing high barrier to entry a lot
<der_edoc> kevin was good enough to give us redhat 7.2 and filc updating for 7.3 someone else posted debian items
<der_edoc> please reminde me ot put them all in single location
<der_edoc> and from home page link out to 'Quick Start Guides' or such
<der_edoc> or 'newbie' docs or somethign
<der_edoc> just remeind me (no dcl so i cant remind myself) ;)
<SachaS> bye
<filc> bye
<filc> ok... just gone through the tree and replaced all gfclients with gnue-forms except for in some of the packaging/installation places where I'm not sure what I'm doing (I can handle documentation!!)
<filc> I'll do a cvs diff and send it to info@gnue.org again
