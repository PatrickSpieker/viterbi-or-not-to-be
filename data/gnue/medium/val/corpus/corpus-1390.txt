<ajmitch> hi psu
<psu> hi aj
<derek> dood postgres needs to be shot
<psu> ?
<ajmitch> hehe
<sshack> Good evening.
<psu> something even worse than the 1.0 > 2 type conversion error
<psu> ?
<psu> good morning sshack
<sshack> :-)
<derek> psu: i THINK dcl is now back and functioning for gnue
<derek> with no thanks from postgres 
<derek> it seems a pgdump dumps tab delimited data
<derek> and takes no care to i18n
<derek> since we have lots of non americans here
<derek> that just fscked its world
<derek> so it wouldnt import data properly
<sshack> derek: File a bug?
<derek> of course where data was i18n was tickets and workorders
<derek> i had to hand manipulate the dump file (about 1.5 hours of work)
<derek> to get it all to load
<psu> fsck
<derek> so some data might not be formatted as one would want
<derek> but all the records SHOULD be there
<psu> Well, my workorders all seem to be there
<psu> Is it OK to start updating yet, or do you still have some tidying up to do?
<derek> i think its ok
<derek> if you can browse your work orders a bit
<derek> and make sure nothign looks grossly wrong i woudl feel better
<derek> but i dont have anything ;outstanding; on my side other than getting folks to verify stuff looks ok
Action: derek just brought it back up and have my hundreds of todos :)
<derek> i just havent gone in to look at them yet
Action: psu will try closing some obsolete tickets
<psu> looking good
<derek> rock
Action: derek was starting to die w/o dcl
<derek> figured i woudl nut up and get it fixed tonight

<derek> well he is part of the problem
<derek> his last name is not unicode compliant
Action: derek glares at him and jens
<psu> hmm
<derek> so now his last name is tajmus or something ;)
<ajmitch> hehe
<btami> Tamás
<derek> as \234 or whatever wasnt cutting the mustard
Action: derek again glares at btami (only becuase postgres developers arent here to glare at) ;)
Action: psu covers btami with anti-glare cream
Action: sshack sprays btami with anti-glare lens cleaner.
Action: psu offers btami a towel
<btami> oh no more covers !
<btami> thanks psu
<psu> but, I would guess, he really knows where his towel is, anyway
<sshack> That's one loopy frood.
<derek> btami: they cover you with much more crap you wont be able to code
<btami> hehe
<psu> I though that being covered with crap dumped on you by other people
<btami> anyway, if you (psu) can't use Tamás, please use Tamas (not Tamus)
<psu> was the normal condition for a coder?
<psu> Well, actually, I can - just never got around to it.
<btami> oh
<psu> Both reinhard and jens get their umlauts on KC
<btami> thats good

<jbailey> Err.  Is any of that directed at me?
<jbailey> I have this suspicion that it is.
<jbailey> If you ever actually want my attention, it helps to type my nick in.  Then the tab turns blue. =)
<der_edoc> jbailey: a. what is status of sapdb packages
<der_edoc> jbailey: b. any chance we can wrangle your help in getting gnue packages
<der_edoc> irc client sucks so no tab nick completion so i apologize (normally i do specifiy)
<jbailey> der_edoc: I think there's been a new version released.  I've been off two days this week with the flu.  I'm back tommorow, but that means that I've been a little crazy in getting caught up.  I also did something stupid:
<jbailey> I'm now a co-maintainer for DEbian glibc.
<jbailey> And we're trying to get ready for the 2.3 release.
<jbailey> *sigh*
<nickr> jbailey: dude, why did you go an do a thing like that?
<jbailey> (no worries.  It's just that if you don't see me answer when you suspect I'm around, like because my idle time is low, saying 'jbailey' turns the tab blue and highlights your nick in yellow so I can find it easy.  I also have a very large backscroll for the same purpose)
<jbailey> nickr: Actually, mostly so that the Hurd port we have a good in.  The problem is that glibc is so critical to us.  Half of the bloody syscalls are implemented there, not in the kernel or in the Hurd.  And Debian has traditionally been very slow about updating from CVS.  This way I can at least update the Hurd portion when I need to.
<jbailey> But there's this vat of catchup to do. =(
<nickr> thats like 'oh by the way I'm now the president of ex-soviet republic of georgia'
<jbailey> der_edoc: GNUe packages.  hmm.  Means I should try getting gnue to work one day.  Y'know that I've still *never* gotten it installed, right? =)
<nickr> I think assufield is master of the gnue packages .. or at least the one most inclined to get them done
<nickr> or am I remembering wrong?
<der_edoc> i dont know we need them desperately though
<der_edoc> i imgain if someone makes them or helps us make them
<der_edoc> i.e the hard work is in the first run ont really the maintenance best i can tell

<esands> been looking at nola/acclite, is there a reason why you guys decided to base acclite on this instead of sql-ledger?
<esands> btw, curry gnocci is just wrong. 8P  More like fission than fusion cooking
<jbailey> esands: Only if you do the curry right!
<der_edoc> yeah sql ledger has massive structural problems
<der_edoc> a. its table layout seems really bad (in quick look)
<nickr> it'd be more of a thai curry
<jcater> esands: yeah, sql-ledget looks really bad under the hood
<jcater> s/ledget/ledger
<der_edoc> b. perl is the demon and so mucking with perl code is like getting a root cananal.... sql-ledger is un commented perl code which makes it like a tooth extraction
<jbailey> der_edoc: What?  You let non-snake code in?
<esands> nola has some issues as well.  Like at the moment it doesnt seem to have a sales tax acculation flag for vendor invoices.  Might have missed it though
<der_edoc> i.e. we had been giving rave reviews of sqlledger here for some time read our logs :)
<nickr> perl is a tool that can be misused.
<jbailey> I thought you were even makin' cw rewrite his bit in python! =)
<der_edoc> then we decided to write gnue front in for it

<jcater> that's why we branched it :)
<jcater> but the underlying structure looked by far more advanced than most of the free accounting packages we looked at

<der_edoc> yeah but it sucks less
<der_edoc> ;)
<der_edoc> but autotools is fine, just we arent willing to do mass conversion and stop using autotools
<der_edoc> at least not until tits proved its python support sucks less than distutils last evaluation it failed that test
<der_edoc> i.e. there is NO allegiance to dist-utils we will take something better
<jbailey> What is it that you needed out of autotools that it failed at?  Last time we spoke (like 18 months ago) you hadn't tried it at all.
<esands> der_edoc: are you derek in another guise?
<jbailey> esands: We are all one another in different forms.  It's the imminent nature of God.
<jbailey> esands: errr..
<jamest> jbailey: gnue used autoconf before distutils
<jamest> from the start
<jamest> we rapidly switched to distutils
<esands> 8P Depends who's book you read
<jamest> at that time autoconf had no support for python beyond some 3rd party patches
<jamest> at least that is what I recall
<jbailey> jamest: Ah, okay.  You know that automake has native support for python now, yes?
<jamest> no i didn't
<jbailey> i've only used it for tiny projects, though.  I had hoped you had tried it since then.
<chillywilly> I was adding auto* support then someone told me I better stop
<jamest> chillywilly: since when do you listen to what people tell you?
<chillywilly> :'(
<jamest> the chillywilly i remember usually said "fsck you, you !@#!@#"
<jamest> did you guys switch chilly's while I was away?
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> I am a wiser chillywilly
Action: jamest is going to have to take a few moments to adjust his world view
<chillywilly> humbled by my mere mediocrity
<esands> der_edoc: I think php and perl are as bad as each other.  Anyway to your question I'll looking for a reasonable/usagable accounting package to replace my manual gnucash hacks
<chillywilly> I wish I wouldn't have blew away those files...
Chipaca (~john@ADSL-200-59-86-69.cordoba.sinectis.com.ar) left irc: "ircII EPIC4-1.0.1 -- Are we there yet?"
<jbailey> chillywilly: Which ones?
<chillywilly> start of auto* support
<chillywilly> why does distutils suck fr debian packaging?
<jbailey> Because alot of things seem quite difficult to override, like easily setting sysconfdir to /etc, etc..
<chillywilly> ah
<chillywilly> so script that you can pass options to like configure?
Action: chillywilly runs setup.py --help-commands
<jbailey> Yeah.  It's pretty standard what you pass:         cd $(BUILD_TREE)/build && ../configure \
<jbailey>         --prefix=/usr --infodir=/usr/share/info --sysconfdir=/etc \
<jbailey>         --mandir=/usr/share/man --with-gdbm \
<jbailey>         --build=$(DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE) --host=$(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)
<jbailey> (obviously without gdbm in most cases)
<chillywilly> ah
<jbailey> And it allows for cross-compiling cases, etc...
<jbailey> And then on the install you need to lightly override the install target so that it installs into a subdirectory that you can choose which files go in which package.
<chillywilly> like install config files in /etc/package/ ?
<jbailey> Well it's usually something like 'make install PREFIX=`pwd`/debian/tmp' or some such.
<jbailey> Then from there, you use the debian tools to pick out the files you want in each package.
<chillywilly> ah, ok
<chillywilly> debian packaging doesn't seem to be too bad ;)
<jbailey> It's really quite simple.  Not terribly easy is the problem!  There's alot of little details to get.  Gets easier with practice.
<jbailey> A package that's done properly with auto* and libtool and such takes me 2-4 hours to package now.
<chillywilly> uhuh
<chillywilly> ok
<jbailey> (where by properly, I mean they actually implemented it *well* with those tools)
<jbailey> (half the time I have to send patches upstream so that they're using the tools well)

<chillywilly> I see
<chillywilly> hi jc
Action: chillywilly points at jcater: "He's the one who told me to stop!" ;)
<chillywilly> it's his fault
<chillywilly> NetBank
<chillywilly> We are currently performing system maintenance.
<chillywilly> The system should be available shortly.
<chillywilly> While we are working to restore your online access, you're welcome to bank by phone at 1-888-BKONWEB (1-888-256-6932), option 1.
<chillywilly> We apologize for any inconvenience. 
<chillywilly> :(
<chillywilly> sorry that neybank stuff is unrelated to my previous statement
<chillywilly> netbank
<jcater> wtf?!?!?
<jbailey> jcater: He's lost it.
Action: jcater has never, ever gotten that message from netbank
Action: jbailey pulls out the straightjacket
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> yes I have
<jcater> when I put in an invalid password
<jcater> it tells me that
<jcater> (Very misleading message :)
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> how lame
<chillywilly> ;)
Action: chillywilly is back in again
<chillywilly> I still need to fill out the rest of my paperwork and make an initial deposit
<chillywilly> how is the export with netbank jcater?
<chillywilly> can you pick catergories and all that?
<jcater> um
<jcater> well
<chillywilly> for the transactions
<chillywilly> I miss that
<chillywilly> my old bank software used to do that before the upgrade
<chillywilly> makes importing int gnucash easier
<jcater> since I switched to debian in 2000/01
<jcater> I haven't had MS Money
<jcater> so haven't used import
<chillywilly> no gnucash :)?
<jamest> s/MS/any/
<chillywilly> heh
Action: jcater is embarassed to say I haven't balanced my checkbook since switching to debian
<jcater> jamest: that's closer to the truth
<jamest> it's so good it does that for you
<chillywilly> netbank is supposed t supprt OFX (nt sure if that's correct) so if you use gnucash from cvs you can yank transactions from the bank over the net
<chillywilly> client/server dealy
<jcater> is gnucash actually usable?
Action: jcater depends heavily on scheduled transactions
<chillywilly> it's missing sme small business features
<chillywilly> they are adding that
<chillywilly> I think it may be in cvs
<jcater> they have been adding that for as long as we have been working on postgresql support
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> :P
<chillywilly> the sql stuff is now working
<chillywilly> in 1.6.8
<chillywilly> which is in debian sid
<chillywilly> i think
<jcater> rofl
<jcater> there's no way I'd use gnu-cash for small business
<jcater> it just ain't right
<chillywilly> well of course not
<chillywilly> it's "personal" finance
<jcater> if it takes years to hack in scheduled transactions
<chillywilly> and as derek mentioned before
<chillywilly> a different market ;)
<jcater> then I say there's some serious design flaws :)
<chillywilly> HEH
<chillywilly> possibly
<chillywilly> :)
<chillywilly> since I accidently blew away my .galeon dir I cannot remember my login and pass for my other on-line banking account
<chillywilly> :(
<chillywilly> sucks
<jbailey> See?  You should use a real os!  Like Microsoft!  Where if you blow things away you can never boot again! =)
<chillywilly> oh yea!
<jcater> hot damn!
<jcater> .me does a happy dance
<chillywilly> wassup?
<jcater> err, /me
<jcater> on the wxDev mailing list:
<jcater> "Yes, but that's because we want to get a 2.4.0 out real soon now, so please
<jcater> no major changes. Afterwards is a different story ..."
<chillywilly> jcater: jbailey wants use to switch to auto* ;)
<chillywilly> s/use/us/
<jcater> yeah, and ppl in hell want icewater
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> :D
<jbailey> jcater: Good analogy!
<filc> how do I create the gnue/www base directory as stated in the gnue/README.... or is this a misnomer?
<jcater> um
<jcater> for some reason
<jcater> I think the www/ directory was moved last week
<jcater> I didn't receive any notice
<jcater> but noticed that it was no longer valid
<chillywilly> why can't I find the frelling customer spport number
<jcater> anyone else see this?
<filc> no www directory or *.html files in the tree
<filc> probably not checking correctly (cvs newbie) but I cant see and old version of www directory
<chillywilly> I hate remembering passwords
<chillywilly> cvs server: cannot open directory /cvsroot/gnue/gnue/www: No such file or directory
<chillywilly> cvs server: skipping directory www

<filc> hrrm... was www/ automatically generated from the docbook stuff??
<jcater> no
<jcater> www was a hack by the gnu.org administrators
<jcater> to let us maintain our www page on their servers
<jcater> I think they've made us consistent with the other projects, now
<filc> ok... I'll send a patch in to remove it from the README, if you that's ok with everyone
<jbailey> Off for food and bed.  g'night all.

<esands> jcater: gnucash is usable.  And their are some small business features in the cvs; they are workable, but require some more polish.  It think it does have scheduled now in the cvs as well
<esands> I'd check by my machine with the gnucash cvs deb is still broken
<esands> jcater: is it possible to get read access to the acclite cvs?  Would make hacking on it a little easier.
<chillywilly> yay, I got into my eBillPay account

<ajmitch> get cvs access?
<nic> hey, no.  power went out here for a moment
<ajmitch> ouch
<nic> just a house thing, some guys putting some new gib up. So they need to move some plugs around.  UPSs helped, except I forgot to put my dsl modem on it. 8)
<ajmitch> oh, ok
Nick change: nic -> esands_
Action: ajmitch has a usb one, it gets power from the computer
<esands_> running linux?
<ajmitch> yep
<esands_> Works well?  Which modem?  I assume that means you pull the IP back to your linux box
<ajmitch> alcatel speedtouch USB
<ajmitch> it appears as a ppp interface which pppd controls
<ajmitch> instead of using a serial port, i use the pppoa userspace drivers
<esands_> What's the performance like?
<ajmitch> i've seen > 400KB/sec when the telecom cap came off once ;)
<esands_> Hmm. I was thinking or replacing my telecom rental modem.  Was going to get the Alcatel Pro and do the PPTP thing, but I might look at the USB one. 8)

<jcater> I often wonder if he has a porta-potty

<ajmitch> jcater can give you access if you send donuts
<esands_> Nah, I bet he just takes into the room with him. ;)
<jcater> esands_: unfortunately we don't have anonymous cvs

<esands_> er.
<jcater> I can set up ssh-based access

<ajmitch> jcater: can you setup pserver-based anoncvs access?
<ajmitch> ah ok

<esands_> That would be better than downloading the 2Mb *-09-10.. and discovering it was the same and 09-08. 8)

<esands_> what's the goal with acclite at the moment?  What sort of work needs doing?
Nick change: esands_ -> esands
<jcater> I think there are still a few oddities left over from our conversion from mysql to postgresql
<esands> is it tidying up postgres issues, like that ''/'0' defaults patchs I forwarded though or working on the gnue side of things?
<jcater> but the biggest goal is to write GNUe Forms screens for the various PHP screens
<jcater> esands: probably the first goal is little stuff like you posted
<jcater> that are showstoppers when testing
<esands> Was the patches I submit in line with your code style or you want something different. Since I'm exploring acclite at the moment for possible use I can easily fix bugs like that when I find them
<jcater> for small stuff like that, I'd go ahead and fix them

<esands> er, sorry dnsdomainname
<SachaS> esands dnsdomainname i think wants to change the domain name at a dns server...not sure
<esands> Actually I think dnsdomainname only prints the domain. It think its actually set in /etc/resolv.conf
<ajmitch> man hostname
<ajmitch> it has an explanation in there
<esands> Otherwise its determined by gethostname() and the last bit of hostname.domain

<derek> not tabs :)
<derek> for loop
<derek>   instruction
[23:55] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<derek> end for
<esands> python style, right. 8)
<derek> so feel free to clean up anything you see there
<derek> yeah in php i like 
<derek> for loop
<derek>   {
<derek>   instruction
[23:56] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<derek>   }
<derek> opposed to 
<derek> for loop {
<derek>   instruction
[23:56] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<derek>   }
<esands> I usually prefer for loop { style rather than for loop\n{
<derek> though im not a nazi
<derek> i.e. if its code im not complaining
<esands> heh.
<derek> but this is one reason i liked python so much
<derek> is it elminates this debate entirely :)
<esands> I guess I'll have to fire up emacs, coding in vi is alright for quick hacks, but its not nice since I'm indenting things manually.
<esands> Maybe you can point me at he AP sales taxt side of things.
<esands> There is "Home > AR Setup > Sales Taxes" where is the AP Sales Tax setup?
