Action: chillywilly thinks derek ran out of gas there at the end
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> it is late
Action: sshack thought the interview questions were a little to generic.
<derek> chillywilly: got nervous :)
Action: chillywilly has a bone to pick with Barbicane
<derek> ?
<sshack> derek: Blah, did fine.
<chillywilly> I gave him some funny things to ask to break the ice and he didn't ask nto one of them
<chillywilly> derek: you did a great job, imho
<ajmitch> what did you give him to ask?
<sshack> The interviewer seemed a little miffed when you didn't get his jokes or respond to his comments though.
<sshack> I don't know any history here, but I thought that seemed a little inappropriate.
<derek> didnt bother me
<derek> i felt silly as i had never listend to an interview on there before
<sshack> owww!!!
<chillywilly> barbicane is a fly-by-the-seat-f-your-pants-kinda-guy
<sshack> Hammer docs!
<chillywilly> derek: case you have a life ;)?!?
<ajmitch> i don't often listen in
Action: chillywilly <-- no life
Action: LuftHans thinks derek did fine
<derek> no i just found out about wopn like 2 weeks ago and have caught it twice but never an interview
Action: chillywilly listens to it all the time
<ajmitch> yeah, first time i heard interviews tiday
<chillywilly> it's like crack
<chillywilly> :)
<LuftHans> barbicane didn't forget he was there as with happned with chipx86 earlier today :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> barbicane was off today
Action: derek is horrified to hear the stream later and sound how horridly dumb i sounded
<chillywilly> you would think he would've got in sooner to be prepared
Action: chillywilly has it recorded :)

<chillywilly> I suppse I can stop recording now
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> barbicane said he might try & split out the interviews into separate files
<chillywilly> derek: you did a good job and helped provide direction for us misguided souls ;)
<sshack> derek: I got the sample running, it's complaining about ui frameworks now (no config setup) but I think I should do this tomorrow.
<sshack> I have to be up at 6:45 tomorrow.
Action: chillywilly has to be up at 5:30

<ajmitch> yeah, i have to use the gtk2 frontend now :)
<chillywilly> weeeeeeeee
Action: sshack is /NOT/ a morning person.
<chillywilly> I stayed up just to hear da masta
<chillywilly> hrrrm, I am hungry now
<ajmitch> chillywilly: you still got wxpython installed?
<chillywilly> derek: I *loved* your answer to "what do yo hate to do?"
<chillywilly> nope
<chillywilly> it's b0rked now
<chillywilly> can't install it
<chillywilly> bitches abot python
<chillywilly> about
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> wxpython needs rebuilt against python 2.2
<chillywilly> jan said you can get the deb and do a --force-depends on it
<chillywilly> I dunno how well that works
<ajmitch> badly, i'd imagine
<sshack> Okay, I shall speak with you guys Possibly tomorrow, more likely wednesday though.
<sshack> Busy day tomorrow.
Nick change: sshack -> sshack_zzz
<ajmitch> ok, cya
<derek> jcater: you ever make it back
Action: chillywilly now has a voice to put with the nick(s) derek, dneighbo, etc.

<jcater> you should see him in real life
<jcater> you'd fear for your life
<chillywilly> rofl
<jcater> :)
<ajmitch> hehe
Action: jcater is glad derek has a good sense of humor
<chillywilly> did yo hear his answer to "what is something you hate doing?"
<jcater> unlike, say, chillywilly
<chillywilly> "any physical work"
Action: jcater can't listen
<jcater> so no
<jcater> lol
<derek> jcater: if people start emailing you
<chillywilly> how do I not have a sense of humor
<derek> asking when the next release is and why they cant get it in debian
<chillywilly> sometimes I am cranky
<derek> its chillywilly's fault
<derek> not mine
<jcater> rofl

<perlhead> jcater: I understand you're the man when it comes to the UI?
<perlhead> There's still an issue wrt the encoding of UI strings.
siesel (jan@dial-213-168-97-135.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> ?
<perlhead> I reported it via IRC a few months ago.
Action: fixe would like to announce the new AxisGroupware.Org portal. Please take a moment to check it out. It pertains to everyone interested in communication and collaborative software integration. Thank You.
<jcater> I don't monitor the irc logs very much
<perlhead> it's in gnue/forms/uidrivers/wx/UIdriver.py
dres (~dres@mail.lewismoss.org) joined #gnuenterprise.
<perlhead> the initForm routine doesn't specify an encoding for the UI's strings
<perlhead> in order to get it to work in my environment, I must change it to read:
<perlhead> widget.SetFont(wxFont(int(gConfig('pointSize')),wxMODERN,wxNORMAL,wxNORMAL,0,"",wxFONTENCODING_ISO8859_1))
<perlhead> Of course, a hardwired encoding like this is a bad thing.
<siesel> perlhead: are you using 0.3.0 or cvs?
<perlhead> Should be configurable in etc/gnue.conf
<jcater>       wxNORMAL,FALSE,'',encodings[gConfig('formFontEncoding')]))
<jcater> looks like you just need to set formFontEncoding=iso8859-1
<jcater> in your gnue.conf file
<perlhead> OK, maybe this is *again* due to the fact that we're using an older version because our patches aren't in yet.
<jcater> we need to discuss the patches
<jcater> as in your email
<jcater> you imply that they weren't discussed
<jcater> when in fact they were
<jcater> and problems were addressed
Action: jcater is busy at the moment
<perlhead> I thought that, since this was so long ago, we would have gotten there already.
<perlhead> Maybe you misunderstood what I wrote, or I failed to communicate.
<perlhead> I didn't say they weren't discussed. On the contrary, I know they *were* discussed.
<perlhead> That's why it's so frustrating that they take months to get their way into the trunk.
Action: StyXman sigh
<StyXman> ...s
<perlhead> I am not aware of any thechnical or legal issues holding the incorporation of the patches.
<perlhead> If there are, please do tell us.
<perlhead> If I undestand it correctly, the problem is that you guys are too overwhelmed with work.
<perlhead> In fact, I'm a bit surprised that nobody answered my mail.
Action: jcater was working on an answer
<jcater> but to be honest
<jcater> it took me by surprise
<jcater> and I gave myself a few days to cool off
<jcater> before responding
<perlhead> Would you care to comment what made you heat up in the first ploace?
<perlhead> place
<jcater> as that's quite a harsh/heated email to be sending to the main discussion email list
<jcater> at least I read it that way
<perlhead> I mean, I sure didn't mean to offend anybody.
<jcater> well, like I said, I gave myself a few days to cool off :)
<jcater> just in case I was taking it the wrong way
<perlhead> Beleive me, either you read it the wrong way, or I failed completely to communicate properly.
<perlhead> I tried my best to make the e-mail as matter-of-fact as possible.
<perlhead> And made sure that I wasn't throwing blames around.
<jcater> I wholy admit that we are not handling the patches in the best manner possible
<jcater> as they shouldn't sit around for a month or two
<perlhead> All the mail says is, in short: "folks, we have a problem, let's find a way to solve it"
<jcater> BUT by the same token
<jcater> some of the patches we receive were discussed
<jcater> and problems raised
<jcater> but submitted anyways as if no problem existed
<jcater> take <mainmenubar> for instance
<jcater> or <scrollbar>
<jcater> those were even discussed on gnue-dev
<jcater> in irc, I was really concerned that adding <mainmenubar> tags were inappropriate for our model, that perhaps an attribute was more appropriate
Action: jcater thinks that was ignored
<perlhead> I must admit I'm not up-to-date with the minute details of the patches.
<StyXman> jcater: may be I'm too stupid yet
Action: perlhead nods
<jcater> and there was concern with how a <scrollbox> (or was it <scrollbar>) would fit in with our model
<jcater> StyXman: no
<jcater> I'm not trying to say that
<jcater> I *fully* admit we've been careless
<StyXman> jcater: uh, <scrollbox>'es were dropped.
<jcater> and haven't given you guys the attention you need
<StyXman> jcater: no, I'm admiting that
Action: jcater thought they were in the latest patchsets I got
<jcater> did you notice we got the netrc patch in this weekend?
<StyXman> now, theer's a <scrollbar>, but I think I didn't submited patches
<perlhead> I think we have two issues here:
<perlhead> Or better, two kinds.
<perlhead> Technical issues are, IMO, the least pressing.
<perlhead> We *are* aligned with GNUe's direction.
<perlhead> Of course, this doesn't mean that we won't ever have diverging views.
<perlhead> We like to think that we are at least able to contribute some original thinking.
<perlhead> This will most likely cause a few discussions and disagreements in the future.
<perlhead> But that's for the good of the project.
<perlhead> No dissens at all is bad for a project's health.
<perlhead> Anyway, we *won't* do stuff that hasn't been agreed upon.
<jcater> I agree
<jcater> with everything you said
<jcater> and I admit
<perlhead> So any technical issues that arise in the future will be discussed, and settled, and that's that.
<jcater> we have a problem
<jcater> but where do we go from here?
<perlhead> Another typical day in free software development.
<perlhead> The problem that looks harder to solve is of a more practical nature.
<perlhead> You guys are *swamped*.
<StyXman> jcater: well, now we're trying to resync with *the* gnue and then, I guess, resubmitt the patches...
<perlhead> You do great work, and have created an amazing project. That takes a lot of effort.
<perlhead> We acknowledge that, we know that you are not ignoring our patches.

<siesel> jcater: it seems, that parameters can be defined correctly in a gfd file, because <cparam> just take a "name" and no "value" attribute.
<siesel> If it should be that way, how can I define a default value?
<jcater> hrm
<jcater> in reports, I had a separate <parameter> tag
<jcater> that defined valid parameters and any default values
Action: jcater didn't think about default values w/forms
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> cparam is a place holder
<jcater> for parameters to be substituted in Conditions
Action: jcater was reading technote 00003.txt
<jcater> or by adding a <cparam> tag to the gnue forms definition file.
<jcater> <cparam> does not set a parameter
<jcater> a prime example
<jcater> (an example of how I use it)
<siesel> yes, but just defining that we will use a parameter X doesn't make much sense for me, why not import the parameter from report definition?
<jcater> huh?
<jcater> oh
<jcater> yeah
<siesel> sorry, I mean why not use the same tag in forms as in reports.
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> we should
<siesel> I just saw, that the <parameter> tag in report has quite a few attributs.
<siesel> I don't know if we could use/need/implement all of them ( 'name' 'required' 'limited' 'default' 'description' 'source' 'type' )
<jcater> we at least need 'type' and 'default'
<siesel> 'description' would be good too. (although we have to provide a "--show-user-parameters" command line option :(
<jcater> true
<jcater> geeze, siesel
<jcater> are you trying to make me work :)
<siesel> thats my job, isn't it? ;)
<siesel> btw. what does "limited" and "source" means?
<jcater> that is primarily for reports
<jcater> I don't see that being a use for forms
<jcater> but in reports
<jcater> the plan was to have a gnue-reports client
<jcater> that would prompt for the parameters
<jcater> if they weren't specified on the command like
<jcater> and source= could point to a datasource that would give valid values
<jcater> and limited= would specify the valid values
<jcater> (neither of those 2 options are implemented)
<siesel> ah. 
Action: siesel sees a light :)
<siesel> we still could use "source" in forms, because like in the example in 0003.txt,  the exchangerate parameter could be f.e. provided by a database. It would be great if the parameter code could be shared between reports and forms, even if the normal forms user never will use <parameter> tags in form files
<siesel> using parameter tags with source attributs could be a SQL less solution replacing "simpleQuery" commands in triggers
<jcater> erm
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> that wasn't my intention
<jcater> imho that's making parameters too complex
<jcater> i.e., then you have a datasource
<jcater> not a parameter
<siesel> sorry, I misunderstood "jcater] and source= could point to a datasource that would give valid values"
<jcater> siesel: but that was not for runtime
<siesel> I just read "source=  could point  to a datasource that would provide values"
<jcater> that was to prompt the user for a value to pass to the reports engine
<siesel> possibly its better to have a command line option like "--read-parameter-from"
<siesel> nevertheless, I think the main usage for parameters in forms is to send information from a main form to a popup subform.
<jcater> I agree
<siesel> IMHO its just would be easier to share the parameter definition with reports than create a new one
<siesel> dunno how much work it is to combine it with forms :)

<Mr_You> hi
<psu> hi Mr_You
<Mr_You> have some quick UI driver questions
<Mr_You> lemme know if this is documented..
<Mr_You> I'm looking for comments on what I might "seperate" in my code.. which would be used in the perl module/library.
<Mr_You> for others
<filc> Hi psu
<Mr_You> for example, should I put "everything" except the actual UI rendering?
<siesel> jcater: that 100% ok for me. btw. what do you think about that reload parameter in the allowedValues(reload=0) trigger function (see 0003.txt). 
<Mr_You> so that way other perl people can make their own interfaces..
<Mr_You> hmm
<Mr_You> this is gonna  be wicked..
<Mr_You> heh
<siesel> I haven't fully tested it (and I don't think, that it will work with dropdown entries at the moment), but If you think that it make sense then I have a small patch to implemet it
<Mr_You> ehh guess I'm on my own heh
siesel (jan@dial-213-168-97-135.netcologne.de) left irc: "has to run"
<jcater> Mr_You: separate in what way?
<Mr_You> ie. put certain functions in the library/module
<Mr_You> functionality
<Mr_You> I'm working on a GNUe Forms Client perl module.. then I'll have code that uses that.. so I'm just trying to seeif anyone has any general comments on what would be put in the module.
<Mr_You> like, obviously I would put the "get gfd" function in the module
<Mr_You> somehow I would need to put some widget stuff in there.. or hmm
<Mr_You> but I have to consider the most efficient method of integrating the module with user code
<Mr_You> understand?
Nick change: sshack_zzz -> sshack
<sshack> Morning.
<psu> sshack: only for non-trivial values of TZ ;-)
<Mr_You> just looking for comments before I start doing the hardwork of planning
<sshack> uhm, only for TZ values > PST8PDT. 
Action: jcater is back (gone 01:56:16)
<sshack> Well, <= -8 really
<psu> Mr_You: I think the key message is to think about how much you have to do in perl and 
<psu> how much you can reuse 
<Mr_You> I guess the best way to explain might be.. I'm isolating GNUe perl functions in the module so that multiple interfaces could be created from that module.
<psu> i.e. I would definantly re-use GNUe Common 
<Mr_You> exactly psu
<psu> and you might get 90% of what you want for 10% of the effort by just teaching 
<Mr_You> oh ok, how would I use GNUe Common?
Action: psu is hoist by his own petard
<psu> there's some docs somewhere, I'm sure
<psu> jamest wrote something for reinhard when we decided to make appserver use common
<psu> and you might get 90% of what you want for 10% of the effort by just teaching 
<psu> the python version of forms to handle wrapped perl triggers
<Mr_You> hmm 
<psu> but, this is free s/w and it's your itch ;-)
<filc> is ther an LXR for gnue at the moment?
<Mr_You> the php forms client has its owncommon
<Mr_You> hmm I see
<jcater> filc: there was, but I don;t think it's working right
<psu> does it? I thought siesel had decided to use the python one
<filc> jcater: thanks... thought it might be just me...
<Mr_You> it has a common.php file: # DESCRIPTION:
<Mr_You> # database abstraction part for phpforms 
<Mr_You> # (a bit like gnue-common, but using php)
<Mr_You> I don't see where it might attempt to link against something else.
Nick change: gontran -> gon_lunch

<Mr_You> perl_head
<der_edoc> mr you and psu MY understand (as im probably the source)
<der_edoc> was that jan originally was writing php version of common (i.e. doing his own db management)
<der_edoc> then he stumbled into master/detail and said, 'dang you guys are doing a lot more than db abstraction how can i use common'
<der_edoc> at which point he started work on gnu-rpc in gnue common
<der_edoc> and started accessing the db funtions of common via xml-rpc (or so thats how i understood it)

<filc> what's the update policy submitting patches... say if I've found some typos in the docs, or maybe a howto for redhat 7.3?
<filc> policy ^on^ submitting
<der_edoc> sigh sore subject right now
<der_edoc> for now sumbit to info@gnue.org
<der_edoc> if its for other than minor documentation we will need copyright assignment
<der_edoc> we are working out a  FORMAL patch policy
Action: filc is feeling there is a high barrier of entry to gnue... :(
<gontran> word.  but don't be discouraged.  think of the payoff :)
<der_edoc> filc: well its not a simple application
<der_edoc> so certainly it will be higher than some
<der_edoc> as to copyright assignment, consider it a barrier, but have solace that there will be no scares (like there was with python recently) about who can protect the code and whom cant
<der_edoc> as for 'formal' patch procedure that will exist to LOWER barrier to entry
<der_edoc> i.e. right now its patch by committee so some patches dangle and dont get committed in timely manner by instituting a procedure it will make sure patches dont go out to the ether ;)
<der_edoc> we certainly take criticiism on how to make it better

<chillywilly> what's the patch for?
<der_edoc> psu: i didnt know sunderland was playing today ;(
<der_edoc> er :)
<filc> LOL... just a one word change in the README...
<chillywilly> README in appserver?
<chillywilly> or in the old geas?
<filc> no.. the readme at the head of the tree... gnue/README
<chillywilly> oh
<chillywilly> GEAS is sorta the official name though
<chillywilly> even if the new module is named appserver
<chillywilly> GNUe Application Server
<chillywilly> GEAS
<filc> yup... doh...
Action: filc going to hide in corner.
<chillywilly> jst like official name of forms is GNUe Forms
<chillywilly> but we have a certain naming convention in CVS

Action: chillywilly sends rock filled donuts to jcater
<LuftHans> midletons makes a good, expensive shot.
<chillywilly> wassat?
<LuftHans> single-malt whiskey. $10-20/shot depending on the bar. Worth the $10-20.
<chillywilly> I don't drink
<jcater> chillywilly: but don't you get dehydrated?
<chillywilly> nope...there's plenty of ice around
<LuftHans> good, save yourself. If you decide to loes your sanity, though, do it with midletons ;-)
<chillywilly> no thanks
<chillywilly> I don't need to dull my senses in order to cope with the realities of life ;)
<filc> what's wrong with 8 pints down the local every friday and saturday night?
<LuftHans> I agree with you on that. Unfortunately I really like a couple of alcoholic beverages. I don't drink much and I never drink and drive, so I think I'm in pretty good shape.
<reinhard> filc: I highly appreciate your patch
<reinhard> we have defined it as incorrect to use the acronym "GEAS" outside the code

<filc> yup  need new versions of wxPython and co for RedHat 7.3 :(
<filc> s/yup/yuck/
<der_edoc> ?
<der_edoc> why would you need new versions of wxPython?
<der_edoc> on the redhat disks there should be python and wxpython
<filc> I'm getting errors like:
<filc> DB000:   import wxc
<filc> DB000: /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/wxPython/__init__.py:20: RuntimeWarning: Python C API version mismatch for module printfwc: This Python has API version 1011, module printfwc has version 1010.
<filc> ??? is there???
Action: filc looks
<der_edoc> which are compatiable if not tehn REd Hat is worse than i thought
<der_edoc> i.e. shipping incompatiable producs
<der_edoc> you running gnue with python2.2?
<filc> I was using the stuff from the redhat7.2 docs on gnue website... didn't check redhat7.3 disks
<filc> yep python2.2
<der_edoc> i would look on your redhat7.3 disks
<der_edoc> btw: wxPython i sdependednt on similar wxwindows and python
<der_edoc> i.e. you can use wxPython for pyton 2.0 and use with python 2.2
<der_edoc> and such
<der_edoc> so make sure if you downloaded wxPython you download the correct one for your version of python
Action: der_edoc gets red hat rpm flashbacks everytime i walk someone through an install of gnue on redhat, so forgive me if i start convulsing ;)
Action: der_edoc really needs to get our rpms working again so at least it will give dependency errors
<filc> Not finding any RPMS on the ftp mirrors of redhat....
<der_edoc> i think some are on my website

<filc> sent
<filc> is gfclient always known as gnue-forms on all platforms?
<der_edoc> i beleive it is now
<der_edoc> that was a recent name change
<der_edoc> as some other tool was shipping with name gfclient i think
<filc> OK... I'm just going through the tree updating all the places where it's used...
<filc> ... is there anyone else doing this before i finish and submit a patch?

<der_edoc> if you were using 0.3.0 i woudl say not eveyrthing got fixed but i thought cvs tree was updated with this....
<der_edoc> i dont have tree in front of me so i cant  speak to it
<der_edoc> you download cvs tarball?
<der_edoc> or get cvs from cvs?
<der_edoc> better yet how did you install cvs?
<der_edoc> did you do setup.py in each individual package dir?
<der_edoc> or did you run setup-cvs.py in the root cvs dir?
<filc> nap... looking on cvs web still says gfclient for forms/sample/intro
<filc> I ran setup.py in each individual package.. per 7.2
<der_edoc> ah for cvs probably wiser to run setup-cvs.py
<der_edoc> gives you lot more control :)
<der_edoc> plus then you can run production and cvs in parallel
<filc> booger.  I'm gonna have to install it again, using this method and update the docs I've just sent you
<der_edoc> psu: im hearing high barrier to entry a lot
<der_edoc> kevin was good enough to give us redhat 7.2 and filc updating for 7.3 someone else posted debian items
<der_edoc> please reminde me ot put them all in single location
<der_edoc> and from home page link out to 'Quick Start Guides' or such
<der_edoc> or 'newbie' docs or somethign
<der_edoc> just remeind me (no dcl so i cant remind myself) ;)
<SachaS> bye
<filc> bye
<filc> ok... just gone through the tree and replaced all gfclients with gnue-forms except for in some of the packaging/installation places where I'm not sure what I'm doing (I can handle documentation!!)
