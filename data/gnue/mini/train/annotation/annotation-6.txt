<topic>Common</topic>
<topic>Application Server</topic>


<p>Stefano Baronio (steu) asked whether <quote who="Stefano Baronio">geas 
is based on corba?</quote> Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said that GNUe Application 
Server (GEAS) was <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">being rewritten anyway, so it 
can use corba, soap, xml-rpc, other funky system</quote>. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) confirmed <quote who="Derek Neighbors">geas v1 uses corba yes</quote>. 
However, the new version <quote who="Derek Neighbors">will use gnue rpc - 
which is an rpc abstraction library - it will support XML-RPC, SOAP, CORBA 
probably right away - but its design is such that it can support any rpc 
that one wishes to write a driver for</quote>. Stefano said he was 
<quote who="Stefano Baronio">writing a generic system for distrib objects in 
corba, and I have found geas, but</quote> wasn't sure if it could help him. 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">geas is not really distributed corba 
objects - i.e. our approach is to not lock ourselves into things - the idea 
is we use rpc as a transport only - not to actually deal with the 
objects</quote>. This was true of even the first, CORBA-only, version of 
GEAS - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i.e. you defined objects via a class 
definition - that got loaded into GEAS but there was not individual IDL for 
every object</quote>. Stefano said <quote who="Stefano Baronio">my problem is 
not how to write a system like this, but how a medium developer can interoperate 
with it without knowledge of corba and c++. - for example, a VB or delphi 
developer</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">our view was that 
if you merely have an abstraction the developer really need not understand 
much of CORBA etc - as they have a lightweight CORBA api to deal with - 
instead of having to use CORBA to ineract with every object</quote>. 
Stefano said he needed a multi-platform solution that was quick to develop on.   
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">gnu enterpise doesnt have the goal 
of being a component company for vb/delphi (which it sounds like what you 
are looking for) - so i guess my short answer is that geas has little value 
in that context</quote>. However, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">there are 
plenty of folks that would discuss such things here as we discuss about 
anything</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">there is some misnomer 
that i love delphi - i think some things in delphi are great adn i think 
borland builds much better tools than say m$ - but i dont think gnue should 
be delphi</quote>. Calum Morrell (drochaid) suggested that tools 
<quote who="Calum Morrell">like kylix</quote> were better as free alternatives 
to Delphi as a generic rapid development tool.</p>
