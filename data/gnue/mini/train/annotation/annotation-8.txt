<topic>Application Server</topic>


<p>Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) asked <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">should 
the different parts of GEAS be all running as separate threads 
in one python instance, or would you rather them be in separate 
instances, communicating via gnue-common libs?</quote>. Peter 
Sullivan (psu) suggested <quote who="Peter Sullivan">I would 
guess that GEAS should be as separated as possible as you might 
want to have it on multiple servers</quote>. Andrew felt that 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">would make it more scalable, &amp;
robust, imho</quote>. He noted <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">webware 
has an appserver, i think we shoudl look at that for how they 
do object caching, etc</quote>. Peter said that 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">scalability is important</quote> for 
GNUe, as <quote who="Peter Sullivan">no matter what we say, some 
people will use it as a Quicken/SAGE/M$Money clone on a single PC
[...] but at the other end you can replicate your GEAS servers as 
much as you like</quote>. Andrew suggested 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">a node controller</quote> to provide 
functionality such as <quote who="Andrew Mitchell">automagical 
failover, so that transactions aren't lost</quote>.</p>
