<Arturas> Hello guys :)
<Arturas> i have one idea about i18n (internationalization) - why i doesn't work in forms
<Arturas> now we create all data (labels & etc.) as strings, encoded in UTF-8
<Arturas> UTF-8 is unicode variable-width encoding
<Arturas> the problem was that standart ASCII characters (ASCII code < 128)
<Arturas> were displayed correctly
<Arturas> and other characters (national characters)
<Arturas> were displayed incorrectly
<Arturas> and there was no idea
<Arturas> why were displayed incorrect symbols
<Arturas> there is possibility
<Arturas> UTF-8 is variable-width encoding
<Arturas> that means that all characters that fall in standard ASCII range (ASCII code < 128)
<Arturas> have "one-to-one"
<Arturas> [i don't know the word in English]
SachaS_away (sacha@203.190.196.228) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<Arturas> "[A] in UTF-8 is [A] in ASCII"
<Arturas> and so for all characters what code are <128
<Arturas> theoretically this was thought
<Arturas> to enable read at least basic text without any i18n characters if you have no UTF-8 support
<Arturas> in forms
<Arturas> when we have i18n character
<Arturas> that's width is 2 bytes
<Arturas> (if it's width would be 1 byte, that would be "synonim" for ASCII)
<Arturas> (and it's code would be both in ASCII and UTF-8 < 128)
<Arturas> it is displayed incorrectly
<Arturas> i think it is possible
<Arturas> that 2 byte width i18n character in form
<Arturas> is considered as two one-byte width ASCII characters
<Arturas> that's why we get so strange results and constant results
<Arturas> forms work perfectly with one-byte width characters
<Arturas> if we go in localization
<Arturas> we can have forms display
<Arturas> local characters (real i18n characters; correctly)
<Arturas> but these would be encoded not in UTF-8
<Arturas> but in, for example, koi8
<Arturas> iso-8859-13
<Arturas> or even iso-8859-1
<Arturas> but this is one-byte encoding, not unicode
alexey (Alexey@195.151.214.33) left irc: "[x]chat"
<Arturas> i'm not sure about this, but i guess that Aditya has not made support for UTF-8
<Arturas> but only support for his local one-byte width fonts
<Arturas> hope i expressed myself clearly enough
<Arturas> comments?
<ra3vat> may be his fonts are not one-byte width as he did much more then me
<ra3vat> with one-byte encoding there are not much problem just setting everithing up properly
<ra3vat> agreed with above how it is interpreted now
<Arturas> his fonts had to be one-byte width
<Arturas> lower part of font
<Arturas> (<128)
<Arturas> was basic ASCII
<Arturas> and upper part (>128)
<Arturas> his countries charset
<Arturas> his country's charset
<Arturas> he had had the same problems as we
<Arturas> if his fonts were real unicode
<Arturas> (although i might make a mistake here :)
<ra3vat> i think forms works properly with utf or unicode strings right now
<ra3vat> we should look closely on wxpython and system level
<Arturas> somewhere in their docs found short and interesting string that
<ra3vat> properly in internal representation
<Arturas> 'unicode is not yet fully supported' :(
<ra3vat> can give a link?
<Arturas> hm
<Arturas> wxwindows
<Arturas> sory
<Arturas> www.wxwindows.org
<Arturas> and then they
<Arturas> offer to download documentation
<Arturas> in different formats
<Arturas> :/
<ra3vat> ok and there is differences between linux and w32 status of that support i think (derek gave an reference to this also) 
<Arturas> may be no
<Arturas> may be not
<Arturas> linux as well as w2k support unicode
<Arturas> i think it might be their wxwindows problem
<Arturas> not of the base-system
<ra3vat> the reference was to wxpython problem that encoding=wxFONTENCODING_UTF8 is not supported yet under linux
<ra3vat> that's why i'm trying to test it under w32

<dneighbo> ?
<jamest> you just wanting to see whats in the files?
<dneighbo> no
<dneighbo> i have a python program

<dneighbo> i basically looking for somethign in python that given prefix*.txt for a dir
<dneighbo> can give me back a list or dictionary of files matching that patter
<dneighbo> n
<jamest> in unix the *.txt is expanded prior to being passed to the program

<jamest> myfoo *.txt
<dneighbo> jamest: not on unix
<jamest> is passed as

<Arturas> something like "cmd dir C:\*.txt|type"
<nickr> that'd be pretty unportable
<Arturas> unportable to what?
<nickr> anything other than windows
<Arturas> => to linux?
<nickr> anything other than windows
<jcater> that's pretty portable imho
<jcater> it's just overkill for unix
<Arturas> ok, how many OSes do you know exept for win and nix to support GNUe?

<jcater> but overkill isn't the same as unportable

<jamest> download the rescue and root floppy images
<jamest> boot from resuce
<jamest> put root in when prompted
<jamest> configure network and select it as the source for your files
<dneighbo> will it do apt via network?
<dneighbo> so this is all via conf files
<nickr> dneighbo: get the netinst CD
<dneighbo> netinst CD?
<nickr> dneighbo: search for woody netinst CD, hownload the image (30 megs), burn it, boot it
<jamest> yes apt over network
<jamest> if you can do that why not grab the real deal?
<jamest> the 2 floppy approach is 1.44*2 MB :)
<nickr> the real deal is 8 x 600 megs
<jamest> lol
<jamest> true
<nickr> actually to netinst woody you need 6 disks
<nickr> well, I guess the have a 4 disk one
<dneighbo> you have a url
<nickr> floppies
<nickr> dneighbo: don't you know how to use google? you are such a baby. Just a sec.
<dneighbo> dont worry not for me having to tell someone :)

<nickr> don't worry about the nasty warnings, the people I've suggested this method to have had good luck with it
<Arturas> :) funny problem - how do i cat all files in the folder and in all subfolders?
<nickr> yep
<nickr> find . -print |xargs cat
<Arturas> and if i want find some string in the files, so i have to add "|grep strin"?
<Arturas> and if i want find some string in the files, so i have to add "|grep string"?
<nickr> er
<nickr> yea
<nickr> Unless you only want to cat files with specific strings
<Arturas> ? what do you mean by 'specific string'?
<Arturas> i'd like to fing one string
<Arturas> somewhere in files
<Arturas> so i do cat
<Arturas> for all files
<Arturas> and grep for the cat
<nickr> probably
<nickr> it'd be better to do find . -print | xargs grep "string"
<nickr> because that will print out tnhe file name also
<nickr> what is your obsession wil catting files?
<Arturas> that's one nix command for viewing contents of file that i know
<Arturas> so
<Arturas> i'm using what i know :)

<Harald1> am I right, that gnue depends on python > 2.1? If yes should I report code whose only purpose python 1.5.2 compatibility is via dcl as a ticket or as a wo, or shouldn't I do anything?
<dneighbo_> i dont understand the question
<dneighbo_> gnue depends on python 2.0 2.1 2.2
<dneighbo_> i.e. > 1.5.2
<dneighbo_> 2.2 python has some bugs
<Harald1> and GConfigParser.py contains code which is only needed for 1.5.2
<dneighbo_> gotcha
<dneighbo_> um submit it as a ticket probably
<dneighbo_> or work order
<dneighbo_> either way would be fine
<Harald1> ok
<dneighbo_> were you one i told to send patches via dcl?
<dneighbo_> if so send to info@gnue.org as well because dcl gateway appears to be eating attachments
<Harald1> one can send patches via dcl?
<dneighbo_> well there is way to include 'attachments'
<dneighbo_> to workorder/tickets
<dneighbo_> so if you find a bug and fix it
<dneighbo_> submit it as a bug and attach the patch
<dneighbo_> then when patch applied ticket can be closed etc
<dneighbo_> but for somereason attachments arent working quite right and i havent had time to look into it

<chillywilly> you lazy bum
Action: jcater looks around
<jcater> me?
<jcater> I do have concerns about people submitting bugs against cvs head
<jcater> as that's a given :)
<chillywilly> it's just a good way for you to keep track of them ;)
<chillywilly> muwaahahahha
<jcater> I'd prefer to handle it like I handle it here at work
<jcater> "um, yeah... well, just email me"
<jcater> 6 months later
<jcater> "what email? I don't recall an email?!!?"
<chillywilly> heh
<jcater> "besides, 90% of the time, it's a user error... just try again"
<chillywilly> quality work
<jcater> well, actually I get away with it here at work
<jcater> because usually the "bug mysteriously disappeared and has never happened again"
<chillywilly> a BTS should be more than just users reporting bugs, I think it should be more like a TODO type thing for developers too ;)
<jcater> iow, they did something wrong the first time and won't admit it
<jcater> um, yeah
<ajmitch> morning
<jcater> afternoon
<ajmitch> howsit?

<chillywilly> ok, I am taking a chance but you guyys have to tell me what's shitty about this logo --> http://frell.dyndns.org/~danielb/
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> is that a bird taking a crap?
<chillywilly> uh?
<chillywilly> it's the liberty bell silly
<jcater> dude
<jcater> that seriously looks like a yellow bird
<jcater> providing some, um, droppings
<jcater> incidentally, don't rip off our logo :)
<jcater> that's not nice
<jcater> the "Free Your Enterprise" :)
<chillywilly> how's that your 'logo'?
<jcater> ok
<jcater> sales mark
<nickr> its a tagline not a logo
<chillywilly> I thought it was somethign different
<chillywilly> Free Software For Your Business
<jcater> well
<chillywilly> it's not yours then is it?
<jcater> I've been saying "free your enterprise" for over a year
<ajmitch> after watching the matrix? 'free your mind...'
<jcater> I've also said "putting the free back in free enterprise"
<jcater> then from that, I came up with "free your enterprise"
<chillywilly> when?
<nickr> saying something and having it be a servicre mark or trademark aren't the same thing :P
<jcater> nickr: in the US, sure it can
Action: jcater is well-versed in trademark law
<nickr> jcater: only if you use it as a trademark in business afaixk
<chillywilly> sue me then
<jcater> that's a big component of my responsibilities :)
<jcater> nickr: he was
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> I don't believe you said it before anyone else
<nickr> but you weren'
<nickr> t
<jcater> I was using it in a non-profit capacity
<chillywilly> the second one I heard you mention before
<jcater> and who said I wasn't using it in a business?
<jcater> I'm not... but I was curious why you assumed that :)
<nickr> beceause you are trying to claim trademark on it
<jcater> trademarks don't have to be owned by companies
<nickr> I never claimed they did.
<chillywilly> they have to be registered don't they?
<jcater> a "registered trademark" has to be registered
<chillywilly> or mayeb just in use
<jcater> just defended
<chillywilly> show me some proof where the damn thing is used in some capacity
<nickr> regular trademarks have to be defended
<jcater> a trademark has to be defended
<jcater> hence, I was defending it :)
<chillywilly> I am insulted that you accuse me of ripping off 'your' slogan
<jcater> it's a slogan I donated to GNUe
<jcater> at least as far as I'm concerned
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> bah, I thought of it plenty of times, it's nothing new
<jcater> I still say the torch looks like a little birdie taking a crap
<chillywilly> the toch does?
<chillywilly> er, torch
<jcater> ya
<chillywilly> why did I even bother asking you anyway?
<jcater> beats me
<chillywilly> everyone else seeems to know what it is
<jcater> but I was giving you an honest answer
Action: jcater will have to remember to not give honest feedback to chilly as he can't handle it
<chillywilly> oh please
<chillywilly> where's the bird at?
<chillywilly> in the flame or something?
<jcater> sigh
<chillywilly> I don't see a 'bird'
<jcater> the yellow flame
<jcater> looks like a bird mooning everyone
<dneighbo_> um jcater you will hate FSF
<chillywilly> inside it?
<dneighbo_> one of the requests brad has for dcl is 'nagware' :)
<jcater> see the fluffy tail
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> nagware?
<dneighbo_> i.e. you can set a 'date' on a ticket and have it notify you if the date passes
<ajmitch> ooh
<chillywilly> oh
<dneighbo_> so people can set nags to tickets
<jcater> if that happens on ash, I'll use my mighty r00t poweres
<dneighbo_> so not only can they give you work
<dneighbo_> they can be reminded when you arent doing it :)
<chillywilly> ban nagware now (tm)
<ajmitch> nagware good! nagware good!
<drochaid> NAGWARE NAGWARE NAGWARE NOW !!!!
Action: ajmitch is saying this from a users perspective ;)
Action: drochaid returns to the corner
Action: ajmitch gives drochaid a cheer
<jcater> seeing as to how most of the stuff in designer's BUGS file is pre-0.1.0, I definitely don't want nagware
<jcater> :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> jcater: you just need nagware with an option to disable ... or ostricise

<chillywilly> and jcater you're just going to have to get everyone to raise a stink before I will stop using it

<chillywilly> I can't even remember last week half the time
<jcater> chillywilly: I think that's unprofessional and rude... but I expect no less :)
<jcater> it sounds like something ximian would do
<dtm> hi all
<jcater> howdy
<ajmitch> yo dtm
<dtm> werd
<dtm> HOW ARE YOU GENTLEMEN
<chillywilly> no one deemed it an 'official' slogan and you bet your ass if it was anywhere on tyhe web site I wouldn't use it, but somehting someone said once in IRC doesn't seemt o count much for me as I didn't come to the slogan thinking oh people said this beofre so I'll go steal it
<ajmitch> dtm: WE ARE FINE THANKS
<chillywilly> and to assumke so like you said the first time is insulting
<chillywilly> but I can find a different one to make people happy
<jbailey> dtm: <AOL/>
<chillywilly> jcater: but I just proved your inital claim to be incorrect so my mission is complete ;P
<jcater> bah
<chillywilly> go look your damn self
<jcater> I'm still not so sure
<chillywilly> if you don't believe me
<jcater> but I'll take it at your word
<jcater> as it's not exactly worth arguing over
<chillywilly> I just greedd through the logs
<chillywilly> er, grepped
<jcater> I've been here longer than those logs, btw
<jcater> but that's fine
<chillywilly> and I've been here longer than you
<jcater> my whole point was that it was a GNUe thing
<chillywilly> and I have all the logs in my stash
<jcater> and I thought it improper for you to use for your thing
<chillywilly> sure, and I renig it then
<chillywilly> I will not use it
<jcater> and I'll concede I might not be the first
<chillywilly> but I didn't some to it through a GNUe thing
<chillywilly> just thoguht it sounded cool
<jcater> it does
<jcater> which is why I wanted GNUe to use it :)
<ajmitch> so we have agreement then?
<jcater> yes
<chillywilly> then put it up on the site as the current slogan sucks
<ajmitch> ok, every kiss & make up
<jcater> neither of us like kiwis
<jcater> that's the agreement
<jcater> right chillywilly?
<chillywilly> right

<dneighbo_> btw: jcater started the phrase and mr you completed it 
<dneighbo_> so you are right there
<dneighbo_> BUT jcaters point was it was a gnue slogan, not necessarily that he said it
<dneighbo_> furthermore looking back at the log i like nickr's slogan
<dneighbo_> <nickr> GNUe doesn't smell like ass
<ajmitch> ah, still good to have an argument, right? ;)
<ajmitch> hehe
<jcater> rofl
<jcater> I missed that slogan
<jcater> I like it too
<jcater> how about"

<chillywilly> fuck them up their stupid asses
<dneighbo> i have talked to linas about this before
<dneighbo> i wont state his opinion as its in the archives publically now :)
<dneighbo> but its a humorous discussion
<ajmitch> why can't GNUe have a decent flamewar?
<dneighbo> we did
<dneighbo> just no one from gnue was involved :)
<chillywilly> uh?

<jcater>  really really wanna zigazig ah
<jbailey> Ah.
<jbailey> Spice girls.
<jcater> jbailey: what's the protocol for requesting that a library be added to debian?
<jcater> or do you have to find a friendly maintainer and wine & dine them?
<jbailey> jcater: Get a Debian Developper to build the package and upload it.
<jbailey> Or build the package yourself and find a sponsor.
<jcater> ah
<jcater> ok
<jcater> I may try that route
<jbailey> But it won't happen between now and Woody's release.  I think they've blocked new packages for now.
<jbailey> Which library?
<jcater> the python bindings for Sablotron (an XSLT processor)
<jcater> sablotron is in woody
<jcater> and the perl and php bindings are there
<jcater> but no one did the python ones :(
<jbailey> I'd offer, but I don't speak snake.
<jcater> I may give it a try... it'd be good for me to learn :)
<jbailey> =)
<jcater> btw, I'm not gonna complain about woody being locked down :)
<jcater> if that brings us closer to a release
<jbailey> *lol*
<jbailey> No kiddin'
<jbailey> I think the release manager isn't enough of an asshole
<jcater> is there a really good place to learn how to do debs
<jcater> like for redhat, the "extreme rpm" book was good
<jcater> or something like that
Action: jcater has mostly regressed his redhat memories
<jcater> is the "Debian Policy Manual" readable?
<jcater> or is it like most policy manuals?
<jbailey> It's like most policy manuals.
<jbailey> There's a reason it takes so long to get through the DD process.
<jcater> I don't doubt it
Action: jcater was hoping he could just do a deb package and send it to one of the big python packagers and hopefully he'd like/approve and upload for me
<jcater> is that a reasonable goal
<jcater> or do I have it all backwards?
<jcater> ewe
<jcater> after reading thru the manual
<jcater> maybe I better stick to gnue gruntwork
<jbailey> *lol*
<jbailey> If I spoke snake better, I would've had gnue packages up.  I still can't get gnue-f to run.
