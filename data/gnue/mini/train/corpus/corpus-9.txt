<dnSleep> much more stable than evolution much smaller footprint
<ToyMan> does sylpheed have a contact book?
<dsmith> Sylpheed does have an address book.
<ToyMan> and yes, I like those calanders and todo's..
<dsmith> Sylpheed also uses LDAP and can read palm Address.DB files
<ToyMan> hmm. cool.
Action: ToyMan portinstalls sylpheed.
<dnSleep> its not an outlook so im not advertising it as that
<dnSleep> but if you want a solid fast email client 
<dnSleep> sylpheed seems to fit that bill :)
<dnSleep> i had to drop to evolution for the wife
<dnSleep> as she really wanted to view html mail inline etc etc etc
<dnSleep> i've made my peace with how it works and rather like it now
<jamest> does it still eat mailboxes randomly?
<dsmith> Sylpheed is also easy to hack.  I munged mine to work through a web proxy.
<jcater> I use sylpheed personally and in our callcenter
<jcater> the users seem to adjust to it well
<jamest> mine didn't :(

<drochaid> just once psu?
<drochaid> that's pretty good for the M6
<psu> & I thought "no, can't be right"
<drochaid> lol
<psu> I tended to use the quiet bits of the M6 normally
<dneighbo> i think watching mold grow might be more entertaining than running a month lclose and auditing it
<psu> the bits that go up towards the jocks
Action: dneighbo should make the bloody accountants do the auditing ;)
<drochaid> I tended to use the M6 in all it's entirity
Action: dneighbo runs before psu can choke me ;)
<drochaid> long drive from Winchester to Glasgow :(
<psu> dneighbo: it;s like racoons, if you encourage them, it's your own fault
<drochaid> dneighbo: you can't trust an accountant to audit man!!
<dneighbo> psu what has happened it i would have them audit them
<psu> I did Winchester to Sunderland, which was bad enuf
<dneighbo> and like 8 months later i would get an exception to handle
<dneighbo> and it would be an utter bitch to fix
<dneighbo> or find supporting detail as to why it was CORRECT
<dneighbo> so now i do my own audits before i give them to the accounts
<psu> went M3-A34-M40-M42-M1-A1(M)-A19 just for the heck of it
<dneighbo> and document the ones they will flag, with little notes as to why i am right :)
<dneighbo> it has helped oddly enough
<drochaid> I normally did ...M3-A34-M40-M42-M6-M74-M73-many wee A and B roads to my door :)

reinhard (rm@62.47.44.208) left irc: "When all else fails, read the instructions"
<dneighbo> i.e. the United States is not an island
<dneighbo> perhaps the continent but not the states
<nickr> good point
<dneighbo> mexico and canada prevent that
<dneighbo> an interesting question is
<dneighbo> australia is a continent that is an island
<dneighbo> as well as a country that is an island
<drochaid> dneighbo: but by the same rule ... no country in the UK is an Island either
<dneighbo> is there any island that is a city

<drochaid> copenhagen
<dneighbo> drochaid i agree, i never called it an island

<dneighbo> samso
<nickr> Denmark is a crazy country
<dneighbo> laeso
<nickr> I think Denmark should be illegal
<drochaid> dneighbo: they are multiple islands
<dneighbo> but this is good proof that isle cities exist :)
<drochaid> and the little pin prick they show as copenhagen actually runs most of that island ... you get a great view from the air
<drochaid> and superb views of the dolphins as you are only a few feet off the sea before you land :D
<dneighbo> singapore is most interesting and i think might fit the bill
<dneighbo> the things you can learn in #gnuenterprise is truly amazing
<drochaid> LMFAO
<drochaid> Junction 6 on the M6 is one of the worst places for speed cameras!!!!
<drochaid> I've NEVER managed to do more than 50mph there
<drochaid> even after midnight
<psu> i have an infallible method for avoiding speed cameras
<drochaid> normally 5mph is considered really really good
<psu> stick to the speed limit ;-)
<drochaid> don't speed?
<drochaid> most of the time, so do I
<drochaid> I've never gone more than 120mph .. ish .. anyway
Action: dneighbo is amused you speak in mph?
<dneighbo> instead of kph
<dneighbo> er kmph
<psu> any police officers monitoring this channel, please remember that irc logs are not valid in a court of law
<dneighbo> rofl
<drochaid> lol
Action: dneighbo is curious what is mph?
<psu> In the Uk, all road distances are miles
<psu> miles per hour
<psu> etc
<dneighbo> wow
<dneighbo> why then on US cars do we get guages that read in mph and km ph?
<drochaid> so that's about .. 190kmph ish?
<psu> most other weights & measures are metric however
<psu> As much as anything, I think the cost of changing every single road sign in the country
<psu> means things are unlikely to change
<drochaid> and the kmph doesn't fit exactly to the existing speeds
<drochaid> can you imagine the fights if the max speed ended up being 2 kmph lower than they are as mph? ;)
<nickr> they use Kmph in Canada I think
<dneighbo> nickr probably in europe too
<dneighbo> outside UK(ireland, scotland)
<nickr> yea
Action: dneighbo desperately wishes we used the metric system here
<dneighbo> purely for mathematical ease
<dneighbo> and 24 hour time
<nickr> the nice thing is you can use 24 hour time
<nickr> the metric system is harder to interoperate though
<dneighbo> yip
<dneighbo> part of me wonders why we made timezones and such
<dneighbo> and instead dont just all run UTC time ;)
<psu> dneighbo: as a US politics geek
<psu> I always wondered why the people who basjhed on 
<dneighbo> though i suppose i see the value there much more so than the american weight and major system
<psu> about the "intent of the Founding Fathers"
<psu> never took this to logical conclusion
<psu> Constitution says pres & congress elections must be same day throught union
<psu> obviously to avoid people knowing other states' results before they vote 
<psu> in today's world 
<psu> to meet the FF's intentions
<psu> you would have to say same day & times 
<dneighbo> i agree 1000 percent
<dneighbo> as with internet and information stores
<psu> a bit unfair on the hawaiians,  I know
<dneighbo> news can travel so readily
<dneighbo> however as our last presidental election proved
<dneighbo> despite technology
<psu> but stops the "CA doesn't matter" syndrome
<dneighbo> our inept governtment takes up to 30 days to actually COUNT the votes
<dneighbo> personally
<dneighbo> the more i see of things and mroe i study history
<dneighbo> the founding fathers woudl abhor the US today
<dneighbo> i never think they intended for the federal govt to be so large
<dneighbo> and have such control
<dneighbo> iirc they were very pro independent state rule for most things
<nickr> yea
<psu> the problem is that states can be tyrannical as well
<dneighbo> in many ways i would like to return to that
<psu> & the federal constitution doesn't provide mechanisms for that
<dneighbo> as i think that the federal govt is turning largely into a joke
<nickr> its easier for the other stats to pressure a state into being less tyrannical than for anyone to pressure the fed into that
<psu> except, arguably, the 2nd amt
<psu> but shooting the governor is a fairly extreme solution
<dneighbo> i.e. it burns through cash like a dot com w/ an blank check
<dneighbo> and the states see little in return (imho)
<dneighbo> i.e. im always curious as to what i get for my 'tax' dollars
<psu> i am in a different situation
<psu> as working for a city council
<dneighbo> psu: i work for local govt as well
<psu> 80% of our income comes from central govt
<psu> the rest from a local property tax
<dneighbo> we get state funding
<dneighbo> but not really federal funding
<psu> we used to have a business property tax
<psu> but that was "nationalised"
<dneighbo> but my point is the feds seem wasteful
<psu> we have a bit more freedom now
<dneighbo> and bills are bull crap
<dneighbo> example
<nickr> the fed is wasteful
<dneighbo> here they do things by tying unrelated crap together
<nickr> no doubt about it
<dneighbo> for example i think there is a bill
<nickr> its too big and complex to be efficient
<dneighbo> actually i know there is a bill
<dneighbo> that sets a SMOG level number
<dneighbo> if a county goes over that level more than X times in a year
<dneighbo> they no longer get Federal Road Tax money
<dneighbo> to me those are UNRELATED issues
<dneighbo> i.e. they are indirectly related
<dneighbo> so the feds pay people to MONITOR this with the road money
<dneighbo> so my road money is being paid for environmental monitoring
<dneighbo> and further more
<dneighbo> the counties in fear of losing say 1 billion in road money 
<dneighbo> will spend 30 million on air quality items
<nickr> they use road money in the worst way
<nickr> like when states started wanting to get rid of the 55 limit
<nickr> the fed used road money to try to force them into keeping it
<dneighbo> and usually that 30 million comes from the road money
<nickr> like wtf?
<drochaid> what's the speed limit on the fastest roads US side?
<psu> didn't Idaho have a spped limit of "safe and sensible" in daylight hours for a while?
<psu> 65, iirc
<drochaid> mph or kmph?
<psu> 55 in urban areas
<psu> mph
<psu> that's why radar detectors are so popular ;-)
<drochaid> heh
<nickr> 75
<nickr> depends on the state
<nickr> actually the fastest roads iirc are in Montana, where I think they have conditional limits, eg you can go as fast as is safe
<psu> i knew it was somewhere up near the top
<psu> s/Idaho/Montana
<nickr> I believe in OR they post 65 but enforce condition based limits
<nickr> same with here in NY, they post 55, but you get pulled over for obstructing traffic at that speed
<nickr> probably the same everywhere
<dneighbo> again you bring the value man :)
<dneighbo> depends on state
<dneighbo> most INTERSTATES are 75 outside city limites
<dneighbo> in side city limits 65
<dneighbo> HOWEVER back to the value
<dneighbo> and my feds are evil rap
<dneighbo> the reason the speed limit is 75
<dneighbo> and some 65
<dneighbo> is federal funding
<dneighbo> TECHNICALLY a state can set their own limits
<dneighbo> montana for example has done this
<dneighbo> HOWEVER
<dneighbo> if you go over 75 you lose all federal funding from some grant
<dneighbo> montana's share of that grant was so small they didnt care
<dneighbo> but if you drop to 65 you get an additional bonus
<nickr> they're like 'fuck it, its cheaper for you to go as fast as you want'
<nickr> :)
<dneighbo> this kind of 'gaming' by the fed is what irrates me
<dneighbo> roadbuilding and highway safety to me are DIFFERENT things
<dneighbo> btw: this is sensitive to me asain AZ public transporation and roads SUCK
<nickr> they are great in OR
<dneighbo> my biggest gripe is that government is like a monolopy
<nickr> its the high property tax all of which seems to go to ODOT
<dneighbo> you are pretty much stuck with what you have
<dneighbo> and more things that are FEDERALLY controlled the more thats true
<dneighbo> if almost everythign was at local level
<dneighbo> i could VOICE myself by moving
<nickr> `yea
<nickr> truedat
<dneighbo> i.e. if OR roads were better than AZ roads etc
<dneighbo> its MUCH more feasible for me to move from AZ to OR than it is to denounce citizenship and leave the USA
<nickr> Truie
<nickr> very true
<nickr> if we had real distributed republics we'd be all set. :)
<dneighbo> to me feds are like microsoft because they control the OS and the Applications :)
<dneighbo> so they can make dumb rules like cited above for road building (application develoeprs)
<dneighbo> that lock the local govts into their 'way'
dsmith (dsmith@cherry7.comerica.com) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<dneighbo> anyhow tirade off :)
<nickr> cause there is no other way to 'control' the states
<dneighbo> btw: as much as i am anti slavery and such
<dneighbo> i think much of the civil war was that the southern states felt they were being mandated things 
<dneighbo> and they did not want to relenquish state power
<nickr> Indeed
<dneighbo> i think the lesser states (the north) were sick of the successs of southern states and turned it into a slavery war (by name) but not by prinicple :)
<dneighbo> i.e. the north surely didnt employ the newly freed slaves
<nickr> True
<nickr> but it makes us feel good about america to say that it was to free the slaves and let the fed completely take over the US
<nickr> oh wait
<nickr> scratch that last part
<jcater> the biggest change following WWII was not slavery, but the move from mostly state-centric to federal-centric gov't
<jcater> hence the change in terminology
<drochaid> dneighbo: so how will GNUe take into account this changing speedlimit accross the US and more globally the world?
<jcater> err, WWII == civil war :)
<jcater> before civil war, we were "These United States"
<jcater> following civil war, we were "The United States"

<dneighbo> actually AZ became a state in 1912
<dneighbo> President William Howard Taft initially refused to sign the bill that accepted the Arizona Constitution, until the citizens of the territory removed a clause permitting recall of judges
<dneighbo> which of course only took 30 years :)
<dneighbo> finally wised up and found out
<dneighbo> get statehood 
<dneighbo> then immediately ratify your state constitution and put the clause back in :)
<dneighbo> which they did
<dneighbo> One of the first acts of the 1st Arizona State Legislature, was to place a constitutional amendment before the voters to add the recall of judges to the state constitution, changing it back to its original form. Voters of the new State of Arizona approved the provision for recall of judges and another amendment that provided women the right to vote in local, state and national elections.

<drochaid> uh, why?
<nickr> because CD is an open format
<nickr> but DVD is constrained by CSS
<drochaid> CD isn't an open format
<drochaid> it's tightly controlloed by philips [who created it] and matsushita-panasonic
<drochaid> what's CSS?
<drochaid> rings a bell, but can't place it
<nickr> Its a coding method that is supposed to prevent you from playing out-of-region discs 
<nickr> so they can restirct markets
<nickr> and also to guarantee that they get royalties from decoding hardware
<drochaid> yeah, I thought I knew it
<nickr> Its very easy to circumvent, but unfortunately that is illegal in mayn countries
<nickr> well in a few at least
<drochaid> philips gain a royalty from every CD sold
<nickr> phillips' thing is non-intrusive though
<nickr> CSS is exteremly intrusive
<drochaid> true

<nickr> I'm more interested in not breaking the law to listen to or copy something I bought.

<nickr> python has all the needed tools to generate the output formats
<nickr> even Flash!
<chillywilly> this is to make md5 sums of files
<chillywilly> to prove they have not been changed or made into mp3s ever ;)
<nickr> yea md5sum is good for that
<chillywilly> wtf is the package name for md5sum?
<chillywilly> apt-get install md5sum doesn't work
<nickr> its in dpkg
<chillywilly> ok

<javaguy> Evening, folks
Action: jcater is cursing java's name at the moment
<jcater> might wanna change your nick
<jcater> :)
<jcater> j/k
<jcater> howdy
<javaguy> It happens... ;)
<javaguy> Is derek here/awake
<jcater> um
<jcater> he hasn't spoken in last hour or so
<jcater> so I'm not sure
<jcater> you never know w/him
<jcater> :)
<jcater> he's a voyeurist
Action: javaguy wanted to run past an idea re: porting GNUe business objects to XSD
<javaguy> well, that's a bit more than I needed to know... ;)

<javaguy> Argh!  Pressed the wrong button
<jcater> xsd?
<jcater> url?
<javaguy> XML Schema Definition
<jcater> ah
Action: jcater thought xml schema was a replacement for dtd
<jcater> how does that relate to business objects?
<javaguy> the Primer (the first part of the RFC, which is divided into three parts) is at http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/
<javaguy> XML Schema is being used to replace DTD's, but that's only one use
<javaguy> Basically, you have an XSD (schema definition), which describes a complex structure, and then you have an XSI (Schema Instance) for each instance of said structure
<nickr> xsd is rather general
<javaguy> It also provides support for alot more complex structure than could be supported through DTD's
<chillywilly> our schema language should be ODL as that's the purpose of it, to describe the schema of an ODMS (which include object application servers)
<javaguy> i.e., enumerations, sequences, patterns
<chillywilly> but that's just me :P
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> it's like IDL + some stuff
<nickr> I think all object definition systems are masturbation
<nickr> the running dogs who disagree with me will be the first against the wall
<chillywilly> nickr: show us the way then
<javaguy> CW: ODL seems to make the most sense for internal definitions
<chillywilly> well I need to really get myself into some more of the xml voodoo
<chillywilly> but I ain't there yet
<javaguy> If you want GNUe to interface with .NET services, SOAP, etc, ODL is not going to do you much good...
<chillywilly> ah, but we have a layer to do remote communication protocols
<dsmith> Axtually, XML is bogus.  You guys should be using S-expressions instead.
<nickr> yes, sexp!
Action: javaguy has never heard of S-expressions
<chillywilly> ODL is internal ;P
Action: nickr hits javaguy with The Lisp Programming Language by Guy L. Steele, jr.
<nickr> blammo
<dsmith> There is an RFC somwhere.  By one of the guys who did RSA encryption.
<javaguy> Ow!  That thing's heavy, nickr!
<nickr> I have a copy of it actually
<nickr> its really good
<nickr> The Silver Book
<dsmith> http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/sexp.html
Action: chillywilly procedural langauges are for people that think backasswards
<chillywilly> woops, no /me
<nickr> chillywilly: you mean functional languages, don't you?
<chillywilly> xml and xslt are wannbe sexps
<chillywilly> no nickr
<chillywilly> power to lisp!
<chillywilly> j/k, yea I meant functional
<chillywilly> my bad
<dsmith> But dep down, chilly knows what's right.  THat's why it slipped out.
<chillywilly> seriously though
<chillywilly> I saw a paper/talk about someone saying just how closely related functional langauges/programming are to xml/xslt
<chillywilly> they contain the same principles
<chillywilly> operations on data
<chillywilly> i.e., they are functional
<dsmith> Right.
Maniac (User@h24-82-132-209.wp.shawcable.net) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<dsmith> People hate parens though, so they use < and > instead.  But there are twice as many now! Arrrhhh!
<chillywilly> lisp fucks with my head
<javaguy> CW: how does this transport layer work?
<nickr> heh
<chillywilly> javaguy: it's an RPC abstraction
<nickr> lisp is tricky if you learned procedurally
<chillywilly> well unfortunately I did indeed learn procedurally
<chillywilly> so lisp makes my head spin
<chillywilly> I have a paper called why functional programming
<chillywilly> or somsething like that
<chillywilly> I never made it through the whole thing
<javaguy> Ok.  So if I am writing, say a .NET service (I'm not, but for argument's sake, let's say I am), how do I go about finding out what services a particular GNUe implementation exposes?
Action: dnSleep shoves jcater
<chillywilly> dunno, dude we don't have DotGNU integration yet....juets ways to call methods remotely
<dnSleep> xslt is mine
<chillywilly> ;)
<dnSleep> go play python
<jcater> dnSleep: you better get busy, boy
Nick change: dnSleep -> dneighbo
<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> im gnueing tonight
Action: chillywilly is too
Action: jcater too
<chillywilly> (sorta anyway)
<dneighbo> is that soon enough :)
<dneighbo> i will get html done
<dneighbo> for your sample

<chillywilly>  Python ODL
<chillywilly>   
<chillywilly>     OMG IDL Binding Overview
<chillywilly>       - since python/ODL binding is based upon the OMG python binding,
<chillywilly>       we include here some descriptions of the important aspects of the
<chillywilly>       IDL binding that are needed in order to better understand the ODL
<chillywilly>       binding that follows
<chillywilly> wooo@
<jcater> gak!
<dneighbo> so you can focus on other things for the moment
<jcater> why is OMG stuff mysteriously appearing in here?
<jcater> I thougt it was #gnuenterprise
<jcater> not #objectLustersAnonymous
<dneighbo> rofl
<chillywilly> just beacss the mappings are similar in describing the objects
<chillywilly> odl is idl-like and so is our current gcd
<chillywilly> and we even use stinking corba right now
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> woooo
<jcater> well, ok
<jcater> but we are doing XML right?
<jcater> right?
Action: jcater punches chillywilly's shoulder
<jcater> right?
<chillywilly> yea, sure but either way you will use the same things to describe the objects
<javaguy> hello, Derek
<chillywilly> attributes, operations, exceptions, etc.
<chillywilly> whihc should map to python code
<chillywilly> in some fashion
<chillywilly> I like how the IDL thing handles 'modules' and 'interfaces' and how the layout the python packages
<chillywilly> it creates a namespace for us
<chillywilly> it's kinda nifty
<derek> hi
<chillywilly> ello masta

<chillywilly> uh oh

<jcater> now, the tables are turned
<jcater> mwahahaha
<chillywilly> woooo
Action: derek gets his XSLT book off the shelf and blows the dust off it
<derek> jcater: is it safe to slurp cvs for reports?
<jcater> um
<jcater> give me 2
Action: derek starts choking down some pasta while he waits
<dneighbo> grrr i know i have asked this before but i forget
<dneighbo> what is the command to remount a mount already in fstab?
<jcater> you "marry" it
<jcater> :)
<jcater> not sure
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> um if you marry it your chances of 'mounting' it dim significantly
<jcater> well, it's a catch 22
<jcater> :(

<dneighbo> that is sad, get over it an use python :)
<dyfet> lol
<dneighbo> dyfet: like how it couldnt be CHILLY's program, but rather its gnu common cpp ;)
<chillywilly> it's been this way ever since I poseted that one time
<chillywilly> well why does it work fine with an older version dneighbo?
<dneighbo> um you havent fixed your program to work with new version?
<chillywilly> yes I have
<dneighbo> why does my old contact.gfd form not work?
<dneighbo> it worked with the old forms :)
<chillywilly> spent a 15-20 changing all the method names
<dneighbo> answer my form is broken :)
<chillywilly> no way man I think it's a debian unstable issue ;)
<chillywilly> yea, that's it
<chillywilly> I blame it on glib
<chillywilly> er, glib

<derek> er pysablot
Action: jcater hasn't used any XSLT yet
<jcater> but since nickr got me debs
<jcater> I have it installed
<jcater> :)
<jcater> I was gonna play w/it tonight
<jcater> but someone shoved me and told me to stop
<jcater> you irc bully
<jcater> ;)
<derek> cool
<derek> just making sure
<jcater> are you just doing html?
<derek> foobulations still the best sample
<jcater> s/best/only
<derek> um for now just doing an html.xsl sheet as it should be easy
<derek> then i think i might make a gnumeric one
<derek> if i get VERY brave i will look at a formatted objects one
<derek> which will segway into ps, pdf etc
Action: jcater wants a text one, too
<jcater> I can do it tho
<derek> just raw text
<derek> no problemo
<derek> probably hardest part of that will be remembering the &foo; equiv for a new line
<nickr> we need an FO engine
<jcater> nickr: you volunteering?
<jcater> btw, how does everyone feel about standardizing on SVG for dynamically generated graphics
<jcater> (i.e., charts, etc)
<nickr> Hm.
<nickr> No I'm not volunteering. I'll be contented to be the local debian guru. :)
<derek> um grrrr
<derek> i feel good about svg
<derek> but i claim to know little :)
<derek> jcater: let me re run sample, i think i have questions :)
<jcater> grrr?
<derek> what is the -outfile param again
<jcater> -p
<jcater> or --destination
<derek> ?
<derek> -p or --destination 
<derek> seems like an odd choice :)
<jcater> well
<jcater> -d is taken for "debug"
<jcater> which I no longer like
<jcater> :)
Action: jcater is wanting to talk w/jamest about that
<derek> -p for put er there
<jcater> I personally don't think a single-letter parameter should be available for debug
<jcater> -p for printer
<derek> ah
<nickr> why not -o ?
<nickr> svg is a good format
<derek> my question is this
<derek> <?xml version="1.0"?>
<derek> <GNUe-report-output>
<derek>   <GNUe-report-request>
<derek>     <GNUe-request-parameter name="end">04/30/2002</GNUe-request-parameter>

<derek>     <GNUe-request-parameter name="begin">04/01/2002</GNUe-request-parameter>
<derek>   </GNUe-report-request>
<derek> what are the request and params showing in the output?
<jcater> nickr: because -o would make TOO much sense
<jcater> derek: you can ignore the GNUe-report-* stuff
<derek> is this a tep thin or no
<jcater> tep?
<derek> temp
<derek> as in xsl i cant really ignore it
<derek> if GNUe-report-ouput will be there always
<jcater> the GNUe-request are the options the report was run with
<derek> i need to know
<jcater> in case the raw xml was written to a file
<jcater> and later transformed
<derek> if the GNUe-report-request are ignorable thats easy enough
<jcater> you could know what the raw xml really is
crazymike (crazymike@mke-65-31-133-230.wi.rr.com) left irc: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)
<jcater> it's ignorable

<derek> no it shouldnt
<derek> the tag names might killme ;)
<derek> j/k btw
<jcater> well, let me retract that
<jcater> nothing is permanent at this stage :)
<jcater> but my intent is to keep them

<jcater> ok
<derek> for now i want to be 'simple'

<jcater> ok
<jcater> seems reasonable :)
<derek> how woudl a section title look?
<jcater> in html I'd picture it as an <h2>
<derek> no
<derek> i mean the markup :)
<jcater> oh
<derek> <sectionTitle>foo</sectionTitle>

<jcater> um, yeah
<jcater> that

<jcater> would work
<nickr> its easier to do xslt with attributes
<jcater> sure
<jcater> but it's not easy to spit that out
<nickr> oh.
<nickr> yea.
<jcater> actually, that'd be trivial
<jcater> if we stuck w/the &lt;tag&gt;
<derek> woo hoo have subtitles and sectdions
<jcater> formatting
<jcater> but that's hard on the eyes :)
<jcater> rofl
<derek> ok have another question
<derek>       <table width="100%">
<derek>         <tablehead>
<derek>           <colhead width="40">Name</colhead>

<derek>         </tablehead>
<jcater> anyone here get the Wall Street Journal?
<derek> im thinking width, alignment etc should possibly not be in the transformation
<derek> er the source file
<derek> this is where im torn
<chillywilly> only yuppies read the wall street journal
<derek> if we leave it out we are better off
<derek> BUT people will whine if we dont
<jcater> the headline is "Microsoft: Software Giant Struggles with Issues of Growing Up"
<chillywilly> tough noogies
<derek> i think the right way to do it is allow custom .xsl files to apply ontop of standard
<derek> but that another debate
<jcater> derek: I have ONLY one reason for doing that
<chillywilly> jcater: interesting
<jcater> I don't like it
<jcater> BUT
<jcater> this is a demo in which I need PS and Text demos
<jcater> and at the moment, I can't figure out tables :)
<jcater> so if you have a "width" we can fudge it for the moment
<jcater> now, if you know how to draw tables w/o that information
<jcater> I'm game
<jcater> long run, that's what I'd like
<jcater> and remember, this is a proof of concept markup, not necessarily "official gnue"
<jcater> that make sense?
<jcater> do you agree/disagree?
<derek> yess
<derek> im thinking what i might be able to do
<derek> if you are doing POC
<derek> i can hard code that crud in the .xsl
<derek> i.e. table
<chillywilly> derek thinking....scary
<derek> i can just make <table width="100%">
<derek> w/o you defining it
<derek> if we need this more portable than a POC
<jcater> oh, I thought you were talking about the width="40"
<derek> then i can make it read the width= in the markup etc
<derek> i was talking about all of it
<nickr> derek: never make something 100%
<derek> i will make it respect the output
<nickr> derek: make it 80% with 10% margins on each side :)
<chillywilly> nickr: and why not you frekazoid?
<derek> the question wasnt really 'i cant/wont do this'
<jcater> derek: "respect the output" ?
<derek> but rather do we want to be doing htis :)
<derek> and you answered that
<jcater> ok
<jcater> just keep that in mind w/all this
<jcater> 1) don't spend TOO much time on it
<derek> er respect the resulting .xml file the .grd creates :)
<jcater> 2) don't get worked up over what I coded
<jcater> :)
<derek> im not worked up
<nickr> use CSS, it makes size and formatting much easier
<derek> just asking questions
<derek> um CSS isnt an XSLT thing
<nickr> just say 'my templathe produces these CSS classes' and let the presentation determine what it really looks like
<nickr> No it isn't
<derek> and for other formats than html it makes no sense
<nickr> yep
<nickr> I thought you were talking about HTML
<nickr> I'm only vaguely conscious because I'm listening to Rush and getting like a major joy from it.
<jcater> Limbagh?
<chillywilly> the band?
<nickr> no
<nickr> the band yo

<derek>       </th>
<derek>     </table>
<derek>   </body>
<derek> </html>
<nickr> derek: don't use hr, use a <!DOCTYPE instead of a <meta
<jcater> yeah, I'm not sure of the <hr> either
<chillywilly> I agree with nickr
<chillywilly> actually both would be better
<chillywilly> <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<chillywilly> <html>
<chillywilly> <head>
<chillywilly> .....
<chillywilly> then the meta tag
<nickr> You don't need a <meta
<nickr> the doctype tells a smart renderer that its html
<derek> smoking
<derek> want a sample jcater?
<jcater> surely
<nickr> cracq
<derek> is ash down?
<derek> nevermind
<chillywilly> apparently
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<derek> is raw output
<derek> i.e. w/ table but not respecting your width etc
<jcater> the width wasn't necessarily for html
<derek> im thinking th is wrong but not sure
<jcater> are the table headers right?
<jcater> isn't it <tr><th>...</td>...</tr>
<jcater> ?
Action: jcater forgets
<nickr> derek: just make it link a CSS that makes it 100% dude.
<jcater> don't forget my subtotals :)
<derek> ah could be
Action: derek isnt to subtotals yet
<jcater> :)
Action: jcater is happy w/the progress :)
<jcater> my baby
<jcater> she's becoming a girl
<derek> its not 
<derek> <th><tr>
<derek> i.e. doesnt make it better
Action: derek goes to find html reference :)
<nickr> derek: th is akin to td
<derek> one thin that would help me jcater is if you could whip up a grd w/ more than one section :)
<nickr> derek: <tr><th>Header</th></tr><tr><td>Data</td></tr>
<chillywilly> akin eh?
<jcater> derek: as soon as I get this one working right :)
<jcater> that's my next step
<nickr> yes, akin
<derek> cool
<chillywilly> you're a super freak
<derek> hmm nickrthat still looks like crap
<nickr> derek: what is the output?
<chillywilly> html sucks rocks
<nickr> html is useful if you use it right :)
<derek> it just isnt pretty
<nickr> derek: I'l make it pretyt, gimme the ouput
Action: nickr is an html wizard
<derek> grrrr
<derek> damn it
<derek> i think galeon is caching the page
<jcater> ouch
<nickr> possibly
<nickr> I've had trouble looking at local files
<derek> yip that was the problem
<derek> reopened instead of refresh and it looks purdy
<derek> looks like th auto centers
alexey (~alexey@195.151.214.34) joined #gnuenterprise.
<nickr> yea
<nickr> by default most browsers render it that way
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<derek> is it with th done right
<derek> jcater: let me knock out subtotaling
<derek> and then i will look at respecting the attributes
<nickr> that looks like crap. Needs padding and borders and such
<derek> hmm pisss
<derek> i dont like how you ahve done subtotals :) it will make me work
<jcater> um
<jcater> how would you like it?
<jcater> we can change
<derek> can you explain it maybe
<jcater> my thinking was
<derek>          <subtotalRow level="2">  
<derek>             <subtotal skip=""/>
[22:58] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<derek>             <subtotal>12</subtotal>
<derek>           </subtotalRow>
<derek> is what i see
<jcater> level = 1 would be like a grand total
<jcater> level = 2 would be like a subtotal
<jcater> level 3 would be a subsubtotal (but you don't have to go that far :)
<derek> hmmm im not sure per say what this file would care about that
<jcater> hang on
<jcater> it would affect formatting
<derek> part of this could be me being an xslt newbie
<derek> at first look it would be probably easier to deal with as
<jcater> Blah 1   $1200
<jcater> Blah 2     100
<jcater>          -----
<jcater>           1300
<jcater> Blah 3   $1200
<jcater> Blah 4     100
<jcater>          -----
<jcater>           1300
<jcater>          -----
<jcater>          $2600
<jcater>          =====
<derek> <row type="total" level="2">
<derek>   <col number="3">12</col>
<derek> </row>
<jcater> um
<jcater> that's fine w/me
<jcater> actually, I think I prefer that
<derek> hey dont agree that easy
Action: Mr_You jumps in without a clue.
<derek> makes me think im wrong
<Mr_You> like usual
Action: nickr makes a nice style for it.
<derek> i say this only because my current sheet does equiv a for iteration through rows
<Mr_You> right now I have invoices where each item has a "price" and "extended price"
<derek> so by making it subtotalRow opposed to row will mean more work
<jcater> derek: I'm serious... change it
<jcater> I like that way better
<Mr_You> first is the @ price, extended price is discounted/total cost for number purchased.
<jcater> derek: at that rate, should we do
<jcater> <row type="heading"> 
<jcater> instead of
<jcater> <tablehead>
<jcater> ?
<derek> :)
Action: derek is going to leave as is for a minute and researching some xslt stuff
<derek> like attribute processing
Action: Mr_You whispers something about RPG?
<derek> i dont want to be changing things too rapidly just yet
<Mr_You> any benefits of old school RPG for report generation?  
<derek> when i posed the question i didnt expect you to agree
<Mr_You> I actually had RPG class in H.S.
<jcater> RPG?
<derek> run 
<Mr_You> hehe
<derek> old reporting language RPG
<derek> Report Program Generator or something
<Mr_You> a language for creating reports.
<nickr> look at http://nick.industrialmeats.com/proj/gnue/monthly.html :)
<derek> oh wicked
<derek> you can combine documents
<jcater> purdy
<derek> like
<derek> <report>
<nickr> with namespaces
<derek>   <title>April Purchase Orders</title>
<nickr> you can
<chillywilly> I don't want to be a cog in the corporate machine anymore
<derek>   <po filename="po3234.xml"/>
<derek>   <po filename="po3235.xml"/>
<derek>   <po filename="po3236.xml"/>
<derek> </report>
<derek> yummy i think we can do some wicked stuff
<Mr_You> cw: take a vacation
<jcater> cw: marry rich
<jcater> err, marry wealth
<Mr_You> but then, I tend to think life shouldn't be about 2-3 vacations a year..
<derek> hmmm we can do formulas in xslt if we so desire
<chillywilly> nah, I think I will just have to do things my way
<jcater> derek: just pagenumbers and the like :)
<Mr_You> I like the idea of working while vacationing.. so you're vacationing 12 times a year
<derek> hmm it can do sorting and the likes too
<jcater> does it do dishes?
<chillywilly> does it make coffee?
<chillywilly> and donuts?

<derek> jcater: well i have it respecting attributes :)
<derek> but its not pretty
<jcater> that's ok
<jcater> we have nickr
<derek> i.e. you specfication of 100% makes it ugly
Action: jcater thinks you can remove the width=100%
<jcater> as I don't know what crack I was smoking at the time
<jcater> the table column widths are actual max character widths
<jcater> which may or may not be relative in html output
<jcater> but was mainly for text/ps
Action: chillywilly is away: hitting the crack pipe
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 00:00:03)
<jcater> derek: regrab cvs
<jcater> the format hasn't changed
<jcater> but I fixed a bug
<nickr> derek: did you even look at the version I made?
<derek> nickr: why doesnt this work
<derek> <html>
<derek> <head>
<derek> <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
<derek> <title>Monthly Accounting Foobulation Report</title>
<derek> <style type="css/text">
<derek> table { 
<derek> 	  width: 80%;
<derek> 	  margin-left: 10%;
<derek> 	  margin-right: 10%;
<derek> 	}
<derek> 	td {
<derek> 	  padding: 0.5em;
<derek> 	  border-style: solid;
<derek> 	  border-width: thin;
<derek> 	  border-color: black;
<derek> 	}
<derek> 	th {
<derek> 	  padding: 0.5em;
<derek> 	  border-style: solid;
<derek> 	  border-width: thin;
<derek> 	  border-color: black;
<derek> 	}
<derek> 	h1 {
<derek> 	  text-align: center;
<derek> 	}
<derek> 	h2 {
<derek> 	  margin-left: 5%;
<derek> 	  margin-right: 5%;
<derek> 	  text-align: left;
<derek> 	}
<derek> 	hr {
<derek> 	  margin-left: 5%;
<derek> 	  margin-right: 5%;
<derek> 	}
<derek>     </style>
<derek> </head>
<derek> as i cant use what you put
<derek> as the <!--
<derek> dicks with the xsl sheet
<derek> and i end up with
<derek> <style></style>
<derek> i suppose i could use CDATA
<derek> nickr: i looked at the version you made but struggling to implement it
<jcater> but I fixed a bug
^chewie (~chewie@flemingi.dsl.visi.com) left #gnuenterprise.
<derek> nickr: ?
<derek> hmmm if i remove that text="css/text" works fine
<jcater> how odd
<derek> prolly will choke the snot out of old browsers though
<jcater> methinks too
<nickr> derek: you should move the stylesheet to a separate file
<nickr> derek: I just stick it in there so you could see
<derek> for now it works
<nickr> anyway, it looks a hell of a lot better than the raw html :)
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<derek> notice date and foobulations header are respecting the xml file alignment
<derek> xslt also does formatting
<derek> note the 12's on the bottom are the subtotals
<derek> but obviously the style sheet is wrong :)
<jcater> rofl
<derek> as i was doing for loop for row
<derek> then did for loop for subtotalrow
<derek> and why i suggested we do them all as row :)
<jcater> you can change them and commit if you want
<derek> that way i could just do an 'if'
<jcater> or I can change them and commit
<jcater> either way
<derek> jcater: you change
<derek> so i can blame you when someone with a clue tells us we are high
<nickr> derek: you should have your xslt formulate CSS styles for things with formatting
<jcater> derek: committed
<chillywilly> derek: heh, too bad this channel is logged ;)
<chillywilly> and plus I also have the logs to prove it
<derek> also if you want the data and not the columns aligned
<chillywilly> muwahahahaha
<derek> er not just the headers
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<derek> you might change the grd to
<derek>                 <out:col align="center"><field name="foodate"/></out:col>
<derek>                 <out:col align="right"><field name="foobs"/></out:col>
<derek> btw: im a foobs man
<derek> nickr: im working on the basics :)
<derek> i have included the stylesheet you suggested
<nickr> hm.
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<derek> should be your style sheet implementation
<nickr> Indeed
<nickr> you can generate the tags without the align if the align isn't specified with a conditional thingy in xslt
<jcater> derek: committed
<chillywilly> http://news.gnome.org/gnome-news/1017787868/index_html
<jcater> with the out:subtotals changed to out:col :)
<jcater> argh!
Action: jcater thinks konq is caching
<derek> jcater: another reason to hate html
Action: derek remembers this from writing jadeke stuff
<derek> caching was a proverbial bitch
<derek> there is a meta tag i believe
<chillywilly> I'm not having any issues
<jcater> are the 3 subttotals still at the bottom?
<chillywilly> the refresh attribute in meta?
<derek> that tells the broswer to ignore cache
<derek> but of course i.e. didnt respect it :)
<derek> yes
<nickr> I don't seem to have a problem with it
<derek> chillywilly: sashxb is old news :)
<chillywilly> sorry d00dz
<nickr> I think they fixored the caching behavior in the galeon that I have
<jcater> derek: that "yes" for me?
<chillywilly> I haven't read news in a while
<derek> yip
<jcater> ok
Action: chillywilly has 1.2.0
<derek> yes subtotals still on bottom
<derek> regrabbing cvs
<derek> and going to run it
<chillywilly> eeek, april 2nd
<derek> then look at some things
<chillywilly> sheesh
Action: jcater is getting summaries to work
<derek> rock
<derek> we might have stupid and useless demo at some point :)
<jcater> ?
Action: derek will work on getting contact manager report soon :)
<jcater> we have that now
<jcater> ah
<nickr> derek: 'stupid and useless demon' is redundant
<nickr> demon
<nickr> demo
<nickr> weird
<jcater> my foobulations report isn't useless
<chillywilly> daemon
Action: derek was supposed to get contact manager working today
<jcater> those are real foobulation numbers I ran from NCS
<chillywilly> bitch
<derek> nickr: you have never worked for a large corporation
<derek> they require many stupid yet useful tools :)
<chillywilly> fuck corporations
<derek> chillywilly: im scared of catching something
<chillywilly> fuck them up their stupid asses
Action: chillywilly works a for a real big shithead of a corporation
<chillywilly> s/a//
<derek> kick butt
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<jcater> chillywilly: that's redundent too
<derek> basically i did nothign to my style sheet
<derek> other than rerun the new grd
<chillywilly> jcater: hehe
<derek> need to pretty up the format of the subtotals
<derek> but they are in right place now
<chillywilly> anyone know of the infamous Tyco (and not eh toy company)
<jcater> oops
<chillywilly> er, the
<jcater> guess I forgot the "right" on the last total
Action: derek hopes you dont use that 'math' when doing your own financials :)
<derek> i.e. all totals are 12
Action: jcater is working on summaries now :)
<jcater> those are hardcoded
Action: derek thought maybe i accidently hardcoded that
<derek> in my sheet and had to double check
<nickr> you should make a class for total lines that get inverted :)
<derek> nickr: if you want want to pretty this up some
<derek> the total lines
<derek> i might be able to make the style sheet fit the bill
<derek> er the xslt sheet
<nickr> Well
<nickr> you are getting logical information about the rows aren't you?
<jcater> sigh
<jcater>   def addSummaryToSection(self, section, field, function):
<jcater>     pass  # This should probably be replaced with real code :)
<nickr> like 'this is a total' 'this is an item' etc?
<derek> jcater:  you in the grd?
<jcater> somewhat... but you can change
<derek> if not i will make some changes 
<derek> ok
<nickr> if you're getting that information, you can put it in class names
<derek> nickr: currently no
<nickr> if its in class names you can mark up based on it
<jcater> what information?
<derek> but technically i will know by type=
Action: jcater thinks that's the only what you should know
<jcater> as I don't wanna put css in my grd
<derek> jcater: the file provides that information
<derek> im just not reading it :)
<derek> yet
<jcater> ah
<nickr> I'm not saying you have CSS in there
<derek> so if nick made a css
<derek> that said
