<topic>Forms</topic>
<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) noted that <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">a lot of 
attributes of GFBlock and GFField are changeable in trigger namespace</quote>
and <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">wondered what was the 
reasoning behind this</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) explained 
<quote who="Jason Cater">at one time, our specifications for forms was that 
triggers could practically build a form at runtime and anything/everything was 
changable/scriptable - that was probably a pipe dream (and probably not necessary)
- but it's possible the code you saw was the start of that general trend</quote>.
Reinhard noted that <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">the dream of building a form at 
runtime</quote>, whilst theoretically possible in a two-tier environment (GNUe Forms 
client talks directly to a database), wasn't really practicable in a three-tier 
environment (GNUe Forms client talks to GNUe Application Server talks to 
database), as there would be no mechanism for triggers in the GNUe Forms client 
to dynamically <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">create new objects</quote> on the 
GNUe Application Server. He noted that, as of time of writing, 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">*all* possible attributes of the 
&lt;block&gt; tag were exported to trigger namespace - autoCommit, queryable, 
editable, deletable, autoCreate, autoCommit, autoNextRecord, transparent - 
similar for GFField - maxLength, minLenght, queryDefault, case, required...
I think practically none of them are very useful, and with some of them you 
might even be able to screw something up if you change at runtime</quote>.</p>
