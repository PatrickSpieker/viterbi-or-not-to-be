<jcater> dude!
<jcater> bigbrother: please troutslap chillywilly
<chillywilly> yes?
<mdean> an eye is upon you!
<ajmitch> hehe
Action: chillywilly trout whips all debian wannabes
<ajmitch> hey
<chillywilly> this means you jcater, mdean
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> ajmitch: you're not a wannabe
Action: mdean sighs and pets his KDE installation....
<ajmitch> hehe
Action: dsmith likes apt-get -u upgrade
<ajmitch> mdean: debian *does* have KDE
<mdean> ajmitch: I know - just ribbing chillywilly
<mdean> it's what I do between lines of code
<ajmitch> i know, it's running on here ;)
<chillywilly> I don't care what you run, but I sure as hell got sick of tryin to find rpms when it should resove dependencies for me
<jcater> chillywilly: yeah, I apt-got upgrade on my laptop
<jcater> now my laptop is useless at the moment
<chillywilly> so I switched to debian and never looked back
<skeeter> Has anyone tried the sorcerer distro?
<jcater> and jamest apt-got upgraded ash
<jcater> and look at her now
<mdean> chillywilly: preaching to the choir :-P
<chillywilly> jcater: but my box is alive and kicking
<chillywilly> both my unstable boxes
<ajmitch> my 3 are all running sid
<chillywilly> you wanna know my secret?
<chillywilly>  /msg apt news #debian
<ajmitch> goat sacrifices?
<chillywilly> duh
<chillywilly> :P
<jcater> mdean: more like preaching to the choir of a church down the street of the same denomination
<chillywilly> jcater: wtf does that mean?
<mdean> jcater: exactly
<mdean> skeeter: why don't you try it and tell us how it goes? ;-)
<skeeter> I would, but I don't have anymore systems to try it with... 9 is more than enough for me..
<ajmitch> hehe
<mdean> 9?  you beat me by 2!
<ajmitch> how many here have used/tried GNU/Hurd? ;)
<mdean> I would if I had 9 boxes!
Action: chillywilly raises his hand
<ajmitch> i know nickr & jbailey have
<ajmitch> maybe Isomer too
<chillywilly> mdean: but you wouldn't like it, it is an evil debian port
<skeeter> hehehe.. if you count the 2 extra devices I have on my network.. an Intel Print Server and my Palm IIIxe..
<ajmitch> i know isomer couldn't quite get the install finished the other day
<skeeter> I would beat you by 4...
<chillywilly> damn those debian ppl!
<ajmitch> the LUG here should be DUNDGLUG, there's so many debian users
<chillywilly> ok, and the point of this pissing match is?
<jcater> sounds like chillywilly's jealous :)
<mdean> chillywilly: the match is over - wash your hands
<skeeter> hehehe
<chillywilly> nope
<jcater> all I can say is my one is big enough to handle all I throw at it
<jbailey> blue?
<jcater> <impersonation character="tim allen">Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho</impersonation>?
<jbailey> ajmitch: I use GNU/Hurd!! =)  
<skeeter> t's my problem... Most of mine are all 386/486 systems..
Action: jbailey waves hands around!
<ajmitch> jbailey: yes, we know ;)
<jbailey> ajmitch: I was worried people might have forgotten. ;)
<ajmitch> woohoo, 13 day uptime
<chillywilly> that's because you are da man jbailey
<mdean> chillywilly: you should use Red Carpet instead of apt - convert to RPM
Action: chillywilly yawns
<ajmitch> ewww
<chillywilly> rpm is horrible
<mdean> chillywilly: time to come out of the closet
<chillywilly> and ximian can kiss my butt
<mdean> chillywilly: rpm -Fvh chillywilly.i8086.rpm
<ajmitch> i don't think rpm is too different from deb
<chillywilly> mdean: time for you to use a "GNU" desktop
<chillywilly> freak
<mdean> been there, done that
<chillywilly> don't you have something to do mdean?
<ajmitch> chillywilly: don't you>?
<mdean> yes - irritate you! ;-)
<ajmitch> hehe
<dsmith> ajmitch: It's not so much the format, it's the policies and the devlopers.
<chillywilly> hardy har har
<ajmitch> dsmith: yeah, i know ;)
<ajmitch> which is why you could get debian-based crap like corel linux
<dsmith> corel was lame
<ajmitch> i have a 1.0 cd around somewhere
<chillywilly> but does redhat have anything close to apt yet? or are they using red carpet now?
<dsmith> I wanted it to be good.  Really.
<mdean> RH is evil - they have an update tool, but you have to register
<dsmith> Told people how good it was going to be.
<chillywilly> plus no distro has Free Software guidelines
<chillywilly> no other
<chillywilly> that's cool in itself
<dsmith> Plus, if all the commercial companies fold, there will still be a Debian.
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> built by the community
<jcater> chillywilly: yeah, but if you represent that community, maybe I better get back to BSD land :)
<ajmitch> plus no other distro has RMS applying to be a developer ;)
<jcater> j/k
Action: chillywilly needs to take a nap
<chillywilly> jcater: man you should wuit your day job and do stand up
<chillywilly> quit
<chillywilly> :P
<jcater> I'm here all day, aren't I.
Action: chillywilly looks around
<chillywilly> I don't see any comedians here
<ajmitch> mdean: i have a dcl package versioned 20010406, i guess there have been a couple of changes since then? ;)
<chillywilly> ajmitch: when did he do that?
<chillywilly> I must've missed something
<ajmitch> chillywilly: mdean did not do the packaging
<ajmitch> chillywilly: dcl is in sid, it looks old hto
<ajmitch> tho
<chillywilly> I'm talking RMS applying to be a debian developer
<mdean> ajmitch: ja - been a few releases since then
<chillywilly> what package is he going to maintain?
<ajmitch> chillywilly: you obviously don't follow the news ;)
<chillywilly> nope
<ajmitch> who knows?
<chillywilly> debian lists are too big
<chillywilly> too much traffic
<chillywilly> is ti on linuxtoday?
<chillywilly> s/ti/it
<ajmitch> it wasn't in the debian lists that i heard
<chillywilly> oh
<ajmitch> it was in #hurd
<mdean> jcater: duh!  I just noticed the highlight page is XML files for syntax highlighting defs
<chillywilly> where'd you hear this then
<ajmitch> and on debianplanet.org
<chillywilly> k
<ajmitch> and it was on slashdot too, iirc
<ajmitch> sigh...
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> I'll check it out
<mdean> ajmitch: hmmmm - I think 0406 is probably a CVS snapshot, to make things worse ;-)
<ajmitch> chillywilly: oskuro is his AM, jbailey was advocate (like that took much... ;)
<ajmitch> mdean: yeah ;)
<chillywilly>  Richard Stallman, Free Software activist, Emacs developer ... Debian Developer?
<chillywilly> Posted by rob on Monday, November 19 @ 18:17:39 GMT (4678 reads)
<chillywilly> [Debian] RIchard Stallman of GNU fame, has entered the the NM process for Debian, you can track his progress here. I'm sure he will be warmly welcomed into the Debian community.
<chillywilly> jeff?
<chillywilly> what is rms going to maintain?
Action: chillywilly pokes jbailey
<chillywilly> heh 33 comments
<chillywilly> this should be fun
<chillywilly> ;P
<dsmith> Yes, what package is rms going to maintain?
<ajmitch> who knows, does he need to maintain a package?
<jcater> woo hooo!!! let's all give jamest_ a hand!!!
<ajmitch> jcater: why would i do that? i need both to type with
<jcater> ajmitch: no, you don't
<ajmitch> uh oh....
<ajmitch> someone tell that alan clifford guy to change his words before chillywilly gets hold of him...
<chillywilly> who's that?
<ajmitch> you'll see ;)
rdean (~rdean@chcgil2-ar2-052-243.chcgil2.dsl.gtei.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> jcater: got the sedatives ready for chillywilly?
<chillywilly> ack!
jamest_ (~jamest@fh-dialup-201076.flinthills.com) left #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> i don't think I will be the only one correcting him
<chillywilly> will I?
<ajmitch> chillywilly: hehe
<chillywilly> he has the definition of open source wrong anyway
<ajmitch> chillywilly: depends
<chillywilly> much less free software
<chillywilly> it's not about getting it for $0
<ajmitch> i know ;)
<jbailey> chillywilly: poke?
<ajmitch> chillywilly: i have been around you long enough to receive the GNU indoctrination ;)
<chillywilly> ajmitch: I was just stating his error
<chillywilly> jbailey: what debian package is rms going to maintain?
<jbailey> he doesn't actually need to maintain something, although for his application, I think he's packaging Marcus' entropy translator.
<chillywilly> seriously?
<ajmitch> jbailey: ah cool
<chillywilly> why does he want to be a debian dveloper then?
<chillywilly> same reason as the gnome board stuff/
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> the non-free software promoting police?
<jbailey> All I know is that he wants to be more involved in the Hurd port.
<jbailey> I think it's a good thing to have him in there, since it will help tear down some misconceptions that the FSF doesn't care about the Hurd at all.
<ajmitch> ah kewl :)
<ajmitch> yes
<chillywilly> yea
<ajmitch> plus a lot of people probably don't think of him being a real hacker anymore
<ajmitch> even considering the massive amount he's done
<chillywilly> having carpal tunnel doesn't help :(
