bigbrother joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> dude!
<jcater> bigbrother: please troutslap chillywilly
<chillywilly> yes?
<mdean> an eye is upon you!
<ajmitch> hehe
Action: chillywilly trout whips all debian wannabes
<ajmitch> hey
<chillywilly> this means you jcater, mdean
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> ajmitch: you're not a wannabe
Action: mdean sighs and pets his KDE installation....
<ajmitch> hehe
Action: dsmith likes apt-get -u upgrade
<ajmitch> mdean: debian *does* have KDE
<mdean> ajmitch: I know - just ribbing chillywilly
<mdean> it's what I do between lines of code
<ajmitch> i know, it's running on here ;)
<chillywilly> I don't care what you run, but I sure as hell got sick of tryin to find rpms when it should resove dependencies for me
<jcater> chillywilly: yeah, I apt-got upgrade on my laptop
<jcater> now my laptop is useless at the moment
<chillywilly> so I switched to debian and never looked back
<skeeter> Has anyone tried the sorcerer distro?
<jcater> and jamest apt-got upgraded ash
<jcater> and look at her now
<mdean> chillywilly: preaching to the choir :-P
<chillywilly> jcater: but my box is alive and kicking
<chillywilly> both my unstable boxes
<ajmitch> my 3 are all running sid
<chillywilly> you wanna know my secret?
<chillywilly>  /msg apt news #debian
<ajmitch> goat sacrifices?
<chillywilly> duh
<chillywilly> :P
<jcater> mdean: more like preaching to the choir of a church down the street of the same denomination
<chillywilly> jcater: wtf does that mean?
<mdean> jcater: exactly
<mdean> skeeter: why don't you try it and tell us how it goes? ;-)
<skeeter> I would, but I don't have anymore systems to try it with... 9 is more than enough for me..
<ajmitch> hehe
<mdean> 9?  you beat me by 2!
<ajmitch> how many here have used/tried GNU/Hurd? ;)
<mdean> I would if I had 9 boxes!
Action: chillywilly raises his hand
<ajmitch> i know nickr & jbailey have
<ajmitch> maybe Isomer too
<chillywilly> mdean: but you wouldn't like it, it is an evil debian port
<skeeter> hehehe.. if you count the 2 extra devices I have on my network.. an Intel Print Server and my Palm IIIxe..
<ajmitch> i know isomer couldn't quite get the install finished the other day
<skeeter> I would beat you by 4...
<chillywilly> damn those debian ppl!
<ajmitch> the LUG here should be DUNDGLUG, there's so many debian users
<chillywilly> ok, and the point of this pissing match is?
<jcater> sounds like chillywilly's jealous :)
<mdean> chillywilly: the match is over - wash your hands
<skeeter> hehehe
<chillywilly> nope
<jcater> all I can say is my one is big enough to handle all I throw at it
<jbailey> blue?
<jcater> <impersonation character="tim allen">Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho</impersonation>?
<jbailey> ajmitch: I use GNU/Hurd!! =)  
<skeeter> t's my problem... Most of mine are all 386/486 systems..
Action: jbailey waves hands around!
<ajmitch> jbailey: yes, we know ;)
<jbailey> ajmitch: I was worried people might have forgotten. ;)
<ajmitch> woohoo, 13 day uptime
<chillywilly> that's because you are da man jbailey
<mdean> chillywilly: you should use Red Carpet instead of apt - convert to RPM
Action: chillywilly yawns
<ajmitch> ewww
<chillywilly> rpm is horrible
<mdean> chillywilly: time to come out of the closet
<chillywilly> and ximian can kiss my butt
<mdean> chillywilly: rpm -Fvh chillywilly.i8086.rpm
<ajmitch> i don't think rpm is too different from deb
<chillywilly> mdean: time for you to use a "GNU" desktop
<chillywilly> freak
<mdean> been there, done that
<chillywilly> don't you have something to do mdean?
<ajmitch> chillywilly: don't you>?
<mdean> yes - irritate you! ;-)
<ajmitch> hehe
<dsmith> ajmitch: It's not so much the format, it's the policies and the devlopers.
<chillywilly> hardy har har
<ajmitch> dsmith: yeah, i know ;)
<ajmitch> which is why you could get debian-based crap like corel linux
<dsmith> corel was lame
<ajmitch> i have a 1.0 cd around somewhere
<chillywilly> but does redhat have anything close to apt yet? or are they using red carpet now?
<dsmith> I wanted it to be good.  Really.
<mdean> RH is evil - they have an update tool, but you have to register
<dsmith> Told people how good it was going to be.
<chillywilly> plus no distro has Free Software guidelines
<chillywilly> no other
<chillywilly> that's cool in itself
<dsmith> Plus, if all the commercial companies fold, there will still be a Debian.
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> built by the community
<jcater> chillywilly: yeah, but if you represent that community, maybe I better get back to BSD land :)
<ajmitch> plus no other distro has RMS applying to be a developer ;)
<jcater> j/k
Action: chillywilly needs to take a nap
<chillywilly> jcater: man you should wuit your day job and do stand up
<chillywilly> quit
<chillywilly> :P
<jcater> I'm here all day, aren't I.
Action: chillywilly looks around
<chillywilly> I don't see any comedians here
<ajmitch> mdean: i have a dcl package versioned 20010406, i guess there have been a couple of changes since then? ;)
<chillywilly> ajmitch: when did he do that?
<chillywilly> I must've missed something
<ajmitch> chillywilly: mdean did not do the packaging
<ajmitch> chillywilly: dcl is in sid, it looks old hto
<ajmitch> tho
<chillywilly> I'm talking RMS applying to be a debian developer
<mdean> ajmitch: ja - been a few releases since then
<chillywilly> what package is he going to maintain?
<ajmitch> chillywilly: you obviously don't follow the news ;)
<chillywilly> nope
<ajmitch> who knows?
<chillywilly> debian lists are too big
<chillywilly> too much traffic
<chillywilly> is ti on linuxtoday?
<chillywilly> s/ti/it
<ajmitch> it wasn't in the debian lists that i heard
<chillywilly> oh
<ajmitch> it was in #hurd
<mdean> jcater: duh!  I just noticed the highlight page is XML files for syntax highlighting defs
<chillywilly> where'd you hear this then
<ajmitch> and on debianplanet.org
<chillywilly> k
<ajmitch> and it was on slashdot too, iirc
<ajmitch> sigh...
<chillywilly> heh
<chillywilly> I'll check it out
<mdean> ajmitch: hmmmm - I think 0406 is probably a CVS snapshot, to make things worse ;-)
<ajmitch> chillywilly: oskuro is his AM, jbailey was advocate (like that took much... ;)
<ajmitch> mdean: yeah ;)

<chillywilly> jeff?
<chillywilly> what is rms going to maintain?
Action: chillywilly pokes jbailey
<chillywilly> heh 33 comments
<chillywilly> this should be fun
<chillywilly> ;P
<dsmith> Yes, what package is rms going to maintain?
<ajmitch> who knows, does he need to maintain a package?
<jcater> woo hooo!!! let's all give jamest_ a hand!!!
<ajmitch> jcater: why would i do that? i need both to type with
<jcater> ajmitch: no, you don't
<ajmitch> uh oh....
<ajmitch> someone tell that alan clifford guy to change his words before chillywilly gets hold of him...
<chillywilly> who's that?
<ajmitch> you'll see ;)

<chillywilly> i don't think I will be the only one correcting him
<chillywilly> will I?
<ajmitch> chillywilly: hehe
<chillywilly> he has the definition of open source wrong anyway
<ajmitch> chillywilly: depends
<chillywilly> much less free software
<chillywilly> it's not about getting it for $0
<ajmitch> i know ;)
<jbailey> chillywilly: poke?
<ajmitch> chillywilly: i have been around you long enough to receive the GNU indoctrination ;)
<chillywilly> ajmitch: I was just stating his error
<chillywilly> jbailey: what debian package is rms going to maintain?
<jbailey> he doesn't actually need to maintain something, although for his application, I think he's packaging Marcus' entropy translator.
<chillywilly> seriously?
<ajmitch> jbailey: ah cool
<chillywilly> why does he want to be a debian dveloper then?
<chillywilly> same reason as the gnome board stuff/
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> the non-free software promoting police?
<jbailey> All I know is that he wants to be more involved in the Hurd port.
<jbailey> I think it's a good thing to have him in there, since it will help tear down some misconceptions that the FSF doesn't care about the Hurd at all.
<ajmitch> ah kewl :)
<ajmitch> yes
<chillywilly> yea
<ajmitch> plus a lot of people probably don't think of him being a real hacker anymore
<ajmitch> even considering the massive amount he's done
<chillywilly> having carpal tunnel doesn't help :(

<SachaS> hi chillywilly
--- Thu Nov 29 2001
[00:02] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<chillywilly> hi
<SachaS> congratulation to the 0.1 release
<chillywilly> well I can't take any credit for that
<chillywilly> I only have hacked geas
<chillywilly> ;)
<SachaS> i see, that gnue has put a lot of effort to the visualisation of the data so far.
<SachaS> -> gui's
Action: SachaS def. has to install gnue soon
<SachaS> i guess it will take some time to get packages implemented.
<SachaS> i wonder who will implement them. a) academics, b) businesses or c) others
<Isomer> hmm
<Isomer> I wonder if I can get a friend of mine to implement academics
<Isomer> he's got a school running Access that he's not overly impressed with
<Isomer> moving them over to gnue could be an idea
<ajmitch> hi Isomer
<ajmitch> oh i wish the uni here would drop access
<SachaS> lets take the supply chain package. someone will start to implement it. The point is, that users need to feedback what is important in that package. 
<SachaS> companies should use the HR package and then improve it.
<SachaS> or tell what is missing, what is wrong, what is good etc.
<SachaS> it may take some time to get it working.
<SachaS> chillywilly: does geas support business processes in any way?
<chillywilly> supports business objects
<chillywilly> and methods in C and python
<chillywilly> we have designs and class descriptions for some packages
<chillywilly> but no forms or methods for them
<chillywilly> in gnue-config is where the package stuff is
<chillywilly> the gcd files
<chillywilly> GNUe Class Definition
<SachaS> So you might have a customer business object. and you might have methods (in the future) to access the street etc. is this right?
<chillywilly> yes
<chillywilly> it si all setup to allow for OO design of things
<chillywilly> the tools are that is
<chillywilly> geas handles storign of the objects too
<chillywilly> and caching
<SachaS> i might get involved with gnue next year. gnue and ebXML.
<chillywilly> it uses corba
<chillywilly> and exposes an interface to our client
<SachaS> ebXML is a framework to do electronic business.
<chillywilly> yea
<SachaS> so businesses design business processes first.
<SachaS> and within these business processes they define the flow of documents
<SachaS> documents can be like order request, offer, order, invoice etc.
<chillywilly> you basically just do your OO design and then you can make gfds, gcds, grds, and methods of the pbjects
<SachaS> and the content of the documents is also defined.
<SachaS> like quality, quantity and many more.
<chillywilly> (forms, class descriptions, report descriptions, and methods)
<chillywilly> SachaS: you read the module guide?
<chillywilly> go to http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~neilt/
<SachaS> chillywilly: havent read anything and should install gnue SOON
<chillywilly> there's a GNUe Module Guide there
<SachaS> ok. i will read into GNUE soon as well.
<chillywilly> k ;)
<SachaS> chillywilly: whats the command to download everything from the gnue.org cvs?
<chillywilly> cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@subversions.gnu.org:/cvs login
<chillywilly> cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@subversions.gnu.org:/cvs co gnue

<ajmitch> i'm getting 178MB over a 33.6k modem
<SachaS> ajmitech: i just started with a gnue installation, so i dont no what follows after python2.2
<ajmitch> well, i'm doing an upgrade of debian unstable ;)
<SachaS> ajmitech: i just changed from stable to testing. i got surprised by the volume of new realeases in testing. I guess unstable has even more volume.
<ajmitch> yes, unstable has a lot
<SachaS> ajmitch you are from new zealand. are you in australia in the near future?
Action: SachaS is in Perth, Australia
<ajmitch> SachaS: i doubt i'll be over there anytime soon
<ajmitch> SachaS: i guessed you were in perth or close ;)
<SachaS> ajmitch: i want to get into gnuenterprise. can we chat here or in private?
<ajmitch> here, but i'm no GNUe hacker, i've just been around irc for awhile
<SachaS> ajmitch: same here. have you installed gnue?
<ajmitch> not lately
<ajmitch> by awhile, i mean i've been around here for a year or more ;)
<ajmitch> last time i tried using gnue forms they'd gone to python 2 or higher
<SachaS> ajmitch: i am around a couple weeks and just downloaded the source from cvs. 
<ajmitch> ok
<SachaS> ajmitch: are you a developper in another gnu project?
<ajmitch> SachaS: ah, not a gnu project, but i do development
<SachaS> ajmitch: are you doing development in an open source project or closed source?
<ajmitch> it's free software, but not currently residing anywhere but my hard drive & at my boss' place :)
<SachaS> ajmitch: ok. how are you involved in gnue?
<ajmitch> am friends with chillywilly, and am interested in using parts of gnue in a business situation 
<ajmitch> but i am mainly just a student who likes projects like this :)
<ajmitch> SachaS: btw, are you part of PLUG?
<SachaS> ajmitch: which parts of gnue are you interested in? PLUG. I am in the mailing list yes and I do go to the meetings yes.
<ajmitch> ah, i had a friend who went to their last meeting, he's in perth at the moment
<ajmitch> i'm interested mainly in forms & GEAS
<ajmitch> not sure just what is needed for what i am looking at (replacing a windows app that uses crufty stuff)
<ajmitch> because i don't know the details of the program
<ajmitch> i'm mainly just interested in helping gnue when i get the time
<SachaS> ajmitch: last meeting was at IBM with some free snaks and a talk about what IBM is doing with Linux
<ajmitch> SachaS: hehe, sounds just like our last LUG meeting here
<ajmitch> we had a guy from IBM do a demo on what they are doing w.r.t linux
<SachaS> ajmitch: free snacks and free beer at IBM. The guy showed a linux on an IBM mainframe :) Unfortunately I had to leave early. I think others wanted to compile a kernel under it to check the speed.
<ajmitch> we only had a presentation, our LUG is rather small
<ajmitch> what are you wanting to use GNUe for?
<SachaS> ajmitch: i am interested in electronic business and do a masters by thesis in computer science next year
<ajmitch> ok
<SachaS> ajmitch: ebXML.org has an framework for doing electronic business.
<ajmitch> i am doing 2nd year computer science next year
<SachaS> ajmitch: i want the gnue to talk with other gnue systems within this ebXML framwork.
<SachaS> ajmitch: ride on.
<ajmitch> hopefully will get into the honours programme here
Action: SachaS gets python2.2-xmlbase
Action: SachaS gets libwxgtk2.2-python
<SachaS> ajmitch: how did you use geas or the forms for the business project?
<ajmitch> SachaS: i haven't yet used gnue for anything 
<ajmitch> SachaS: i said i was looking at using it
<SachaS> ajmitch: ok.

<neilt> i switched to using a distribution packages instead of compiling everything from source
<neilt> and of course it installed everything in new paths
Action: SachaS thinks he installed all dependencies and cds to the gnue directory
Action: SachaS enters python2.2 setup.py
<SachaS> I am installing gnue as root. after the comment that a symlink for the cvs version of the tools appears the setup aborts without a warning.
<SachaS> i guess thats ok. and change to the geas directory
<SachaS> ./configure in the geas directory errors with bash: ./configure: No such file or directory
<ajmitch> run autogen.sh in the geas dir
<SachaS> ta ajmitch: This could go into the README or INSTALL file
Action: SachaS apt-gets autoconf 2.13 m4
<ajmitch> SachaS: it's usual for a lot of projects that have code in cvs
<ajmitch> since everytime a Makefile.am for the configure.in changes, you have to run automake & autoconf
<SachaS> ajmitch: thanks i did not know that.
<SachaS> ajmitch: the autconf does create the configure file according the Makefile.am and configure.in?
<ajmitch> autogen.sh runs aclocal, automake, then autoconf
<ajmitch> and then runs the generated configure script
<neilt> SachaS: to run geas you will also need libuuid
<neilt> SachaS: sorry, isee you already go it

<madlocke_> hi... was reading kc#4...
<jamest> hey madlocke_
<madlocke_> hi jamest...
<madlocke_> erm... shit... this time with _
<madlocke_> reinhard: you are here_
<madlocke_> ?
<reinhard> yep
<madlocke_> reinhard: you talked about xml for gcds...
<madlocke_> reinhard: was thinking some time ago about soap too...
<madlocke_> so xml not only for object definition... for transport too....
<reinhard> not sure if that was me
<reinhard> as basically i am _anti_ xml in gcd's
<madlocke_> erm... ;)
<madlocke_> have to read again... ;)
<madlocke_> reinhard: btw. why are you against it?
<madlocke_> speed_
<madlocke_> ?
<reinhard> no
<jamest> it's tough to write programs in xml
<jamest> less readable
<reinhard> i see two possible constellations
<reinhard> a. we have an uber druber designer and will create all object definitions graphically with uml and whatever
<reinhard> b. we will author our object definitions with our editor of choice in a text file
<reinhard> when we have reached a. i see no use for .gcd files anymore at all, object definitions will be in the database
<reinhard> until then we will do b. which means we need some easily-writeable format
<reinhard> w/o much overhead
<reinhard> and i still believe that
<reinhard>   char name<35>;
<reinhard> is much more readable than
<madlocke_> sure it is...
<reinhard>   <field type="char" length="35">
<reinhard> not even thinking about stuff like compound types and so on
<madlocke_> one problem is was reading time and again was the fact that corba has probs with firewalls
<madlocke_> or the other way around...
<jamest> that's up to the firewall admin
<reinhard> gcd reading is local
<reinhard> and has nothing to do with corba
<madlocke_> jamest: sure I is... but if you go to a company and they, hey change your security settings and our program will work...
<madlocke_> who will actually do it?
<madlocke_> they=say... arg...
<madlocke_> I=it
<madlocke_> what am I writing... 
<madlocke_> maybe need some coffee...
<jamest> :)
<jamest> i think it'll become a moot point soon enough
<madlocke_> :)
<jamest> IIRC jcater has GRPC (GNUe Comm) drivers for xml-rpc, pure sockets, and "something else I dont recall"
<jamest> if this flies then you _should_ be able to pick your poison with regard to transport
<madlocke_> :)
<jamest> on to the UI rewrite :)
<jamest> you still up for it?
alexey (alex@techkran.vladimir.ru) left irc: "[x]chat"
<jamest> I think I'd like to hammer out the needs over this week
<madlocke_> had to do some other work the last days... will continue work on msg handling...
<jamest> and start implementing over the weekend
<madlocke_> ok...
<jamest> i need to finish geas driver first though
<madlocke_> rest of week I have enough free time...
<jamest> i just wondered if you still planned to be actively involved
<jamest> as we need lots of changes over old system
<madlocke_> yes...
<jamest> can you say "scrap it"
<jamest> :)
<madlocke_> for gnuef... sure.. :)
<jamest> :)
<madlocke_> and if jcater doesn't nail me for this I would say it for designer too ;)
<jamest> lol
<jamest> the UI rewrite would heavily impact designer
<madlocke_> sure... I know...
<jamest> as it's driving a few of the needs
<madlocke_> at the moment I am using windows... have to change... I am back in 2 minutes...
<SachaS> Due to low download bandwith I have to postpone the compilation/installation of gnue. See ya tomorrow.

<dneighbo> thanks for doing some of the updates that alan has been sending :)
<dneighbo> i just changed accounting to financials but havent done anything else
<neilt> cool
<neilt> there is more to change for accounting -> fin
<neilt> we have all the specs
<neilt> then gnu faq
<neilt> and a bunch of other docs
<dneighbo> im toying with and will discuss with jamest jcater as well when they get back about just removing mainmenu
<neilt> so i assume you got all of those
<neilt> :)
<neilt> yes

<neilt> i am here in VA but in a 10 foots square room
<dneighbo> yeah
<dneighbo> i just havent had time to get to them :(
<neilt> cant afford anything bigger
<dneighbo> hopefully tonight
<dneighbo> and make something different as the header than main menu
<neilt> cool
<dneighbo> and keep links to like FAQ, Screenshots etc
<neilt> i revised the gnu faq this morning, but noticed a lot of things that need to be cleaned up
<dneighbo> cool
<dneighbo> yeah i think its time to go on a documentation kick
<dneighbo> and get it all compiled into single place and make easy to find and in all formats
<dneighbo> etc etc
<dneighbo> and get links from site to it
<dneighbo> as well as actually review it :)
<dneighbo> and update it
Action: dneighbo is so ambitious and has no time :)
<dneighbo> figure if i can get the ball rolling next fellow hopping in wanting a task to do can have it :)
<neilt> cool
<dneighbo> trying to get dcl setup on ash
<neilt> so i can review all the new docs in the morning :)
<dneighbo> so we have a global todo list
<dneighbo> and bug tracker
<dneighbo> that is centralized

<jcater> yes
<sklein> I may have a little bit of time to work on the menu system I proposed.
<jcater> oh, cool
<dneighbo> hey before you jump too much into it
<dneighbo> can you refresh us on the docs for it
<dneighbo> and can we get you and mdean in here at same time
<sklein> I looked at the latest designer and noticed that you seem to have dropped the XML-based menus.  Am I reading the code right?
<dneighbo> as some of the RBAC i think can pertain directly to this
<jcater> sklein: not sure what you mean
<jamest> jcater you using the released gnuef exe's on a win32 machine
<jamest> ?
<jcater> jamest: yes
<jamest> i've tried install on nt and 98 and it fails on both
<jcater> ick
<dneighbo> must be user error
<sklein> derek: what do you mean refresh on the docs?
<jcater> that'd be my guess
<dneighbo> btw: jamest i had on 98 and 95
<jcater> dneighbo: the docs were in the mail lists
<dneighbo> refresh : means give us the urls again or re send the emails :)
<jamest> dneighbo: can you try the released exes where you are at?
<dneighbo> yes
<dneighbo> i will trade you
<sklein> OK, will do (although I thought neilt posted them)
<jamest> for?
<dneighbo> postgres that uses tcp/ip for testing of win32 :)

<dneighbo> i just wish you could be here at same time as mdean :(
<sklein> jcater: I looked at the menu bar and it looks like the menus are all defined there
<dneighbo> brb i need to go test for jamest :)
<dneighbo> jamest you want me to use off website the release?
<jcater> sklein: that's just designer's native menus
<jcater> I don't think I've changed them
<sklein> that's what I meant.  I thought previous versions had the native menus defined in XML
<dneighbo> nope
<jamest> dneighbo: yes
<jamest> that's where I got the exe's
<sklein> jcater: maybe I need to go back and look more
<sklein> dneighbo:  the RBAC can interact with this
<sklein> jcater and jamest:  how do I install designer to /home/stan and not /usr/bin?
<dneighbo> sklein i know it can
<jamest> sklein: i would just do a devel install
<dneighbo> thats why i want you to be around when mdean is :)
<jamest> ./setup devel
<jamest> er
<jamest> ./setup.py devel
<jamest> then you can run right from the cvs tree
<sklein> jamest: I did and it started to ask me for the root password
<sklein> this was with 0.1.0
<sklein> The previous version installed to /home/stan
<sklein> I ctrl-D'ed out of the install
<sklein> for 0.1.0
<jamest> that's fine

<jamest> cvs/designer/client/gfdes
<dneighbo> jamest: anything in particular you want me to test?
<jamest> dneighbo: does it work
<jamest> i get hourglass then nothing
<sklein> dneighbo:  what area is jdean working on? 
<dneighbo> jamest: got called to fire, just getting back to it
<dneighbo> mdean is doing DCL (diff proj workign with gnue)
<dneighbo> but he is needing RBAC there
<dneighbo> and we need it here
<dneighbo> the idea would be to try to use same system :)
<sklein> there is RBAC in SELinux
<sklein> The loadable kernel module stuff is likely to be in kernel 2.5
<sklein> and there are patches for current kernels
<dneighbo> hey now the icons have purdy icons :)
<dneighbo> before they didnt :)
<sklein> 2.5 will become production 2.6
<dneighbo> win95 works fine for me
<jamest> joy
<dneighbo> we can not do SELinux security
<dneighbo> its not an option
<dneighbo> as we cant demand SELinux as a prerequisite
<dneighbo> well we could, but it woudl seriously limit our ability to get in the door at most places :)
<sklein> My proposal was to use whatever the OS provides
<jamest> how many floors do you have to leap from to ensure a swift demise
<dneighbo> ask the sample form :)
<sklein> it's up to the user to get the RBAC OS
<dneighbo> confusious say 'man that leap from tall building, fall long ways'
<dneighbo> er
<dneighbo> 'man that leap from tall building, really go long way'
<sklein> and RBAC without an RBAC OS is vulnerable
<sklein> I think there is another way you can get RBAC for Linux
<sklein> You might be able to simulate it in NT with ACL's
<dneighbo> sigh ACL is yucky
<dneighbo> i prefer KISS to a degree
<dneighbo> as im not seeing this as being trying to 100% cracker proof for RBAC
<sklein> it may be yucky but that's what I think NT has
<dneighbo> yes NT has ACL
<dneighbo> NT is thus yuck y :)
<sklein> well, there is the NIST stuff
<dneighbo> but i digress, i swore i woudl stay out of security discussions
<dneighbo> and thusly i should
<dneighbo> as im one of these fellows that believes that you give up freedoms to be secure
<dneighbo> and a truly secure system is one that is not usable :)
<sklein> I have had some discussions with them in the past regarding the patent issues
<dneighbo> and so no MATTER what its a trade off
<dneighbo> if you make things usable you make them insecure
<dneighbo> being a business user vs a system admin i generally
<sklein> of course.  The only secure system is disconnected, encased in concrete and dropped in the ocean
<dneighbo> err on side of usability and will give up some security so i dont do well in discussions of security with the pros :)
<sklein> some dbms's offer RBAC, I think
<dneighbo> when i say RBAC im thinking at object level
<sklein> the user could use an RBAC DBMS
<dneighbo> the rights would be stored in the DB
<dneighbo> but anyhow i promised i would not clutter such discussions so i wont :)
<dneighbo> but i still think you should talk to mdean
<sklein> well, according to the NIST definitions, there are different levels and object may be an upper one
<dneighbo> unfortunately he is only around after work
<sklein> I'll look for him when I have a chance
<sklein> we can do RBAC easily at the form level by controlling access to gfd's
<sklein> for example
<dneighbo> i hoped to go one deeper than that
<dneighbo> that it would be method and property of an object
<dneighbo> so say you had a purchaseorder object
<dneighbo> you might have method
<dneighbo> purchaseorder.print
<dneighbo> purchaseorder.close
<jamest> ah, network installed of the exe's don't seem to work here
<jamest> hmmm
<dneighbo> etc etc
<jamest> they did at home
<dneighbo> print and close coudl be assigned to a role etc etc
<dneighbo> anyhow
<dneighbo> mdean was supposed to be assembling a doc on this
<sklein> dneighbo:  Let me think about that.  it might be possible with just file access control
<dneighbo> as we discussed via some emails
<dneighbo> i think that jcater had not relpied yet :)
<sklein> did he look at my security proposal?
<dneighbo> and he was waiting on thtat (hint hint hint)
<dneighbo> no he didnt
<dneighbo> but i will point him to it tonight if he is around

<jcater> btw, I'd like to see sklein get started on menuing with or without access control, as menuing is desparately needed at some level
<sklein> BTW, has anyone heard from the Singapore folks on the licensing?  Maybe it's time to tickle them
<sklein> jcater:  I will try to spend a little time getting myself back up to speed.
<sklein> since I'm plagiarizing heavily from designer, that's why I asked about the designer install
<jcater> sklein: try to keep the menu structuring code separate from the actual wxMenu code
<jcater> so we can make this UI indedependent fairly easily
<sklein> jcater: one thing that gave me a fit earlier was the undocumented wxPython stuff that you had in the designer and common
<sklein> looks like you cleaned that up
<jcater> oooh... there should be no wxPython in common
<sklein> well then in designer
<jcater> I've tried to document as much as I could :)
<sklein> that was the older version anyway
<sklein> i'll look at the docs

<SachaS> which python version do you want to use? 2.1 or 2.2?
<ajmitch> 2.1
<neilt> I thought there was some talk about making the minimum requirement python 2.1
<derek> 2.x i think is currently the requirement
<neilt> not sure if that actually happened
<derek> though i had said if we are gonna require greater than 1.5.2 we really should require 2.1 or greatter
Action: SachaS removed /usr/bin/python which was a link to /usr/bin/python1.5 and created a new link to python2.2
Action: SachaS make in geas ok.
<derek> and i just read some stuff in python interpreter that reconfirmed that
<derek> :)
<derek> as 2.0 iirc is NOT gpl compatiable
<derek> 1.5.2, 2.1 and 2.2 are
<derek> i think we should eliminate support for 1.5.2 as it will be VERY old by time our software makes it into distros
<derek> forms already requires 2.0 or greater
Action: SachaS make check in geas looks ok.

<derek> ok
<derek> are you using psycopg?
<derek> i heard you earlier say you were using pygresql?
<ajmitch> sure
<derek> so you do have psycopg installed
<ajmitch> was trying to use pygresql (it was postgresql in connection.conf)
<neilt> what is psycopg?
<derek> ok
<ajmitch> but i changed it to psycopg since i'd just installed that
<derek> now two stupid questions
<derek> a. does database gnue exist?
<derek> and if it does
<derek> b. can you get to it via sockets
<derek> i.e.
<derek> can you do
<ajmitch> it exists, with no tables
<derek> psql -h localhost gnue
<ajmitch> am looking at it with pgaccess now
<derek> if you can do that
<derek> then add a table and retry
<derek> i think its probably having no tables thats frying it :)
<ajmitch> ok, adding table
<derek> as wizard is trying to 'introspect' into the database and get list of table names
<derek> and is choking when it cant
<derek> jcater: if you are really here and that is the problem, probably good idea to add error handling for that :)
<derek> you can try somethign like
<jcater> yes
<ajmitch> am starting wizard again
<derek> er in our samples dir there are some postgres create scripts
<jcater> that is the problem :)
<jcater> I see it in the code
<jcater> sifg

<ajmitch> ah much better
<derek> cool
<derek> see i could help :)
<ajmitch> apart from that little prob, it's looking quite nice :)
<derek> not much but a little :)
<ajmitch> thx derek :)
<derek> neilt fwiw: psycopg is just another dbdriver for postgres for python
<derek> it would be like another 'vendors' library for postgres that works with python
<derek> fwiw: i think i like it much better than pygresql
<neilt> in place of pysgresl or whatever it is
<derek> yes
<neilt> ok, thanks
<derek> we support like 4 or 5 of them now
<derek> popy
<derek> pygresql
<derek> pscyopg and some others
<jcater> pypgsql
<derek> i couldnt get popy to work :(
<derek> pygresql works and has decent windows support
<jcater> I'd recommend either pypgsql or psycopg to everyone
<derek> i like psycopg a lot and i think it has windwos driver
<jcater> derek: you mean pypgsql
<derek> though i havent looked since jcater got odbc working :)
<ajmitch> the main problem i seem to have is speed :)
<derek> speed?
<derek> really
<derek> i find it rather snappy
<derek> even on my slow machines
<ajmitch> yeah, but that could be my machine being 'old'
<neilt> ajmitch: well too much and you wont have any problems at all
<derek> slow == p200mmx w/ 64mb RAM

<SachaS> neilt: and /usr/local/share/geas/methods/: No such file or directory
<neilt> ok the path to ORBit is not right in geas.conf
<neilt> SachaS: seriously, i have never installed geas
<neilt> so i have no idea where it puts things
<ajmitch> how well does geas work at the moment, anyway?
<neilt> ajmitch: it passes all of the regression tests
<neilt> it works, has room for improvement
<ajmitch> ok
<neilt> but the forms team will not write a driver for geas
<neilt> that works
<ajmitch> why is that?
<neilt> so its not much use
<ajmitch> i see
<neilt> i dont know the problems with the forms driver
<neilt> jamest has promised to work on it for the past several months
<ajmitch> but hasn't?
<neilt> so we are kind of on hold with geas

<ajmitch> a problem with limited number of developers

<SachaS> neilt: yes changed it to .../geas/examples/python/methods
<neilt> SachaS: you may need to use an absolute path
<neilt> because it is relative to the location of the file geas.conf file
<neilt> or the location of geas-server executable, i dont recall right off
<SachaS> neilt: ok.
<neilt> SachaS: are you installing geas from a distribution or from cvs?
<SachaS> neilt: cvs
<neilt> ok, geas-server is compiled in geas/src
<neilt> and you can run and test from this dir if you want
<neilt> and it will use the geas.conf in geas/src
<SachaS> neilt: i compiled geas and installed it. i made the make test which was ok. do you mean that test?
<neilt> SachaS:  dont know what i am talking out really, i never knew we had a "make test"
<neilt> s/out/about/
<SachaS> neilt: me too. if the geas server would start is the idea to create some tables in the selected database, right?
<neilt> right
<neilt> reinhard and usually run geas from geas/src
<neilt> using a modified geas.conf
<SachaS> neilt: ok. i will wait until reinhard comes in.

<jcater> whew... there for a minute, I thought you were using designer
<jcater> :)
<neilt> SachaS: thats right, you have to get that warning in order for methods to work correctly
<neilt> part of that is because we only have one methods working
<neilt> that is the geas.sys("machine_shutdown");
<neilt> method
<SachaS> neilt: i see wxPython, CORBAmodule are installed into /usr/lib/python1.5/site-packages. so i copied CORBAmodule.so to /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages. maybe not a good idea.
<SachaS> neilt: i thought, damn kernel segmentation fault. dman.
<SachaS> s/dman/damn
<neilt> :)
<neilt> SachaS: that seems a bit risky
<SachaS> neilt: def. not the right approach.
<neilt> now that you changed to link to python/config you should be able to reinstall orbit and it should put it in the correct locations
<SachaS> heilt: i have python1.5, 2.0 and 2.2. i changed the /usr/bin/python to link to python2.2.
<SachaS> i only changed the sym link in /usr/bin

<chillywilly> neilt: more than you apparently
<ajmitch> hi chillywilly
<chillywilly> hey ajmitch
<chillywilly> didn't have to reinstall
<ajmitch> got forms & designer going here, works ook
<ajmitch> ok
<chillywilly> just diable that stupid gateway go-back thing
<chillywilly> disable
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> lovely
<neilt> SachaS: hmmm

<chillywilly> j/k
<neilt> :)
<chillywilly> feh
<chillywilly> I just have no faith in America anymore
<SachaS> neilt: i do apt-get remove python1.5 and apt-get remove python2.0 so there will be only python2.2 :)
<chillywilly> http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/23084.html
<ajmitch> but it's the land of the free
<SachaS> neilt: and I do an apt-get remove python2.2 and an apt-get install python2.1
<chillywilly> ajmitch: sure it is
<chillywilly> whatever
<neilt> SachaS: excellent
skeeter (~skeeter@cs666916-91.satx.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<SachaS> neilt: an apt-get remove python2.2-xml . basically i start again with only python2.1 installed on the system :)

<madlocke> neilt: standard for gnue at the moment python 2.1??
<neilt> madlocke:  i believe that is correct
<neilt> almost
<neilt> it should be python 2.1.1
<madlocke> neilt: think some people were complaining that newest webware needs 2.2 but not sure about that...
<madlocke> neilt: maybe he can get sources of orbit-python...
<neilt> yes i think 2.2 should work also
<madlocke> there is not yet a deb package for 2.2 i think :(
<jcater> mmm
<jcater> well, 2.2 is still beta
<jcater> so I'd be cautious
<neilt> at least for geas, i had it working at one point
<neilt> but dropped back to 2.1.1
<ajmitch> madlocke: newest webware should not need 2.2
<madlocke> ajmitch: ok....
<ajmitch> it works with 2.2m but should run with older
<SachaS> quck question: when did you guys decide to use python?
<madlocke> SachaS: some time ago ;)
<SachaS> s/quck/quick
<neilt> because its the best

<SachaS> neilt: so i got rid of python1.5 and python2.2 and installed python2.1
<neilt> and you installed python-orbit?
<ajmitch> neilt: if python-orbit was built for bython1.5, it'll go in the 1.5 dir
<SachaS> when i try to apt-get python-orbit it gets python1.5 again :(
<SachaS> yes. ajmitch.
<ajmitch> python policy has recently changed, btw
<neilt> yuck
<SachaS> and there is no python2.1-base
<SachaS> only a python1.5-base
<SachaS> in debian testing.
<ajmitch> i guess 0.3.0 is in testing (depends on python 1.5 here), but 0.3.1 is in unstable (depends on python (>= 2.1), python (<< 2.2) )
<ajmitch> i think you can get python-orbit from unstable (and only that package)
<SachaS> ajmitch. i guess so. 
<neilt> i am using orbit-python 0.3.1
<neilt> i built and installed from source
<SachaS> in debian testing orbit-python is 0.3.0-2
<ajmitch> neilt: ah, ok
<SachaS> debian testing orbit-python 0.3.0-2 is against python-base 1.5.2-18.4 
<ajmitch> not surprising
<SachaS> ajmitch, i dont realy want to go to testing with this machine.
<ajmitch> SachaS: i though you were using testing?
<SachaS> ajmitch. sorry to unstable.
<ajmitch> well, i said that you can get single packages from unstable
<SachaS> ajmitch: how do you do that in the /etc/apt/sources.list file?
<ajmitch> umm, i cannot remember exactly (since i only use unstable)...
<SachaS> ajmitch: ok. nevermind.
<ajmitch> i know you install it with apt-get install orbit-python/unstable
<chillywilly> you would have to changes soures.list to point to instable, update temporarily, install orbit-python, and then change it back and update to the distro you are using
<chillywilly> s/instable/unstable
<SachaS> mailinglist for supply-chain seems not to work.
<SachaS> mailinglist for forms seems not to work.
<SachaS> i dont get confirmatin mail for those two lists.

<SachaS> mailinglist geas and mailinglist discuss seem to be ok.
<neilt> will i just posted the first message to the supply chain list since 7/26

<neilt> so it must just be sign-up that is hosed

Action: SachaS downloads source for python-orbit 0.3.1 for python2.1 base
<SachaS> debian testing python-pygresql 7.1.3-4 depends on python-base 1.5. ahhhh
<ajmitch> default python in testing is probably 1.5.2
<neilt> ugh, this is getting ugly
<ajmitch> what's that, the mess of python versions?
<SachaS> it seems there is no python-orbit and python-pygresql based on python2.1 in testing. havent looked at libwxgtk for python2.1.
<SachaS> and no python2.1-base in testing.
<ajmitch> it'll be for 1.5
<SachaS> yep. and i cant use 1.5 for gnue. right?

<derek> to explain the sickness of my family my mother sends me this email:
<derek> One day when the teacher walked to the black board, she 
<derek> noticed someone had written the word 'penis' in tiny small letters. 
<derek> She turned around, scanned the class looking for the guilty face.
<derek> Finding none, she quickly erased it, and began her class. 
<derek> The next day she went into the room and she saw, in larger letters, 
<derek> the word 'penis' again on the black board. 
<derek> Again, she looked around in vain for the culprit, but found none, so she
<derek> proceeded with the day's lesson. 
<derek> Every morning, for about a week, she went into the classroom and 
<derek> found the same word written on the board, and each day it was 
<derek> written in larger letters. 
<derek> Finally, one day, she walked in, expecting to be greeted by the 
<derek> same word on the board, but instead, found the words, 
<derek> "The more you rub it, the bigger it gets!"

<SachaS> derek: get wxGTK 2.3.1 and then install wxPython 2.3.1. 
<derek> i would
<derek> since you already are doing stuff from source
<SachaS> ok check wxGTK2.3.1 what the dependencies are.
<SachaS> seems like wxGTK-2.2.7 is the latest
<SachaS> so i have wxGTK2.2 and i download wxPython 2.2.7 and test then wxPython.
<SachaS> i heard from the dependencies problems of gnucash. but in some sense it is good to REUSE software ...
<derek> yip
<derek> my problem isnt that gnucash reuses software its that it uses non highly voliatle dependencies
<derek> that are oft not backwards compatiable
<derek> so like say for libgtkhtml you need an 'exact version' or a bleeding edge version
<derek> which then requires you to upgrade half your system to get the dependencies resolved
<derek> i.e. requiring python 2.x instead of 1.5.2 is a dependency
<derek> but its not like python 2.x then requires you upgrade 70 other packages to install it :)

<SachaS> yeah true derek
<SachaS> wxPython2.2.7 compiled with lots of warnings. but compiled.
Action: SachaS is recompiling geas
<SachaS> got an error compiling geas: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpython2.1
--- Fri Nov 30 2001
[00:11] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<SachaS> went to /gnue/designer and did a ./setup.py install
<SachaS> error: can't copy 'doc/DevelopersGuide-Forms.txt': doesn't exist or not a regular file
<SachaS> and script seems to stop.
<derek> hmm
<derek> do ./setup.py devel instead
<SachaS> in the main directory?
<derek> since you are running cvs copies right?
<SachaS> right
<derek> sure main directory will work (or so jason says)
<SachaS> in the main directory. does not work. Press Control-D to abort or any other key to continue. i press a key and nothing happens,.
<SachaS> i go to designer
<SachaS> and make a ./setup.py devel
<SachaS> -> Creating client/gfdes
<SachaS> so i go into client/
<SachaS> and sh ./gfdes
<SachaS> and in gfdes is some strange path:
<SachaS> PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/src/gnue/designer/../gnuef/.cvsdevelbase:$PYTHONPATH; export PYTHONPATH
<SachaS>   /usr/bin/python /usr/local/src/gnue/designer/../gnuef/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/designer/GFDesigner.py $*
<SachaS> i need a break. started at 07.00 am. its 14.24 now. and its not working. geas does not compile and designer not working.
Nick change: SachaS -> SachaS_break
<SachaS_break> and I want a SHARP Linux PDA :)
<derek> um i had this problem too
<derek> now if i can recall what i did to fix it
<derek> ok where is src/gnue/designer?
<derek> i assume not in /usr/local/src/gnue/designer
<derek> edit the gfdes file
<derek> to 
<derek> PYTHONPATH=/dir/your/cvstree/gnue/designer/../............
<derek> and and then the line after it
<derek> in same way
<derek> and try again
<derek> jcater and jamest would be ones to ask why this is now broken in cvs
<derek> its not in release
<derek> it should not take 7 hours to install gnue
Nick change: SachaS_break -> SachaS
<SachaS> derek: changed settings in /usr/local/src/gnue/designer/dfdes. designer comes up now :)
<SachaS> derek: is it that with the designer you can create gui pages. and within these gui pages you can reference tables and table entries to display.?

<SachaS> reinhard: after getting problems with python dependencies i got the source and installed python2.1.1, orbit-python-0.3.1, wxPython-2.2.7 and PyXML-0.6.6
<SachaS> reinhard: first question: is PyXML the correct xml package for python?
<psu> New website design - much better IMHO
<SachaS> second question: after installing python2.1.1 and PyXML i go back to the python installation and do the tests. the test_pyexpat fails. i guess thats not good.

<SachaS> ajmitch: i installed python2.1.1, orbit-python-0.3.1, wxPython-2.3.1 and PyXML-0.6.6 and could compile them and install them.
<SachaS> ajmitch: if they work how they should i dont know. the wxPython demo i could check.
<SachaS> ajmitch: then i went to the designer and started the client. the client works but i did not try to create a page.
<ajmitch> ok
<SachaS> ajmitch: my compilation of geas has some problems with python2.1.
<ajmitch> oh?
<ajmitch> i shoudl try compile geas
<SachaS> ajmitch: oh yeah give it a try if it compiles.
<ajmitch> shouldn't be too bad
<SachaS> ajmitch: actually it does not have to run at the moment it is more like to get into gnue
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> you just want to try forms & designer at the moment?
<SachaS> ajmitch: i also need to read some documentation first.

<ajmitch> geas has compiled & installed

<SachaS> ajmitch: you run sid. i run woody and installed python2.1.1 from source. hmmmm
<ajmitch> yeah, installing from packages is nearly always cleaner
<ajmitch> dunno how well geas will run, but it compiled
<ajmitch> i should check this, since it probably hasn't built in python method support properly
