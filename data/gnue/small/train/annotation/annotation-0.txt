<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>
<topic>Bayonne</topic>


<p>Mark Miller said <quote who="Mark Miller">I've heard GNUe has been 
shown at a few user groups with very positive feedback.  Would 
anyone be interested in putting together a demo that could be 
showcased in the AMD booth at Linux World Expo in San 
Francisco?</quote></p>

<p>Some days later 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.08Apr2002">
on IRC</a>, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">is there anyone willing to come to 
Linux World Expo in August</quote>? He said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">it sounds as though AMD will give us 
facilities to present GNUe for 20 min every hour or so on their 
floor - which means if we want our own booth we will need more 
than one person there - i am hoping to be able to make the 
trek</quote>.</p>

Two days later</a>, Derek asked David Sugar (dyfet) about Bayonne's 
experiences <quote who="Derek Neighbors">with being at Intel booth 
in NY that one year?</quote>. He <quote who="Derek Neighbors">was 
wondering if you had horror stories or not :)</quote> David said 
<quote who="David Sugar">The problem was we were the only free 
software at the booth...and nobody thought to look for us there</quote>. 
Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we would maintian our own 
booth still</quote>. David felt <quote who="David Sugar">the other 
problem with the Intel booth was it was huge and we were so easily 
lost in it :).  AMD might be much better in that respect</quote>.</p>
