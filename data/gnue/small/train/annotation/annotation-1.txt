<topic>DCL</topic>


<p>Continuing 
<kcref startdate="20 Mar 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="Debian packages for GNUe" />,
Nick Rusnov (nickr) said <quote who="Nick Rusnov">I'm 
looking at the current debian packages [...] they are 
rather wonky</quote>. He noted <quote who="Nick Rusnov">the 
guy put the ./debian directory right into the setup.py - 
rather than doing the DESTDIR thing you're supposed ot do - 
I have to reread the quick guide to packaging to figure out 
the best way to do it. I think it'll involve wrapping 
setpu.py in a Makefile - althigh since I know the people who 
wrote setup.py I could just tell them to support 
debian</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, continuing 
<kcref startdate="30 Mar 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="Debian packages for DCL" />,
Jeff Bailey (jabiley) said he had 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">some not-finished debs for DCL.</quote> 
He was <quote who="Jeff Bailey">trying to decide if I Should 
automate database selection and creation, and whether that's an 
abuse of debconf.</quote>. He would be the DCL package maintainer -
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">It was placed up for adoption and I've 
announced my intention to adopt it already.</quote> He thought 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">Maybe we should get a 
debian-gnue@lists.debian.org setup for good group discussion, 
and do the uploaders thing.</quote> Derek Neighbors (derek) 
suggested <quote who="Derek Neighbors">feel free to use the 
gnue-dev list</quote>. Jeff thought that <quote who="Jeff Bailey">The 
advantage of a Debian list just ofr packaging is visibility.</quote>.
Also, <quote who="Jeff Bailey">while you're different, most upstream 
folks tend to chew a new asshole in people who report packaging bugs 
to them.</quote> Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) volunteered to get 
<quote who="Andrew Mitchell">a list organised</quote>. Jeff warned it 
might take some time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.05Apr2002">
The next day</a>, Jeff noted that <quote who="Jeff Bailey">There are 
apparently only 5 users of dcl</quote>, based on the figures reported 
by the Debian 
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~apenwarr/popcon/results.web.html">
popularity-contest</a> package. Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">there are lots of dcl users (more than 5)
BUT i would imagine probably none of them installed from the debian 
:) - so i dont think 'breaking' the upgrade of the debian is a big 
deal</quote>.</p>
