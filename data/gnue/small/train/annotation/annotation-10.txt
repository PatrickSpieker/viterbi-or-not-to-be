<p>Ian Stewart (Javaguy) <quote who="Ian Stewart">wanted 
to run past an idea re: porting GNUe business objects to 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/">XSD</a> - 
XML Schema Definition</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) 
<quote who="Jason Cater">thought xml schema was a replacement 
for dtd</quote>. Ian said <quote who="Ian Stewart">XML 
Schema is being used to replace DTD's, but that's only one 
use - Basically, you have an XSD (schema definition), which 
describes a complex structure, and then you have an XSI (Schema 
Instance) for each instance of said structure</quote>. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">our 
schema language should be ODL as that's the purpose of it, 
to describe the schema of an ODMS (which include object application 
servers)</quote>. Ian said that, although 
<quote who="Ian Stewart">ODL seems to make the most sense for 
internal definitions If you want GNUe to interface with .NET services, 
SOAP, etc, ODL is not going to do you much good...</quote>. 
Daniel said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">ah, but we have a layer 
to do remote communication protocols</quote>. He added 
<quote who="Daniel Baumann">we don't have DotGNU integration 
yet.... juets ways to call methods remotely</quote>.</p>
