<topic>Reports</topic>


<p>Derek Neighbors (derek) said he would use a sample GNUe 
Reports Definition (.gfd), and do <quote who="Derek Neighbors">an 
html.xsl sheet as it should be easy - then i think i might make a 
gnumeric one - if i get VERY brave i will look at a formatted 
objects one which will segway into ps, pdf etc</quote>. Jason Cater 
(jcater) <quote who="Jason Cater">wants a text one, too</quote>. He 
asked <quote who="Jason Cater">how does everyone feel about 
standardizing on SVG for dynamically generated graphics
(i.e., charts, etc)</quote>. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i feel good about svg but i claim 
to know little :)</quote></p>

<p>Jason confirmed that the output parameter for GNUe Reports 
was <quote who="Jason Cater">-p or --destination</quote>. Derek 
thought this <quote who="Derek Neighbors">seems like an odd choice 
:)</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">-d is taken for 
"debug"</quote> but he was going to see if that could 
be changed. Nick Rusnov (nickr) suggested 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">why not -o</quote> for output?</p>

<p>Derek asked what the &lt;GNUe-report&gt; and &lt;GNUe-request&gt; 
tags in the output were for. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">you 
can ignore the GNUe-report-* stuff</quote>, whilst 
<quote who="Jason Cater">the GNUe-request are the options the report 
was run with - in case the raw xml was written to a file and later 
transformed</quote>. He didn't really want to remove either of 
these <quote who="Jason Cater">unless it really causes you a 
problem</quote> - <quote who="Jason Cater">nothing is 
permanent at this stage :) but my intent is to keep them</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Derek confirmed <quote who="Derek Neighbors">basic 
transformatoin for title is done :)</quote> He suggested 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">for now i want to be 'simple'
so im going to ignore 'page breaks' in html - and instead insert 
&lt;hr&gt;</quote>. Jason confirmed that section titles would 
be marked up as <quote who="Jason Cater">&lt;sectionTitle&gt;
foo &lt;/sectionTitle&gt;</quote> in the source XML. Derek was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">just curious if we are avoiding 
&lt;section title="something"&gt; for a reason - 
i think its easier in xslt to do the way we are doing it :)</quote>. 
He confirmed he had <quote who="Derek Neighbors">subtitles and 
sectdions</quote> working.</p>

<p>On formatting the tables, Derek thought 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">width, alignment etc should possibly 
not be in the [...] source file - this is where im torn - 
if we leave it out we are better off - BUT people will whine if 
we dont - i think the right way to do it is allow custom .xsl files 
to apply ontop of standard - but that another debate</quote>. 
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">I have ONLY one reason for doing 
that - I don't like it - BUT - this is a demo in which I need PS and 
Text demos - and at the moment, I can't figure out tables :) - 
so if you have a "width" we can fudge it for the moment. 
Now, if you know how to draw tables w/o that information - I'm game - 
long run, that's what I'd like - and remember, this is a proof of 
concept markup, not necessarily "official gnue"</quote>.
Derek suggested hard-coding a 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">&lt;table 
width="100%"&gt;</quote> in the HTML output for the moment. 
Nick Rusnov (nickr) suggested <quote who="Nick Rusnov">use CSS, it 
makes size and formatting much easier</quote>, but admitted this 
would only help with HTML output.</p>

<p>After some more work, Derek was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">getting closer</quote> with the HTML 
output, and posted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">a 
<a href="http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html">sample</a></quote>. 
Jason got all emotional - <quote who="Jason Cater">my baby - she's 
becoming a girl</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">let 
me knock out subtotaling - and then i will look at respecting the 
attributes</quote>. He did not <quote who="Derek Neighbors">like how 
you ahve done subtotals :) it will make me work</quote>. Jason asked 
<quote who="Jason Cater">how would you like it? we can change</quote>. 
Derek suggested XML source mark-up like 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">&lt;subtotalRow 
level="2"&gt;</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">actually, I think I prefer that</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek did some more research on <quote who="Derek Neighbors">some 
xslt stuff - like attribute processing</quote>. He noted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">you can combine documents</quote> using 
attribute values to contain filenames, and 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">we can do formulas in xslt if we so 
desire - hmm it can do sorting and the likes too</quote>. He 
reported <quote who="Derek Neighbors">well i have it respecting 
attributes :) - but its not pretty</quote>, as the table width 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">of 100% makes it ugly</quote>. Jason 
suggested removing this - <quote who="Jason Cater">the table column 
widths are actual max character widths - which may or may not be 
relative in html output - but was mainly for text/ps</quote>.</p>

<p>Nick reformatted the output using a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) 
to show how this would work. Derek <quote who="Derek Neighbors">looked 
at the version you made but struggling to implement it</quote>, but 
noted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if i remove that 
text="css/text" works fine - prolly will choke the snot 
out of old browsers though</quote>. Nick said the stylesheet would 
normally be a seperate file. Derek suggested 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">if you want want to pretty this up 
some</quote>, he might be able to get <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the 
xslt sheet</quote> to apply the formatting rather than have to use 
CSS. Nick noted <quote who="Nick Rusnov">you are getting logical 
information about the rows aren't you? [...] if you're getting that 
information, you can put it in class names - if its in class names 
you can mark up based on it</quote>. Jason agreed, 
<quote who="Jason Cater">as I don't wanna put css in</quote> the 
GNUe Report Definition (.grd) format.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.09Apr2002">
After midnight</a>, Nick suggested XML tagging like 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">class="total"</quote>. 
However, <quote who="Nick Rusnov">it doesn't matter what 
you call it on tehe grd side, as long as we can guess 
logical information about the data and convert it to CSS 
classes</quote>. For number formatting, 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">what you should do is do like 
spreadsheets do it - and say 'this item should be numeric' 
etc - and then we can say at the HTML level 'numeric classed 
things are right aligned'</quote> Jason said he had been 
planning to <quote who="Jason Cater">have something like 
&lt;field type="date" 
format="y-m-d h:m:s.i"&gt;2002-04-01 
00:00:00.00&lt;/field&gt; -  and the XSLT could take it as 
provided - or if the locale preferred, could convert the 
format</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">technically
it might be preferred to make xslt do formatting</quote>. Nick 
agreed - <quote who="Nick Rusnov">I say remove all physical 
formatting from grd - only provide logical information for the 
formatting side to use as hints</quote>. But Derek did not 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">want to lock us into xslt - 
so i woudl rather put the tag in grd and have our engine do 
it - though it think when we get cooking we probably wont have 
anything but xslt</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">fwiw, 
I don't want to put TOOO much processing off into the XSLT - as 
it isn't exactly known for its speed - i.e., transforms is one 
thing, sorting and format masks are another</quote>. Nick 
thought <quote who="Nick Rusnov">definitely do sorting and char 
level formatting on the grd side. but leave alignments and stuff 
up to the xslt based on type/class hints</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">there's several instances where I've 
needed right-aligned text- or left-aligned numbers - however, 
I do agree that the "default" could vary based on 
type</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason went to bed, and Derek and Nick discussed using 
italics or sans-serif fonts, making more changes as they 
went. As more people joined the channel, Derek gave a quick 
summary of progress to date - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the 
report is certainly lame but its really living and breathing
i.e. it actually gets its database from a database - 
you have an .grd which is xml that is like a form to define 
what db and such to connect too - then it goes out gets the 
data and makes an outputted xml file - and we do an xslt 
translation to turn it into html</quote>. He felt it was 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">a pretty solid start</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek and Nick continued to adjust the format to see 
what looked best. Derek explained 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">subtotalling is not fully 
functional</quote> yet - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">jcater 
will probably have them workign tomorrow</quote>. He started 
to experiment with outputting newlines and tabs for plain 
ASCII output, and posted <quote who="Derek Neighbors">the 
start of a text version</quote> before going to bed - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">i just think jcater needs 
ascii output for some dot matrix forms at work - 
so wanted to encourage that it might be doable pretty 
quick</quote>, although he admitted 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">it was easier to try txt 
as a second transformation</quote> than formatted 
objects for Postscript or PDF.</p>

<p>After some sleep, Derek started on the Gnumeric 
format as well. He asked <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i 
thought that gnumeric saved in xml? [...] but default 
is some binary</quote>. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) 
said that the default was just 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">compressed xml - via 
gzip</quote>. Derek decompressed it and exclaimed 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">man is it 'verbose' - 
will have to do for loops with variables in xslt
get it to output</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.10Apr2002">
The next day</a>, Jason asked about progress on the text XSL. 
Derek said he <quote who="Derek Neighbors">was going to write some 
'functions' so col width="" is respected - and would 
justify off that</quote>. Jason asked <quote who="Jason Cater">can 
I send you a sample of what I'd like to see?</quote>. Derek asked 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">what do you want for 'pages' in the 
.txt version - will a 'form feed' char work?</quote>. Jason said
that <quote who="Jason Cater">will work</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">if you can get the text.xsl up to speed
then that'll free me up to make the datasources respect those 
passed parameters - this is gonna be one helluva 0.0.1 
release</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">we really 
need all the items released - forms, designer, reports etc - 
its been a while on all of them</quote>. Jason said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">hopefully this weekend or next 
week</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said that one of the <quote who="Derek Neighbors">downsides 
to GNUe - every time you need info you are your own best reference 
(according to google)</quote>. Jason agreed - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">no kidding - I searched for xslt postscript 
yesterday - and guess what was at the top spot? gnue reports :) -
which blew me away</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason posted a sample 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/foobulations.txt">text</a>
report, and asked <quote who="Jason Cater">btw, is there any way in 
XSLT to store arrays?</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">um
 not really - its morelike a functional language than a procedurual 
one</quote>. Jason recognised that, but <quote who="Jason Cater">was 
wondering if it'd be possible to remember the "width" settings 
for the &lt;col&gt;</quote> headings. He <quote who="Jason Cater">only 
had those in the &lt;heading&gt; section - it seems SO wasteful to have 
to repeat those for each row - but if that's all we can do, then that's 
all we can do :)</quote>. Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">you 
can have it persist</quote>.</p>
