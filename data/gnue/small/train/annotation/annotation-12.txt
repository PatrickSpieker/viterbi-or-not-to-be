<topic>Common</topic>


<p>Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) suggested 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">maybe it would be better to 
assign for i18n one directory - put there translations 
(maybe in subdirectories), some kind of readme what i18n is, 
in what ways it's going to be realised and etc.) - and that 
everyone could put his ideas/corrections there</quote>. 
Jason Cater (jcater) suggested the translations could go 
into <quote who="Jason Cater">/usr/local/gnue/etc/lang/</quote> - 
or possibly <quote who="Jason Cater">etc/locale</quote>, to 
allow for localisations like time format as well - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">and maybe have subdirectories under 
that for each supported locale</quote>.</p>

<p>Further to 
<kcref startdate="27 Mar 2002 13:02:33 -0800" subject="[Gnue-dev] customized (non-ascii) forms" />,
Arturas reported <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">some good 
news from i18n world - i &amp; Dmitry (ok, it was Dmitry on the 
whole :) managed to get i18n (=&gt; Russian) symbols in wxForm
under win - source still looks awfully, but it 
works</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) felt that 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">documentation of what we are doing 
for all of i18n probably belongs in docbook/ -  with proposals 
and other docs</quote>. Derek felt there probably wouldn't be 
any tool-specific i18n files, so Jason suggested 
<quote who="Jason Cater">to continue w/our current model, they 
should all go into common/etc</quote>. This might not be ideal, 
but they could <quote who="Jason Cater">worry about cleaning up 
when we clean it ALL up :)</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">let Arturas check it in so we can 
blame him later when people complain ;)</quote>. Arturas didn't 
like the sound of that, but Jason reassured him 
<quote who="Jason Cater">don't worry.. we do that to derek ALL 
the time :)</quote>.</p>

<p>Arturas asked <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">do we transalate 
error, debug messages?</quote> Jason thought error messages 
needed translating, but <quote who="Jason Cater">I wouldn't worry 
about debug messages at this point</quote>. James Thompson 
(jamest) thought <quote who="James Thompson">i think the msg_blah 
stuff in gnue.conf needs to come out of there</quote>. Arturas 
agreed, as then <quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">there is no need 
to translate gnue.conf :)</quote> Nick Rusnov (nickr) asked 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">does python support gettext?</quote>. 
Jason said it did, but <quote who="Jason Cater">unfortunately, 
we have to be careful in implementing that - as that adds a lot 
of overhead</quote> as it <quote who="Jason Cater">causes a python 
method call</quote>. James asked whether they could be 
cached once on startup and <quote who="James Thompson">then the 
apps only reference the var that holds the output of the 
original _() call</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek suggested that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if its a 
message that is useful to teh END USER it shoudl be translated - 
if its more a 'developer' message - it should be in english 
only - as we already are assuming all 'developers' will speak 
english at least enough to code in english :)</quote>. He said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">the problem i think lies in that 
our lower level debug statements - some of the stuff is actuall
'user messages' - but not all of it</quote>. Arturas agreed - 
<quote who="Arturas Kriukovas">all other strings (that end user 
can see) will be translated</quote>.</p>
