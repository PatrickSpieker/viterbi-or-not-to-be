<topic>Forms</topic>
<topic>Common</topic>


<p>Justin Kirby (return_this) said <quote who="Justin Kirby">I found GNUe 
yesterday and it peaked my interest</quote>. He noted GNUe was written 
in python, and said <quote who="Justin Kirby">I am thinking about 
mozilla and jabber (my main points of experience) - does it make sense 
to integrate GNUe into these platforms? or is it too divergant?</quote>.</p> 

<p>Nick Rusnov (nickr) said <quote who="Nick Rusnov">Currently most of 
it is in python</quote> but <quote who="Nick Rusnov">you already know 
python, basically, if you know C++</quote>. He explained that, as 
python was interpreted rather than compiled, it  
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">has a library management system similar to 
perl's</quote>. But <quote who="Nick Rusnov">for most things
like simple scripts its just write and run</quote>. Justin 
said <quote who="Justin Kirby">maybe perl has tainted my outlook... 
but scripts and I do not get along at all</quote> - he thought this 
might cause stability problems for <quote who="Justin Kirby">something 
that will grow as large as GNUe will...</quote>. Nick said 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">I see where perl would give you a bad impression 
of interpreted lanuages - Python is by nature object oriented - 
its not like perl umm package wise</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, he explained <quote who="Nick Rusnov">python goes like 
this "you use whitespace for what!?" then "okay, 
its not so bad" then "Wow, this is easy" then 
"I love python!"</quote>. Justin said 
he had <quote who="Justin Kirby">just hit that "You use 
whitespace for what?!?!?!" phase</quote>. Nick said 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">yea, thats the most painful phase of 
all - a lot of people get stuck there</quote>. 
Justin said <quote who="Justin Kirby">also the lack of 
typesafety is troublesome too</quote>. Daniel Baumann 
(chillywilly) said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">that's what 
exceptions are for ;)</quote>. Justin asked 
<quote who="Justin Kirby">are braces optional?</quote>. 
Nick said <quote who="Nick Rusnov">you don't use braces at 
all</quote>. Daniel said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">python 
seems very natural to me even coming from c/c++ background - 
I don't miss the braces</quote>.</p>

<p>Earlier, Justin said he was looking at GNUe for 
<quote who="Justin Kirby">several things: a POS, Accounting for 
bother Retail and Service oriented biz - I am looking for a base 
to build off of for these types of apps... GNUe seems almost 
perfect</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) asked 
<quote who="Jason Cater">how are you envisioning either mozilla 
or jabber working with business software?</quote>. 
Nick said <quote who="Nick Rusnov">I could see 
jabber for a distributed sort of business object network - you 
could use mozilla with a web-based forms client - but I don' 
see why it'dhave to be specificly mozilla</quote>. Justin 
said he would use <quote who="Justin Kirby">mozilla for the XUL 
and XPCOM...</quote> Nick wasn't sure about that, 
<quote who="Nick Rusnov">although theres nothing stopping you 
from writing a XUL forms client</quote>. Jason said that 
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/projects/gnue/faq.html">FAQ</a>
explained why GNUe was not keen on Java-style technology.</p>

<p>Later, Derek Neighbors (derek) said he saw GNUe using jabber 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">in two ways - a. as an option for 
asyncronous messaging in gnurpc (i.e. just one more rpc choice) - 
b. as a integral part of the groupware/workflow components</quote>.
On Mozilla, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i see someone could make 
an 'alternative' forms client with XUL model and java script</quote>
if they wanted, but he didn't <quote who="Derek Neighbors">think 
its what core gnue developers should be focusing on</quote>.</p>
