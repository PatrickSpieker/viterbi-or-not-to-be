<topic>Application Server</topic>
<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Johannes Vetter (johannesV) announced <quote who="Johannes Vetter">ok, that's 
another bug removed from the new wx26 driver</quote> which allowed GNUe Application 
Server to work with version 2.6 of the wx user interface libraries, adding 
<quote who="Johannes Vetter">if anybody finds another one, please let me know</quote>. 
Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) pointed out that <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">if you 
click on a tab in a multi-page form, it loses the focus - and selection with up/down 
keys from a dropdown doesn't work yet - just with Shift+up/down - but it's not intuitive, 
imho</quote>. Johannes said that, to check this, he'd created a sample application 
just using the base wx driver, and <quote who="Johannes Vetter">i could use the 
up/down keys without shift-key to navigate within the popup</quote>. Reinhard M&#252;ller 
(reinhard) wondered if <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">it's the form catching the 
keypress before the UI gets it</quote> but this was not the case - Johannes 
<quote who="Johannes Vetter">just added a debug-print to the __keypress signal 
handler</quote> and found that <quote who="Johannes Vetter">it does not get 
anything</quote>. In any case, this <quote who="Johannes Vetter">works fine for 
gtk and osx</quote>.</p>

<p>Jason Cater (jcater) said that these sorts of issues were 
<quote who="Jason Cater">the main reason we split away from using wx into all the 
more-targeted UI libraries</quote> for GNUe Forms. Using the wx libraries to 
abstract the GNUe Forms code away from specific user interfaces had been a quick 
way of being able to support many different user interfaces and operating systems 
all at once (as described in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 12 Feb 2003" title="How User Interface drivers interact with Forms" />), 
but having a "native" driver for each user interface library was the better 
long-term option in terms of being able to fully support different UI drivers. 
James Thompson (jamest) cheerfully added <quote who="James Thompson">welcome to our 
(wx) hell - we hope you like it here</quote>.</p>

<p>Johannes reported back that <quote who="Johannes Vetter">i've found out why 
up/down does not work for dropdowns on wx.MSW - it is the menu-item for "next 
record" and "previous record" which are bound to up and down keys - 
on wx.MSW the menu seems to have a higher priority than the current control - 
so the keypress is eaten by the menu !!</quote> He developed a work-around for 
this by changing <quote who="Johannes Vetter">the "key_PrevRecord" and 
"key_NextRecord" in gnue.conf (as an intermediate solution)</quote>. 
But he would send an e-mail to the wx developers to see if this could be fixed 
properly within wx, however.</p>

<p>Reinhard was reminded <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">that I have never liked 
the cursor keys being bound to record navigation - I feel it's plain wrong to 
have the cursor keys bound to a menu item as a hotkey</quote>. Johannes noted 
that <quote who="Johannes Vetter">it's very problematic in this case</quote>. 
Reinhard noted that <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">there are quite a lot of 
controls that use cursor keys natively - multi line edits, dropdowns, radio 
buttons (that we don't have anyway) - and we will either break that native behavoiur 
(like it is now with the dropdowns) - or it will be impossible to go next/prev 
record when the focus is on such a control, because the control will eat the 
keypress</quote>. James said this had been done in GNUe Forms originally to 
emulate Oracle Forms, but asked <quote who="James Thompson">what would you 
replace those keys with?</quote> Reinhard was <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">not 
sure</quote> but suggested setting aside four function keys 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">matching first, prev, next, last might be an option, 
but that would mean to redefine other f-keys, too - alt cursor keys might be 
another option</quote>. James wasn't keen on using the function keys, but 
<quote who="James Thompson">i could live with the alt-curs-up|down setup i 
imagine as it would require little new learning for the people here - 
and alt left right could work same as shift-tab/tab i imagine</quote>. 
However, Reinhard believed that <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">alt cursor keys 
are not available on curses</quote>, the text-only user interface which 
GNUe needed to support, along with the graphical user interfaces (as 
previously discussed in 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 05 Aug 2003" title="Character-only (curses) User Interface for Forms" />) 
- and in any case, <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">alt left right might be useful 
to change tabs</quote>. Johannes noted that this currently used 
<quote who="Johannes Vetter">ctrl-page-up/down</quote>.</p>

<p>James noted that some of the current key mappings were not ideal - 
<quote who="James Thompson">F12 == new record - F11 = rollback - two functions 
that shouldn't be anywhere near each other on the keyboard</quote>. In any 
case, Johannes pointed out that F11 was <quote who="Johannes Vetter">used 
by the window-manager on os x</quote> and so was unusable on Apple Macs. 
Other potentially usuable function keys were also already mapped in different 
operating systems. James wondered <quote who="James Thompson">if we'll need 
environment specific mappings</quote>. Nobody was that keen on this, especially 
since they could see themselves using GNUe on different operating systems 
at the same time, but felt that it might be unavoidable - James just did not 
<quote who="James Thompson">see us finding one magic keybinding set that works 
everywhere</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.10Mar2006">Some 
days later</a>, Tam&#225;s asked that keypresses should be configurable - 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">i have more than 100 old customers 
using my old foxpro based app from 1992 -  using up/down arrows 
to change next/prev record - they will kill me, if i ever chage 
it to shift/ctrl/alt +up/down - we (kilo and me) started to 
rewrite it in gnue - fortunately we have no deadlines in 
stone</quote>. At first, Johannes did not think he could 
<quote who="Johannes Vetter">do very much about that, as i don't 
get that event at all (at control-level)</quote> Reinhard suggested 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">maybe it would be an idea to *not* 
assign cursor up/down as a menu hotkey</quote> as well. Johannes 
said that would help, and <quote who="Johannes Vetter">if we 
skipp up/down in the keymappers getEventKeyStroke .. it still 
works (as the keymapper can still associate the event) - 
but it is not bound in the menu</quote>. Later, he reported 
that he had <quote who="Johannes Vetter">got it working</quote> 
so that users could still use the up/down keys for next/previous 
record generally, but that whilst in a dropdown these keys would 
navigate between drop-down entries instead.</p>

<p>Tam&#225;s downloaded the changes, and was happy with the up/down 
behaviour, but noted that <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">enter doesn't 
select from the dropdown</quote> as expected. Johannes 
investigated and reported that <quote who="Johannes Vetter">it 
jumps to the next entry on win, but it does not on gtk2 ...</quote>. 
He found the bug and fixed it.</p>

<p>Tam&#225;s then reported that <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">after pressing 
the enter key the focus is going to the next entry now, but
the selected value from the dropdown is not ok</quote>. After 
some digging, Johannes discovered that this was a bug in the 
underlying wx 2.6.2.1 driver - <quote who="Johannes Vetter">according 
to the mailinglist this bug should be fixed with 2.7</quote>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.11Mar2006">The 
next day</a>, Johannes reported back <quote who="Johannes Vetter">the 
dropdown-problem is a known issue</quote> and the wx developers 
would be <quote who="Johannes Vetter">trying to look at it this 
weekend</quote> according to an e-mail he had received - 
<quote who="Johannes Vetter">meanwhile i'd prefer using wx 2.6.1.0 
as it is working perfectly with that version</quote>.
Tam&#225;s confirmed he had <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">tried it with 
2.6.1.0, and it's ok</quote>. Johannes confirmed he was still 
looking at <quote who="Johannes Vetter">the page-switching problem, 
I've not found the pb right now ...</quote>.</p>
