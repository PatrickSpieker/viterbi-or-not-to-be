<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>In the midst of a potential vi-versus-emacs holy war, Reinhard M&#252;ller 
(reinhard) suggested that <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">syntax highlighting 
and automatic indenting would be nice for writing triggers in designer 
... not so sure whether i'm still joking or not, actually :-)</quote>. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said that GNUe Designer already did highlighting - in 
fact, he has <quote who="Jason Cater">been working on designer a lot this weekend
- expect some mm, mmm goodness</quote>. Reinhard had seen 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">your huge commits, and it's great to see you back 
gnue'ing again</quote>.</p>

<p>He asked <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">what's your take 
on layout management? will it cause problems for designer?</quote>. James 
Thompson (jamest) noted that <quote who="James Thompson">designer currently uses 
forms wx ui driver to render the form (unless something radically changed)</quote>
- <quote who="James Thompson">iirc it also links into the events from forms to 
capture focus events to know what is being edited</quote>.
Reinhard deduced that <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">basically as long as the wx 
driver can render it, it will be not a big problem?</quote> Jason confirmed 
this - but he might need to change this. <quote who="Jason Cater">from a coding 
standpoint, it is great - as when a feature is added to forms - then designer 
automatically supports it</quote>. However, wx <quote who="Jason Cater">won't 
let us capture all events on an object consistently enough - so it makes the 
designer experience "lacking" - so I'm experimenting with drawing the 
controls</quote> within the GNUe Designer code itseld rather than leaving this 
to the wx libraries. Reinhard wondered if <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">maybe 
wx2.6 has become better on that</quote>. Jason replied <quote who="Jason Cater">not 
really - actually stuff that I could get away with in 2.4 - won't work in 2.6 - 
/me found out the hard way this weekend :)</quote>.</p>

<p>He confirmed that <quote who="Jason Cater">I'm not changing too much how 
designer works with forms - as I know you'll be changing some stuff - I'm working 
more on the designer code base itself - as designer was designed to be able to edit 
any GObject-based structure</quote> (any XML definition used for a GNUe object - 
whether it be a form definition, report definition, trigger or whatever) 
<quote who="Jason Cater">and I have a lot of GObject-based stuff in-house</quote>.</p>
