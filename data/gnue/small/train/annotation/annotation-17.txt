<p>Peter Sullivan (psu) asked <quote who="Peter Sullivan">what's the current 
status of the project?</quote> His perception was: <quote who="Peter Sullivan">a) 
Two tier tools - pretty much mature, in that jcater and jamest have all the features 
they want - b) App Server - probably where 2-tier tools were when I was last here, 
i.e. useful 0.somethings but still needs work - c) Packages - still really waiting 
for anyone to take an interest. Not really a focus for any of the existing 
developers</quote>. James Thompson said that the two-tier tools (GNUe Forms, 
GNUe Reports, etc.) did not have <quote who="James Thompson">all the features</quote>
he wanted, but <quote who="James Thompson">i've been unable to find time to GNUe 
seriously in years</quote>. Jason Cater felt that <quote who="Jason Cater">appserver 
is probably more stable than the 2-tier at this point - but that's for reinhard to 
say</quote>. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) said that 
<quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">appserver is more or less only missing 2 key 
features before 1.0: authentication/access control and transaction/locking 
support</quote>.</p>

<p>He added that the GNUe packages <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">would actually 
be a focus for me, but I have no time. gnue-luca is started but stalled</quote>. 
This was <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">a series of ERP packages for GNU Enterprise, 
targeted at small and medium companies.  Its major aim is to provide a comfortable and 
easily usable solution for the most common tasks in such companies, while still 
remaining flexible enough that it can be extended to fulfill more specialized
jobs.</quote> He added <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">`Luca' is an acronym for 
'Lightweight Utility for Company Accounting'. However, 
some people believe that the name was really chosen in memory of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Pacioli">Luca Pacioli</a>,
an Italian mathematician (1445-1517) who is credited with the first publication
of the `Venetian method' of keeping accounts, now known as double-entry
bookkeeping.</quote> Peter remembered <quote who="Peter Sullivan">Double-entry 
bookkeeping is one of those things that was sort of discovered rather than invented - 
in that the Venetian merchants noted that whenever they sold something - they had to 
record the reduction of stock in the stock book - and the debt incurred by the 
merchant who bought it in their accounts receivable book - Soon they started 
cross-refering the two entries - and voila - double entry bookkeeping</quote>. 
The conversation drifted off onto Enron jokes.</p>
