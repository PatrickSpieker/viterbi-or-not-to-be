<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>It was reported that GNUe Forms was not even starting on 
Windows if it was not started from within the 
c:\program files\gnue\bin directory - was it necessary to 
set an environment variable to avoid this? James Thompson 
(jamest) <quote who="James Thompson">didn't think that was 
necessary</quote>. He upgraded to the latest version, and 
couldn't reproduce the error - <quote who="James Thompson">it
loaded forms, let me login, then tracebacked</quote>. He 
suggested asking Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami), who 
<quote who="James Thompson">maintains the windows port</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Tam&#225;s said that it sounded as if the problem might 
be that <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">All gnue tools (forsm/ designer/ 
navigator/ reports/ appserver) depends on gnue-common. If it was 
not installed, this exception generated.</quote> He was intending 
to enhance all of the GNUe executables for Windows 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">to check not only the existence of
runtime, but gnue-common too.</quote> James wasn't sure that 
this was the issue, but didn't have time to look at it further.</p>
