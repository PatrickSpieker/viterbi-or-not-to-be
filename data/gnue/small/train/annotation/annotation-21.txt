<topic>Common</topic>
<mention>Reinhard M&#252;ller</mention>

<p>James Thompson (jamest) said he had defined <quote who="James Thompson">a 
coalesce() function - which works exactly like postgresql's coalesce</quote>, 
returning the first non-null value in the list of parameters. He wondered 
<quote who="James Thompson">if any of this would be of use to others and if 
so where I'd put them in common</quote>. Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) suggested 
that a chain of OR statements in python would do exactly the same. Johannes 
Vetter wasn't sure - <quote who="Johannes Vetter">watch out !</quote> - and 
gave a possible counter-example.</p>
