<topic>Reports</topic>

<p>Sebastian Brosig asked <quote who="Sebastian Brosig">Can 
gnue reports, or any other Free database tool for that matter, 
create crosstables</quote> - <quote who="Sebastian Brosig">i 
know the</quote> Open Office 
<quote who="Sebastian Brosig">spreadsheet has the "Data Pilot" 
which is OpenOffice's answer to pivot tables but it's a 
point-and-click interactive tool and not a database</quote>.
Derek Neighbors said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">Right now 
today.  It can not do CrossTabulation.  It will at somepoint
support this.  Furthermore, I am working to try to get a free 
OLAP implementation that GNUe can use as well.  OLAP is pivot 
tables on steriods. :)</quote> Jason Cater said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I will try to post an example pivot 
report done in GNUe shortly. Reports does more than you 
initially realize :) Of course, we don't have any sort of visual 
designer (yet), so it's rather difficult to see what's
going on :(</quote>. Todd Boyle felt that there was a 
distinction <quote who="Todd Boyle">between the goal of computing 
a particular crosstab at design time, versus providing users 
dynamic cross-tabs among a whole, balanced data surfing capability 
at runtime.   The latter is of course much harder but turns out, 
pretty essential for managers to investigate and understand 
problems /oppties which, guess what.  design time
programmers cannot always anticipate.</quote> He noted that 
proprietary <quote who="Todd Boyle">OLAP vendors have been providing 
dynamic crosstabs for at least a decade, against large datasets 
usu. by precomputing various subtotals.</quote></p>

<p>Stan Klein suggested looking at R, 
<quote who="Stan Klein">a clone of a commercial language called 
S</quote> which <quote who="Stan Klein">appears to be popular 
among academic departments of statistics, who use and contribute. 
It might be worthwhile to look at producing GNUe output that can 
be processed by R or to consider an interface that allows R 
capabilities to operate on GNUe-managed databases</quote> - 
<quote who="Stan Klein">The combination of GNUe and R could make 
a very high powered strategic planning, forecasting, and data 
mining capability.</quote> He gave <quote who="Stan Klein">an 
extract from the R Introduction manual discussing 
crosstabs</quote> Derek said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">I 
think the standard OLAP engine language for financials is a 
langaguage called A (im serious not being smart butt).  There is 
a GPL implementation from Morgan Stanley (the original authors) 
called <a href="http://www.aplusdev.org">A+</a>.</quote> 
Stan said <quote who="Stan Klein">A+ is a variant of a language
called APL ("A Programming Language") that, IIRC, was developed 
by an IBM researcher in the early 1970's</quote>, which needed 
<quote who="Stan Klein">a special keyboard to be able to input 
all the peculiar characters that it used</quote> - 
<quote who="Stan Klein">Think obfuscated C and go a few orders 
of magnitude worse.  :-)</quote>. By contrast, 
<quote who="Stan Klein">R is a more general statistical package, 
similar in capability to SAS or SPSS, with the possible exception 
of the user interface.</quote> <quote who="Stan Klein">I think the 
big users of R, besides academics, are probably strategic planners, 
market researchers, and scientific researchers, especially in the
medical and social sciences where statistics are important.</quote> 
Gontran Zepeda said <quote who="Gontran Zepeda">It so happens I 
have spent part of the past couple weeks hacking up a kludgey
perl *cough* package that interacts with R</quote>. He felt that 
R had a <quote who="Gontran Zepeda">quite un-gnu like</quote>.
There were facilities for using python within R, but GNUe would 
really need something the othe way around - but R did have 
<quote who="Gontran Zepeda">a DBI type interface.  That's right 
kids, get data from mysql, postgresql or plain flat files into 
your analysis space directly from R.</quote> He was not convinced 
that adding R as another dependancy for GNUe Reports was necessary, 
asking <quote who="Gontran Zepeda">Doesn't jamest have pivot tables 
working anyway?</quote> Stan <quote who="Stan Klein">took a look 
at the links on the R homepage and found something called
RSPython that appears to provide interfaces both ways</quote> 
between R and Python, although <quote who="Stan Klein">It looks 
like you need to know something about the objects involved, so it's 
an interface that needs to be programmed for specific 
purposes.</quote> He suggested <quote who="Stan Klein">The easiest 
way for GNUe to quickly do an interface (if desired) would be
to write files using Reports in a format that can be read by R, use 
the Python to R interface to send R commands to read the input files
and perform various functions, and then write the output from R to a 
file that could either be printed or imported to a database.</quote> 
He saw this as an add-on rather than a core dependancy. He also noted 
<quote who="Stan Klein">there appears to be work ongoing on GUI 
interfaces for R, but it doesn't seem to be very far along.  It might 
be nice to let the R folks know that GNUe might be a good candidate 
for that.</quote> Derek still preferred A+ as a general OLAP 
framework - and <quote who="Derek Neighbors">To do general crosstab 
type of reports I dont think an additionalpackage is 
necessary.</quote></p>

<p>Stan did some more research, and said that either OLAP or 
<quote who="Stan Klein">Traditional statistical packages</quote> 
could be used <quote who="Stan Klein">for strategic business 
analysis.</quote> These both required human intervention, at least 
in specifying the analysis to do. Also, <quote who="Stan Klein">There 
are also AI-based approaches under which the analytical tool searches 
for patterns in the data "on its own."</quote> In general, 
<quote who="Stan Klein">I detected a lot of "buzzwordism" in what 
I saw</quote> and <quote who="Stan Klein">when this kind of stuff is 
demo'ed it looks very "gee whiz" especially when stuff like 3D
graphics are included.</quote> There were really two issues - 
<quote who="Stan Klein">whether a free/open-source OLAP package can 
be built using A+</quote>, which it obviously could, given effort. 
<quote who="Stan Klein">The other issue is which of these approaches 
GNUe can support.  I hope the answer is all of the above</quote>, 
including R.</p>

<p>Todd said the most important part of a GNUe-linked OLAP tool 
was user-friendliness for the non-technical user. Quickbooks 
had dominated the small business accounting market, not 
because of any better functionality, but because it was 
perceived as more user-friendly. This was why he preferred 
something that built on existing experience of pivot tables.
Jason agreed that <quote who="Jason Cater">I see great
value in getting GNUe to talk to existing OLAP tools</quote> 
but pointed out that <quote who="Jason Cater">GNUe *will* 
(pretty much does) support simple pivot tables/cross
tabulation in its reports package.  And, this does not/will 
not require any external OLAP packages</quote>.</p>
