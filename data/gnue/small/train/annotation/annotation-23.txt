<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Jeffrey Walls asked if there was <quote who="Jeffrey Walls">an 
open source Linux driver for Unidata</quote> database. 
Jason Cater asked <quote who="Jason Cater">Is this the Unidata 
that's part of IBM/Informix's UniVerse line?</quote> Jeffrey 
confirmed this. Derek Neighbors suggested 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">Does Unidata have an ODBC driver 
(unix or windows).  If it does I would just use the ODBC 
driver</quote>. The main problem with ODBC was that there was 
no standard way to do introspection (e.g. find out the tables 
and fields in a database, but <quote who="Derek Neighbors">If 
you are fluent with Unidata or can provide information for it, 
we can likely write custom Unidata ODBC GNUe Common
driver that would enable introspection and the likes.</quote> 
As an IBM database, there would probably be a Linux ODBC driver 
for it. Julien Munoz asked <quote who="Julien Munoz">Does gnue 
use a "Database Adapter" concept like Zope ?</quote> Jason 
said <quote who="Jason Cater">Yes, we do.  As a matter of fact, 
if you notice, there's about a 1:1 relationship between the 
databases that Zope supports and those that GNUe supports. That's 
no coincidence. We both use the same underlying Python API model 
for database access.</quote></p>
