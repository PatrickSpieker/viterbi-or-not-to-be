<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) noted that the version of GNUe Forms 
maintained by Project

<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">has about twice more functions in 
trigger namespace - is there any purpose to keep ours such 
limited?</quote> James Thompson (jamest) said 
<quote who="James Thompson">i setup the trigger namespace so it 
could be easily extended then I sat back and let others extend 
it - /me is lazy like that. I'm hoping that we can start looking 
at merging the two trees in the very near future - or at least 
setting them up as a branch in our cvs until we can work thru the 
changes</quote>.</p>
