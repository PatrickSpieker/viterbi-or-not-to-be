<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 06 Nov 2002" title="Adding a CSV 'database' driver for Integrator" />, 
Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think 
good things were discussed, but im curious about making db driver 
more complex than need be</quote> - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">as 
generally there are two types of things - csv files in which you wnat 
to read and write and csv files which are used to 'move' data</quote>. 
He agreed with Jason Cater (jcater) <quote who="Derek Neighbors">in the 
dont assume 1 line - some wierd files dont start data until two or 
three lines in</quote> He was not sure about random access read-write, 
however - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i.e. is it only valid for 
import/export</quote>. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">well, 
I wouldn't expect to run GNUe Forms off of it - I suppose one 
"could"</quote>. Derek was not keen on defining CSV formats in the 
connections.conf file - he thought that sort of thing belonged in 
the .gmd (GNUe Mapping Definition) in Integrator. Jan agreed - 
if nothing else, the filenames would be changing even if the 
structure was not. Jason agreed - <quote who="Jason Cater">I'm 
really thinking, wherever you define it, this really boils down to 
a &lt;datasource&gt; issue</quote> - he felt both ways could be 
useful. </p>

<p>Reflecting back to 
<kcref archive="http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue/2002-August/003166.html" title="Integrator and schema import wizard" />, 
Derek said that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">integrator 
is just a different front end to reports</quote>. Jason said that 
it was a tool to provide a mapping layer between datasources 
<quote who="Jason Cater">to do complex stuff (with triggers if need 
be)</quote>. <quote who="Jason Cater">in my mind.. it's reports with 
a SINGLE destination... another datasource :)</quote> Derek felt 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">that the CSV driver to me is a HUGE 
first step for integrator - ie. i have needs for integrator but 
mostly with CSV - as soon as we have CSV driver i can start to 
torture test integrator with sample usages :)</quote>.</p>
