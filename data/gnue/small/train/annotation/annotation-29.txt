<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) reported some error messages for 
Unknown Events. James Thompson (jamest) explained 
<quote who="James Thompson">events are now defined per object 
instead of globaly - so if you've events on objects we've 
missed then they won't fire</quote>. He gave an overview of 
the event system. <quote who="James Thompson">any object can 
register to listen to any other object (basically) - however 
that object may only understand what to do with a few of those 
events. Example: so if you and i both did something crazy like 
register to listen to derek - and derek says "jump off a bridge"
I may know how to jump off a bridge so I go do it - you on the 
other hand don't know how (or are too smart to listen to him) 
and instead say "Unknown Event: jump off bridge"</quote>.</p>
