<topic>Application Server</topic>

<p>Bill Gribble (grib) asked how GNUe Application Server 
related to Zope. <quote who="Bill Gribble">it has many of 
the properties of an application server and gives you a lot 
of freebies. and it's already python. For example, the ZPT 
mechanism and TAL/METAL could be used to process a 
report definition (in XML) into a filled-out report (in XML)
- essentially for free. Since it already talks XML-RPC every 
which way it seems like it could interoperate with some of 
the existing gnue stuff, no?</quote> He did not 
<quote who="Bill Gribble">have enough experience with the 
state of the art in gnue to really know how the pieces fit 
together</quote> so he was not sure if this was sensible 
or not.</p>
