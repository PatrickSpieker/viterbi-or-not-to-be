<p>Further to 
<kcref subject="[IRC] 05 Nov 2002" title="GNUe Project organisation - version numbers, roadmaps, testing and branches" />, 
James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">i know 
people have said that the roadmap exists only in a few heads of 
the developers - in an effort to do something about that I 
present</quote> a feature-plans document for 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/forms.html">Forms</a> 
and 
<a href="http://ash.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/reports.html">Reports</a>. 
The format was based on the feature plans for KDE - 
<quote who="James Thompson">while it's not as strick as a roadmap 
it does attempt to give people an idea where things are going - 
how we think it'd work - as the 0.5.x releases progress things get 
moved from the red area, to the yellow, then to the green. 0.6.0 
will not appear until either everything in 0.5.0 section is in the 
green OR something causes us to move items holding us back into a 
later release section</quote> Jason Cater liked 
<quote who="Jason Cater">KDE's release plans better than the 
traditional roadmap you see w/projects as it is more fluid - 
and, I think it fits our model of development better</quote>. 
James asked <quote who="James Thompson">so should jason and I  
continue to work on these or are we waisting our time?</quote></p>

<p>Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">how 
are/will be the feature plans updated?  CVS? ...?</quote> 
James said <quote who="James Thompson">right now it's horrible - 
vi and raw html. I'm pretty sure I'd like to see someone make 
some databases and gfd files we can run on</quote> the web 
server - <quote who="James Thompson">then force our webmaster 
to write some php to create the pages in realtime</quote>. 
There were "placeholder" pages for the other GNUe Tools as well, 
but <quote who="James Thompson">the only ones that have been 
worked on are common, forms, reports - and then only a 
little</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek Neighbors (revDeke) appreciated James and Jason's 
efforts, and said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">im fine with 
calling it a featureplan as thats what i pretty much am 
defining by saying roadmap - i.e. a list of what features are 
targeted for what release. I woudl call it release schedule
but that sounds like it has a 'time' connotation and we all 
dont want that.</quote> The format was also helpful in terms 
of defining what he needed to add to DCL, GNUe's own
bug/task-tracking system, so that these could 
eventually be generated automatically - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">already i plan to add 'versions' 
properly into DCL</quote>. Jason said he had considered 
doing the feature plans in DCL, <quote who="Jason Cater">but 
I'm a little concerned about the flexibility</quote>. Derek 
agreed - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">for now i would suspect 
that DCL be done to track the work (bugs) not so much plan 
it</quote>. For the moment, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">im 
sooo happy to see loose feature lists - i dont want to get 
out of control</quote>. He would add 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">All outstanding critical bugs 
in dcl, if any</quote> to the lists.</p>
