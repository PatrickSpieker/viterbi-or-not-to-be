<p>Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said he and Reinhard M&#252;ller 
(reinhard) had <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">talked about 
autocreated forms out of database metadata.</quote>. Jason Cater 
(jcater) said <quote who="Jason Cater">you could almost take the 
Designer wizard examples and use them as is to do that (well, and 
make them non-interactive)</quote>. He was not sure whether this 
belonged in Forms or AppServer. James said 
<quote who="James Thompson">i think they want a data browser - 
point forms at a database and it opens a tree - click on a table 
and it opens a grid</quote>. This would enable him to stop using 
pgaccess, which he was not keen on. Neither Derek Neighbors 
(revDeke) nor Jason were really sure this functionality belonged 
in Forms, and Jason pointed out that you could pretty much do 
this from Designer anyway, by running the Simple Form Wizard and 
then using the Debug-Run menu option.</p>

<p>Derek thought <quote who="Derek Neighbors">maybe what people 
are wanting is dynamic forms - i know thats what the</quote> 
Application Server developers wanted. He personally would 
probably use static (flat file XML) form defintions mostly, 
but he could see the need for something more. James suggested 
<quote who="James Thompson">wouldnt this data browser be fairly 
simple standalone app</quote> using GNUe Common and wx, rather 
than part of either Forms or Designer. Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">im thinking maybe its a 'plugin' 
to designer - that could be called indpendently. I see many of 
things in designer being like that - where you can access them 
from within designer or launch on their own</quote>.</p>

<p>Jan said <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">reinhards idea was NOT 
to have a data browser, but to use dynamic forms for 80% of all 
cases.</quote> Jason asked <quote who="Jason Cater">wouldn't 
that be something appserver serves up?</quote> Reinhard 
said that Forms would be better at doing dynamic forms, as it 
would be aware of what font sizes and screen size it was 
working to. Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">actually, no 
forms definitions ever mention point sizes or anything like 
that</quote> - that was up to the UI (user interface) driver.</p>

<p>Derek said this might be as simple as just tweaking the 
current Simple Form Wizard in Designer to produce its GNUe Forms 
Definition (.gfd) as an XML stream instead of a file, and passing 
this to Forms - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">i think thats a plus 
of dealing with xml in this case is forms shoudnt care if the 
definition is coming from a file or directly from a stream</quote>.
Jason pointed out that <quote who="Jason Cater">it doesn't fit 
in with any model of forms client we have... the client is always 
given a definition</quote>. Derek said that, in practice, he 
would probably expect some other tool (possibly GNUe Common) to 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">prebuild streams and hand it to 
forms</quote>. By putting the dynamic form generator in Common, 
any GNUe tool could use it - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">you 
coudl have a form that called a trigger to make a dynamic 
form - rofl that would be funny</quote>.</p>
