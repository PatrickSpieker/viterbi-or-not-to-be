<topic>DCL</topic>

<p>Jeff Bailey (jbailey) asked if much had been added to DCL since 
the last release. Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">dcl has LOTS of new goodies - i 
just havent tested them all. I hope mdean is around as it might 
be this weekend - i had my side pretty much done - he was fixing 
new nested product stuff</quote>. Jeff asked 
<quote who="Jeff Bailey">What's your integration plan with DCL 
and the rest of GNUe?</quote> Derek said 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">for right now, my goals are to get 
it doing some stuff to help with managing consulting operations 
and gnue - then start migrating it to gnue - it already uses GNUe 
Schema Definitions</quote>. Also, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">my 
production implementation uses GNUe Reports - i will likely author 
some reports for it with GNUe Reports and put themin the DCL 
distro. There are several gfd's for it</quote>. Jeff said he 
would do a revised version of the Debian packages for DCL or 
any of the GNUe Tools whenever he was told there were enough 
new features to make it worthwhile.</p>
