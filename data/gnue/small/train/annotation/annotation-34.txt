<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vart) asked <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">what 
is master and detail when we talk about blocks in form?</quote> 
Derek Neighbors (derek) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">master/detail 
is parent/child</quote>, giving the classic example of invoices and 
invoice item lines. Dmitry asked <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">shouls 
i put child block inside parent? &lt;block name="parent"&gt;
&lt;block name="child"&gt;&lt;/block&gt;&lt;/block&gt;</quote>
Derek said he normally put the blocks after each other. 
Jason Cater (jcater) confirmed <quote who="Jason Cater">blocks aren't 
meant to be nested - I really don't know what would happen - but I 
wouldn't recommend trying :)</quote> Dmitry asked 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">how blocks will know they related? by 
datasources assigned to them?</quote> Derek said you used the 
masterlink="" and detaillink="" attributes on the datasource tag to 
define the linked (master and detail) fields. He thought 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">you can define parent child stuff in 
the blocks as well, but i havent done it that way</quote>. Jason 
said that was depreciated <quote who="Jason Cater">since 0.0.x 
series</quote>.</p>

<p>Dmitry said he had been trying to do master-detail using triggers. 
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">you don't really have to use many 
triggers to get functionality out of forms - triggers will usually be 
for special validation - or such similar polish</quote>. Derek 
agreed - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">forms internals does most DATA 
work</quote>.</p>
