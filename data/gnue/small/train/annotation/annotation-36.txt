<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>It was asked whether GTK2/libglade was stable on Microsoft 
Windows yet. Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) said it worked quite well - 
using the GTK2 driver for GNUe Forms on Windows worked better 
than the wx driver - it <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">isn't full 
featured IIRC - but hasn't got that ugly bugs like "focus 
nightmare" and "tabbed pages" problems</quote>. James Thompson 
(jamest) asked <quote who="James Thompson">how hard is it to 
get the gtk2 driver running on any platform? i thought it 
required custom patches to gtk or something - so avoided it 
for now</quote>. Bajusz said that, on Windows XP, he just had 
to <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">downloaded the necessary stuff 
from sourceforge - and it worked</quote> - no need for cygwin.</p>
