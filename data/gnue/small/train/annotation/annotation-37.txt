<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) reported <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">a 
problem with pages and blocks - i have 1 table with many fields, and 
want use tabbed pages, but with only one datasource and one 
block</quote>. James Thompson (jamest) said that the code assumed 
a block would not spread across multiple pages. This limitation
had been inspired by similar functionality in equivalent 
proprietrary products - <quote who="James Thompson">have fields 
display across pages is in the forms TODO - the blocks nested 
inside pages have been around since the start - I'm not saying 
were tied to that idea only that is was the 1st implementation 
and we've never adjusted it :)</quote> This would probably 
not change until they provided a way to repeat fields across 
different pages - <quote who="James Thompson">What we want to 
provide is a way to say this field belongs on all pages, or on 
pages 1, 3 and 5, or on page 1 - however I wouldn't expect this 
feature until after 0.5.x series is complete</quote>. Bajusz 
said his problem was more immediate - 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">what to do if i have 1 table 
with 100 fields and want tu use 1 form</quote>. James admitted 
<quote who="James Thompson">right now you're going to suffer 
:)</quote> - he <quote who="James Thompson">never thought about 
that size table when I did the page inside block thing</quote>. 
For <quote who="James Thompson">a very nasty workaround</quote> 
he suggested <quote who="James Thompson">make a 
master/detail/detail/detail setup - all using the same 
table</quote>. However, <quote who="James Thompson">It 
would be ugly to setup, editing would be a major pita.
Is this page limitation going to be a showstopper for 
you?</quote></p>
