<topic>Designer</topic>
<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Jeff Bailey (jbailey) tried to run the Simple Form Wizard 
from inside Designer against a PostgreSQL database. 
Jason Cater (jcater) warned <quote who="Jason Cater">check your 
psycopg version</quote> - versions 1.0.13 of this python-to-PostgreSQL 
driver was known to have issues, as <quote who="Jason Cater">either 
they changed the API or have a serious bug</quote>. Jeff tried 
anyway, and asked <quote who="Jeff Bailey">Is there a good way 
to make the input boxes more than 0 pixels wide?</quote> - the 
wizard was setting them with a default width of minus 5. 
James Thompson (jamest) said <quote who="James Thompson">the 
default size is based upon the size reported by the 
database</quote>, which suggested a serious problem with the 
pyscopg database driver. He suggested either using an older 
version of psycopg, or the popy or pgsql drivers instead.</p>
