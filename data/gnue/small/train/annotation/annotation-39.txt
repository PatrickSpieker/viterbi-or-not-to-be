<topic>Forms</topic>

<p>It was asked how to search for part of a field. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) said <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if you have field name
do f8 in the name entry - do ra%  - hit f9 it should return all 
results starting with ra</quote>. Also, 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">there is something called 
'sloppyquery'</quote> - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">if you put 
sloppyquery=""</quote> into an entry definition, then 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">everytime you execute a query it 
will</quote> put a SQL wildcard character (%) between each 
character - this <quote who="Derek Neighbors">fires 
onProcessQuery</quote>. Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) confirmed that 
the code for this was currently commented out - using the 
sloppyquery="" attribute did not crash Forms, 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">but search fails</quote>.</p>
