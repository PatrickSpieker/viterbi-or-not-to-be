<mention>Ariel Cal&#242;</mention>

<p>Reinhard M&#252;ller (reinhard) thanked Ariel Cal&#242; (ariel_) for 
his draft <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">object repository document 
you sent me</quote>. He was <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">not sure 
if we want to include inheritance at all - and if we want to 
include versioning and compounds in the very first version</quote>. 
He felt that some of Ariel's tabular explanations were clearer 
than the XML versions. He asked Ariel to send him a graphical 
version of the AppServer architecture diagram, so that he could 
include it in the AppServer whitepaper.</p>
