they are running an article on openMFG - which doesn appear free, 
open or even available - and that well kind of got my goad. It 
was an interview - i took the liberty of responding to the same 
questions from a gnue standpoint</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) 
felt <quote who="Jason Cater">I just don't see where they get off 
associating themselves with open source/free software - they are 
just trying to be the peachtree of the manufacturing world</quote>. 
He noted that there were <quote who="Jason Cater">several references 
to GNUe in the comments</quote> as of time of writing.

as a label as well.</p>
