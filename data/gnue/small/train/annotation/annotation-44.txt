<p>Jason Cater (jcater) announced <quote who="Jason Cater">After 
the next point release, we are moving away from</quote> reporting
version numbers for CVS versions of the software in the format 
0.4.1a, and would do them as 0.4.0.99 instead, to avoid 
breaking upgrades on Debian and other packaging systems. 
In the meantime, he had the <quote who="Jason Cater">first set 
of prereleases for 0.4.1</quote> on the 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/prereleases.php">web 
site</a>. Derek Neighbors (revDeke) asked if Debian packages could 
be done for these, but Jason felt they were 
<quote who="Jason Cater">not ready for debs yet</quote>.
Derek said he wanted to <quote who="Derek Neighbors">pay 
more attention to the release</quote>, as he would be looking  
to take responsibility to port any major bug-fixes back to the 
0.4.x series (as a "stable" branch) once Jason and James Thompson 
(jamest) had moved on to 0.5.0.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/irc-logs/gnue-public.log.13Nov2002">
The next day</a>, Jason announced <quote who="Jason Cater">New 
prereleases (-pre2)</quote>, listing the chages since -pre1. 
He was now in feature freeze mode (unless bribed with donuts), 
as <quote who="Jason Cater">We are prepping up for a weekend 
release.</quote>.</p>
