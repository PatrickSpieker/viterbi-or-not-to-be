<topic>Common</topic>

<p>Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked where to put test forms. 
Derek Neighbors (revDeke) felt these belonged in CVS, in the 
samples directory. Jan thought 
<quote who="Jan Ischebeck">that every feature needs an 
implementation by an form/report etc. which can be used for testing 
as for learning</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
<quote who="Jason Cater">I want to rm -rf samples and start all 
over. I want one interesting 
schema with sample data and all - and all forms / reports / etc
use this schema/ theme - and I want to use the same schema/theme 
in the developers guides - much like Access' Northwind (or 
whatever) test database - and I don't find zipcodes interesting 
:)</quote> Derek said this <quote who="Derek Neighbors">sounds 
like gnue-sb :)</quote> (GNUe Small Business edition). 
Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">maybe a simple version of 
that only 2-3 tables - anywho - that's not going to happen this 
release - but I would like to see it in 0.5.0</quote>.</p>

<p>Derek said he had a demo database 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">that i use for demos - its a video 
catalog database</quote>. Jason liked that - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">most people can relate to it</quote>. 
Derek said it had a very simple schema - 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">one main table and a few foreign 
key tables for type = vhs, dvd etc and rating = R, PG, 
PG-13</quote>. Alternatively, <quote who="Derek Neighbors">ideal 
for me would be a music database - CDs parent - Songs Child - 
lots of lookup tables for year put out, label etc</quote>. 
This would also demonstrate <quote who="Derek Neighbors">some 
cool triggers as i want to tie it into CDDB :)</quote>. Jan 
wondered if <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">a sample application for 
gnue should have connections with business</quote>. Jason was
<quote who="Jason Cater">not sure I agree because a sample with 
a pure business theme will tend to try to outgrow itself and try 
to become an actual app</quote>. Derek said he would come up 
with a schema in .gsd (GNUe Schema Definition) format over the 
next few weeks.</p>
