<p>Jason Cater (jcater) noted <quote who="Jason Cater">postgres 
uses a funky definition for precision</quote> which the XSLT 
files to transform a general .gsd (GNUe Schema Definition) 
into PostgreSQL-specific SQL could not handle as of time of 
writing - <quote who="Jason Cater">we are working on the schema 
system - trying to get it back together - it has been totally 
trashed</quote>. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked why there were 
so few data types in .gsd - no distinction between integer 
and float numbers, and <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">varchar and 
char the same?</quote> Jason said <quote who="Jason Cater">that 
was not the direction we were wanting to take gsd</quote>. Jan 
felt that <quote who="Jan Ischebeck">its quite different if you 
use varchar or char, as it is between float and 
number</quote>.</p>
