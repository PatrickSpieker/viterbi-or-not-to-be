<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) was having problems using GNUe 
Reports with i18n (internationalisation) Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) 
said <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">it seems something puts 
charset=UTF-8 into html header</quote>. Jason Cater (jcater) 
volunteered <quote who="Jason Cater">if someone can whip me 
up a simple report that fails with i18n, I can debug</quote>. 
Bajusz said it seemed to <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">be any 
report that pulls db data not in ascii, i suppose - you use 
dest.write ('&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;\n') 
in GRReport.py</quote>. Jason thought 
<quote who="Jason Cater">there's more to it than just changing 
that header, though - I think I have to open a codec - which I 
learned to do this past weekend by accident</quote>. Bajusz 
said <quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">you don't have to deal with 
codecs, if sitecustomize.py</quote> was set up to set all 
locales. Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) believed that Arturas Kriukovas
(Arturas) had got it working without having to do this, but 
he was not sure of the details. Later, he found Arturas' commit 
message - <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">Corrected problem of i18n 
characters in .gfd file - in case of not only ascii characters, 
sax returned unicode string, which caused further errors in 
python. Earlier this was solved by changing system-wide site.py 
file option defaultencoding from 'ascii' to other value. Now
encoding is read from gnue.conf file option formFontEncoding and 
is used to enforce sax returned unicode string recode to given 
encoding.</quote> Bajusz said that this 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">solves the gfd's problem, but what 
about data (from DBMS) ?</quote> Dmitry said that his 
<quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">problem was that xml processing 
enforces internal representation in unicode - it is not with db 
data - you know db encoding and can convert to other encoding if 
you wish</quote>. Bajusz said he was 
<quote who="Bajusz Tam&#225;s">thinking about reports - it makes an 
intermadiate xml file with dest.write() calls - and then a 
sablotron process comes. I don't know/when how UTF-8 comes</quote> 
into the process. Dmitry said that <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">UTF 
comes as far as you use xml processing libs (parsers)</quote>.</p>
