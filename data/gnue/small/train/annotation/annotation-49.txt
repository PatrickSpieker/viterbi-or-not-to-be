<topic>Reports</topic>

<mention>Bajusz Tam&#225;s</mention>

<p>Bajusz Tam&#225;s (btami) asked whether support for labels 
would be included in the next release of Reports. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said he had just completed this, 
and pointed to a 
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/labels.pdf">screenshot</a> - 
<quote who="Jason Cater">that was created from a dozen-line report file
and by telling reports "Avery 5961" (that is the brand/part # of the 
labels I use)</quote> - <quote who="Jason Cater">I still have some 
small polishing to do</quote>.</p>

<p>Later, Jason reported <quote who="Jason Cater"><code>gnue-reports 
-f postscript -F 'label="Avery 6879"' mylabels.grd</code> - that, boys 
and girls, now works. I tested with 3-4 different label part numbers
that I have in house</quote>. He explained the -F option was the short 
form of <quote who="Jason Cater">--filter-options == options to pass  
to the filter process</quote>. Derek Neighbors (revDeke) asked 
<quote who="Derek Neighbors">how are you making the postscript?
ie.. what libraries or such in python are you using?</quote> Jason 
said <quote who="Jason Cater">none</quote> - he had done this all 
himself in python. There was general appreciation of both the 
coolness of python, and Jason's coding skills.</p>
