<p>Rob Adamson (bobacus) said he had come 
<quote who="Rob Adamson">across gnue on the web a couple of 
weeks ago, and it looks like an exciting development - particularly 
if it can replace MS Access :)</quote>, as previously discussed in
<kcref startdate="18 Mar 2002 00:00:00 -0800" title="GNUe as a free alternative to Microsoft Access - and more" />.
Peter Sullivan (psu) said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">well, it's 
a bit more than that (or will be, anyway)</quote>. However, 
<quote who="Peter Sullivan">the beauty of GNUe Forms as an Access 
replacement is that you get to use *your* choice of 
"real" back end database - be it postgresql, 
SAP-DB, mysql, firebird or one of the non-free "famous 
names" DBs</quote>. Rob said he was installing the 
Debian packages. Peter said <quote who="Peter Sullivan">I'm not sure 
how "solid" the debs are at the moment</quote>. Nick 
Rusnov (nickr) warned <quote who="Nick Rusnov">the debs are being 
dropped from the distirbution I think because the latest ones are 
unbuildable</quote>. Peter felt <quote who="Peter Sullivan">It's a 
tad embaressing for a free software project (and a GNU project at 
that), but the "easiest" platform to install on at the 
moment is M$ Windows - just grab the setup.exe and go</quote>. 
He suggested <quote who="Peter Sullivan">I suspect you may be better 
installing from source on Debian GNU/Linux - I don't believe the 
dependancies are too awful to hack manually - and are reducing 
anyway ;-)</quote> Nick agreed - <quote who="Nick Rusnov">installing 
from CVS is very easy</quote>. Later, Derek Neighbors (derek) 
agreed - <quote who="Derek Neighbors">on debian get all dependencies 
from sid via apt and just get the cvs copy of gnue</quote>.</p>

<p>Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) <quote who="Dmitry Sorokin">wonders why 
so many peoples do not like access that much?</quote>. Peter 
said that Microsoft Access was not a 'real' relational data base 
managment system, <quote who="Peter Sullivan">but it gets (ab)used 
for fairly big d/b jobs because most people on Win platforms have 
it as part of Office - and hence it is "free" (as in beer) 
to them</quote>. Rob said it <quote who="Rob Adamson">does 
horrible locking stuff with its mdb files, which seems to interact 
badly with samba, afaict - but it can be used with other back-ends 
via ODBC</quote>.</p>
