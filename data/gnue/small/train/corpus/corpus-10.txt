<drochaid> I've got 2.2r4 on disk from a month or two ago ... and noticed 2.2r6 from the web site
<ajmitch> ok
<drochaid> am I right in thinking I don't need to get 2.2r6 to have a current install?
<ajmitch> very little difference, i'd say
<ajmitch> install 2.2r4 then do apt-get update; apt-get upgrade
<drochaid> that's the one someone mentioned a couple of days ago .. ta :)
<ajmitch> but of course i'd upgrade to unstable asap :)
<drochaid> bleh
<ajmitch> potato is so old
<drochaid> this is my spare test server [finally, I have a *spare*!!!! :D ]
<ajmitch> it's grown mouldy ;)
<ajmitch> hehe, ok
<drochaid> lol
<ajmitch> go for testing then :)
<ajmitch> this is my main workstation (yes i do work :P), and it runs unstable
<drochaid> now I've just got a 92 page PDF to print out and read for install ;)
<drochaid> I take it unstable isn't that instable?
<drochaid> more of a *current* not BAU than unstable?
<ajmitch> about as unstable as a mandrake release with all the patches installed... actually not even that bad
<drochaid> LOL
<ajmitch> it's hard to get that bad :)
<drochaid> I'm getting fed up with MDK
<ajmitch> hehe, you're soon to be an ex-mdk user as well?
<drochaid> not from the packages tey use, just how difficult they make manual config if you don't like their tools
<ajmitch> i used to use it until early last year
<drochaid> I'm already an ex-MDK user
<ajmitch> now it's debian on all my computers
<drochaid> I use slack 8 at the mo
<ajmitch> yeah, i understand what you mean, i jumped ship before they made it even harder :)
<drochaid> mdk 8.2 was the final straw ...
<drochaid> I tried the network wizards for ftp, smb etc in the new control panel
<drochaid> god knows what it did to my system, but it turned a manually config'ed working machine to a usless lump of shite
<ajmitch> debian seems to have the right balance between tacky-simpleton config & sadomasochistic configurability :)
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> my needs are really basic
<ajmitch> ie, with quite a few packages, debconf is all you need, but you can certainly do it manually, and debconf shoudl respect that
<drochaid> postgresql, openLDAP, DNS, web, ftp, ssh, openssl and a few others
<ajmitch> ok, i run all those but openLDAP & openssl (well, ssh uses openssl)
<drochaid> that would be good, I refuse to use pgsql unless I've built it myself [again MDKs pgsql implementation is a joke]
<ajmitch> heh, ok
<ajmitch> apt-get build-dep postgresql; apt-get source postgresql; apt-get build postgresql :)
<drochaid> :o
<drochaid> that will be shining bright :P
<ajmitch> oh, you probably want to tweak the config before you build it :)
<ajmitch> since you want a custom build
<drochaid> ./configure --enable-locale --with-pgport=<not telling> --with-CXX --with-perl --with-python --with-tcl --enable-odbc --with-java --with-krb5 --with-openssl
<ajmitch> right
<ajmitch> edit debian/rules, & you're away :)
<drochaid> cool :)
<ajmitch> makes it easier to satisfy deps
<drochaid> I take it 7.2.1 is available for deb using apt-get?
<ajmitch> yeah
<drochaid> cool
<ajmitch> for unstable, tho, you could have some few issues satisfying build-deps for potato
<drochaid> cause i don't want the sequences to run backwards after a crash ;)
<ajmitch> usually not much of a problem
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> use postgres quite a bit?
Action: ajmitch should put this now spare hard drive in the other computer
<drochaid> I don't use it nearly as much as I want to
Action: ajmitch got a 40gb drive, now can retire the drive which is dying :)
<drochaid> :-(
<drochaid> poor dead drive
<ajmitch> not dead yet
<drochaid> one of my test servers was my primary workstation .. until the primary ide chanel started to die
<ajmitch> just buzzing & coming up with uncorrectable errors in kernel log :)
<drochaid> I'm just hoping it lasts longer with linux than it would with win2k
<ajmitch> still good for a few more months/years :)
<drochaid> hopefully :)
<ajmitch> trust me, it'll last ;)
<drochaid> or at least, I'd be happier using a pci ide card with linux if the chanel does die
<ajmitch> i'm just gonna chuck scratch partitions & some GNU/Hurd partitions on it
<drochaid> doesn't look good for a backup & disaster recovery consultant to have to tell a client he can't access his docs because his machine died ;)
<ajmitch> hehe
Action: ajmitch wonders why hard drive does not detect...
<drochaid> what's the main differences betweem stable and unstable?
<drochaid> wrong bios LBA set?
<drochaid> not plugged in? ;)
<ajmitch> nah, bios isn't detecting it
<ajmitch> certainly is plugged in
<ajmitch> bugger
<ajmitch> i shoudl check ide cable, brb
<drochaid> k
<ajmitch> it's a western digital, need to pull 'master' jumper off to set to single drive
<ajmitch> stupid WD drives...
<drochaid> caviar?
<ajmitch> can't remember, it's an 8gb
<ajmitch> ah, fsck it, hdc=ide-scsi was still set as well
<ajmitch> another reboot...
<drochaid> lol
<ajmitch> good thing i'm using grub, supports cmdline editing
Action: drochaid isn't a grub fan
Action: ajmitch likes it, hasn't had problems with it
<drochaid> but really only because I'm too used to lilo
<ajmitch> i use the Hurd so need grub to boot it
<ajmitch> excellent, drive works now :)
<drochaid> I haven't had any problems either, I just haven't put the work into learning how to manually configure it ... very ashamed to admit to using MDKs gui editor for it :(
<ajmitch> sad... :)

<ajmitch> i haven't had any for quite awhile

<ajmitch> yo psu
<psu> hi
<chillywilly> sup dawg
<psu> not much
<ajmitch> been having fun with irc summaries?
<psu> finished off Friday's earlier today ;-)
<psu> first job is to strip out the off-topic stuff, and sort what's left into "threads"
<psu> usually takes 1/2 hour
<psu> then actually writing the summaries
<psu> can be anything from 0 to 2 hours a day
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> you do a very good job, psu
<jbailey> psu: Stripping out the off-topic?  Is there anything left?
<psu> jbailey - some days, no. 
Action: chillywilly thwaps jbailey with a 5lb trout
<psu> Actually, there's usually 3-4 mini-threads a day on average
<psu> but no such thing as an average day ;-)
<ajmitch> jbailey: i think so
<ajmitch> iirc chillywilly & i discussed GEAS for awhile the other day
<chillywilly> cause we're super freaks
<psu> GNUe KC #23 is up, anyway
<psu> http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/latest.html
<chillywilly> woooo
<chillywilly> is that brand new?
<chillywilly> looks to be
Action: ajmitch goes to read
<psu> cw is mentioned in 8 of the 20 sections ;-)
<psu> indexing of names is still not working 
<psu> I think it's a temporary casulty of the move from using perl to XSLT to parse the source code
<ajmitch> 8/20? not bad, chillywilly ;)
<psu> plus a certain ajmitch returns 
<psu> section 11
<ajmitch> "he discussion as to whether this was a good idea or not degenerated rapidly." ie, went offtopic very quickly ;)
<psu> s/11/12
<psu> I've always been a master of the careful euphemism ;-)
<psu> only once so far had to use "A full and frank discussion then ensued."

<psu> ajmitch: you might think that, Icouldn;t possibly comment
<drochaid> deb question ... I'm configuring the apt-get sources during install ... all 3cds are scanned and I want to add a downloadable one as well
<drochaid> I take it ftp is preferable to http?
<ajmitch> http is preferable, i'd say
<drochaid> really?
<ajmitch> eg:
<ajmitch> deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib
<ajmitch> deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US unstable/non-US main contrib 
<ajmitch> i dunno ;)
<psu> I was always told that ftp was better (=marginally more efficient)
<psu> at getting files than http
<psu> BUT 
<psu> this was wrt general downloading 
<psu> not deb specific
<psu> so may or may not be true in this case
<psu> Helpful, ain't I?
alexey (alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<psu> FWIW, I think the other PC which I installed debian over modem on 
<psu> is set up to use FTP
<psu> (It has no CD, so I had no choice but to do it online
<drochaid> k
<psu> with some help from a very patient chillywilly)
<drochaid> I went with ftp anyways
Action: ajmitch waits for debian tarball to download so he can install
<ajmitch> psu: i'm about to do an install online, over a 33.6k modem ;)
<psu> I think I had a 56k, but it was still painful
<chillywilly> I use http
<drochaid> also to confirm ... once the base system for deb is on ... I assume it's safe to just install apps I actually want?
<drochaid> unlike MDK et all where that would completely screw the system ..
<ajmitch> well the full packages compiled for the libio-based GNU/Hurd system is minimal anyway
<chillywilly> but I use apt-proxy now so all my paclages are caches in one place
<chillywilly> er, packages
<chillywilly> cached
<ajmitch> don't knock mdk, mdk rocks ;) (cough)
<psu> drochaid: yes, but beware dependancies
<psu> apt-get is your friend
<psu> It took me several days before I realised I had X and GNOME but no window manager, for instance
<chillywilly> aptitude is nice
<drochaid> lol psu
<drochaid> I'm screwed then, ain't I ;)
<chillywilly> drochaid: why does that 'screw the system'
<chillywilly> psu: 56K is always painful
<ajmitch> chillywilly: it's mandrake, mandrake is crap ;)

Action: ra3vat is using mdk-like distro with apt-get integrated
Action: chillywilly hugs debian
<drochaid> which window manager did gnome use when 2.2r4 was released ... enlightenment or sawmill ... and should I just use enlightnment anyway?
<chillywilly> I love you
<drochaid> ty chillywilly
<chillywilly> you should upgrade to testing
<chillywilly> imho
<drochaid> very kind of you o say so
<ajmitch> chillywilly: that's what i said - i suggested sid of course :)
<chillywilly> well I do love you all too, but not as much as my debian sorry
Action: ajmitch is feeling a little tired
<chillywilly> you should upgrade now while you have the base installed
<chillywilly> less shit to download
<drochaid> who should? me?
<chillywilly> yes, you
<chillywilly> :)
<drochaid> ah me
<drochaid> this is just a primary test build
<drochaid> it's not going to last more than a couple of days
<chillywilly> ?
<drochaid> at the moment I just want to get used to deb to see what I think
<chillywilly> you should convert all your boxen to the One True Debian Way (tm)
<chillywilly> :P
<drochaid> which means re-installing in different ways a number of times
<chillywilly> nah
<chillywilly> friggin ghost the rest
<drochaid> just now I'm using the install docs to guide me [sparse tho the info is at times]
<chillywilly> drochaid: #debian-support is the best damn debian support channel
<chillywilly> ;)
<drochaid> once I've got a rough idea what I'm doing I'll get you to tell me the best way ;)
<chillywilly> right ajmitch ;)
<ajmitch> chillywilly: you mean cp or dd? ghost is proprietary :)
<psu> dneighbo always swears by #debian
<chillywilly> ajmitch: rsync
<psu> sorry, that should be swears *at* #debian...
<chillywilly> psu: I'm sure her does swear at it
<chillywilly> rofl
<psu> anyway
<psu> bbl
<chillywilly> buh-bye psu
<ajmitch> chillywilly: i use cp -avx for straight copies (done it a few times tonight)
psu (peter@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> bye
<chillywilly> via nfs?
<chillywilly> b2b == booty 2 booty not business 2 business....lol
<ajmitch> no, via ide :) just plug in 2 hard drives at once, copy in single-user mode (since i was copying /)
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> that'll do it
<chillywilly> hey does python call the parent constructpr implecity or do you have to do parentClass.__init__(some stuff)?
<chillywilly> er, implicitly
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<psu> back
<chillywilly> wb psu
<ajmitch> yep, in wxPython you'd do wxGrid.__init__(self, ...)
<ajmitch> (have to pass self as first argument)
<ajmitch> hey psu
<psu> kc #23 announcement posted to gnue-announce & web front page
<psu> both awaiting approval ;-)
<ajmitch> excellent
<chillywilly> ajmitch: so you are telling me it is 'explicit' right?
Action: ajmitch looks around for some electroshock therapy
<ajmitch> chillywilly: yep
<ajmitch> chillywilly: parent ctor is not called unless you do it
<chillywilly> a'ight
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> we should talk more about GEAS to give psu something to do ;)
<ajmitch> should the different parts of GEAS be all running as separate threads in one python instance, or would you rather them be in separate instances, communicating via gnue-common libs?
<ajmitch> i vote for separation, for robustness :)
<ajmitch> this has probably already been discussed to death, but hey, i'm bored
<psu> I would guess that GEAS should be as separated as possible
<psu> as you might want to have it on multiple servers
<ajmitch> psu: yeah, that would make sense
<psu> and as well as having mutliple instances of different parts of GEAS on diff servers
<ajmitch> would make it more scalable, & robust, imho
<psu> you might also want to put diff parts of GEAS on diff servers
<psu> Bear in mind that all I know about CORBA is a powerpoint slide a salesman once showed me
<ajmitch> yep
<psu> and even less about other RPCs
<drochaid> ok ... someone tell me that 2.2 does NOT use 6.5.3 of pgsql?
<psu> "all I knew about RPC I learned in #gnuenterprise" - bumper sticker
<ajmitch> webware has an appserver, i think we shoudl look at that for how they do object caching, etc
<ajmitch> ok ;)
<ajmitch> drochaid: umm, i think it might ;)
<drochaid> ajmitch: just how old is 2.2??
<drochaid> that's like .. over 2 years ago or summat
<ajmitch> umm, 2.2 is ancient, i'm telling you ;)
<drochaid> release date, 13th of October 1999
<drochaid> 7.0 was released 8th of May 2000
<drochaid> now I know why my friends though debian was dead
<drochaid> waaaaay overdue for a new stab;e
<ajmitch> ;)
<psu> on geas scalability, I am really speaking from a business mgr/app consultant POV
<drochaid> the unstable version .. is that what deb call the testing version on their website?
<psu> so the technical details are of minimal interest to me 
<psu> but 
<psu> scalability is important
<psu> as free s/w tends to need scalability
<psu> look at Linux - from embedded PDA to IBM mainframe
<ajmitch> i talk mainly from a technical perspective with an eye on business needs :)
<psu> or beowulf cluster
<psu> GNUe has the potential to a similar wide range
<ajmitch> yeah, which is really appealing to businesses :)
<psu> i.e. no matter what we say, some people will use it as a Quicken/SAGE/M$Money clone
<psu> on a single PC
<psu> naming no jcaters by name
<psu> but 
<psu> at the other end
<psu> you can replicate your GEAS servers as much as you like 
<psu> i.e. multiple servers doing same tasks
<psu> diff servers doing diff tasks
<psu> the only obvious limit to scalability is that you need a "GEAS Server Server" 
<ajmitch> hehe
<psu> to tell the other GEAS servers where all the other servers are & their status
<ajmitch> a node controller?
<psu> sorta a GEAS DNS 
<psu> yep
<psu> and, at  a pinch, even that could be replicated or have some kind of masta/slave relationship
<ajmitch> yep, automagical failover, so that transactions aren't lost?
<ajmitch> all that was planned awhile back, but was never done (wasn't needed)
<ajmitch> i guess with GNUe, things are implemented as needed :)
<psu> yes & no - quick and dirty fixes that get us going are better than plans that go nowhere
<psu> but we want to keep the big picture
<chillywilly> hmmm
<psu> I guess that, in retrospect, GEAS v1 is almost a "proof of concepot"
Action: chillywilly read back buffer
<chillywilly> reads
<ajmitch> yep, that's why there's a redesign
<chillywilly> I'm not sure it proved much
<chillywilly> ;)
<ajmitch> iirc andrewm didn't like that he had no time to design a decent GEAS
<psu> chillywilly: ok then a "proof of failure"
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> I wouldn't go that far
<chillywilly> it's not hat bad
<psu> s/failure/useful 
<chillywilly> proof that we can hack some shit up
<psu> just needs some GNUe luvvin'
<psu> I believe you said once
<psu> may even be quoted in KC ;-)
Action: psu is away: designing GEAS schemas in the bath...
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> althought I can't take credit for the current GEAS design
<chillywilly> I only contributed some code to andrewm's diabolical plan
<chillywilly> now I can make one of my own ;)
<drochaid> ok doodles ... I've got into a failing loop with deb trying to create an XF86Config
<drochaid> htf do I leave without aborting the install?
<drochaid> scrap that, I aborted and it asked if I wanted to retry
<chillywilly> dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
<chillywilly> if X 4.1.c
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> if X 4.1.x
<drochaid> and why does it get me to enter all the info near the start and then try to override it with this bit?
<drochaid> pointless redundancy

<chillywilly> I fell sorry for you ajmitch
<ajmitch> i'll get some highly caffienated drink for between lectures
<ajmitch> i'm a student, i'm allowed to ;)
<chillywilly> you will feel like shit at about 10 or 11am
<ajmitch> which is right when my lectures start ;)
<ajmitch> excellent
<ajmitch> i've done all-nighters & begun to feel tired about 8pm or so the next day
<chillywilly> well you usually get another adrenaline rush
<chillywilly> and make it into pm
<chillywilly> then you really feel like crap
<ajmitch> yep ;)
<drochaid> I've never gone more than 46 hours without sleep before
<drochaid> that's about my limit before I get no choice
<ajmitch> shall i try for 7am sunday -> 9pm tuesday?
<drochaid> oh yes
<ajmitch> shoudl be fairly easy ;)
<ajmitch> don't think i could concentrate thru my 4 hour electronics lab on tuesday tho
<drochaid> is that really a prob?
<drochaid> you the student or lecturer?
<ajmitch> yeah, i have to catch up on CS lab before wednesday morning
<ajmitch> i'm the student
<ajmitch> :)
<drochaid> would be worse if you were the lecturer ;)
<drochaid> ok, I've now got a deb 2.2r4 build that doesn't have x config'ed properly, and has an old pgsql I don't want ...
<drochaid> what now? :)
<ajmitch> upgarde to testing! :)
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> so howd I do that then?
<drochaid> and wtf is woody due? :)
<ajmitch> edit /etc/apt/sources.list, change 'stable' to 'woody'
<ajmitch> tentatively for May 1 ;)
<drochaid> oooh
<ajmitch> 2002
<drochaid> so not too long then, even if it goes some way past that
<drochaid> lol @ 2002
<drochaid> ok ..
<drochaid> I'm thinking about doing a reinstall of the base system
<drochaid> I think chillywilly said that was the best place to go to woody?

<drochaid> cool
<drochaid> so I get to base stage, choose not to install any more apps ... then come back here at that point?
<ajmitch> could do,i guess ;)

<drochaid> nickr: what??
<ajmitch> drochaid: tasksel lets you choose 'tasks' which are groups of packages for certain tasks, like web server, X, etc
<drochaid> ahh
<ajmitch> you need to upgrade the base to testing first, then apt-get the tasksel package, iirc
<drochaid> mmm ... but first I need to install win95 on the machine >:)
<drochaid> I need to find out what graphics card I'm using
<drochaid> I picked one from my spare parts bin yesterday

<drochaid> I know it's a matrox ... not sure which one tho
<nickr> lspic

<thooby> Hi,
<ajmitch> hello
<thooby> Can I ask for some help?
<ajmitch> umm, i dunno if i can help you, but you can ask :)
<thooby> well I am just installed  gnuenterprise and I am a bit confused
<thooby> How I can start suppy-chain packages
<psu> thooby: SCM is still a proposal
<psu> as we are  a free s/w project, you get to see our stuff much earlier
<psu> in the development cycle than you would with proprietary software
<psu> GNUe is sorta two projects in one:
<thooby> The modules seems to work but I have no any idea how install the package
<psu> a) a set of tools to run enterprise apps (forms, reports, etc)
<psu> b) the apps themselves
<psu> we have concentrated so far on a)
<psu> so we have an excellent forms client, graphical designer, 
<psu> and the start of a reports and application server module
<psu> but nothing other than some proposals on b)
<thooby> Yes I know yes but suppy-chain is the first
<thooby> sorry
Action: psu thinks we need a much more prominent "Status" page on the website
<psu> There's quite a bit of documentation on what we want SCM to be
<psu> in CVS
<thooby> Well I understand. I thought it was a little prototype
<psu> looking in CVS, there are some GCD (GNUe Class Definitions)
<psu> which may be the start of what you mean
<thooby> Well, I have more questions I've compiled everything but I have some
<thooby> problems in order to connect with postgres
<psu> I assume you have set up your connections.conf with details of the postgres d/b you want to 
<psu> point at?
<psu> i.e. user name, p/w etc
Action: psu is really just a lurker, but is repeating things he's heard others say
<thooby> In conections.conf I have put provider= postgresql host =localhost and dbname = gnue
<thooby> and i have create a gnue database
<psu> ok - I believe this should then ask you for u/name & p/w when you log in
<psu> If you have the GNUe Designer, that is a good place to start
<psu> try one of the wizards.
<psu> Are there any tables or data in the gnue database?
<psu> If so, the simple d/b wizard should find it & ask you which table to 
<psu> do a simple form off

<drochaid> any peeps around willing to help me get up to deb unstable?
<drochaid> I've just re-installed the base and zero apps
<drochaid> with the excpetion of the updates for base apps via ftp
Action: drochaid prods
<drochaid> hmm
<drochaid> try again
Action: drochaid prods chillywilly
<nickr> gross
Action: drochaid holds coffee under ajmitchs nose
<nickr> drochaid: edit /etc/apt/sources, change lines from stable to unstable (except for the security line)
<nickr> apt-get update
<drochaid> ta nickr
<nickr> hrm, are you going from stable or woody?
<drochaid> stable
<nickr> shit
<drochaid> shit?
<nickr> it might be easier to reinstall from woody
<drochaid> easier or just faster?
<drochaid> I've put on 2.2 r4
<nickr> easier AND faster
<drochaid> I'll try this first, since it's on now
<nickr> do you have a CD burner and broadband? theres a 30 meg thing you download and its really easy
<nickr> alrgihtn I'll find the release notes
<nickr> theres an ordering you have to do
<drochaid> uh ...
<drochaid> I do have broadband and a cdrw
<nickr> hrm, just try an apt-get dist-upgrade and see what happens :)
<drochaid> okies .. I've just done the apt-get update ... so I'll try that now
<drochaid> 95 upgrades and 19 new installs happening now
<nickr> okey
<nickr> anything kept back?
<drochaid> what would it say to let me know?
<nickr> at the top it says 'The following packages have been kept back:'
<drochaid> I didn't notice any
<drochaid> and now the top is off the screen
<nickr> you could shift-pageup
<nickr> but okay
<nickr> no worries-
<drochaid> except that the second I hit ahift and page up .... it drops straight to the bottom again ;P
<nickr> you can hit control-s
<nickr> then shift pageup
<nickr> then read
<nickr> then control-q
<drochaid> what does control-s do ?
<nickr> xoff
<nickr> STOP
<drochaid> ah, ta
<drochaid> uh
<drochaid> no it don't
<drochaid> that's just scroll lock
<drochaid> and with that switched on, I *can't* shift-pageup

<dneighbo> hi anyone know where to get mame roms

<dneighbo> um its really slow (iirc)
<drochaid> nickr: ok, I just fudged it by hijacking another term ....
<dneighbo> http://mamefans.metropoliglobal.com/
<dneighbo> that the link you gave me?
<drochaid> there is nowhere mentioning things kept back
<nickr> maybe.
<drochaid> nickr: ok .. dist-upgrade happened, with lots of questions I guess at
<drochaid> anything else?
<nickr> thats it
<nickr> now install whatever you want
<drochaid> cool
<drochaid> right
<drochaid> how do I find out what apps are available?
<drochaid> I assume it's just 'apt-get install <appname>' ?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> you can search with apt-cache search
<drochaid> ta
<nickr> or you could use a proper front end
<nickr> or you could use tasksel and get a lot of garbage you do'nt need ;)
<drochaid> what would a decent front end for apt-get be?
<nickr> well, the up and comming one is aptitude
<nickr> its reasonably easy to use
<drochaid> cool
<drochaid> x based?
<nickr> no
<drochaid> excellent, cause I don't have X yet :)
<nickr> well there is an X version maybe
<nickr> the text one is better though
<nickr> For X theres something called Synaptik that I rather like

<drochaid> nickr: I can see why you like aptitude ... I'm playing with it just now, and gradually getting used to it
<nickr> it is pretty good yes
<nickr> the nice thing about it when mass adding packages is that you can just go through the list and pick out the things you need
<nickr> the same reason its also useful when culling your installation
<nickr> also it brings along suggests: and recommmends: with packages
<nickr> which apt doesn't do
<drochaid> yep :)
<drochaid> I am finding it stalls quite a bit tho, which I'm guessing is the ftp server ....
<nickr> yea
<nickr> perhaps
<drochaid> at the mo I'm just quiting the download, ok'ing the error then hitting 'g' again
<drochaid> is there a better way?
<nickr> that works
<drochaid> cool
<nickr> I'm not sure what causes the stalling

<nickr> make a netinst cd for woody

<chillywilly> does gnue do anything?

<chillywilly> heh, that's the question of the month in #python
<jcater> huh?
<jcater> what did you tell them?
<jcater> it doesn't do dishes?
<jcater> or windows?
<jcater> haha
<chillywilly> I said it make great coffee
<chillywilly> makes
<chillywilly> ;P
<nickr> and donuts
<jcater> does it make donuts?
<jcater> or consume them?

<chillywilly> well yea there's a whole donut factory interface example
<chillywilly> you wrote it
<chillywilly> remember?
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> oh, yeah
Action: jcater has a shortterm memory

<nickr> and rectangles
<derek> well ill be a prick and say gnue is at least 5 times as productive as #python ;)
<derek> though that ain't saying much ;)
<derek> my experience is that its like #debian
<derek> go in and ask a question and one of several options
<derek> a) you flat out get ignored
<derek> b) you are told thats so simple go rtfm
<derek> c) they have no clue what you are asking so they try to spew CS rhetoric on you instead
<derek> d) they ask why would you want to do that you should do X instead, never answering the question rather just putting it in their own frame of reference w/o ever understanding what you want :)
<nickr> i agree
<nickr> they also have a good time there for the most part
<nickr> although that is wholly unlike #debian

<crazymike> neverminfd
<nickr> and write some documentation
<nickr> there isn't so much as a readme in the tarball
<nickr> and no comments in the files
<nickr> no explicit license
<jcater> who knows
<jcater> by the time we're done
<jcater> we might end up "adopting" a lot of small python projects
<nickr> that wouldh be good
<nickr> you could start the GNUe Python Foundry

<jcater> where as collections are clearly a christian thing
crazymike (~crazymike@mke-65-31-133-230.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> I know there's the list, tuple, and dictionary but that's pretty primitive
<jcater> wtf be's you talking about?
<chillywilly> booo
<nickr> chillywilly: why the fuck do you need a collection class in python?
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> like nickr said
<jcater> nickr: it's quite understandable
<jcater> it can't be simple
<nickr> ah
<chillywilly> because it would make my life easier
<nickr> chillywilly: explain in 30 words or less how thats possible?
<chillywilly> when you do an OQL query you gte a Bag or Set of objects
<chillywilly> usually
<chillywilly> when you doa  select that is
<chillywilly> or an ordered list if you do an 'oderby'
<chillywilly> no biggie
<nickr> use an array
<nickr> sort an array
<nickr> use for looping to iterate over the array
<chillywilly> array is not the same as a list
<chillywilly> theoretically
<nickr> By array I mean list
<ajmitch> theoretically
<jcater> chillywilly: theoretically and python DON'T mix
<ajmitch> who cares about theory?
<chillywilly> most of them I can implement using a list as a memeber
<ajmitch> then do so :)
<chillywilly> there's given interfaces that the collections should support, but it's not that hard to just code them
<ajmitch> why complain about it then?
<chillywilly> I was just asking as I am not hip tot he python way of thinking
<chillywilly> I'm not complaining
Action: ajmitch hands chillywilly a copy of emacs 
<nickr> the python way of thinking is dynamic, growable lists and dictionaries
<chillywilly> sorry dude I already have my emacs running
<ajmitch> so do i
<chillywilly> dictionaries are immutable
<chillywilly> that sorta blows
<ajmitch> in what ways?
<chillywilly> as it makes other collections time be O(1)
<chillywilly> er, O(n)
<jcater> dictionaries are immutable?
<chillywilly> if I implement a set using a list I have to traverse the wole list
<chillywilly> aren't they?
<chillywilly> maybe I am smoking good crack
<ajmitch> what good are immutable dictionaries?
Action: ajmitch wants some of that crack
Action: chillywilly is away: hitting the crack pipe
[21:12] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<nickr> chillywilly: use a dictionary as a set
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 00:00:01)
<chillywilly> ok, I think I am stoned
<chillywilly> I just took someone's word for it without looking in my book
<chillywilly> nickr: the oonly difference is the methods that I will add like union(), subtract(), etc.
<ajmitch> chillywilly: www.diveintopython.org
<chillywilly> it will probably just be a wrapper
<nickr> yea
<chillywilly> with a dictionary instance
<chillywilly> jsut trying to decide how I want to do it and as always talking to the python gurus here
<ajmitch> you mean jcater?
<nickr> you coulddo something more efficient and just emulate the interface
<chillywilly> (not always sure if that's a good idea though as sometimes it can just cause argument ;) )
<ajmitch> chillywilly: arguments are fun ;)
<chillywilly> ummm, what do you mena exactly by theat nickr? Do a wrapper that has the methods?
<nickr> I like arguing
<nickr> chillywilly: no you imbecile.
<nickr> ahh
<nickr> that feels good
<nickr> hehe
<chillywilly> I figured I couls also support the python sequence built-in methods
<nickr> yep.
<chillywilly> liek __add__, __sub__
<nickr> yep
<chillywilly> shit like that
<chillywilly> to be 'complete'
<chillywilly> see I am not that much of an imbecile

<jcater> you can create a class that is indistiguishable from a dictionary
<crazymike> i see 28
<jcater> plus add other methods as you need
<chillywilly> okie
<chillywilly> that's probably going to be my plan

<nickr> no
<nickr> ogg is lossy

<chillywilly> he despises mp3
<ajmitch> crazymike: so?
<crazymike> then it can't be used
