<drochaid> I've got 2.2r4 on disk from a month or two ago ... and noticed 2.2r6 from the web site
<ajmitch> ok
<drochaid> am I right in thinking I don't need to get 2.2r6 to have a current install?
<ajmitch> very little difference, i'd say
<ajmitch> install 2.2r4 then do apt-get update; apt-get upgrade
<drochaid> that's the one someone mentioned a couple of days ago .. ta :)
<ajmitch> but of course i'd upgrade to unstable asap :)
<drochaid> bleh
<ajmitch> potato is so old
<drochaid> this is my spare test server [finally, I have a *spare*!!!! :D ]
<ajmitch> it's grown mouldy ;)
<ajmitch> hehe, ok
<drochaid> lol
<ajmitch> go for testing then :)
<ajmitch> this is my main workstation (yes i do work :P), and it runs unstable
<drochaid> now I've just got a 92 page PDF to print out and read for install ;)
<drochaid> I take it unstable isn't that instable?
<drochaid> more of a *current* not BAU than unstable?
<ajmitch> about as unstable as a mandrake release with all the patches installed... actually not even that bad
<drochaid> LOL
<ajmitch> it's hard to get that bad :)
<drochaid> I'm getting fed up with MDK
<ajmitch> hehe, you're soon to be an ex-mdk user as well?
<drochaid> not from the packages tey use, just how difficult they make manual config if you don't like their tools
<ajmitch> i used to use it until early last year
<drochaid> I'm already an ex-MDK user
<ajmitch> now it's debian on all my computers
<drochaid> I use slack 8 at the mo
<ajmitch> yeah, i understand what you mean, i jumped ship before they made it even harder :)
<drochaid> mdk 8.2 was the final straw ...
<drochaid> I tried the network wizards for ftp, smb etc in the new control panel
<drochaid> god knows what it did to my system, but it turned a manually config'ed working machine to a usless lump of shite
<ajmitch> debian seems to have the right balance between tacky-simpleton config & sadomasochistic configurability :)
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> my needs are really basic
<ajmitch> ie, with quite a few packages, debconf is all you need, but you can certainly do it manually, and debconf shoudl respect that
<drochaid> postgresql, openLDAP, DNS, web, ftp, ssh, openssl and a few others
<ajmitch> ok, i run all those but openLDAP & openssl (well, ssh uses openssl)
<drochaid> that would be good, I refuse to use pgsql unless I've built it myself [again MDKs pgsql implementation is a joke]
<ajmitch> heh, ok
<ajmitch> apt-get build-dep postgresql; apt-get source postgresql; apt-get build postgresql :)
<drochaid> :o
<drochaid> that will be shining bright :P
<ajmitch> oh, you probably want to tweak the config before you build it :)
<ajmitch> since you want a custom build
<drochaid> ./configure --enable-locale --with-pgport=<not telling> --with-CXX --with-perl --with-python --with-tcl --enable-odbc --with-java --with-krb5 --with-openssl
<ajmitch> right
<ajmitch> edit debian/rules, & you're away :)
<drochaid> cool :)
<ajmitch> makes it easier to satisfy deps
<drochaid> I take it 7.2.1 is available for deb using apt-get?
<ajmitch> yeah
<drochaid> cool
<ajmitch> for unstable, tho, you could have some few issues satisfying build-deps for potato
<drochaid> cause i don't want the sequences to run backwards after a crash ;)
<ajmitch> usually not much of a problem
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> use postgres quite a bit?
Action: ajmitch should put this now spare hard drive in the other computer
<drochaid> I don't use it nearly as much as I want to
Action: ajmitch got a 40gb drive, now can retire the drive which is dying :)
<drochaid> :-(
<drochaid> poor dead drive
<ajmitch> not dead yet
<drochaid> one of my test servers was my primary workstation .. until the primary ide chanel started to die
<ajmitch> just buzzing & coming up with uncorrectable errors in kernel log :)
<drochaid> I'm just hoping it lasts longer with linux than it would with win2k
<ajmitch> still good for a few more months/years :)
<drochaid> hopefully :)
<ajmitch> trust me, it'll last ;)
<drochaid> or at least, I'd be happier using a pci ide card with linux if the chanel does die
<ajmitch> i'm just gonna chuck scratch partitions & some GNU/Hurd partitions on it
<drochaid> doesn't look good for a backup & disaster recovery consultant to have to tell a client he can't access his docs because his machine died ;)
<ajmitch> hehe
Action: ajmitch wonders why hard drive does not detect...
<drochaid> what's the main differences betweem stable and unstable?
<drochaid> wrong bios LBA set?
<drochaid> not plugged in? ;)
<ajmitch> nah, bios isn't detecting it
<ajmitch> certainly is plugged in
<ajmitch> bugger
<ajmitch> i shoudl check ide cable, brb
<drochaid> k
<ajmitch> it's a western digital, need to pull 'master' jumper off to set to single drive
<ajmitch> stupid WD drives...
<drochaid> caviar?
<ajmitch> can't remember, it's an 8gb
<ajmitch> ah, fsck it, hdc=ide-scsi was still set as well
<ajmitch> another reboot...
<drochaid> lol
<ajmitch> good thing i'm using grub, supports cmdline editing
Action: drochaid isn't a grub fan
Action: ajmitch likes it, hasn't had problems with it
<drochaid> but really only because I'm too used to lilo
<ajmitch> i use the Hurd so need grub to boot it
<ajmitch> excellent, drive works now :)
<drochaid> I haven't had any problems either, I just haven't put the work into learning how to manually configure it ... very ashamed to admit to using MDKs gui editor for it :(
<ajmitch> sad... :)

<ajmitch> i haven't had any for quite awhile

<ajmitch> yo psu
<psu> hi
<chillywilly> sup dawg
<psu> not much
<ajmitch> been having fun with irc summaries?
<psu> finished off Friday's earlier today ;-)
<psu> first job is to strip out the off-topic stuff, and sort what's left into "threads"
<psu> usually takes 1/2 hour
<psu> then actually writing the summaries
<psu> can be anything from 0 to 2 hours a day
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> you do a very good job, psu
<jbailey> psu: Stripping out the off-topic?  Is there anything left?
<psu> jbailey - some days, no. 
Action: chillywilly thwaps jbailey with a 5lb trout
<psu> Actually, there's usually 3-4 mini-threads a day on average
<psu> but no such thing as an average day ;-)
<ajmitch> jbailey: i think so
<ajmitch> iirc chillywilly & i discussed GEAS for awhile the other day
<chillywilly> cause we're super freaks
<psu> GNUe KC #23 is up, anyway
<psu> http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/latest.html
<chillywilly> woooo
<chillywilly> is that brand new?
<chillywilly> looks to be
Action: ajmitch goes to read
<psu> cw is mentioned in 8 of the 20 sections ;-)
<psu> indexing of names is still not working 
<psu> I think it's a temporary casulty of the move from using perl to XSLT to parse the source code
<ajmitch> 8/20? not bad, chillywilly ;)
<psu> plus a certain ajmitch returns 
<psu> section 11
<ajmitch> "he discussion as to whether this was a good idea or not degenerated rapidly." ie, went offtopic very quickly ;)
<psu> s/11/12
<psu> I've always been a master of the careful euphemism ;-)
<psu> only once so far had to use "A full and frank discussion then ensued."

<psu> ajmitch: you might think that, Icouldn;t possibly comment
<drochaid> deb question ... I'm configuring the apt-get sources during install ... all 3cds are scanned and I want to add a downloadable one as well
<drochaid> I take it ftp is preferable to http?
<ajmitch> http is preferable, i'd say
<drochaid> really?
<ajmitch> eg:
<ajmitch> deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib
<ajmitch> deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US unstable/non-US main contrib 
<ajmitch> i dunno ;)
<psu> I was always told that ftp was better (=marginally more efficient)
<psu> at getting files than http
<psu> BUT 
<psu> this was wrt general downloading 
<psu> not deb specific
<psu> so may or may not be true in this case
<psu> Helpful, ain't I?
alexey (alexey@195.151.214.34) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<psu> FWIW, I think the other PC which I installed debian over modem on 
<psu> is set up to use FTP
<psu> (It has no CD, so I had no choice but to do it online
<drochaid> k
<psu> with some help from a very patient chillywilly)
<drochaid> I went with ftp anyways
Action: ajmitch waits for debian tarball to download so he can install
<ajmitch> psu: i'm about to do an install online, over a 33.6k modem ;)
<psu> I think I had a 56k, but it was still painful
<chillywilly> I use http
<drochaid> also to confirm ... once the base system for deb is on ... I assume it's safe to just install apps I actually want?
<drochaid> unlike MDK et all where that would completely screw the system ..
<ajmitch> well the full packages compiled for the libio-based GNU/Hurd system is minimal anyway
<chillywilly> but I use apt-proxy now so all my paclages are caches in one place
<chillywilly> er, packages
<chillywilly> cached
<ajmitch> don't knock mdk, mdk rocks ;) (cough)
<psu> drochaid: yes, but beware dependancies
<psu> apt-get is your friend
<psu> It took me several days before I realised I had X and GNOME but no window manager, for instance
<chillywilly> aptitude is nice
<drochaid> lol psu
<drochaid> I'm screwed then, ain't I ;)
<chillywilly> drochaid: why does that 'screw the system'
<chillywilly> psu: 56K is always painful
<ajmitch> chillywilly: it's mandrake, mandrake is crap ;)

Action: ra3vat is using mdk-like distro with apt-get integrated
Action: chillywilly hugs debian
<drochaid> which window manager did gnome use when 2.2r4 was released ... enlightenment or sawmill ... and should I just use enlightnment anyway?
<chillywilly> I love you
<drochaid> ty chillywilly
<chillywilly> you should upgrade to testing
<chillywilly> imho
<drochaid> very kind of you o say so
<ajmitch> chillywilly: that's what i said - i suggested sid of course :)
<chillywilly> well I do love you all too, but not as much as my debian sorry
Action: ajmitch is feeling a little tired
<chillywilly> you should upgrade now while you have the base installed
<chillywilly> less shit to download
<drochaid> who should? me?
<chillywilly> yes, you
<chillywilly> :)
<drochaid> ah me
<drochaid> this is just a primary test build
<drochaid> it's not going to last more than a couple of days
<chillywilly> ?
<drochaid> at the moment I just want to get used to deb to see what I think
<chillywilly> you should convert all your boxen to the One True Debian Way (tm)
<chillywilly> :P
<drochaid> which means re-installing in different ways a number of times
<chillywilly> nah
<chillywilly> friggin ghost the rest
<drochaid> just now I'm using the install docs to guide me [sparse tho the info is at times]
<chillywilly> drochaid: #debian-support is the best damn debian support channel
<chillywilly> ;)
<drochaid> once I've got a rough idea what I'm doing I'll get you to tell me the best way ;)
<chillywilly> right ajmitch ;)
<ajmitch> chillywilly: you mean cp or dd? ghost is proprietary :)
<psu> dneighbo always swears by #debian
<chillywilly> ajmitch: rsync
<psu> sorry, that should be swears *at* #debian...
<chillywilly> psu: I'm sure her does swear at it
<chillywilly> rofl
<psu> anyway
<psu> bbl
<chillywilly> buh-bye psu
<ajmitch> chillywilly: i use cp -avx for straight copies (done it a few times tonight)
psu (peter@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> bye
<chillywilly> via nfs?
<chillywilly> b2b == booty 2 booty not business 2 business....lol
<ajmitch> no, via ide :) just plug in 2 hard drives at once, copy in single-user mode (since i was copying /)
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> that'll do it
<chillywilly> hey does python call the parent constructpr implecity or do you have to do parentClass.__init__(some stuff)?
<chillywilly> er, implicitly
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<psu> back
<chillywilly> wb psu
<ajmitch> yep, in wxPython you'd do wxGrid.__init__(self, ...)
<ajmitch> (have to pass self as first argument)
<ajmitch> hey psu
<psu> kc #23 announcement posted to gnue-announce & web front page
<psu> both awaiting approval ;-)
<ajmitch> excellent
<chillywilly> ajmitch: so you are telling me it is 'explicit' right?
Action: ajmitch looks around for some electroshock therapy
<ajmitch> chillywilly: yep
<ajmitch> chillywilly: parent ctor is not called unless you do it
<chillywilly> a'ight
<ajmitch> :)
<ajmitch> we should talk more about GEAS to give psu something to do ;)
<ajmitch> should the different parts of GEAS be all running as separate threads in one python instance, or would you rather them be in separate instances, communicating via gnue-common libs?
<ajmitch> i vote for separation, for robustness :)
<ajmitch> this has probably already been discussed to death, but hey, i'm bored
<psu> I would guess that GEAS should be as separated as possible
<psu> as you might want to have it on multiple servers
<ajmitch> psu: yeah, that would make sense
<psu> and as well as having mutliple instances of different parts of GEAS on diff servers
<ajmitch> would make it more scalable, & robust, imho
<psu> you might also want to put diff parts of GEAS on diff servers
<psu> Bear in mind that all I know about CORBA is a powerpoint slide a salesman once showed me
<ajmitch> yep
<psu> and even less about other RPCs
<drochaid> ok ... someone tell me that 2.2 does NOT use 6.5.3 of pgsql?
<psu> "all I knew about RPC I learned in #gnuenterprise" - bumper sticker
<ajmitch> webware has an appserver, i think we shoudl look at that for how they do object caching, etc
<ajmitch> ok ;)
<ajmitch> drochaid: umm, i think it might ;)
<drochaid> ajmitch: just how old is 2.2??
<drochaid> that's like .. over 2 years ago or summat
<ajmitch> umm, 2.2 is ancient, i'm telling you ;)
<drochaid> release date, 13th of October 1999
<drochaid> 7.0 was released 8th of May 2000
<drochaid> now I know why my friends though debian was dead
<drochaid> waaaaay overdue for a new stab;e
<ajmitch> ;)
<psu> on geas scalability, I am really speaking from a business mgr/app consultant POV
<drochaid> the unstable version .. is that what deb call the testing version on their website?
<psu> so the technical details are of minimal interest to me 
<psu> but 
<psu> scalability is important
<psu> as free s/w tends to need scalability
<psu> look at Linux - from embedded PDA to IBM mainframe
<ajmitch> i talk mainly from a technical perspective with an eye on business needs :)
<psu> or beowulf cluster
<psu> GNUe has the potential to a similar wide range
<ajmitch> yeah, which is really appealing to businesses :)
<psu> i.e. no matter what we say, some people will use it as a Quicken/SAGE/M$Money clone
<psu> on a single PC
<psu> naming no jcaters by name
<psu> but 
<psu> at the other end
<psu> you can replicate your GEAS servers as much as you like 
<psu> i.e. multiple servers doing same tasks
<psu> diff servers doing diff tasks
<psu> the only obvious limit to scalability is that you need a "GEAS Server Server" 
<ajmitch> hehe
<psu> to tell the other GEAS servers where all the other servers are & their status
<ajmitch> a node controller?
<psu> sorta a GEAS DNS 
<psu> yep
<psu> and, at  a pinch, even that could be replicated or have some kind of masta/slave relationship
<ajmitch> yep, automagical failover, so that transactions aren't lost?
<ajmitch> all that was planned awhile back, but was never done (wasn't needed)
<ajmitch> i guess with GNUe, things are implemented as needed :)
<psu> yes & no - quick and dirty fixes that get us going are better than plans that go nowhere
<psu> but we want to keep the big picture
<chillywilly> hmmm
<psu> I guess that, in retrospect, GEAS v1 is almost a "proof of concepot"
Action: chillywilly read back buffer
<chillywilly> reads
<ajmitch> yep, that's why there's a redesign
<chillywilly> I'm not sure it proved much
<chillywilly> ;)
<ajmitch> iirc andrewm didn't like that he had no time to design a decent GEAS
<psu> chillywilly: ok then a "proof of failure"
<chillywilly> lol
<chillywilly> I wouldn't go that far
<chillywilly> it's not hat bad
<psu> s/failure/useful 
<chillywilly> proof that we can hack some shit up
<psu> just needs some GNUe luvvin'
<psu> I believe you said once
<psu> may even be quoted in KC ;-)
Action: psu is away: designing GEAS schemas in the bath...
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> althought I can't take credit for the current GEAS design
<chillywilly> I only contributed some code to andrewm's diabolical plan
<chillywilly> now I can make one of my own ;)
<drochaid> ok doodles ... I've got into a failing loop with deb trying to create an XF86Config
<drochaid> htf do I leave without aborting the install?
<drochaid> scrap that, I aborted and it asked if I wanted to retry
<chillywilly> dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
<chillywilly> if X 4.1.c
<chillywilly> er
<chillywilly> if X 4.1.x
<drochaid> and why does it get me to enter all the info near the start and then try to override it with this bit?
<drochaid> pointless redundancy

<chillywilly> I fell sorry for you ajmitch
<ajmitch> i'll get some highly caffienated drink for between lectures
<ajmitch> i'm a student, i'm allowed to ;)
<chillywilly> you will feel like shit at about 10 or 11am
<ajmitch> which is right when my lectures start ;)
<ajmitch> excellent
<ajmitch> i've done all-nighters & begun to feel tired about 8pm or so the next day
<chillywilly> well you usually get another adrenaline rush
<chillywilly> and make it into pm
<chillywilly> then you really feel like crap
<ajmitch> yep ;)
<drochaid> I've never gone more than 46 hours without sleep before
<drochaid> that's about my limit before I get no choice
<ajmitch> shall i try for 7am sunday -> 9pm tuesday?
<drochaid> oh yes
<ajmitch> shoudl be fairly easy ;)
<ajmitch> don't think i could concentrate thru my 4 hour electronics lab on tuesday tho
<drochaid> is that really a prob?
<drochaid> you the student or lecturer?
<ajmitch> yeah, i have to catch up on CS lab before wednesday morning
<ajmitch> i'm the student
<ajmitch> :)
<drochaid> would be worse if you were the lecturer ;)
<drochaid> ok, I've now got a deb 2.2r4 build that doesn't have x config'ed properly, and has an old pgsql I don't want ...
<drochaid> what now? :)
<ajmitch> upgarde to testing! :)
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> so howd I do that then?
<drochaid> and wtf is woody due? :)
<ajmitch> edit /etc/apt/sources.list, change 'stable' to 'woody'
<ajmitch> tentatively for May 1 ;)
<drochaid> oooh
<ajmitch> 2002
<drochaid> so not too long then, even if it goes some way past that
<drochaid> lol @ 2002
<drochaid> ok ..
<drochaid> I'm thinking about doing a reinstall of the base system
<drochaid> I think chillywilly said that was the best place to go to woody?

<drochaid> cool
<drochaid> so I get to base stage, choose not to install any more apps ... then come back here at that point?
<ajmitch> could do,i guess ;)

<drochaid> nickr: what??
<ajmitch> drochaid: tasksel lets you choose 'tasks' which are groups of packages for certain tasks, like web server, X, etc
<drochaid> ahh
<ajmitch> you need to upgrade the base to testing first, then apt-get the tasksel package, iirc
<drochaid> mmm ... but first I need to install win95 on the machine >:)
<drochaid> I need to find out what graphics card I'm using
<drochaid> I picked one from my spare parts bin yesterday

<drochaid> I know it's a matrox ... not sure which one tho
<nickr> lspic

<thooby> Hi,
<ajmitch> hello
<thooby> Can I ask for some help?
<ajmitch> umm, i dunno if i can help you, but you can ask :)
<thooby> well I am just installed  gnuenterprise and I am a bit confused
<thooby> How I can start suppy-chain packages
<psu> thooby: SCM is still a proposal
<psu> as we are  a free s/w project, you get to see our stuff much earlier
<psu> in the development cycle than you would with proprietary software
<psu> GNUe is sorta two projects in one:
<thooby> The modules seems to work but I have no any idea how install the package
<psu> a) a set of tools to run enterprise apps (forms, reports, etc)
<psu> b) the apps themselves
<psu> we have concentrated so far on a)
<psu> so we have an excellent forms client, graphical designer, 
<psu> and the start of a reports and application server module
<psu> but nothing other than some proposals on b)
<thooby> Yes I know yes but suppy-chain is the first
<thooby> sorry
Action: psu thinks we need a much more prominent "Status" page on the website
<psu> There's quite a bit of documentation on what we want SCM to be
<psu> in CVS
<thooby> Well I understand. I thought it was a little prototype
<psu> looking in CVS, there are some GCD (GNUe Class Definitions)
<psu> which may be the start of what you mean
<thooby> Well, I have more questions I've compiled everything but I have some
<thooby> problems in order to connect with postgres
<psu> I assume you have set up your connections.conf with details of the postgres d/b you want to 
<psu> point at?
<psu> i.e. user name, p/w etc
Action: psu is really just a lurker, but is repeating things he's heard others say
<thooby> In conections.conf I have put provider= postgresql host =localhost and dbname = gnue
<thooby> and i have create a gnue database
<psu> ok - I believe this should then ask you for u/name & p/w when you log in
<psu> If you have the GNUe Designer, that is a good place to start
<psu> try one of the wizards.
<psu> Are there any tables or data in the gnue database?
<psu> If so, the simple d/b wizard should find it & ask you which table to 
<psu> do a simple form off

<drochaid> any peeps around willing to help me get up to deb unstable?
<drochaid> I've just re-installed the base and zero apps
<drochaid> with the excpetion of the updates for base apps via ftp
Action: drochaid prods
<drochaid> hmm
<drochaid> try again
Action: drochaid prods chillywilly
<nickr> gross
Action: drochaid holds coffee under ajmitchs nose
<nickr> drochaid: edit /etc/apt/sources, change lines from stable to unstable (except for the security line)
<nickr> apt-get update
<drochaid> ta nickr
<nickr> hrm, are you going from stable or woody?
<drochaid> stable
<nickr> shit
<drochaid> shit?
<nickr> it might be easier to reinstall from woody
<drochaid> easier or just faster?
<drochaid> I've put on 2.2 r4
<nickr> easier AND faster
<drochaid> I'll try this first, since it's on now
<nickr> do you have a CD burner and broadband? theres a 30 meg thing you download and its really easy
<nickr> alrgihtn I'll find the release notes
<nickr> theres an ordering you have to do
<drochaid> uh ...
<drochaid> I do have broadband and a cdrw
<nickr> hrm, just try an apt-get dist-upgrade and see what happens :)
<drochaid> okies .. I've just done the apt-get update ... so I'll try that now
<drochaid> 95 upgrades and 19 new installs happening now
<nickr> okey
<nickr> anything kept back?
<drochaid> what would it say to let me know?
<nickr> at the top it says 'The following packages have been kept back:'
<drochaid> I didn't notice any
<drochaid> and now the top is off the screen
<nickr> you could shift-pageup
<nickr> but okay
<nickr> no worries-
<drochaid> except that the second I hit ahift and page up .... it drops straight to the bottom again ;P
<nickr> you can hit control-s
<nickr> then shift pageup
<nickr> then read
<nickr> then control-q
<drochaid> what does control-s do ?
<nickr> xoff
<nickr> STOP
<drochaid> ah, ta
<drochaid> uh
<drochaid> no it don't
<drochaid> that's just scroll lock
<drochaid> and with that switched on, I *can't* shift-pageup

<dneighbo> hi anyone know where to get mame roms

<dneighbo> um its really slow (iirc)
<drochaid> nickr: ok, I just fudged it by hijacking another term ....
<dneighbo> http://mamefans.metropoliglobal.com/
<dneighbo> that the link you gave me?
<drochaid> there is nowhere mentioning things kept back
<nickr> maybe.
<drochaid> nickr: ok .. dist-upgrade happened, with lots of questions I guess at
<drochaid> anything else?
<nickr> thats it
<nickr> now install whatever you want
<drochaid> cool
<drochaid> right
<drochaid> how do I find out what apps are available?
<drochaid> I assume it's just 'apt-get install <appname>' ?
<nickr> yea
<nickr> you can search with apt-cache search
<drochaid> ta
<nickr> or you could use a proper front end
<nickr> or you could use tasksel and get a lot of garbage you do'nt need ;)
<drochaid> what would a decent front end for apt-get be?
<nickr> well, the up and comming one is aptitude
<nickr> its reasonably easy to use
<drochaid> cool
<drochaid> x based?
<nickr> no
<drochaid> excellent, cause I don't have X yet :)
<nickr> well there is an X version maybe
<nickr> the text one is better though
<nickr> For X theres something called Synaptik that I rather like

<drochaid> nickr: I can see why you like aptitude ... I'm playing with it just now, and gradually getting used to it
<nickr> it is pretty good yes
<nickr> the nice thing about it when mass adding packages is that you can just go through the list and pick out the things you need
<nickr> the same reason its also useful when culling your installation
<nickr> also it brings along suggests: and recommmends: with packages
<nickr> which apt doesn't do
<drochaid> yep :)
<drochaid> I am finding it stalls quite a bit tho, which I'm guessing is the ftp server ....
<nickr> yea
<nickr> perhaps
<drochaid> at the mo I'm just quiting the download, ok'ing the error then hitting 'g' again
<drochaid> is there a better way?
<nickr> that works
<drochaid> cool
<nickr> I'm not sure what causes the stalling

<nickr> make a netinst cd for woody

<derek> well ill be a prick and say gnue is at least 5 times as productive as #python ;)
<derek> though that ain't saying much ;)
<derek> my experience is that its like #debian
<derek> go in and ask a question and one of several options
<derek> a) you flat out get ignored
<derek> b) you are told thats so simple go rtfm
<derek> c) they have no clue what you are asking so they try to spew CS rhetoric on you instead
<derek> d) they ask why would you want to do that you should do X instead, never answering the question rather just putting it in their own frame of reference w/o ever understanding what you want :)
<nickr> i agree
<nickr> they also have a good time there for the most part
<nickr> although that is wholly unlike #debian

<chillywilly> I know there's the list, tuple, and dictionary but that's pretty primitive
<jcater> wtf be's you talking about?
<chillywilly> booo
<nickr> chillywilly: why the fuck do you need a collection class in python?
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> like nickr said
<jcater> nickr: it's quite understandable
<jcater> it can't be simple
<nickr> ah
<chillywilly> because it would make my life easier
<nickr> chillywilly: explain in 30 words or less how thats possible?
<chillywilly> when you do an OQL query you gte a Bag or Set of objects
<chillywilly> usually
<chillywilly> when you doa  select that is
<chillywilly> or an ordered list if you do an 'oderby'
<chillywilly> no biggie
<nickr> use an array
<nickr> sort an array
<nickr> use for looping to iterate over the array
<chillywilly> array is not the same as a list
<chillywilly> theoretically
<nickr> By array I mean list
<ajmitch> theoretically
<jcater> chillywilly: theoretically and python DON'T mix
<ajmitch> who cares about theory?
<chillywilly> most of them I can implement using a list as a memeber
<ajmitch> then do so :)
<chillywilly> there's given interfaces that the collections should support, but it's not that hard to just code them
<ajmitch> why complain about it then?
<chillywilly> I was just asking as I am not hip tot he python way of thinking
<chillywilly> I'm not complaining
Action: ajmitch hands chillywilly a copy of emacs 
<nickr> the python way of thinking is dynamic, growable lists and dictionaries
<chillywilly> sorry dude I already have my emacs running
<ajmitch> so do i
<chillywilly> dictionaries are immutable
<chillywilly> that sorta blows
<ajmitch> in what ways?
<chillywilly> as it makes other collections time be O(1)
<chillywilly> er, O(n)
<jcater> dictionaries are immutable?
<chillywilly> if I implement a set using a list I have to traverse the wole list
<chillywilly> aren't they?
<chillywilly> maybe I am smoking good crack
<ajmitch> what good are immutable dictionaries?

<chillywilly> ok, I think I am stoned

<ajmitch> chillywilly: www.diveintopython.org
<chillywilly> it will probably just be a wrapper
<nickr> yea
<chillywilly> with a dictionary instance
<chillywilly> jsut trying to decide how I want to do it and as always talking to the python gurus here
<ajmitch> you mean jcater?
<nickr> you coulddo something more efficient and just emulate the interface

<ajmitch> chillywilly: arguments are fun ;)
<chillywilly> ummm, what do you mena exactly by theat nickr? Do a wrapper that has the methods?
<nickr> I like arguing

<psu> & I thought "no, can't be right"
<drochaid> lol
<psu> I tended to use the quiet bits of the M6 normally
<dneighbo> i think watching mold grow might be more entertaining than running a month lclose and auditing it
<psu> the bits that go up towards the jocks
Action: dneighbo should make the bloody accountants do the auditing ;)
<drochaid> I tended to use the M6 in all it's entirity

<drochaid> long drive from Winchester to Glasgow :(
<psu> dneighbo: it;s like racoons, if you encourage them, it's your own fault
<drochaid> dneighbo: you can't trust an accountant to audit man!!
<dneighbo> psu what has happened it i would have them audit them
<psu> I did Winchester to Sunderland, which was bad enuf
<dneighbo> and like 8 months later i would get an exception to handle
<dneighbo> and it would be an utter bitch to fix
<dneighbo> or find supporting detail as to why it was CORRECT
<dneighbo> so now i do my own audits before i give them to the accounts
<psu> went M3-A34-M40-M42-M1-A1(M)-A19 just for the heck of it
<dneighbo> and document the ones they will flag, with little notes as to why i am right :)
<dneighbo> it has helped oddly enough

<nickr> good point
<dneighbo> mexico and canada prevent that
<dneighbo> an interesting question is
<dneighbo> australia is a continent that is an island
<dneighbo> as well as a country that is an island
<drochaid> dneighbo: but by the same rule ... no country in the UK is an Island either
<dneighbo> is there any island that is a city

<dneighbo> drochaid i agree, i never called it an island

<drochaid> Junction 6 on the M6 is one of the worst places for speed cameras!!!!
<drochaid> I've NEVER managed to do more than 50mph there

<drochaid> normally 5mph is considered really really good
<psu> stick to the speed limit ;-)
<drochaid> don't speed?
<drochaid> most of the time, so do I
<drochaid> I've never gone more than 120mph .. ish .. anyway
Action: dneighbo is amused you speak in mph?
<dneighbo> instead of kph
<dneighbo> er kmph
<psu> any police officers monitoring this channel, please remember that irc logs are not valid in a court of law
<dneighbo> rofl
<drochaid> lol
Action: dneighbo is curious what is mph?
<psu> In the Uk, all road distances are miles
<psu> miles per hour
<psu> etc
<dneighbo> wow
<dneighbo> why then on US cars do we get guages that read in mph and km ph?
<drochaid> so that's about .. 190kmph ish?
<psu> most other weights & measures are metric however
<psu> As much as anything, I think the cost of changing every single road sign in the country
<psu> means things are unlikely to change
<drochaid> and the kmph doesn't fit exactly to the existing speeds
<drochaid> can you imagine the fights if the max speed ended up being 2 kmph lower than they are as mph? ;)
<nickr> they use Kmph in Canada I think
<dneighbo> nickr probably in europe too
<dneighbo> outside UK(ireland, scotland)
<nickr> yea
Action: dneighbo desperately wishes we used the metric system here
<dneighbo> purely for mathematical ease
<dneighbo> and 24 hour time
<nickr> the nice thing is you can use 24 hour time
<nickr> the metric system is harder to interoperate though
<dneighbo> yip
<dneighbo> part of me wonders why we made timezones and such
<dneighbo> and instead dont just all run UTC time ;)
<psu> dneighbo: as a US politics geek
<psu> I always wondered why the people who basjhed on 
<dneighbo> though i suppose i see the value there much more so than the american weight and major system
<psu> about the "intent of the Founding Fathers"
<psu> never took this to logical conclusion
<psu> Constitution says pres & congress elections must be same day throught union
<psu> obviously to avoid people knowing other states' results before they vote 
<psu> in today's world 
<psu> to meet the FF's intentions
<psu> you would have to say same day & times 
<dneighbo> i agree 1000 percent
<dneighbo> as with internet and information stores
<psu> a bit unfair on the hawaiians,  I know
<dneighbo> news can travel so readily
<dneighbo> however as our last presidental election proved
<dneighbo> despite technology
<psu> but stops the "CA doesn't matter" syndrome
<dneighbo> our inept governtment takes up to 30 days to actually COUNT the votes
<dneighbo> personally
<dneighbo> the more i see of things and mroe i study history
<dneighbo> the founding fathers woudl abhor the US today
<dneighbo> i never think they intended for the federal govt to be so large
<dneighbo> and have such control
<dneighbo> iirc they were very pro independent state rule for most things
<nickr> yea
<psu> the problem is that states can be tyrannical as well
<dneighbo> in many ways i would like to return to that
<psu> & the federal constitution doesn't provide mechanisms for that
<dneighbo> as i think that the federal govt is turning largely into a joke
<nickr> its easier for the other stats to pressure a state into being less tyrannical than for anyone to pressure the fed into that
<psu> except, arguably, the 2nd amt
<psu> but shooting the governor is a fairly extreme solution
<dneighbo> i.e. it burns through cash like a dot com w/ an blank check
<dneighbo> and the states see little in return (imho)
<dneighbo> i.e. im always curious as to what i get for my 'tax' dollars
<psu> i am in a different situation
<psu> as working for a city council
<dneighbo> psu: i work for local govt as well
<psu> 80% of our income comes from central govt
<psu> the rest from a local property tax
<dneighbo> we get state funding
<dneighbo> but not really federal funding
<psu> we used to have a business property tax
<psu> but that was "nationalised"
<dneighbo> but my point is the feds seem wasteful
<psu> we have a bit more freedom now
<dneighbo> and bills are bull crap
<dneighbo> example
<nickr> the fed is wasteful
<dneighbo> here they do things by tying unrelated crap together
<nickr> no doubt about it
<dneighbo> for example i think there is a bill
<nickr> its too big and complex to be efficient
<dneighbo> actually i know there is a bill
<dneighbo> that sets a SMOG level number
<dneighbo> if a county goes over that level more than X times in a year
<dneighbo> they no longer get Federal Road Tax money
<dneighbo> to me those are UNRELATED issues
<dneighbo> i.e. they are indirectly related
<dneighbo> so the feds pay people to MONITOR this with the road money
<dneighbo> so my road money is being paid for environmental monitoring
<dneighbo> and further more
<dneighbo> the counties in fear of losing say 1 billion in road money 
<dneighbo> will spend 30 million on air quality items
<nickr> they use road money in the worst way
<nickr> like when states started wanting to get rid of the 55 limit
<nickr> the fed used road money to try to force them into keeping it
<dneighbo> and usually that 30 million comes from the road money
<nickr> like wtf?
<drochaid> what's the speed limit on the fastest roads US side?
<psu> didn't Idaho have a spped limit of "safe and sensible" in daylight hours for a while?
<psu> 65, iirc
<drochaid> mph or kmph?
<psu> 55 in urban areas
<psu> mph
<psu> that's why radar detectors are so popular ;-)
<drochaid> heh
<nickr> 75
<nickr> depends on the state
<nickr> actually the fastest roads iirc are in Montana, where I think they have conditional limits, eg you can go as fast as is safe
<psu> i knew it was somewhere up near the top
<psu> s/Idaho/Montana
<nickr> I believe in OR they post 65 but enforce condition based limits
<nickr> same with here in NY, they post 55, but you get pulled over for obstructing traffic at that speed
<nickr> probably the same everywhere
<dneighbo> again you bring the value man :)
<dneighbo> depends on state
<dneighbo> most INTERSTATES are 75 outside city limites
<dneighbo> in side city limits 65
<dneighbo> HOWEVER back to the value
<dneighbo> and my feds are evil rap
<dneighbo> the reason the speed limit is 75
<dneighbo> and some 65
<dneighbo> is federal funding
<dneighbo> TECHNICALLY a state can set their own limits
<dneighbo> montana for example has done this
<dneighbo> HOWEVER
<dneighbo> if you go over 75 you lose all federal funding from some grant
<dneighbo> montana's share of that grant was so small they didnt care
<dneighbo> but if you drop to 65 you get an additional bonus
<nickr> they're like 'fuck it, its cheaper for you to go as fast as you want'
<nickr> :)
<dneighbo> this kind of 'gaming' by the fed is what irrates me
<dneighbo> roadbuilding and highway safety to me are DIFFERENT things
<dneighbo> btw: this is sensitive to me asain AZ public transporation and roads SUCK
<nickr> they are great in OR
<dneighbo> my biggest gripe is that government is like a monolopy
<nickr> its the high property tax all of which seems to go to ODOT
<dneighbo> you are pretty much stuck with what you have
<dneighbo> and more things that are FEDERALLY controlled the more thats true
<dneighbo> if almost everythign was at local level
<dneighbo> i could VOICE myself by moving
<nickr> `yea
<nickr> truedat
<dneighbo> i.e. if OR roads were better than AZ roads etc
<dneighbo> its MUCH more feasible for me to move from AZ to OR than it is to denounce citizenship and leave the USA
<nickr> Truie
<nickr> very true
<nickr> if we had real distributed republics we'd be all set. :)
<dneighbo> to me feds are like microsoft because they control the OS and the Applications :)
<dneighbo> so they can make dumb rules like cited above for road building (application develoeprs)
<dneighbo> that lock the local govts into their 'way'
dsmith (dsmith@cherry7.comerica.com) left irc: Remote closed the connection
<dneighbo> anyhow tirade off :)
<nickr> cause there is no other way to 'control' the states
<dneighbo> btw: as much as i am anti slavery and such
<dneighbo> i think much of the civil war was that the southern states felt they were being mandated things 
<dneighbo> and they did not want to relenquish state power
<nickr> Indeed
<dneighbo> i think the lesser states (the north) were sick of the successs of southern states and turned it into a slavery war (by name) but not by prinicple :)
<dneighbo> i.e. the north surely didnt employ the newly freed slaves
<nickr> True
<nickr> but it makes us feel good about america to say that it was to free the slaves and let the fed completely take over the US
<nickr> oh wait
<nickr> scratch that last part
<jcater> the biggest change following WWII was not slavery, but the move from mostly state-centric to federal-centric gov't
<jcater> hence the change in terminology
<drochaid> dneighbo: so how will GNUe take into account this changing speedlimit accross the US and more globally the world?
<jcater> err, WWII == civil war :)
<jcater> before civil war, we were "These United States"
<jcater> following civil war, we were "The United States"
<drochaid> ok, so it was a very poor atttempt at linking back with the chan subject :)

<dneighbo> actually AZ became a state in 1912
<dneighbo> President William Howard Taft initially refused to sign the bill that accepted the Arizona Constitution, until the citizens of the territory removed a clause permitting recall of judges
<dneighbo> which of course only took 30 years :)
<dneighbo> finally wised up and found out
<dneighbo> get statehood 
<dneighbo> then immediately ratify your state constitution and put the clause back in :)
<dneighbo> which they did
<dneighbo> One of the first acts of the 1st Arizona State Legislature, was to place a constitutional amendment before the voters to add the recall of judges to the state constitution, changing it back to its original form. Voters of the new State of Arizona approved the provision for recall of judges and another amendment that provided women the right to vote in local, state and national elections.

<nickr> DVD Audio is evil
<drochaid> uh, why?
<nickr> because CD is an open format
<nickr> but DVD is constrained by CSS
<drochaid> CD isn't an open format
<drochaid> it's tightly controlloed by philips [who created it] and matsushita-panasonic
<drochaid> what's CSS?
<drochaid> rings a bell, but can't place it
<nickr> Its a coding method that is supposed to prevent you from playing out-of-region discs 
<nickr> so they can restirct markets
<nickr> and also to guarantee that they get royalties from decoding hardware
<drochaid> yeah, I thought I knew it
<nickr> Its very easy to circumvent, but unfortunately that is illegal in mayn countries
<nickr> well in a few at least
<drochaid> philips gain a royalty from every CD sold
<nickr> phillips' thing is non-intrusive though
<nickr> CSS is exteremly intrusive
<drochaid> true
<drochaid> but I'm more interested in the quality of DVD-Audio than the politics to be honest
<nickr> Heh.
<nickr> I'm more interested in not breaking the law to listen to or copy something I bought.

<javaguy> XML Schema Definition
<jcater> ah
Action: jcater thought xml schema was a replacement for dtd
<jcater> how does that relate to business objects?
<javaguy> the Primer (the first part of the RFC, which is divided into three parts) is at http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/
<javaguy> XML Schema is being used to replace DTD's, but that's only one use
<javaguy> Basically, you have an XSD (schema definition), which describes a complex structure, and then you have an XSI (Schema Instance) for each instance of said structure
<nickr> xsd is rather general
<javaguy> It also provides support for alot more complex structure than could be supported through DTD's
<chillywilly> our schema language should be ODL as that's the purpose of it, to describe the schema of an ODMS (which include object application servers)
<javaguy> i.e., enumerations, sequences, patterns
<chillywilly> but that's just me :P
<chillywilly> yea
<chillywilly> it's like IDL + some stuff
<nickr> I think all object definition systems are masturbation
<nickr> the running dogs who disagree with me will be the first against the wall
<chillywilly> nickr: show us the way then
<javaguy> CW: ODL seems to make the most sense for internal definitions
<chillywilly> well I need to really get myself into some more of the xml voodoo
<chillywilly> but I ain't there yet
<javaguy> If you want GNUe to interface with .NET services, SOAP, etc, ODL is not going to do you much good...
<chillywilly> ah, but we have a layer to do remote communication protocols
<dsmith> Axtually, XML is bogus.  You guys should be using S-expressions instead.

<chillywilly> seriously though
<chillywilly> I saw a paper/talk about someone saying just how closely related functional langauges/programming are to xml/xslt

<chillywilly>       IDL binding that are needed in order to better understand the ODL
<chillywilly>       binding that follows
<chillywilly> wooo@
<jcater> gak!
<dneighbo> so you can focus on other things for the moment
<jcater> why is OMG stuff mysteriously appearing in here?
<jcater> I thougt it was #gnuenterprise
<jcater> not #objectLustersAnonymous
<dneighbo> rofl
<chillywilly> just beacss the mappings are similar in describing the objects
<chillywilly> odl is idl-like and so is our current gcd
<chillywilly> and we even use stinking corba right now
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> woooo
<jcater> well, ok
<jcater> but we are doing XML right?
<jcater> right?
Action: jcater punches chillywilly's shoulder
<jcater> right?
<chillywilly> yea, sure but either way you will use the same things to describe the objects
<javaguy> hello, Derek
<chillywilly> attributes, operations, exceptions, etc.
<chillywilly> whihc should map to python code
<chillywilly> in some fashion
<chillywilly> I like how the IDL thing handles 'modules' and 'interfaces' and how the layout the python packages
<chillywilly> it creates a namespace for us
<chillywilly> it's kinda nifty
<derek> hi
<chillywilly> ello masta
#gnuenterprise: mode change '+o derek' by ChanServ!ChanServ@services.
<chillywilly> uh oh
<jcater> woohoo
<chillywilly> but I am being a good slave
<jcater> this morning, reports was kicking my arse
<chillywilly> honest
<jcater> now, the tables are turned
<jcater> mwahahaha
<chillywilly> woooo
Action: derek gets his XSLT book off the shelf and blows the dust off it
<derek> jcater: is it safe to slurp cvs for reports?
<jcater> um
<jcater> give me 2
Action: derek starts choking down some pasta while he waits
<dneighbo> grrr i know i have asked this before but i forget
<dneighbo> what is the command to remount a mount already in fstab?
<jcater> you "marry" it
<jcater> :)
<jcater> not sure
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> um if you marry it your chances of 'mounting' it dim significantly
<jcater> well, it's a catch 22
<jcater> :(

<chillywilly> hey hey just the man I wanted to see
<dyfet> uh oh
<chillywilly> dude gnu common cpp v2 is fucked on my system
<dneighbo> mount -a 
<chillywilly> either my example program crashes or it does nothing
<dneighbo> that is sad, get over it an use python :)
<dyfet> lol
<dneighbo> dyfet: like how it couldnt be CHILLY's program, but rather its gnu common cpp ;)
<chillywilly> it's been this way ever since I poseted that one time
<chillywilly> well why does it work fine with an older version dneighbo?
<dneighbo> um you havent fixed your program to work with new version?
<chillywilly> yes I have
<dneighbo> why does my old contact.gfd form not work?
<dneighbo> it worked with the old forms :)
<chillywilly> spent a 15-20 changing all the method names
<dneighbo> answer my form is broken :)
<chillywilly> no way man I think it's a debian unstable issue ;)
<chillywilly> yea, that's it
<chillywilly> I blame it on glib
<chillywilly> er, glib
<chillywilly> c
<crazymike> sup
<chillywilly> sup niggie
<derek> grrr only pepsi left in the house
<derek> anyone want to trade?
<jcater> gak!
<jcater> no thanks
<jcater> I'll stick w/the big red monopoly
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> pepsi rules
<jcater> sigh
<derek> only thing worse than pepsi is pepsi one ;)
<jcater> reports decided to kick my butt again
<chillywilly> pfffft
<jcater> give me a minute to regroup
<derek> can i check out cvs?
<chillywilly> coke licks balls yo
<chillywilly> derek: never
<chillywilly> you've been banned
<jcater> give me a minute to regroup
<derek> if i could find a soda that licked my balls, they surely would get my business
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> everclear will kick your balls
<jcater> not quite the same
dyfet (dyfet@dsl-65-188-113-57.telocity.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<nickr> no
<nickr> not quite the same at all
dsmith (dsmith@p100.usnyc7.stsn.com) left irc: "later.."
<chillywilly> bah, dyfet is such a wimp
<chillywilly> ran away like a little girl
<jcater> derek: reports is at your disposal
<jcater> committed
<derek> cool
<derek> you are using pysaboltron?
javaguy (ian@dhcp065-024-035-118.columbus.rr.com) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<derek> er pysablot
Action: jcater hasn't used any XSLT yet
<jcater> but since nickr got me debs
<jcater> I have it installed
<jcater> :)
<jcater> I was gonna play w/it tonight
<jcater> but someone shoved me and told me to stop
<jcater> you irc bully
<jcater> ;)
<derek> cool
<derek> just making sure
<jcater> are you just doing html?
<derek> foobulations still the best sample
<jcater> s/best/only
<derek> um for now just doing an html.xsl sheet as it should be easy
<derek> then i think i might make a gnumeric one
<derek> if i get VERY brave i will look at a formatted objects one
<derek> which will segway into ps, pdf etc
Action: jcater wants a text one, too
<jcater> I can do it tho
<derek> just raw text
<derek> no problemo
<derek> probably hardest part of that will be remembering the &foo; equiv for a new line
<nickr> we need an FO engine
<jcater> nickr: you volunteering?
<jcater> btw, how does everyone feel about standardizing on SVG for dynamically generated graphics
<jcater> (i.e., charts, etc)
<nickr> Hm.
<nickr> No I'm not volunteering. I'll be contented to be the local debian guru. :)
<derek> um grrrr
<derek> i feel good about svg
<derek> but i claim to know little :)
<derek> jcater: let me re run sample, i think i have questions :)
<jcater> grrr?
<derek> what is the -outfile param again
<jcater> -p
<jcater> or --destination
<derek> ?
<derek> -p or --destination 
<derek> seems like an odd choice :)
<jcater> well
<jcater> -d is taken for "debug"
<jcater> which I no longer like
<jcater> :)
Action: jcater is wanting to talk w/jamest about that
<derek> -p for put er there
<jcater> I personally don't think a single-letter parameter should be available for debug
<jcater> -p for printer
<derek> ah
<nickr> why not -o ?
<nickr> svg is a good format
<derek> my question is this
<derek> <?xml version="1.0"?>
<derek> <GNUe-report-output>
<derek>   <GNUe-report-request>
<derek>     <GNUe-request-parameter name="end">04/30/2002</GNUe-request-parameter>
<derek>     <GNUe-request-parameter name="subtitle">April2002</GNUe-request-parameter>
<derek>     <GNUe-request-parameter name="begin">04/01/2002</GNUe-request-parameter>
<derek>   </GNUe-report-request>
<derek> what are the request and params showing in the output?
<jcater> nickr: because -o would make TOO much sense
<jcater> derek: you can ignore the GNUe-report-* stuff
<derek> is this a tep thin or no
<jcater> tep?
<derek> temp
<derek> as in xsl i cant really ignore it
<derek> if GNUe-report-ouput will be there always
<jcater> the GNUe-request are the options the report was run with
<derek> i need to know
<jcater> in case the raw xml was written to a file
<jcater> and later transformed
<derek> if the GNUe-report-request are ignorable thats easy enough
<jcater> you could know what the raw xml really is
crazymike (crazymike@mke-65-31-133-230.wi.rr.com) left irc: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)
<jcater> it's ignorable
<jcater> but permanent
<jcater> unless it really causes you a problem
Action: jcater hopes not
<derek> no it shouldnt
<derek> the tag names might killme ;)
<derek> j/k btw
<jcater> well, let me retract that
<jcater> nothing is permanent at this stage :)
<jcater> but my intent is to keep them
Action: jcater makes no guarantees
Action: chillywilly hugs tcpdump
<chillywilly> I like tcpdump
<chillywilly> it's cool
<Mr_You> mac os x has a tcpdump gui app.. 
<jcater> is that for taking distributed dumps?
Action: Mr_You claps for Apple.
<chillywilly> hehe
jamest (~jamest@fh-dialup-201028.flinthills.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> it dumps tcp packet headers
<Mr_You> its a sniffer
<chillywilly> it
<chillywilly> s pretty cool
<chillywilly> let's you see wtf is going on
Action: chillywilly was monitoring crazymike's web server
<chillywilly> I was seeing how many leaches were sucking on his server
<chillywilly> heheh, there's someone form charter hospital

<chillywilly> that pussy
<chillywilly> he's got on RR user, on ameritech DSL user, and a guy/girl form charter hospital all downloading songs off his web server

<chillywilly> er, western
<Mr_You> word of advice for all, don't use sniffers on corporate networks unless you've been authorized ;-)

<nickr> I think chillywilly needs to take up like origami or weaving or something
<derek> </html>
<derek> got interrupted but basic transformatoin for title is done :)
<chillywilly> heheh
<nickr> foobulation
<jcater> derek: cool
<derek> since its there
<derek> can you, or do you mind me adding a section
<jcater> ?
<derek>       <sectionTitle></sectionTitle>
<derek> can we make a sectionTitle here
<jcater> dammit
<jcater> I had that fixed yesterday
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> you can manually type something there if you want
<derek> hmmm
<derek> also it looks odd like malformed xml
<derek> i see
<derek>     </section>
<derek> </GNUe-report-output>
<derek> but i dont see any <section>
Action: jcater has focused on the underlying report engine... not the validity of my sample file :)
<jcater> <reportTitle>Monthly Accounting Foobulation Report</reportTitle><section break="page">
<jcater>       <sectionTitle/>
<derek> grr was looking at old one
<derek> reran
<derek> and section loosk better
<jcater> ok
<derek> for now i want to be 'simple'
<derek> so im going to ignore 'page breaks' in html
<derek> and instead insert <hr>
<jcater> ok
<jcater> seems reasonable :)
<derek> how woudl a section title look?
<jcater> in html I'd picture it as an <h2>
<derek> no
<derek> i mean the markup :)
<jcater> oh
<derek> <sectionTitle>foo</sectionTitle>
<jcater> <sectionTitle>foo</sectionTitle>
<jcater> um, yeah
<jcater> that
Action: derek is just curious if we are avoiding <section title="something">
<derek> for a reason
<derek> i think its easier in xslt to do the way we are doing it :)
<jcater> the markup is actually
somebody_ (~somebody@h24-82-132-209.wp.shawcable.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> just asking :)
<jcater> <sectionTitle><param name="subtitle"/></sectionTitle>

<jcater> I don't think

Maniac (~somebody@h24-82-132-209.wp.shawcable.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> <sectionTitle title="<param name="subtitle"/>"/>
<jcater> would work
<nickr> its easier to do xslt with attributes
<jcater> sure
<jcater> but it's not easy to spit that out
<nickr> oh.
<nickr> yea.
<jcater> actually, that'd be trivial
<jcater> if we stuck w/the &lt;tag&gt;
<derek> woo hoo have subtitles and sectdions
<jcater> formatting
<jcater> but that's hard on the eyes :)
<jcater> rofl
<derek> ok have another question
<derek>       <table width="100%">
<derek>         <tablehead>
<derek>           <colhead width="40">Name</colhead>
<derek>           <colhead align="center" width="10">Date</colhead>
<derek>           <colhead align="right" width="10">Foobulations</colhead>
<derek>         </tablehead>
<jcater> anyone here get the Wall Street Journal?
<derek> im thinking width, alignment etc should possibly not be in the transformation
<derek> er the source file
<derek> this is where im torn
<chillywilly> only yuppies read the wall street journal
<derek> if we leave it out we are better off
<derek> BUT people will whine if we dont
<jcater> the headline is "Microsoft: Software Giant Struggles with Issues of Growing Up"
<chillywilly> tough noogies
<derek> i think the right way to do it is allow custom .xsl files to apply ontop of standard
<derek> but that another debate
<jcater> derek: I have ONLY one reason for doing that
<chillywilly> jcater: interesting
<jcater> I don't like it
<jcater> BUT
<jcater> this is a demo in which I need PS and Text demos
<jcater> and at the moment, I can't figure out tables :)
<jcater> so if you have a "width" we can fudge it for the moment
<jcater> now, if you know how to draw tables w/o that information
<jcater> I'm game
<jcater> long run, that's what I'd like
<jcater> and remember, this is a proof of concept markup, not necessarily "official gnue"
<jcater> that make sense?
<jcater> do you agree/disagree?
<derek> yess
<derek> im thinking what i might be able to do
<derek> if you are doing POC
<derek> i can hard code that crud in the .xsl
<derek> i.e. table
<chillywilly> derek thinking....scary
<derek> i can just make <table width="100%">
<derek> w/o you defining it
<derek> if we need this more portable than a POC
<jcater> oh, I thought you were talking about the width="40"
<derek> then i can make it read the width= in the markup etc
<derek> i was talking about all of it
<nickr> derek: never make something 100%
<derek> i will make it respect the output
<nickr> derek: make it 80% with 10% margins on each side :)
<chillywilly> nickr: and why not you frekazoid?
<derek> the question wasnt really 'i cant/wont do this'
<jcater> derek: "respect the output" ?
<derek> but rather do we want to be doing htis :)
<derek> and you answered that
<jcater> ok
<jcater> just keep that in mind w/all this
<jcater> 1) don't spend TOO much time on it
<derek> er respect the resulting .xml file the .grd creates :)
<jcater> 2) don't get worked up over what I coded
<jcater> :)
<derek> im not worked up
<nickr> use CSS, it makes size and formatting much easier
<derek> just asking questions
<derek> um CSS isnt an XSLT thing
<nickr> just say 'my templathe produces these CSS classes' and let the presentation determine what it really looks like
<nickr> No it isn't
<derek> and for other formats than html it makes no sense
<nickr> yep
<nickr> I thought you were talking about HTML
<nickr> I'm only vaguely conscious because I'm listening to Rush and getting like a major joy from it.
<jcater> Limbagh?
<chillywilly> the band?
<nickr> no
<nickr> the band yo
<chillywilly> rock on!
<nickr> and a voice rings in his ears, like the music of the spheres!
Action: jcater was getting worried about nickr
<chillywilly> a bolder new reality closer tot he heart
<chillywilly> er, to the
<nickr> too man hands on my time, too many feelings, too many things on my mind, when I leave I don't know what I'm hopin to find, and when I leave I don't know what I'm leavin behind!
<derek> what is html for table head?
<derek> th
<derek> and is the data td
<derek> <th>
Action: jcater thinks
<derek>   <td>foo</td>
<derek> etc
<chillywilly> gah, nickr what song is that?
<nickr> chillywilly: analog kid
<derek> getting closer
<derek> <html>
<derek>   <head>
<derek>     <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">

<derek>       </th>
<derek>     </table>
<derek>   </body>
<derek> </html>
<nickr> derek: don't use hr, use a <!DOCTYPE instead of a <meta
<jcater> yeah, I'm not sure of the <hr> either
<chillywilly> I agree with nickr
<chillywilly> actually both would be better
<chillywilly> <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<chillywilly> <html>
<chillywilly> <head>
<chillywilly> .....
<chillywilly> then the meta tag
<nickr> You don't need a <meta
<nickr> the doctype tells a smart renderer that its html
<derek> smoking
<derek> want a sample jcater?
<jcater> surely
<nickr> cracq
<derek> is ash down?
<derek> nevermind
<chillywilly> apparently
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<derek> is raw output
<derek> i.e. w/ table but not respecting your width etc
<jcater> the width wasn't necessarily for html
<derek> im thinking th is wrong but not sure
<jcater> are the table headers right?
<jcater> isn't it <tr><th>...</td>...</tr>
<jcater> ?
Action: jcater forgets
<nickr> derek: just make it link a CSS that makes it 100% dude.
<jcater> don't forget my subtotals :)
<derek> ah could be
Action: derek isnt to subtotals yet
<jcater> :)
Action: jcater is happy w/the progress :)
<jcater> my baby
<jcater> she's becoming a girl
<derek> its not 
<derek> <th><tr>
<derek> i.e. doesnt make it better
Action: derek goes to find html reference :)
<nickr> derek: th is akin to td
<derek> one thin that would help me jcater is if you could whip up a grd w/ more than one section :)
<nickr> derek: <tr><th>Header</th></tr><tr><td>Data</td></tr>
<chillywilly> akin eh?
<jcater> derek: as soon as I get this one working right :)
<jcater> that's my next step
<nickr> yes, akin
<derek> cool
<chillywilly> you're a super freak
<derek> hmm nickrthat still looks like crap
<nickr> derek: what is the output?
<chillywilly> html sucks rocks
<nickr> html is useful if you use it right :)
<derek> it just isnt pretty
<nickr> derek: I'l make it pretyt, gimme the ouput
Action: nickr is an html wizard
<derek> grrrr
<derek> damn it
<derek> i think galeon is caching the page
<jcater> ouch
<nickr> possibly
<nickr> I've had trouble looking at local files
<derek> yip that was the problem
<derek> reopened instead of refresh and it looks purdy
<derek> looks like th auto centers
alexey (~alexey@195.151.214.34) joined #gnuenterprise.
<nickr> yea
<nickr> by default most browsers render it that way
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<derek> is it with th done right
<derek> jcater: let me knock out subtotaling
<derek> and then i will look at respecting the attributes
<nickr> that looks like crap. Needs padding and borders and such
<derek> hmm pisss
<derek> i dont like how you ahve done subtotals :) it will make me work
<jcater> um
<jcater> how would you like it?
<jcater> we can change
<derek> can you explain it maybe
<jcater> my thinking was
<derek>          <subtotalRow level="2">  
<derek>             <subtotal skip=""/>
[22:58] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<derek>             <subtotal>12</subtotal>
<derek>           </subtotalRow>
<derek> is what i see
<jcater> level = 1 would be like a grand total
<jcater> level = 2 would be like a subtotal
<jcater> level 3 would be a subsubtotal (but you don't have to go that far :)
<derek> hmmm im not sure per say what this file would care about that
<jcater> hang on
<jcater> it would affect formatting
<derek> part of this could be me being an xslt newbie
<derek> at first look it would be probably easier to deal with as
<jcater> Blah 1   $1200
<jcater> Blah 2     100
<jcater>          -----
<jcater>           1300
<jcater> Blah 3   $1200
<jcater> Blah 4     100
<jcater>          -----
<jcater>           1300
<jcater>          -----
<jcater>          $2600
<jcater>          =====
<derek> <row type="total" level="2">
<derek>   <col number="3">12</col>
<derek> </row>
<jcater> um
<jcater> that's fine w/me
<jcater> actually, I think I prefer that
<derek> hey dont agree that easy
Action: Mr_You jumps in without a clue.
<derek> makes me think im wrong
<Mr_You> like usual
Action: nickr makes a nice style for it.
<derek> i say this only because my current sheet does equiv a for iteration through rows
<Mr_You> right now I have invoices where each item has a "price" and "extended price"
<derek> so by making it subtotalRow opposed to row will mean more work
<jcater> derek: I'm serious... change it
<jcater> I like that way better
<Mr_You> first is the @ price, extended price is discounted/total cost for number purchased.
<jcater> derek: at that rate, should we do
<jcater> <row type="heading"> 
<jcater> instead of
<jcater> <tablehead>
<jcater> ?
<derek> :)
Action: derek is going to leave as is for a minute and researching some xslt stuff
<derek> like attribute processing
Action: Mr_You whispers something about RPG?
<derek> i dont want to be changing things too rapidly just yet
<Mr_You> any benefits of old school RPG for report generation?  
<derek> when i posed the question i didnt expect you to agree
<Mr_You> I actually had RPG class in H.S.
<jcater> RPG?
<derek> run 
<Mr_You> hehe
<derek> old reporting language RPG
<derek> Report Program Generator or something
<Mr_You> a language for creating reports.
<nickr> look at http://nick.industrialmeats.com/proj/gnue/monthly.html :)
<derek> oh wicked
<derek> you can combine documents
<jcater> purdy
<derek> like
<derek> <report>
<nickr> with namespaces
<derek>   <title>April Purchase Orders</title>
<nickr> you can
<chillywilly> I don't want to be a cog in the corporate machine anymore
<derek>   <po filename="po3234.xml"/>
<derek>   <po filename="po3235.xml"/>
<derek>   <po filename="po3236.xml"/>
<derek> </report>
<derek> yummy i think we can do some wicked stuff
<Mr_You> cw: take a vacation
<jcater> cw: marry rich
<jcater> err, marry wealth
<Mr_You> but then, I tend to think life shouldn't be about 2-3 vacations a year..
<derek> hmmm we can do formulas in xslt if we so desire
<chillywilly> nah, I think I will just have to do things my way
<jcater> derek: just pagenumbers and the like :)
<Mr_You> I like the idea of working while vacationing.. so you're vacationing 12 times a year
<derek> hmm it can do sorting and the likes too
<jcater> does it do dishes?
<chillywilly> does it make coffee?
<chillywilly> and donuts?

<derek> jcater: well i have it respecting attributes :)
<derek> but its not pretty
<jcater> that's ok
<jcater> we have nickr
<derek> i.e. you specfication of 100% makes it ugly
Action: jcater thinks you can remove the width=100%
<jcater> as I don't know what crack I was smoking at the time
<jcater> the table column widths are actual max character widths
<jcater> which may or may not be relative in html output
<jcater> but was mainly for text/ps
Action: chillywilly is away: hitting the crack pipe
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 00:00:03)
<jcater> derek: regrab cvs
<jcater> the format hasn't changed
<jcater> but I fixed a bug
<nickr> derek: did you even look at the version I made?
<derek> nickr: why doesnt this work
<derek> <html>
<derek> <head>

<derek> as i cant use what you put

<derek> dicks with the xsl sheet
<derek> and i end up with
<derek> <style></style>
<derek> i suppose i could use CDATA
<derek> nickr: i looked at the version you made but struggling to implement it
<jcater> but I fixed a bug
^chewie (~chewie@flemingi.dsl.visi.com) left #gnuenterprise.
<derek> nickr: ?
<derek> hmmm if i remove that text="css/text" works fine
<jcater> how odd
<derek> prolly will choke the snot out of old browsers though
<jcater> methinks too
<nickr> derek: you should move the stylesheet to a separate file
<nickr> derek: I just stick it in there so you could see
<derek> for now it works
<nickr> anyway, it looks a hell of a lot better than the raw html :)
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<derek> notice date and foobulations header are respecting the xml file alignment
<derek> xslt also does formatting
<derek> note the 12's on the bottom are the subtotals
<derek> but obviously the style sheet is wrong :)
<jcater> rofl
<derek> as i was doing for loop for row
<derek> then did for loop for subtotalrow
<derek> and why i suggested we do them all as row :)
<jcater> you can change them and commit if you want
<derek> that way i could just do an 'if'
<jcater> or I can change them and commit
<jcater> either way
<derek> jcater: you change
<derek> so i can blame you when someone with a clue tells us we are high
<nickr> derek: you should have your xslt formulate CSS styles for things with formatting
<jcater> derek: committed
<chillywilly> derek: heh, too bad this channel is logged ;)
<chillywilly> and plus I also have the logs to prove it
<derek> also if you want the data and not the columns aligned
<chillywilly> muwahahahaha
<derek> er not just the headers
<chillywilly> *sigh*
<derek> you might change the grd to
<derek>                 <out:col align="center"><field name="foodate"/></out:col>
<derek>                 <out:col align="right"><field name="foobs"/></out:col>
<derek> btw: im a foobs man
<derek> nickr: im working on the basics :)
<derek> i have included the stylesheet you suggested
<nickr> hm.
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<derek> should be your style sheet implementation
<nickr> Indeed
<nickr> you can generate the tags without the align if the align isn't specified with a conditional thingy in xslt
<jcater> derek: committed
<chillywilly> http://news.gnome.org/gnome-news/1017787868/index_html
<jcater> with the out:subtotals changed to out:col :)
<jcater> argh!
Action: jcater thinks konq is caching
<derek> jcater: another reason to hate html
Action: derek remembers this from writing jadeke stuff
<derek> caching was a proverbial bitch
<derek> there is a meta tag i believe
<chillywilly> I'm not having any issues
<jcater> are the 3 subttotals still at the bottom?
<chillywilly> the refresh attribute in meta?
<derek> that tells the broswer to ignore cache
<derek> but of course i.e. didnt respect it :)
<derek> yes
<nickr> I don't seem to have a problem with it
<derek> chillywilly: sashxb is old news :)
<chillywilly> sorry d00dz
<nickr> I think they fixored the caching behavior in the galeon that I have
<jcater> derek: that "yes" for me?
<chillywilly> I haven't read news in a while
<derek> yip
<jcater> ok
Action: chillywilly has 1.2.0
<derek> yes subtotals still on bottom
<derek> regrabbing cvs
<derek> and going to run it
<chillywilly> eeek, april 2nd
<derek> then look at some things
<chillywilly> sheesh
Action: jcater is getting summaries to work
<derek> rock
<derek> we might have stupid and useless demo at some point :)
<jcater> ?
Action: derek will work on getting contact manager report soon :)
<jcater> we have that now
<jcater> ah
<nickr> derek: 'stupid and useless demon' is redundant
<nickr> demon
<nickr> demo
<nickr> weird
<jcater> my foobulations report isn't useless
<chillywilly> daemon
Action: derek was supposed to get contact manager working today
<jcater> those are real foobulation numbers I ran from NCS
<chillywilly> bitch
<derek> nickr: you have never worked for a large corporation
<derek> they require many stupid yet useful tools :)
<chillywilly> fuck corporations
<derek> chillywilly: im scared of catching something
<chillywilly> fuck them up their stupid asses
Action: chillywilly works a for a real big shithead of a corporation
<chillywilly> s/a//
<derek> kick butt
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<jcater> chillywilly: that's redundent too
<derek> basically i did nothign to my style sheet
<derek> other than rerun the new grd
<chillywilly> jcater: hehe
<derek> need to pretty up the format of the subtotals
<derek> but they are in right place now
<chillywilly> anyone know of the infamous Tyco (and not eh toy company)
<jcater> oops
<chillywilly> er, the
<jcater> guess I forgot the "right" on the last total
Action: derek hopes you dont use that 'math' when doing your own financials :)
<derek> i.e. all totals are 12
Action: jcater is working on summaries now :)
<jcater> those are hardcoded
Action: derek thought maybe i accidently hardcoded that
<derek> in my sheet and had to double check
<nickr> you should make a class for total lines that get inverted :)
<derek> nickr: if you want want to pretty this up some
<derek> the total lines
<derek> i might be able to make the style sheet fit the bill
<derek> er the xslt sheet
<nickr> Well
<nickr> you are getting logical information about the rows aren't you?
<jcater> sigh
<jcater>   def addSummaryToSection(self, section, field, function):
<jcater>     pass  # This should probably be replaced with real code :)
<nickr> like 'this is a total' 'this is an item' etc?
<derek> jcater:  you in the grd?
<jcater> somewhat... but you can change
<derek> if not i will make some changes 
<derek> ok
<nickr> if you're getting that information, you can put it in class names
<derek> nickr: currently no
<nickr> if its in class names you can mark up based on it
<jcater> what information?
<derek> but technically i will know by type=
Action: jcater thinks that's the only what you should know
<jcater> as I don't wanna put css in my grd
<derek> jcater: the file provides that information
<derek> im just not reading it :)
<derek> yet
<jcater> ah
<nickr> I'm not saying you have CSS in there
<derek> so if nick made a css
<derek> that said
--- Tue Apr  9 2002
[00:00] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<nickr> you just pass on some hints about the what *kind* of information it is
<derek> td.total
<derek> td.item
<derek> i could make xslt
<derek> that by type
<nickr> yea, although its better to say class="total"
<derek> deteremines what class to use
<derek> if type=subtotal
<derek>   <td class="total">
<derek> or whatever
<derek> is that what you meant nickr?
<jcater> I don't think "class" makes sense in the grd, so can y'all use "type" ?
<chillywilly> does python have along double type?
<chillywilly> a, 'long double'
<jcater> chillywilly: python has floats and ints
<jcater> derek: I just committed everything I have
<jcater> and I'm calling it a nite
<jcater> y'all enjoy
<jcater> (the only change I made to the GRD was added align="right" to that last subtotal)
Action: jcater is excited!
<nickr> jcater: it doesn't matter what you call it on tehe grd side, as long as we can guess logical information about the data
<nickr> and convert it to CSS classes
<jcater> yeah, I'd think type= would be the place to infer then
<chillywilly> the python IDl binding defines some interface
<chillywilly> for long double support
<jcater> derek: any more questions before I go?
<chillywilly> for some reason xpdf doesn't want to let me copy shit
<derek> nickr: refresh that page
<derek> shifted some columns on the grd to make it nicer
<derek> still needs html pretties though :)
<nickr> nice
<chillywilly> wtf
<derek> um
<nickr> what you should do is do like spreadsheets do it
<chillywilly> it used to work
<derek> i made slight grd changes
<nickr> and say 'this item should be numeric' etc
<derek> i made the total in the middle column
<nickr> and then we can say at the HTML level 'numeric classed things are left aligned'
<derek> and right aligned it
<nickr> right alignd
<derek> nickr: good point and we could do number formatting in xslt if we so desired as well, though imagine that will happen in grd
<nickr> yea
<derek> jcater: scary thing
<jcater> derek: my plans on that were to
<derek> w/ nickrs html pretties
<chillywilly> For the long double type, the following 
<chillywilly> interface must be provided:
<nickr> well what you do is minimize or remove physical markup from grd, add all of that to after the grd
<derek> this report is nicer than what access makes
<nickr> the xslt, html, FO
<chillywilly> The function CORBA.long_double creates a new long double number from 
<chillywilly> a floating point number.
<chillywilly> The operation to_float of a long double number converts it into a 
<chillywilly> floating point number. For each floating point number f, 
<chillywilly> CORBA.long_double(f).to_float==f.
<nickr> hav the grd contain logical information about the stuff so you can use that as a hint as to how to format it
<chillywilly> The long double number has an internal representation that is capable of storing 
<chillywilly> IEEE-754 compliant values, with sign, 31 bits of mantissa (offset 16383), and 112 
<chillywilly> bits of fractional mantissa. If numeric operations are provided, they offer the 
<chillywilly> precision resulting from this specification.
<chillywilly> sorry, done
<jcater> have something like <field type="date" format="y-m-d h:m:s.i">2002-04-01 00:00:00.00</field>
<jcater> and the XSLT could take it as provided
<jcater> or if the locale preferred, could convert the format
<jcater> but the format="..." identified how the GRD has outputted it
<derek> btw: fire sandy that wench has negative foobulations :)
<derek> ?
<derek> im not too worried about that part yet
<jcater> but that's for a later "official" discussion
<jcater> :)
<derek> technically it might be preferred to make xslt do formatting
<nickr> I say remove all physical formatting from grd
<derek> but idealistically i dont want to lock us into xslt
<derek> so i woudl rather put the tag in grd and have our engine do it
<nickr> only provide logical information for the formatting side to use as hints
<derek> though it think when we get cooking we probably wont have anything but xslt
<jcater> nickr: to a certain extent, I agree
<jcater> but like I showed with my example, we'll actually
<jcater> output a format, but actually provide the mask used to create the format
<jcater> so the layout formatter can reformat the value if need be
<nickr> well thats different
<derek> ok one question jcater
<jcater> but that's for later
<nickr> thats char level formatting
<derek> currently how im doing transformations is
<nickr> I mean page level
<derek> with html.xsl
<jcater> nickr: so do I
<derek> and with pyxslt (a small program from DCL) :)
ra3vat (ds@ics.elcom.ru) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> i think pyxslt belongs in the gnue tree as its useful :)
<derek> where should i put these two files?
Action: jcater thinks common/scripts
<jcater> or create a subdir under utils/
Action: jcater thinks scripts, tho
<jcater> fwiw, I don't want to put TOOO much processing off into the XSLT
<ra3vat> hello all
<jcater> as it isn't exactly known for its speed
<jcater> i.e., transforms is one thing
<jcater> sorting and format masks are another
<jcater> ra3vat: howdy
<nickr> jcater: Yes, definitely do sorting and char level formatting on the grd side.
<nickr> but leave alignments and stuff up to the xslt based on type/class hints
<ra3vat> jcater: hello
<jcater> I don't fully agree w/that
<jcater> in principle, I do
<jcater> in practice, I don't
<nickr> why?
<jcater> well, at the moment we are looking at VERY simple tabulation reports
<jcater> in this case, sure, I agree
<nickr> Yes.
<jcater> but that's only a small piece of the pie
<nickr> Well.
<nickr> I'd say its possible to extend the conept to every level.
<jcater> there's several instances where I've needed right-aligned text
<jcater> or left-aligned numbers
<nickr> and I'll do my best to influence things that way. :)
<nickr> okay
<nickr> at least for most cases you should try to define a set of useful classes
<derek> jcater putting in scripts/
<jcater> however, I do agree that the "default" could vary based on type
<nickr> such as lineitem, total, etc
<derek> but i think html.xsl is a reports only thing
<jcater> i.e., the "default" for numeric might be right allign
<derek> is there a dir under reports that woujld be better
<derek> jcater: i agree
<nickr> jcater: Yes, I can agree that allowing the report to override the default behavior would be useful.
<jcater> there was
<jcater> hang on
<derek> type="numeric" align="right|left|center"
<derek> and if type="numberic" and no alight defined it right aligns or such
<jcater> derek: add that to samples/foobulations for now
<jcater> I may have it moved later on
<chillywilly> jcater: you should go to bed
<jcater> I could've sworn I had a directory for transforms
<chillywilly> so should I
<jcater> chillywilly: yes, you are right
<jcater> derek: anything else?
<jcater> I need to go to bed
<chillywilly> me too
<derek> um i think im good
<derek> i will put in foobulations
<derek> but it should at somepoint be moved to a transforms or something similar
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I had a directory structure for that
<jcater> but it isn't in cvs
<jcater> I may have forgotten to cvs add it
<chillywilly> I'm outty 2000

<ajmitch> hey
<nickr> derek: add tr.subtotal { background: black; color: white } to the stylesheet
<ajmitch> what's up all?
<derek> gack
<derek> that made the text disappear

<derek> cause my type

<nickr> hows that suit you?
<derek> not my taste
<nickr> hm
<derek> but at least i can tell what is what :)
Action: ajmitch pokes #gnuenterprise
<nickr> you might make the th's inverted like that
<derek> hey bitch that hurt
<nickr> and make the totals boldface
<nickr> font-weight: bold;
<nickr> see how that suits you

<derek> gack my section header is gone

<nickr> indeed
<derek> hey reinhard what you think of the first gnue reports report 
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<reinhard> looks like a good starting point
<reinhard> i think dandy is missing
<reinhard> ;-)
<ajmitch> hi reinhard
<nickr> derek: maybe a slight mod to the borders to make them more liney, and box in the totals
<derek>         body {
<derek>           font-face: sans-serif;
<derek>         }
<derek> seems to have little effect
<nickr> indeed.
<derek> tell me what to change and i will
<derek> for the borders
<nickr> hrm
<psu> reinhard: what about randy?
<psu> that's always a good name to wind americans up with
<psu> (in English english, randy = horny
<psu> so US tourists called randy are always a source of innocent amusement)
<ajmitch> hehe
<derek> btw: reinhard the report is certainly lame but its really living and breathing
<derek> i.e. it actually gets its database from a database
<ajmitch> impressive
<derek> you have an .grd which is xml that is like a form to define what db and such to connect too
<derek> then it goes out gets the data and makes an outputted xml file
<derek> and we do an xslt translation to turn it into html
<derek> which is what the url is for
<derek> so while it might look lame and unimpressive it really is a pretty solid start
<derek> nickr: can probably attest to just in a few hours tonight it has made pretty decent progress
<reinhard> derek: yeah that's what i said

<derek> but now seeing it im not so sure
<nickr> it looks interesting
<nickr> but not great.
<nickr> looks better as is now
<derek> im thinking what if we killed all lines
<nickr> uh
<nickr> it'd look narsty
<derek> except for the one's above Total For XXX
<nickr> they eye would have nothing to follow
<nickr> Well see thats the problem
<derek> and bolded the NAME
<nickr> since you chose to put the class at the row level, theres no way to put a line there
<reinhard> derek: and below Total For XXX
<derek> reinhard: yes
<derek> i didnt choose jcater did :)
Action: derek knew he need to let him check that in :)
<derek> you cant do borders at tr level?
<nickr> No
<nickr> Unforutanely
<nickr> I don't think it considers trs block level
<nickr> which sucks.
<derek> and if i move things down to td level
<derek> we have issue of alignment
<nickr> Not really 
<nickr> what you do is generate classes
<derek> in about 2 seconds i just generated classes
<nickr> so you say 'this cell is a numeric right aligned' o you generate a new class taht has everything in a numeric except the alignment
<derek>       <tr class="item">
<derek>         <td align="" class="item">Sandy</td>
<derek>         <td align="center" class="item">2002-04-03 00:00:00.00</td>
<derek>         <td align="right" class="item">-203</td>
<derek>       </tr>
<derek>       <tr class="subtotal">
<derek>         <td align="" class="subtotal"></td>
<derek>         <td align="right" class="subtotal">Total for Sandy</td>
<derek>         <td align="right" class="subtotal">12</td>
<derek>       </tr>
<nickr> bah
<nickr> It won't render correctly like taht.
<derek> obviously would have to remove the align=
<nickr> Ahh I know how to do
<nickr> use a <span>
<derek> jsut show that the row type at td level now as wel las tr level
<nickr> derek: if theres an alignment value, put a <span align=""> around the data
<nickr> if not don'tt put anything
<nickr> that'd really be a better solution anyway
<nickr> more consistant with the background
<nickr> because whan you're doing with the span is *locally* overriding the hiting
<nickr> hinting
<derek>       <tr class="item">
<derek>         <td class="item">
<derek>           <span align=""></span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>         <td class="item">
<derek>           <span align="center">2002-04-03 00:00:00.00</span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>         <td class="item">
<derek>           <span align="right">63</span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>       </tr>
<derek>       <tr class="subtotal">
<derek>         <td class="subtotal">
<derek>           <span align=""></span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>         <td class="subtotal">
<nickr> yes, but leave the span out if theres no item or no align
<derek>           <span align="right">Total for Candy</span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>         <td class="subtotal">
<derek>           <span align="right">12</span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>       </tr>
Action: derek hasnt yet ventured into the if its blank thing
<nickr> leave the span out if theres no item or no align
<nickr> its a very simple <xslt:if thing
<derek>       <tr class="item">
<derek>         <td class="item"></td>
<derek>         <td class="item">
<derek>           <span align="center">2002-04-03 00:00:00.00</span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>         <td class="item">
<derek>           <span align="right">63</span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>       </tr>
<derek>       <tr class="subtotal">
<nickr> sweet!
<derek>         <td class="subtotal"></td>
<derek>         <td class="subtotal">
<nickr> how does it render?
<derek>           <span align="right">Total for Candy</span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>         <td class="subtotal">

<derek>       </tr>
<derek> better?
<derek> dont know havent tried :)
<nickr> lets see it
<derek> grr everything left aligned
<nickr> ah, change the span to div
<nickr> div is block level
<nickr> and relook
<derek> after all this xslt i think i might some of my website stuff xml
<derek> and use xslt for it
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<nickr> heh
<derek> div worked!
<derek> so now can we play cool stylesheets
<nickr> okey dokey
<derek> anyone know the entity for a newline char 
<derek> and for a tab
<nickr> you don't need those.
<nickr> oh
<nickr> for generating text output
<nickr> eh
<nickr> just put the leteral char in there?
<derek> ?
<nickr> I dunno. ;)
<nickr> Hrm
<nickr> check out my copy
<derek> getting close :)
<derek> hmmm i was able to core dump trying to do ascii :)
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<derek> ahh its text not ascii
<derek> my copy should match yours now
<nickr> except that I put a cellpsacing="0" in the <table>
<nickr> which makes it look right, but I'm trying to find if theres a css property to do that
<reinhard> silly question
<reinhard> is it on purpose that the total values aren't correct?
<nickr> ha hah!
<nickr> I am a mad html hax0
<nickr> check it out
<derek> jcater used to work for arthur andersen
<derek> dont blame him
<derek> he was trained to 'fudge' numbers
<nickr> all is revealed. :)
<derek> reinhard: subtotalling is not fully functional
<derek> we put in hard numbers for them so we could play with transformations
<derek> jcater will probably have them workign tomorrow
<derek> http://www.jovino.com/stuff/entities.html
<derek> seems to show
<derek> &#010; or &#013; as newline
<derek> i tried both separate and togehter with now luck :(
<nickr> thats the ascii yes
<nickr> you can just put literal new lines in with <xslt:text> can't you?
<nickr> <xsl:text> rather
<nickr> yes you can
<nickr> and you have to tell it that you're producing text output
<nickr> <xsl:output method="text" indent="no"/>
<nickr> then you can do like
<nickr> <xsl:text>
<nickr>   foo!
<nickr> </xsl:text>
<nickr> and it'll be \n  foo\n
<derek> can you check my page to make sure it looks like yours :)
<derek> i think i have it
<nickr> yep
<nickr> :)
<derek> smoking......................!
<nickr> looks better than crystal reports
<nickr> hah
<derek> but how do i do 'tabs'
<nickr> tabs yes
<nickr> hm
<derek> will they be preserved in xsl:text?
<nickr> I believe so
<nickr> its supposed to output literally whats in there
<nickr> you could probably put the entity for tab in a <text> ..
<nickr> &#09;
<nickr> or maybe
<nickr> &#009;
Action: nickr checks on that
<nickr> parsing dia files is fun :P
<nickr> xsl:value-of select="substring-before(substring-after(dia:attribute[@name='name']/dia:string,'#\'),'#')" />
<nickr> ah
<nickr> derek: you can put a tab char ($#009;) right into a <xsl:text>
<derek> so
<derek> <xsl:text>&#009;</xsl:text>
<nickr> yea
<nickr> at least it worked for me
<derek> didnt work here
<nickr> hm
<nickr> hmm
<nickr> lemme see
<derek> it does
<derek> damn variable names :)
<nickr> oh.
<nickr> heh.
<nickr> show us the money!

<derek> well im just happy to get it this far i need to go to bed

<nickr> yea

<nickr> ah

<dneighbo> you might find that interesting jcater
<dneighbo> reinhard: our co-op idea for bandwidth
<dneighbo> er re :
<Mr_You> I like the idea of public bandwidth, but seems spensive unless you are using super extended reach wireless
<Mr_You> then again, DSL equipment can probably be found cheap
<Mr_You> I would bitch locally if broadband wasn't available to me.
<dneighbo> jcater: the locals here are raving about gentoo linux
<dneighbo> which uses BSD like ports called portage
<dneighbo> i just found out its written in python :)
<jcater> yip
<dneighbo> could be interesting for gnue package management :)
<dneighbo> personally im not seeing the advantage over debian
<dneighbo> while compiling rather than usign binaries might give a minor advantage
<jcater> well, all the packages would be compiled optimized for your machine
<dneighbo> on some machines the compile times would kick your ass
<jcater> and honestly I had less issues w/FreeBSD ports than I have w/apt
<dneighbo> like ToyMan on bsd was saying that gnumeric took like over 4 hours to compile
<jcater> even though apt works the vast majority of the time
<dneighbo> as to optimization
<jcater> yeah, that was my big issue
<dneighbo> unless you are just a raw metal geeks im not seeing the huge difference
<jcater> ... compile time
<jcater> my understanding is its not uncommon to see a 10% gain
<dneighbo> i.e. kernels you can get optimized for you processor
<ToyMan> dneighbo: you don't have to compile, you can use pkg_add and get the binaries..
<dneighbo> ToyMan at which point its same as debian :)
<jcater> but i loved the FreeBSD ports
<dneighbo> im not saying ports is dumb
<dneighbo> i think its pretty cool
<dneighbo> im just saying if im a sysadmin
<ToyMan> except, that if you compile, it never breaks your system
<jcater> dneighbo: once there's Debian/BSD then you can argue "why not debian"
<ToyMan> which apt *will* do
<jcater> as a person who wants BSD wants BSD
<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> and my choice is slightly faster apps
<dneighbo> or a well supported platform
<dneighbo> its a no brainer
<dneighbo> i.e. i would have reservations putting gentoo on a production box
<dneighbo> as to BSD
<Mr_You> source packages are ok, but I don't see them as a requirement.. just untar heh
<dneighbo> i really prefer GPL licensing :)
<jcater> dneighbo: sure
<jcater> that's why debian makes sense for you :)
<dneighbo> i.e. as a sysadmin (which im not)
<dneighbo> i would use debian (or someother well supported distro)
<dneighbo> and if i had applications that needed 'performance' boosts i would compile them
<dneighbo> if i wasnt anti-BSD i would simply say install BSD :)
<dneighbo> jcater : i guess my gripe is one of practicality
<dneighbo> to me this kind of environment is like CS jerking off (as nickr would put it)
<jcater> dneighbo: I don't necessarily agree
<dneighbo> its good to see choices
<jcater> have you ever used a ports system?
<dneighbo> yes
<jcater> other than compile times, BSD ports was as good as apt
<dneighbo> not gentoo but bsd
<dneighbo> i didnt say it wasnt as good as apt
<dneighbo> my point is long compile time for minor performance
<dneighbo> makes little practical sense
<jcater> well, that was *one* point :)
<jcater> it really shines when you don't have packages for everything
<ToyMan> ports is quite a bit better than apt, apt breaks things, ports doesn't, that's a *big* diff.
<jcater> and you needed to install something else for source
<jcater> s/for/from
<jcater> then the ports shined over apt
<jcater> as they often worked with the custom installed thingy
<dneighbo> you dont want my answer there (remember im borderline socialist)
<dneighbo> if you dont have packages for what you want
<dneighbo> be a good debian citizen and make them :)
<ToyMan> with apt, I still ended up chasing dependancies, though not near as bad as with the rpm nightmare
<jcater> now, see you are then restricting usage to technically elite
<dneighbo> ToyMan i think you had some odd experience
<jcater> I can install something from source w/o a hitch
<dneighbo> in about a year with debian
<jcater> but I wouldn't begin to know how to package something for debian
<dneighbo> i think that apt has truly only broken something 1 or 2 times
<dneighbo> and have really never had a dependency issue
<ToyMan> dneighbo: I don't think so, the mail lists are full of people trying to fix apt-broken systems
<dneighbo> not that apt is flawless, it simple sucks less
<dneighbo> ToyMan : well i thought the same thing till lived in #gnuenterprise
<ToyMan> as i said *way* better than rpm
<dneighbo> nickr and jbailey showed me the way
<jcater> of course, I'm now an apt and debian fanatic (an ex-FreeBSD dude)
<dneighbo> i.e. generally if apt gets into any issues its just a matter of knowing more commands than apt-get to play
<jcater> but I still do miss some things :)
<dneighbo> maybe its a personality thing
<dneighbo> just almost everyone i know that uses BSD and now gentoo
<dneighbo> are know it all grab ass wannabe's
<ToyMan> hehe, that's me to the n'th
<dneighbo> who's number one cool factor is that they have a CUSTOM install
<dneighbo> ToyMan : you have been only exception to this :)
<dneighbo> i.e. i wont mention names
<ToyMan> how little you know...
<jcater> I might agree w/that on gentoo front
<dneighbo> but generally they are of the ilk that if you dont recompile your kernel daily
<jcater> but freebsd has one helluva user base
<dneighbo> and you arent running the most unstable of file systems
<ToyMan> oh, there's shitheads in every camp...
<dneighbo> you just dont know what you are doing :)
<dneighbo> ToyMan : agree
<dneighbo> actually the BSD's arent really like that
<dneighbo> im talking mostly gentoo crows
<dneighbo> er crowd
<jcater> dneighbo: to elaborate on your stereotypes
<dneighbo> and to a large degree the slack crowd had this mentality
<jcater> let me provide mine
<jcater> until I hooked up w/gnue
<ToyMan> heh, there's people over at #freebsd who would rip your head off if you came in talkin debian shit...
<ToyMan> but plenty of nice folks too
<jcater> I was a firm believer in the statement "Those who love unix, use BSD... those who hate microsoft use Linux"
<dneighbo> :)
<jcater> I strongly believed that based on many many observation
<jcater> s
Action: Mr_You reboots &
<jcater> but then jamest prooved me wrong :)
<dneighbo> linux users are generally the worst
<dneighbo> and debian developers are probably the rudest :)
<dneighbo> except the ones that seem to have found this channel
<dneighbo> but if my first experience with debian woudl ahve been #debian or a debian mailing list i wouldnt be using debian :)
<dneighbo> only thing that prevented me from being a BSD user was license
<dneighbo> i still plan on installing netBSD on my toaster this year ;)
<ToyMan> dneighbo: for me the proof is in the pudding, either there's a good community or there isn't... the license affects that, but it's only one factor
<jcater> I bought a DreamWeaver when they went to $50
<jcater> for the explicit reason of installing NetBSD on it
<dneighbo> rofl
<jcater> I'm not joking
<dneighbo> ToyMan : i think community is important
<dneighbo> but here is my take, for the most part i dont like the linux community
<jcater> err, I meant DreamCast
<jcater> not DreamWeaver :)
<dneighbo> but license is more important than community to me
Action: jcater doesn't think NetBSD even runs in an HTML editor
<ToyMan> community is the *real* thing (coke commecial music wells up in the background)
<ToyMan> for me just reducing it to the license is too theoretical and 'clean'
<ToyMan> reality is messy
<ToyMan> and things have unintended consequences
<dneighbo> :)
<ToyMan> and if there's a real living community, that's the best way to judge that all of the combined effects worked out for the good
<dneighbo> all things said, BSD is FREE
<dneighbo> so its definteily usable
<ToyMan> and their community and license has led to many good things in the world
<dneighbo> i just hate seeing good fruit put on the table for m$ or sun or whomever to take as their own and abuse their users with
<jamest> i proved you wrong?
<ToyMan> there will always be shitheads, it's an illusion to think a license will keep them from being shitheads
<jamest> little ol' me?
<jcater> jamest: yes
<ToyMan> it can help, though
<jamest> how so?
<jcater> I thought all linux ppl hated windows (and not that they loved unix)
<jcater> you proved to me that some linux admins simply hate users
<jcater> and could care less about windows
<ToyMan> heh
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> i hate it too
<jamest> users, windows, people in the fast lane driving slow
<jamest> it's all the same thing
<jamest> a target for my aggression
<dneighbo> i fall into the love unix category
<dneighbo> as i have writings from just a few years ago
<dneighbo> where i said i still preferred windows on the desktop
<dneighbo> i.e. i was 'curious' to unix
<dneighbo> but still preferred windows

<dneighbo> nickr you here?
<dneighbo> or jamest or jcater
<dneighbo> have old machine not lots of disk space
<dneighbo> how do i remove .debs after installed
<dneighbo> i.e. not the package
<dneighbo> just the file
<Mr_You> guess I'd hafta create some scripts and find/create a program to spit out the stuff
<Mr_You> dpkg --purge <packagename>
<Mr_You> oh
<Mr_You> rm (don't do -r)... rm /var/cache/apt/archives/*
<dneighbo> Mr_You there is easier way
<dneighbo> that gets them all in one command
<Mr_You> that removes downloaded debs
<Mr_You> hehe, I've always done rm ;-)
<Mr_You> can't get much easier ;-)
<Mr_You> doesn't break anything AFAIK
<dneighbo>        clean  clean clears out the local repository of  retrieved
<dneighbo>               package  files.  It removes everything but the lock
<dneighbo>               file     from     /var/cache/apt/archives/      and
<dneighbo>               /var/cache/apt/archive/partial/.  When  APT is used
<dneighbo>               as a dselect(8) method, clean is run automatically.
<dneighbo>               Those  who  do  not use dselect will likely want to
<dneighbo>               run apt-get clean from time to time to free up disk
<dneighbo>               space.
<dneighbo> apt-get clean 
<Mr_You> ahh, good to know.. 
<Mr_You> I'm use to netscape caches which don't work properly, so I rm ;-)
<dneighbo> an apt-get clean just got me back 300mb :)
