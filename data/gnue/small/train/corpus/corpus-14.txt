<nickr> you just pass on some hints about the what *kind* of information it is
<derek> td.total
<derek> td.item
<derek> i could make xslt
<derek> that by type
<nickr> yea, although its better to say class="total"
<derek> deteremines what class to use
<derek> if type=subtotal
<derek>   <td class="total">
<derek> or whatever
<derek> is that what you meant nickr?
<jcater> I don't think "class" makes sense in the grd, so can y'all use "type" ?
<chillywilly> does python have along double type?
<chillywilly> a, 'long double'
<jcater> chillywilly: python has floats and ints
<jcater> derek: I just committed everything I have
<jcater> and I'm calling it a nite
<jcater> y'all enjoy
<jcater> (the only change I made to the GRD was added align="right" to that last subtotal)
Action: jcater is excited!
<nickr> jcater: it doesn't matter what you call it on tehe grd side, as long as we can guess logical information about the data
<nickr> and convert it to CSS classes
<jcater> yeah, I'd think type= would be the place to infer then
<chillywilly> the python IDl binding defines some interface
<chillywilly> for long double support
<jcater> derek: any more questions before I go?
<chillywilly> for some reason xpdf doesn't want to let me copy shit
<derek> nickr: refresh that page
<derek> shifted some columns on the grd to make it nicer
<derek> still needs html pretties though :)
<nickr> nice
<chillywilly> wtf
<derek> um
<nickr> what you should do is do like spreadsheets do it
<chillywilly> it used to work
<derek> i made slight grd changes
<nickr> and say 'this item should be numeric' etc
<derek> i made the total in the middle column
<nickr> and then we can say at the HTML level 'numeric classed things are left aligned'
<derek> and right aligned it
<nickr> right alignd
<derek> nickr: good point and we could do number formatting in xslt if we so desired as well, though imagine that will happen in grd
<nickr> yea
<derek> jcater: scary thing
<jcater> derek: my plans on that were to
<derek> w/ nickrs html pretties
<chillywilly> For the long double type, the following 
<chillywilly> interface must be provided:
<nickr> well what you do is minimize or remove physical markup from grd, add all of that to after the grd
<derek> this report is nicer than what access makes
<nickr> the xslt, html, FO
<chillywilly> The function CORBA.long_double creates a new long double number from 
<chillywilly> a floating point number.
<chillywilly> The operation to_float of a long double number converts it into a 
<chillywilly> floating point number. For each floating point number f, 
<chillywilly> CORBA.long_double(f).to_float==f.
<nickr> hav the grd contain logical information about the stuff so you can use that as a hint as to how to format it
<chillywilly> The long double number has an internal representation that is capable of storing 
<chillywilly> IEEE-754 compliant values, with sign, 31 bits of mantissa (offset 16383), and 112 
<chillywilly> bits of fractional mantissa. If numeric operations are provided, they offer the 
<chillywilly> precision resulting from this specification.
<chillywilly> sorry, done
<jcater> have something like <field type="date" format="y-m-d h:m:s.i">2002-04-01 00:00:00.00</field>
<jcater> and the XSLT could take it as provided
<jcater> or if the locale preferred, could convert the format
<jcater> but the format="..." identified how the GRD has outputted it
<derek> btw: fire sandy that wench has negative foobulations :)
<derek> ?
<derek> im not too worried about that part yet
<jcater> but that's for a later "official" discussion
<jcater> :)
<derek> technically it might be preferred to make xslt do formatting
<nickr> I say remove all physical formatting from grd
<derek> but idealistically i dont want to lock us into xslt
<derek> so i woudl rather put the tag in grd and have our engine do it
<nickr> only provide logical information for the formatting side to use as hints
<derek> though it think when we get cooking we probably wont have anything but xslt
<jcater> nickr: to a certain extent, I agree
<jcater> but like I showed with my example, we'll actually
<jcater> output a format, but actually provide the mask used to create the format
<jcater> so the layout formatter can reformat the value if need be
<nickr> well thats different
<derek> ok one question jcater
<jcater> but that's for later
<nickr> thats char level formatting
<derek> currently how im doing transformations is
<nickr> I mean page level
<derek> with html.xsl
<jcater> nickr: so do I
<derek> and with pyxslt (a small program from DCL) :)
ra3vat (ds@ics.elcom.ru) joined #gnuenterprise.
<derek> i think pyxslt belongs in the gnue tree as its useful :)
<derek> where should i put these two files?
Action: jcater thinks common/scripts
<jcater> or create a subdir under utils/
Action: jcater thinks scripts, tho
<jcater> fwiw, I don't want to put TOOO much processing off into the XSLT
<ra3vat> hello all
<jcater> as it isn't exactly known for its speed
<jcater> i.e., transforms is one thing
<jcater> sorting and format masks are another
<jcater> ra3vat: howdy
<nickr> jcater: Yes, definitely do sorting and char level formatting on the grd side.
<nickr> but leave alignments and stuff up to the xslt based on type/class hints
<ra3vat> jcater: hello
<jcater> I don't fully agree w/that
<jcater> in principle, I do
<jcater> in practice, I don't
<nickr> why?
<jcater> well, at the moment we are looking at VERY simple tabulation reports
<jcater> in this case, sure, I agree
<nickr> Yes.
<jcater> but that's only a small piece of the pie
<nickr> Well.
<nickr> I'd say its possible to extend the conept to every level.
<jcater> there's several instances where I've needed right-aligned text
<jcater> or left-aligned numbers
<nickr> and I'll do my best to influence things that way. :)
<nickr> okay
<nickr> at least for most cases you should try to define a set of useful classes
<derek> jcater putting in scripts/
<jcater> however, I do agree that the "default" could vary based on type
<nickr> such as lineitem, total, etc
<derek> but i think html.xsl is a reports only thing
<jcater> i.e., the "default" for numeric might be right allign
<derek> is there a dir under reports that woujld be better
<derek> jcater: i agree
<nickr> jcater: Yes, I can agree that allowing the report to override the default behavior would be useful.
<jcater> there was
<jcater> hang on
<derek> type="numeric" align="right|left|center"
<derek> and if type="numberic" and no alight defined it right aligns or such
<jcater> derek: add that to samples/foobulations for now
<jcater> I may have it moved later on
<chillywilly> jcater: you should go to bed
<jcater> I could've sworn I had a directory for transforms
<chillywilly> so should I
<jcater> chillywilly: yes, you are right
<jcater> derek: anything else?
<jcater> I need to go to bed
<chillywilly> me too
<derek> um i think im good
<derek> i will put in foobulations
<derek> but it should at somepoint be moved to a transforms or something similar
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I had a directory structure for that
<jcater> but it isn't in cvs
<jcater> I may have forgotten to cvs add it
<chillywilly> I'm outty 2000

<derek> how is that new purdy style sheet for totals coming?
Action: derek is kind of having fun
<nickr> oh, you want totals marked up?
<nickr> the current structure counterindicates that
<nickr> the fact that there are align="" in there will prevent IE from rendering the class
<derek> ?
<nickr> you have like <td align="">
<nickr> if you were to make that <td align="" class="numeric">
<nickr> IE wouldn't pick up the class.
<derek> well i.e. sucks nuts
<derek> actually cant i do combo?
<derek> if switch to css inline
Action: derek doesnt remember syntax

<derek>         <td align=""></td>
<derek>         <td align="center">2002-04-03 00:00:00.00</td>

<derek>       </tr>
<derek> if you can whip me up some style sheet magic
<nickr> hm, that'd work I guess.
<ajmitch> hey
<nickr> derek: add tr.subtotal { background: black; color: white } to the stylesheet
<ajmitch> what's up all?
<derek> gack
<derek> that made the text disappear
<derek> for the subtotal rows
<derek> cause my type
<derek> er typo
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<nickr> hows that suit you?
<derek> not my taste
<nickr> hm
<derek> but at least i can tell what is what :)
Action: ajmitch pokes #gnuenterprise
<nickr> you might make the th's inverted like that
<derek> hey bitch that hurt
<nickr> and make the totals boldface
<nickr> font-weight: bold;
<nickr> see how that suits you
Action: ajmitch wonders who's trying to fiddle the books
<derek> spiffy
<derek> how do i make italic
<nickr> put it up?
<nickr> font-variant: italic; I think
<nickr> hrm
<nickr> I don't think thats right actually
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<nickr> ahh a little better :)
<derek> gack my section header is gone
<nickr> I'd make all the fonts sans serif myself
Action: ajmitch wonders where everyone is 
<derek> whew no worries, jason had different grd :)
<derek> um oh html master show me the way to sans serif and im there

<nickr> I think will do ya
<psu> nickr: sans serif fonts are for "easy reader" learing books
<psu> oh, and US academic texts ;-)
<nickr> indeed
<derek> hey reinhard what you think of the first gnue reports report 
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<reinhard> looks like a good starting point
<reinhard> i think dandy is missing
<reinhard> ;-)
<ajmitch> hi reinhard
<nickr> derek: maybe a slight mod to the borders to make them more liney, and box in the totals
<derek>         body {
<derek>           font-face: sans-serif;
<derek>         }
<derek> seems to have little effect
<nickr> indeed.
<derek> tell me what to change and i will
<derek> for the borders
<nickr> hrm
<psu> reinhard: what about randy?
<psu> that's always a good name to wind americans up with
<psu> (in English english, randy = horny
<psu> so US tourists called randy are always a source of innocent amusement)
<ajmitch> hehe
<derek> btw: reinhard the report is certainly lame but its really living and breathing
<derek> i.e. it actually gets its database from a database
<ajmitch> impressive
<derek> you have an .grd which is xml that is like a form to define what db and such to connect too
<derek> then it goes out gets the data and makes an outputted xml file
<derek> and we do an xslt translation to turn it into html
<derek> which is what the url is for
<derek> so while it might look lame and unimpressive it really is a pretty solid start
<derek> nickr: can probably attest to just in a few hours tonight it has made pretty decent progress
<reinhard> derek: yeah that's what i said
<nickr> derek: I'm toying it
<nickr> yes
<nickr> hrm
<nickr> nick.imeats/proj/gnue/monthly.html
<nickr> see how that strikes you

<ra3vat> ?
<nickr> nick.industrialmeats.com
<nickr> sorry
<ra3vat> seems http://nick.imeats.net is also related as it is something about food :)
<derek> hmm i was thinking thats what would look good
<derek> but now seeing it im not so sure
<nickr> it looks interesting
<nickr> but not great.
<nickr> looks better as is now
<derek> im thinking what if we killed all lines
<nickr> uh
<nickr> it'd look narsty
<derek> except for the one's above Total For XXX
<nickr> they eye would have nothing to follow
<nickr> Well see thats the problem
<derek> and bolded the NAME
<nickr> since you chose to put the class at the row level, theres no way to put a line there
<reinhard> derek: and below Total For XXX
<derek> reinhard: yes
<derek> i didnt choose jcater did :)
Action: derek knew he need to let him check that in :)
<derek> you cant do borders at tr level?
<nickr> No
<nickr> Unforutanely
<nickr> I don't think it considers trs block level
<nickr> which sucks.
<derek> and if i move things down to td level
<derek> we have issue of alignment
<nickr> Not really 
<nickr> what you do is generate classes
<derek> in about 2 seconds i just generated classes
<nickr> so you say 'this cell is a numeric right aligned' o you generate a new class taht has everything in a numeric except the alignment
<derek>       <tr class="item">
<derek>         <td align="" class="item">Sandy</td>
<derek>         <td align="center" class="item">2002-04-03 00:00:00.00</td>
<derek>         <td align="right" class="item">-203</td>
<derek>       </tr>
<derek>       <tr class="subtotal">
<derek>         <td align="" class="subtotal"></td>
<derek>         <td align="right" class="subtotal">Total for Sandy</td>
<derek>         <td align="right" class="subtotal">12</td>
<derek>       </tr>
<nickr> bah
<nickr> It won't render correctly like taht.
<derek> obviously would have to remove the align=
<nickr> Ahh I know how to do
<nickr> use a <span>
<derek> jsut show that the row type at td level now as wel las tr level
<nickr> derek: if theres an alignment value, put a <span align=""> around the data
<nickr> if not don'tt put anything
<nickr> that'd really be a better solution anyway
<nickr> more consistant with the background
<nickr> because whan you're doing with the span is *locally* overriding the hiting
<nickr> hinting
<derek>       <tr class="item">
<derek>         <td class="item">
<derek>           <span align=""></span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>         <td class="item">
<derek>           <span align="center">2002-04-03 00:00:00.00</span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>         <td class="item">
<derek>           <span align="right">63</span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>       </tr>
<derek>       <tr class="subtotal">
<derek>         <td class="subtotal">
<derek>           <span align=""></span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>         <td class="subtotal">
<nickr> yes, but leave the span out if theres no item or no align
<derek>           <span align="right">Total for Candy</span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>         <td class="subtotal">
<derek>           <span align="right">12</span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>       </tr>
Action: derek hasnt yet ventured into the if its blank thing
<nickr> leave the span out if theres no item or no align
<nickr> its a very simple <xslt:if thing
<derek>       <tr class="item">
<derek>         <td class="item"></td>
<derek>         <td class="item">
<derek>           <span align="center">2002-04-03 00:00:00.00</span>

<derek>       <tr class="subtotal">
<nickr> sweet!
<derek>         <td class="subtotal"></td>
<derek>         <td class="subtotal">
<nickr> how does it render?
<derek>           <span align="right">Total for Candy</span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>         <td class="subtotal">
<derek>           <span align="right">12</span>
<derek>         </td>
<derek>       </tr>
<derek> better?
<derek> dont know havent tried :)
<nickr> lets see it
<derek> grr everything left aligned
<nickr> ah, change the span to div
<nickr> div is block level
<nickr> and relook
<derek> after all this xslt i think i might some of my website stuff xml
<derek> and use xslt for it
<derek> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/monthly.html
<nickr> heh
<derek> div worked!
<derek> so now can we play cool stylesheets
<nickr> okey dokey
<derek> anyone know the entity for a newline char 
<derek> and for a tab
<nickr> you don't need those.
<nickr> oh
<nickr> for generating text output
<nickr> eh
<nickr> just put the leteral char in there?
<derek> ?
<nickr> I dunno. ;)
<nickr> Hrm
<nickr> check out my copy
<derek> getting close :)
<derek> hmmm i was able to core dump trying to do ascii :)
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<derek> ahh its text not ascii
<derek> my copy should match yours now
<nickr> except that I put a cellpsacing="0" in the <table>
<nickr> which makes it look right, but I'm trying to find if theres a css property to do that
<reinhard> silly question
<reinhard> is it on purpose that the total values aren't correct?
<nickr> ha hah!
<nickr> I am a mad html hax0
<nickr> check it out
<derek> jcater used to work for arthur andersen
<derek> dont blame him
<derek> he was trained to 'fudge' numbers
<nickr> all is revealed. :)
<derek> reinhard: subtotalling is not fully functional
<derek> we put in hard numbers for them so we could play with transformations
<derek> jcater will probably have them workign tomorrow
<derek> http://www.jovino.com/stuff/entities.html
<derek> seems to show
<derek> &#010; or &#013; as newline
<derek> i tried both separate and togehter with now luck :(
<nickr> thats the ascii yes
<nickr> you can just put literal new lines in with <xslt:text> can't you?
<nickr> <xsl:text> rather
<nickr> yes you can
<nickr> and you have to tell it that you're producing text output
<nickr> <xsl:output method="text" indent="no"/>
<nickr> then you can do like
<nickr> <xsl:text>
<nickr>   foo!
<nickr> </xsl:text>
<nickr> and it'll be \n  foo\n
<derek> can you check my page to make sure it looks like yours :)
<derek> i think i have it
<nickr> yep
<nickr> :)
<derek> smoking......................!
<nickr> looks better than crystal reports
<nickr> hah
<derek> but how do i do 'tabs'
<nickr> tabs yes
<nickr> hm
<derek> will they be preserved in xsl:text?
<nickr> I believe so
<nickr> its supposed to output literally whats in there
<nickr> you could probably put the entity for tab in a <text> ..
<nickr> &#09;
<nickr> or maybe
<nickr> &#009;
Action: nickr checks on that
<nickr> parsing dia files is fun :P
<nickr> xsl:value-of select="substring-before(substring-after(dia:attribute[@name='name']/dia:string,'#\'),'#')" />
<nickr> ah
<nickr> derek: you can put a tab char ($#009;) right into a <xsl:text>
<derek> so
<derek> <xsl:text>&#009;</xsl:text>
<nickr> yea
<nickr> at least it worked for me
<derek> didnt work here
<nickr> hm
<nickr> hmm
<nickr> lemme see
<derek> it does
<derek> damn variable names :)
<nickr> oh.
<nickr> heh.
<nickr> show us the money!

<dneighbo> you might find that interesting jcater
<dneighbo> reinhard: our co-op idea for bandwidth
<dneighbo> er re :
<Mr_You> I like the idea of public bandwidth, but seems spensive unless you are using super extended reach wireless
<Mr_You> then again, DSL equipment can probably be found cheap
<Mr_You> I would bitch locally if broadband wasn't available to me.
<dneighbo> jcater: the locals here are raving about gentoo linux
<dneighbo> which uses BSD like ports called portage
<dneighbo> i just found out its written in python :)
<jcater> yip
<dneighbo> could be interesting for gnue package management :)
<dneighbo> personally im not seeing the advantage over debian
<dneighbo> while compiling rather than usign binaries might give a minor advantage
<jcater> well, all the packages would be compiled optimized for your machine
<dneighbo> on some machines the compile times would kick your ass
<jcater> and honestly I had less issues w/FreeBSD ports than I have w/apt
<dneighbo> like ToyMan on bsd was saying that gnumeric took like over 4 hours to compile
<jcater> even though apt works the vast majority of the time
<dneighbo> as to optimization
<jcater> yeah, that was my big issue
<dneighbo> unless you are just a raw metal geeks im not seeing the huge difference
<jcater> ... compile time
<jcater> my understanding is its not uncommon to see a 10% gain
<dneighbo> i.e. kernels you can get optimized for you processor
<ToyMan> dneighbo: you don't have to compile, you can use pkg_add and get the binaries..
<dneighbo> ToyMan at which point its same as debian :)
<jcater> but i loved the FreeBSD ports
<dneighbo> im not saying ports is dumb
<dneighbo> i think its pretty cool
<dneighbo> im just saying if im a sysadmin
<ToyMan> except, that if you compile, it never breaks your system
<jcater> dneighbo: once there's Debian/BSD then you can argue "why not debian"
<ToyMan> which apt *will* do
<jcater> as a person who wants BSD wants BSD
<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> and my choice is slightly faster apps
<dneighbo> or a well supported platform
<dneighbo> its a no brainer
<dneighbo> i.e. i would have reservations putting gentoo on a production box
<dneighbo> as to BSD
<Mr_You> source packages are ok, but I don't see them as a requirement.. just untar heh
<dneighbo> i really prefer GPL licensing :)
<jcater> dneighbo: sure
<jcater> that's why debian makes sense for you :)
<dneighbo> i.e. as a sysadmin (which im not)
<dneighbo> i would use debian (or someother well supported distro)
<dneighbo> and if i had applications that needed 'performance' boosts i would compile them
<dneighbo> if i wasnt anti-BSD i would simply say install BSD :)
<dneighbo> jcater : i guess my gripe is one of practicality
<dneighbo> to me this kind of environment is like CS jerking off (as nickr would put it)
<jcater> dneighbo: I don't necessarily agree
<dneighbo> its good to see choices
<jcater> have you ever used a ports system?
<dneighbo> yes
<jcater> other than compile times, BSD ports was as good as apt
<dneighbo> not gentoo but bsd
<dneighbo> i didnt say it wasnt as good as apt
<dneighbo> my point is long compile time for minor performance
<dneighbo> makes little practical sense
<jcater> well, that was *one* point :)
<jcater> it really shines when you don't have packages for everything
<ToyMan> ports is quite a bit better than apt, apt breaks things, ports doesn't, that's a *big* diff.
<jcater> and you needed to install something else for source
<jcater> s/for/from
<jcater> then the ports shined over apt
<jcater> as they often worked with the custom installed thingy
<dneighbo> you dont want my answer there (remember im borderline socialist)
<dneighbo> if you dont have packages for what you want
<dneighbo> be a good debian citizen and make them :)
<ToyMan> with apt, I still ended up chasing dependancies, though not near as bad as with the rpm nightmare
<jcater> now, see you are then restricting usage to technically elite
<dneighbo> ToyMan i think you had some odd experience
<jcater> I can install something from source w/o a hitch
<dneighbo> in about a year with debian
<jcater> but I wouldn't begin to know how to package something for debian
<dneighbo> i think that apt has truly only broken something 1 or 2 times
<dneighbo> and have really never had a dependency issue
<ToyMan> dneighbo: I don't think so, the mail lists are full of people trying to fix apt-broken systems
<dneighbo> not that apt is flawless, it simple sucks less
<dneighbo> ToyMan : well i thought the same thing till lived in #gnuenterprise
<ToyMan> as i said *way* better than rpm
<dneighbo> nickr and jbailey showed me the way
<jcater> of course, I'm now an apt and debian fanatic (an ex-FreeBSD dude)
<dneighbo> i.e. generally if apt gets into any issues its just a matter of knowing more commands than apt-get to play
<jcater> but I still do miss some things :)
<dneighbo> maybe its a personality thing
<dneighbo> just almost everyone i know that uses BSD and now gentoo
<dneighbo> are know it all grab ass wannabe's
<ToyMan> hehe, that's me to the n'th
<dneighbo> who's number one cool factor is that they have a CUSTOM install
<dneighbo> ToyMan : you have been only exception to this :)
<dneighbo> i.e. i wont mention names
<ToyMan> how little you know...
<jcater> I might agree w/that on gentoo front
<dneighbo> but generally they are of the ilk that if you dont recompile your kernel daily
<jcater> but freebsd has one helluva user base
<dneighbo> and you arent running the most unstable of file systems
<ToyMan> oh, there's shitheads in every camp...
<dneighbo> you just dont know what you are doing :)
<dneighbo> ToyMan : agree
<dneighbo> actually the BSD's arent really like that
<dneighbo> im talking mostly gentoo crows
<dneighbo> er crowd
<jcater> dneighbo: to elaborate on your stereotypes
<dneighbo> and to a large degree the slack crowd had this mentality
<jcater> let me provide mine
<jcater> until I hooked up w/gnue
<ToyMan> heh, there's people over at #freebsd who would rip your head off if you came in talkin debian shit...
<ToyMan> but plenty of nice folks too
<jcater> I was a firm believer in the statement "Those who love unix, use BSD... those who hate microsoft use Linux"
<dneighbo> :)
<jcater> I strongly believed that based on many many observation
<jcater> s
Action: Mr_You reboots &
<jcater> but then jamest prooved me wrong :)
<dneighbo> linux users are generally the worst
<dneighbo> and debian developers are probably the rudest :)
<dneighbo> except the ones that seem to have found this channel
<dneighbo> but if my first experience with debian woudl ahve been #debian or a debian mailing list i wouldnt be using debian :)
<dneighbo> only thing that prevented me from being a BSD user was license
<dneighbo> i still plan on installing netBSD on my toaster this year ;)
<ToyMan> dneighbo: for me the proof is in the pudding, either there's a good community or there isn't... the license affects that, but it's only one factor
<jcater> I bought a DreamWeaver when they went to $50
<jcater> for the explicit reason of installing NetBSD on it
<dneighbo> rofl
<jcater> I'm not joking
<dneighbo> ToyMan : i think community is important
<dneighbo> but here is my take, for the most part i dont like the linux community
<jcater> err, I meant DreamCast
<jcater> not DreamWeaver :)
<dneighbo> but license is more important than community to me
Action: jcater doesn't think NetBSD even runs in an HTML editor
<ToyMan> community is the *real* thing (coke commecial music wells up in the background)
<ToyMan> for me just reducing it to the license is too theoretical and 'clean'
<ToyMan> reality is messy
<ToyMan> and things have unintended consequences
<dneighbo> :)
<ToyMan> and if there's a real living community, that's the best way to judge that all of the combined effects worked out for the good
<dneighbo> all things said, BSD is FREE
<dneighbo> so its definteily usable
<ToyMan> and their community and license has led to many good things in the world
<dneighbo> i just hate seeing good fruit put on the table for m$ or sun or whomever to take as their own and abuse their users with
<jamest> i proved you wrong?
<ToyMan> there will always be shitheads, it's an illusion to think a license will keep them from being shitheads
<jamest> little ol' me?
<jcater> jamest: yes
<ToyMan> it can help, though
<jamest> how so?
<jcater> I thought all linux ppl hated windows (and not that they loved unix)
<jcater> you proved to me that some linux admins simply hate users
<jcater> and could care less about windows
<ToyMan> heh
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> i hate it too
<jamest> users, windows, people in the fast lane driving slow
<jamest> it's all the same thing
<jamest> a target for my aggression
<dneighbo> i fall into the love unix category
<dneighbo> as i have writings from just a few years ago
<dneighbo> where i said i still preferred windows on the desktop
<dneighbo> i.e. i was 'curious' to unix
<dneighbo> but still preferred windows
<dneighbo> slowly over time i came to love unix
<dneighbo> and now since i still on occassion have to use windows i hate it because its not unix :)
Action: dneighbo really loathes fact that command prompt does not support tab autocomplete
<jamest> <derek>Windows is to die for.  Linux seems like a toy.  However with my guidence I'm sure I can make you losers produce something as truely great as myself.
<jamest> ....from my logs
<dneighbo> rofl
<dneighbo> everything is spelled right, im worried that really did come from a log
<dneighbo> oh wait guidence is wrong
<dneighbo> whew... scared me for a minute
<jcater> you forgot the next line
<jamest> that was right below the line
<jcater> <derek> until linux gets delphi, it's useless
<dneighbo> its has delphi
<jamest> <derek> Someone said you might be able to hook me up with some goat porn.
<dneighbo> jamest: thats the REAL reason im here
<jamest> i know
<dneighbo> you have no idea how hard it is to get goat porn on the net now that they have started cracking down
<jamest> that's another one for my scrapbook
<nickr> la
<nickr> free goat porn?
<jcater> nickr: yeah

<dsmith> nickr: But "*.tar.gz" will be *exactly* "*.tar.gz". The '*' won't be expanded.
<nickr> um
<nickr> dsmith: you mix up '' and ""
<nickr> "" expands variables and globs.
<dsmith> Hmm.
<dsmith> I don't believe you.
<nickr> I just tested it.

<nickr> etc.
<dsmith> "" does NOT expand globs.  In bash anyway.
<dsmith> Try an echo "*.mp3"

<nickr> thats in echo
<nickr> this is in for
<dsmith> Hmmm. Must be another level or someting in for
<dsmith> I think the for is expanding it.

<nickr> most likely
<dsmith>        for name [ in word ] ; do list ; done
<dsmith>               The  list of words following in is expanded, gener­
<dsmith>               ating a list of items.  The variable name is set to
<dsmith> Yep. Learn something every day.
<dsmith> I still say that "" doen't expand globs.

<drochaid> don't you just hate it when that happens?
<nickr> yes
<dsmith> for f in '*.whatever'; do something; done    works also. Cool.

<nickr> hah
<nickr> weird
<dsmith> It's re-expanded on each do.
<dsmith> When you quote it, you see what it really is.
<nickr> thats sort of odd.
<dsmith> When I used [$f] the shell tried to expand [*.ogg] .  But it CAN expand *.ogg .

<jcater> a human being what? being a tree?
Action: nickr makes soylent green out of rdean 
Action: rdean is apparently uncultured...has heard the term "soylent green" before, but never what it meant.
<nickr> uh
<nickr> whoa
<nickr> you are uncultured
Action: rdean is open to enlightenment, providing it doesn't take longer than 5 minutes (got a meeting to get to) :-)
<nickr> well there was a movie with Charlton Heston called Soylent Green
<nickr> one of those weird future movies he did during the 70s, (along with Planet of the Apes and Omega Man and probably others)
<nickr> oh that one where he's a racecar driver
<nickr> hrm
<rdean> okay...I'll look it up...doubt I'll ever find time to watch it, because by the time I get my kids in bed, I'm ready for bed (or am too engrossed in Jedi Knight...although I'm getting to the end of that)
<rdean> okay, gotta go....i'm getting paged.

<derek> can you define somewhat/
Action: derek is wondering what you want me to do next
<jcater> well
<derek> im thinking either play more with the xslt
<jcater> pay my bills?
<jcater> that'll free up some time for me
<derek> and get text working and gnumeric working
<derek> or test out all the new block/datasource triggers
<derek> if you are around and gnue'ing the later is probably better as it needs to be done and i will probably have lots of questions
<derek> if you arent really around i can probably play with transformations w/o much babysitting
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> I'd go w/transforms then
<derek> as to bills, if i could pay my own, i would consider getting yours paid :)
<jcater> as I'm not sure at this point
<derek> not sure if you are gnue'ing? or not sure about the triggers ;)
<jcater> gnue'n
