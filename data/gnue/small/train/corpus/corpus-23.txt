paqan (~paqan@202.155.120.221) joined #gnuenterprise.
<pradhap> jcater: if that listener is not the active listener it gives TNS Error: Unable to resolve the serivce name...
<jcater> active listener?
<pradhap> jcater: i mean the current listener...
<jcater> well, the listener has to be running in the Oracle server
<pradhap> jcater: but by default... the listener LISTENER will be created by the oracle installtion and will be running in the server...
<pradhap> jcater: and that listener will be used by the applications like sqlplus, etc.,...
<pradhap> jcater: but GNUe expects one with the service name that is been mentioned in the connections.conf...
<jcater> are you running SQLPlus on the debian machine, or on the server?
<jcater> if it's creating an actual listener called "LISTENER" , then you should be able to have that in your tnsnames.ora file on the client as well
<jcater> at least I think
<pradhap> jcater: now we are running both SQLPlus and GNUe on the server only...
<jcater> ah, ok
<jcater> when running on the server, sqlplus can use interprocess communications to talk with the server
<jcater> we can't 
<jcater> we can only do it via tcp/ip
<pradhap> jcater: Oh!!!
<pradhap> jcater: but i cannot find any entry related to listener in the tnsnames.ora.. instead there is a file called listener.ora, in which there is an entry for the listener LISTENER...
<pradhap> even though that listener "LISTENER" is running, GNUe expects a listener entry corresponding to the service name...
<jcater> ok
Action: jcater is thinking back to his oracle setup
<jcater> I am running Oracle in client/server
<jcater> nothing but oracle runs on the server
<jcater> everything else on the client
<jcater> are you running lsnrctl?
<jcater> my listener.ora only has a LISTENER= in it as well
<jcater> but my TNSNAMES.ORA has the database-specific ones listed
<jcater> and when I startup lsnrctl on the serer
<jcater> server
<jcater> it reads from that TNSNAMES.ORA file
<jcater> and starts listening for all of those databases/connection strings
<pradhap> jcater: yeah, i am running lsnrctl...
<pradhap> jcater: yeah you are right...
<pradhap> jcater: i did the same thing as you have said here...
<pradhap> jcater: tell me, will there be any problem if i run both GNUe client and the oracle server on the same machine???
<jcater> shouldn't be
<jcater> you'll still need a listener running though :
<jcater> :)
<pradhap> jcater: yeah, the default listener *LISTENER* is running...
<pradhap> jcater: inspite of it... GNUe expects a specific listener.. i dont know why.. :(
<pradhap> jcater: when i created *that* specific listener, it started working...
<pradhap> jcater: btw, is it possible for you to send your current tnsnames.ora, listener.ora and connections.conf to me, so that i can compare them with mine here???
<jcater> yeah
<pradhap> jcater: do you have my id???

<jcater> how can they check licensing for something I'm going to do?
<pradhap> jcater: this is the first time for me with oracle... :)

<psu> i.e. do they know a man who can 
<jcater> sigh
<psu> PHP on www.gnu.org
<jcater> that's retarded
<ajmitch> ouch
<jcater> I already indicated that it was gpl
<ajmitch> jcater: yes, as do a lot of people
<psu> or a "can't do that, can you find another way" msg
<ajmitch> but people seem to have a knack for missing copyright headers on source files
<ajmitch> projects that i've submitted have been rejected & told to resubmit, too
<ajmitch> do you have any code/forms/stuff for gnue-sb?
<jcater> no
<ajmitch> guess you have to explain that to them, then ;)
<ajmitch> ok, bbiab, shower time
<psu> tar -z /dev/null/
<revDeke> jcater: its a licensing thing
<revDeke> ok im going to go off
<revDeke> we are the ONLY son of a peter murphies to even get copyright assignment
<revDeke> and now they are worried one of our SUB PROJECTS might not have good license?
<jcater> I don't think they even read them to be honest
Action: jcater thinks they are like SprintPCS... assume it's not right the first time
<jcater> :)
<psu> revDeke: it's sorta like we try to play by the rules 
<psu> but still get this "bad boy" image
<psu> like a soccer hardman defender trying to do charity work at the children's hospice ;-)
<ajmitch> also rudy just started on assessing projects :)
<jcater> it's not that I care that he wanted clarification on something
<jcater> but geeze, it took several days to get that
Action: jcater worries how long it'll take to get an ok
<ajmitch> if you saw the pile of projects that are in the submission queue...
Action: jcater thought that's what they wanted
Action: ajmitch wonders when jbailey will be around

<revDeke> oh you said red satin
<revDeke> never mind you must have provisioned for that ;)
<jcater> return it?
Action: ajmitch wonders how long this gpg keygrabbing will take ;)
<jcater> these are homemade ones :)
<ajmitch> i think that going 4 levels deep in the web of trust will grab me far too many keys
<chillywilly> then stop that shit
<ajmitch> would only grab a few million, i guess
<chillywilly> sheeeit
<ajmitch> since for each key, it grabs the keys of those who've signed
<chillywilly> fncky butt lovin'...
<chillywilly> er, funky

<revDeke> i have an active account

<revDeke> had 'issues'
<ajmitch> yeah
<jcater> ajmitch: bsd-suckz
<revDeke> my stuff got reset
<revDeke> i never reset it
<jcater> I think that's their password
<ajmitch> that's what i'm fixing for someone now

<ajmitch> revDeke: could you send a mail about it to accounts@gnu.org, with your ssh 2 key attached, signed with gpg
<ajmitch> means that it gets in the 'system'
<StyXman> hi alll
<ajmitch> hi StyXman
<revDeke> grrrr
<revDeke> never mind
<revDeke> this is the problem
<revDeke> barrier to entry is too damn painful for gnu
<revDeke> i finally did get pgp installed and working
<revDeke> i have ssh keys somewhere
<revDeke> but i use all this so rarely i never remember so i have to set aside two hours just to get an account
<ajmitch> heh
<revDeke> friggin AOL is less painful
<ajmitch> it's quite simple
<ajmitch> you send them your ssh public key, you can then login with ssh
<revDeke> so is a root canal
<revDeke> but it doesnt make it fun to tolerate
<revDeke> nor convienent
<revDeke> sometimes i think gnu stands for GNU's Not Userfriendly
<ajmitch> you're probably just different from most GNU developers who have an account there :)
<ajmitch> i can use your ssh key from savannah
<ajmitch> or maybe not..
<revDeke> i will go through official steps
<revDeke> ajmitch: that is the problem they want all developers to be the 'same'
<revDeke> i.e. emacs/autoconf/unproductive folk
<revDeke> that is my #1 gripe
<ajmitch> so how would you prefer to get an account there?
<revDeke> not all people are the same.  it would be like me saying jcater is a crappy unproductive coder because he uses kate instead of emacs
<revDeke> ajmitch: honestly
<revDeke> i would like to pick up phone or email and say i need an account here is the user name
<ajmitch> unfortunately they've found they have to deal with security now
<chillywilly> why would the savannah passwd be BSD sucks?
<revDeke> and have someone call me back with a password or email/irc me the password asking me to change it asap
<revDeke> btw: thats how i did it originally i picked up a telephone and called someone and they called me back 10 minutes later with a password
<revDeke> and get this
<ajmitch> that's probably the way it used to me
<revDeke> i had an account in 10 minutes
<ajmitch> s/me/be/
<revDeke> SHOCK
<revDeke> CRAZY
<revDeke> INSANE
<ajmitch> anyway, i have to run off now, goodbye all, bbl
<revDeke> btw: this isnt a gripe on you
Action: ajmitch just looked at clock
<revDeke> just in general
<revDeke> :)
<chillywilly> seems to me that the Hurd hackers are more BSD influenced than "Linux", imho
<jcater> poor ajmitch
<jcater> he's the unofficial representative of gnu here :)
<chillywilly> ajmitch: what do you think?
<jcater> chillywilly: /me was referring to license :)
<jcater> not kernels
<chillywilly> yea, I figured as much but I feel like arging with you
<chillywilly> so live with it ;)
<jcater> chillywilly: no
<jcater> I disagree

<chillywilly> jamest: what you say?

<jcater> can't hear me over the slowness of your microkernel?
<grib> nickr: hurd is actually way, way non-traditional.  it's pretty funky in fact.  
<jcater> should I speak louder? :)
