<ratmice> there is an existing python objc class that would need porting
<ajmitch> gnustep & gnue? what?
<ratmice> someone here mentioned it hours ago
<ajmitch> ah
<ratmice> that it would be nice
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ratmice> the gnustep projects gorm and gnue form designer implement similar ideas
<ratmice> if gorm could be extended to output gnue-form xml definitions and applications that'd be nice..
<ratmice> it has it's own database library
<ratmice> doubt it supports as many things as gnue
<psu> us and Zope are the big boys when it comes to backend d/b support in python
<psu> If there's a pyfoo driver out there for any database
<psu> no matter how obscure
<psu> we've probably heard of it ;-)
Action: psu wonders if there is a py driver for native M$ Access
<psu> not that it really matters 
<ratmice> with odbc.. 
<psu> in that if you are having to use M$ Access w/GNUe
<psu> being stuck with odbc is probably the least of your problems...
<psu> Part of thr reason for seperating the GNUe d/b abstraction into GNUe Common
<psu> was so other projects could pick it up & re-use
<ratmice> but, I tought my mother how to use it over the phone... :)
<psu> if they felt so inclined
<ratmice> by that i mean make a database and some queries
<ratmice> looks like it should work if i can figure out this setup.py thing
<psu> ratmice: if you are using CVS, use the ./setup-cvs.py instead 
<psu> if tarball release, you are on right track
<ratmice> actually trying to compile pyobjc
Action: psu guesses we're not the only project to have a setup.py ;)

<chillywilly> hello
<ariel_> reinhard: i'm workink on an analysys of the class repository, when i finish i will submit a document to feedback
<reinhard> ariel_: analysis?
<chillywilly> hey does syslog.conf execte everything that macthes?
<reinhard> you mean a proposal
<chillywilly> er, log to everything that matches the selector?
<reinhard> my understanding of analysis is to describe something that is already there
<chillywilly> I want iptables output to only go to one file
<chillywilly> not spewed on the screen and /var/log/messages like it does now
<chillywilly> although I added: kern.=info			/var/log/kernel.info, but it doesn't even seem to write there
<jbailey> Does appserver actually do anything yet?
<chillywilly> i have iptables log with log-level info
<chillywilly> sure
<reinhard> jbailey: yes
<reinhard> jbailey: it passes all data requests through to the database
<ariel_> more a note to discuss, it will contain a class diagram, how the classes are stored as tables, how a simple example (say base+baber+cardealer+..) will fill the tables.r
<reinhard> and has a very very basic function for calling methods
<reinhard> ariel_: great
<reinhard> ariel_: thanks for informing me, i just planned to start something similar
<ariel_> can you read openoffice format?
<reinhard> eahm...
<jbailey> reinhard: Okay, cool.  I just want to make sure if I go throught he effort of packaging it that it's not a waste of time.
<reinhard> i have a pc where i can :)
<reinhard> jbailey: not sure about that
<reinhard> it does nothing "useful" now
<reinhard> it's more like an empty box that can be filled afterwards
<reinhard> the only reason i see it would make sense to package it is
<jbailey> I'm not so concerned about the usefulness.  I just want it to somewhat work as advertised.
<reinhard> for "marketing" reasons
<chillywilly> nobody can help with syslogd?
<jbailey> chillywilly: No, sorry.
<reinhard> chillywilly: don't think so
<reinhard> chillywilly: only thing i found out is
<chillywilly> I think it will do all that match
<reinhard> that some messages can be turned off by dmesg command
<chillywilly> that's not what I want ;)
<chillywilly> I want to route some loggin elsewhere ;)
<reinhard> ok
<reinhard> well the feeling i got from your question was anyway
<reinhard> that you have a much better understanding of syslogd than me :)
<reinhard> jbailey: it does work as advertised IMHO
<reinhard> as we advertised it as "very early proof of concept" :)
<jbailey> Excellent!

<ColeMarcus> hi guys.  Anyone from germany, and knows if there is a localysed version of gnue availabale for germany, and that the output is accepted by the finance office
<chillywilly> lupo!
<lupo> ColeMarcus: there is the general possibility of translating gnue. as we have 3 german-speaking developers or project-watchers, this is quite possible
<lupo> concerning the output
<lupo> output which is useful for the tax office has to be generated by program packages, i.e. the general ledger, which are not yet implemented
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<lupo> ToyMan!
<ToyMan> howdy
<ColeMarcus> hmm and some simple   xml (or simmilar)output, i can render myself a document , print it out and give it to the finance office. Can this easily solved or do i need a huge time to deploy this
<lupo> no general problem
<jbailey> Nivada didn't legalize pot.  Weird.
<lupo> GNUe reports takes xml and transforms it to various other formats. You can always take the raw XML and do with it what you want.
<ColeMarcus> ;)
<lupo> jbailey: That discussion has been going on for months now in Germany - the Green party wants it legalized
<lupo> What a crap - they just want to do legally what they've done illegally for the last 20 years ;)
<lupo> Nothing against pot. but the discussion shows a lot of stupid points on the conservative side
<lupo> ColeMarcus: what do you want to use GNUe for?
Nick change: reinhard -> columbo
<jbailey> lupo: I just figured that Nivada of all of them would legalize first.  It's likely to be decriminalized here in Canada, and acc. to the news I just heard, doctors want to be able to prescribe heroin.

Action: lupo thinks that Frankfurt sucks
<ColeMarcus> hmmmm  :( 
<ColeMarcus> lupo you know any existing alternatives on linux that are still ready to use?
<lupo> There are still NOLA and SQL Ledger
<lupo> I plan to use NOLA for a medium business solution
<ColeMarcus> hmm ill have a look at NOLA ( while still keeping an eye on gnue;) perhaps for later use ).  SQL Ledger is  webbased only as i know, which i dont realy like 
<lupo> NOLA is also web based
<ColeMarcus> hmm
<lupo> So you see why GNUe exists :)

<jamest> a real quick demo would be to run one of the wizards

<jamest> i can step you thru it but I'll be a bit choppy on responce times
<jamest> oooooo, that reminds me, cvs designer wizards are not happy at the moment
<jamest> i haven't looked into why as they haven't worked quite right since I returned to coding
Action: jamest is subtly implying that they were broke before I got back so I didn't do it :)
<dsmith> Well, I tried the .debs on www.gnuenterprise.org.  They want me to install a date package from somewhere.
<dsmith> Is the egenix-mx-base-2.0.4 the right package to get for that?
Action: jbailey is away: dr meeting
<jamest> dsmith: i thought it would autoload dependencies
<jamest> hmmm
<jamest> on woody you need

<dsmith> Well...   I already have that.  Lets start over.
<dsmith> When I run gnue-designer, I get:
<dsmith>    This GNUe tool requires mxDateTime to be installed
<dsmith>    You can find the mxDateTime at 
<dsmith>    http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/mxDateTime.html
<dsmith> Is that because I have 2.2 of pythin installed?
<dsmith> Hmm. actually, I have 2.1 and 2.2 installed:
<dsmith> ii  python2.1          2.1.3-11           An interactive object-oriented scripting language (v
<dsmith> ii  python2.2          2.2.2-1            An interactive object-oriented scripting language (v

<ariel_> we have a type 'key' (old auto) that is translated to a db specific type, may be serial, int4 or whatsoever
<ariel_> now a primary key has 2 functions:
<ariel_> 1) enforce uniqueness of rows
<ariel_> 2) be referenced by foreign keys of other databases
<ariel_> suppose i have a table with a field that references the primary key of another table
<ariel_> i want that field to have the same type of the pk in the other table

<ariel_> if i declare it of type key may be this is translated to serial (that i don't want since it is only a foreign key)

Action: jbailey is back (gone 00:39:12)

<ariel_> what is your opinion?

jcater (~jason@w202.z065105010.mem-tn.dsl.cnc.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> ariel_: key != serial
<jcater> there should be an auto="" that makes it serial

<StyXman> hi siesel
<jamest> StyXman: i dunno

<StyXman> well, with just adding...
Action: jamest has been gone too long to recall
<StyXman>       '_parameters': app._parameters
<siesel> hi StyXman.
<StyXman> to the attributes hash passed to loadXMLObject in GFParser.loadFormm
<StyXman> fixes it
<jcater> um
<jcater> that doesn't seem quite right
<jcater> reports doesn't do that
<jcater> hmmm
<siesel> StyXman: IMHO the parameter stuff is already fixed by removing the parameter caching in forms.
<siesel> but I could be wrong.
<StyXman> well, the orginal code assigns the parameters when calling instance.setForm
<StyXman> that's too late to read parameters in on-startup, as is done after the whole loadForm (with all the inits run) is executed
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I have that one fixed in my local copy

psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> siesel: relatively so
<jcater> I mean, not tomorrow
<jcater> but real soon
<jcater> I've already started on
<jcater> it
<jbailey> Funny, I'm just reading the website to figure out what integator is. =)
<jcater> I think my latest stuff is in cvs
<jcater> siesel: one of the biggest things I'll need to do next
<jcater> (That I haven't even started on)
<jcater> is a CSV / Flatfile dbdriver
<jcater> even a simplistic one
<ajmitch> gadfly not gonna cut it?
Action: Chipaca remembers DBD::CSV
<jcater> as my plans for integrator are primarily mapping from source datasources to destination datasources
<jcater> ajmitch: this isn't actually to run apps against
<jcater> I need to be able to load CVS files into my database
<jcater> and dump them from my database
<jbailey> ajmitch: Aren't you studying?
<jcater> for our vendors
<jcater> I certainly wouldn't plan on running forms against a CSV file, although it would be possible I suppose....
<jcater> :)
<ajmitch> jbailey: yeah, got my monitor on still tho
<ajmitch> ah, i see
sfb- (mattr@chew.exelus.net) left irc: "[BX] This BitchX's for you"
<ajmitch> shouldn't take too long to do something 
<ajmitch> when do you need it by? :)
<jbailey> jcater: Cheaper to do it against CSV then, say, an XML flatfile. =)
<StyXman> Chipaca: yes, sorrily this ain't perl...
<jbailey> At least you could mmap the CSV file and get some decent performance out ofit.
<StyXman> but I like python a lot more than perl...
<Chipaca> StyXman: yes. But DBI kicks butt :)
<ajmitch> jcater: i can try & start on one tomorrow if you'd like, not sure how you'd declare field names & stuff like that tho
<ajmitch> as it would be useful for me as well
<siesel> jcater: For me Mapping between databases and especially some kind of rule engine is important.
<jcater> ajmitch: that's part of my hangup
<jcater> I'm wondering about having a child node of datasource
<jcater> <datasource type="flatfile">
<jcater>   <flatfiledefinition> 
<jcater>     ....
<jcater> but am not sure
<jcater> the best approach
jamest (~jamest@leibniz.math.ksu.edu) left #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> for something quick & dirty, just name them 'column1' or 'field2', etc
<ajmitch> would allow for conversion
<siesel> if the flatfile dbdriver is just used for loading csv into integrator, why should we define special names for the fields
<ajmitch> agreed
<siesel> wouldn't a "field_1", "field_2" etc. be enought?
<ajmitch> as i said :)
<jcater> I don't think it will necessarily be 1 way
<jcater> but that's fine too
<jcater> field_1 would work 2 ways
<ajmitch> some CSV files may have headers
<ajmitch> iirc
<jcater> s/2/both
<jcater> ajmitch: most loading software I see
<jcater> have a "skipFirstRow" option
<ajmitch> yep
<ajmitch> that first row may contain field names if you're lucky
Action: siesel would like to put all that stuff (skipFirstRow, delimiter....) into the connection.conf file
<jcater> that's workable too
<ajmitch> could be a good idea 
reinhard (~reinhard@M693P020.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: "'Hardware' defines as the parts of a computer system that can be kicked"
<jcater> let's do that
<ajmitch> i'm thinking of using CSV to import online banking records
<ajmitch> http://www.object-craft.com.au/projects/csv/ could be useful (if you can access it :) )
<siesel> what about writing? Should read+write access be supported. (that would mean to rewrite the file after a COMMIT)
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> so this will be a standard db driver? i'll give it a go tomorrow for y'all
<jcater> siesel: that's what I'm thinking
<ajmitch> ah yup, my bank has the first row as:
<ajmitch> Date,Amount,Payee,Particulars,Code,Reference,Tran Type
<jcater> I can see two options
<jcater> 1. skipFirstRow=0|1
<jcater> or
<jcater> 2. useHeadersAsFields
<jcater> or soemthing like that
<ajmitch> go for 2
<jcater> (they don't have to be exclusive
<jcater> )
<ajmitch> true
<jcater> err
<jcater> actually
<jcater> skiprows shouldn't be boolean
<jcater> it should be an integer
<jcater> as I've gotten some funky stuff frm vendors before
<jcater> esp. when they aren't using a real application
<jcater> but are instead doing in a spreadsheet and saving as cvs
<jcater> s/cvs/csv
<siesel> what about "firstRow=skip|fieldnames|data"
<jbailey> Is there plans for GNUe to provide an interface to creating databases/manipulating schemas?
<jcater> designer
<jcater> siesel: and default to "data" ?
<jcater> works for me'
<siesel> ok.
ajmitch (~me@wlg1-port38.jetstart.maxnet.co.nz) left irc: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)
<siesel> ehm. ... IMHO the Integrator Proposal speaks of converting data from a datasource into XML, move it into a RULE ENGINE and export the XML into a datasource again.
<siesel> the RULE ENGINE is quite similar to a XSLT tranformation for me.
ajmitch (~me@wlg1-port38.jetstart.maxnet.co.nz) joined #gnuenterprise.
<ajmitch> bother
<ajmitch> silly linux 
<siesel> So I would like to add a module, which does kind of XSLT transformations, but is written in python, to common.
<jbailey> 'kind of'?
Action: ajmitch asks for logs to see what i missed :)
<jbailey> What's wrong with regular XSLT?
<siesel> So reports could use it too. 
<siesel> nothing
<jbailey> Use an XSLT namespace....
<jbailey> Like, if it's presenting as XML, you could just use <xsl:*> tags to embed commands in.
<siesel> I would just like to fake XML to the RULE ENGINE, because I don't think that it is good to convert huge database tables to XML just for fun.

<chillywilly> I like gnome 2
<chillywilly> it is my beotch

<jbailey> Perhaps you would get along well with the author of this textbook.
<jamest> physical contact?
<jbailey> physical contact.  heads and feet can be used for sexual activity.
<jbailey> Some might even be into pain.
<jbailey> And there's a few people for whom that might be their *preferred* sexual contact.
<jbailey> But not many. =)
<jbailey> Any DCL evangelizors here?

Action: jbailey pokes Derek.
Action: jamest hands jbailey a bat
<jamest> try this
<Maniac> evangelizers?
Action: Maniac sings the praise of DCL
<jbailey> http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2002-11/msg00122.html and the descending threads seem to indicate that folks there want to switch from Gnats to Bugzilla.
<jbailey> People (and by this, I generally mean Derek) who would prefer that they use DCL should probably speak up.
<jamest> I'm pretty happy with DCL for our bugs
<jbailey> I just don't have time to explain to them why it's a good idea to use it.
<jbailey> (Partially because I dno't actually use DCL for anything)
<derek> jbailey: im a dcl evangelizer
<derek> BUT its more 'work order' oriented than software bug oriented
<jbailey> Ah, okay.
<derek> i.e. there are several features missing that would make it better
<derek> but i think it does pretty darn good
<jbailey> derek: I just figured that if you felt DCL was up to it, you could poke your head it.
jcater (~jason@w202.z065105010.mem-tn.dsl.cnc.net) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<derek> PLUS with most software you hope you are doing more new work
<derek> than fixing bugs
<derek> and i think DCL is FAR superior in task management
<derek> but weaker in bug management (though it does an ok job of this)
<jbailey> (Uh oh.  Derek is in an uppercase mood)
<derek> if 'versioning' stuff was beefed up a bit it would be pretty good
<derek> bugzilla is great for version management, but its really bad for end users to deal with (imho)
<derek> i.e. its daunting to deal with unless you use it religiously
<jbailey> I know several people with the same complaint.
<derek> Remosi: csv driver, i personally wouldnt make it as complex as is talked about (well to a degree)
<jamest> derek!
<jamest> you have mysql running?
<derek> as i think there is a difference between 'integrator' and 'csv driver'
<derek> jamest: i think so but im on way out
<jamest> i need a person with mysql running to test some stuff for me
<derek> just was logging out and i saw my name and bat
<derek> sos thought i shsould investigate :)
<jamest> i felt the love?
<jamest> s/i/and
<derek> i can test when i get home in a few hours

<marioct> hello people, I need some help with Sample examples....  
<jamest> i'll try and help
<marioct> good night jamest.
<jamest> what do yo need?
<marioct> I need SQL Sample tables. Where can I get it ?
<marioct> To run zipcode.gfd
<jamest> where is this sample located?
<jamest> samples/zipcode/zipcode.gfd?
<marioct> yes.
<jamest> is this cvs or a release?
<marioct> is a release... 
<jamest> hmmm is there not a pg_zip_code.sql file in the same directory with it?
<marioct> no there isn't !
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> ok
<jamest> create table state
<jamest> (
<jamest>   state char(2)                 PRIMARY KEY,
<jamest>   description varchar(30)       NOT NULL
<jamest> );
<jamest> create table zipcode
<jamest> (
<jamest>   zip char(5)      PRIMARY KEY,
<jamest>   city varchar(30) NOT NULL,
<jamest>   state char(2)    NOT NULL REFERENCES state
<jamest> );
<jamest> then quite a few lines like
<jamest> INSERT INTO state (state, description) VALUES('AL','Alabama');
<jamest> INSERT INTO state (state, description) VALUES('AK','Alaska');
<jamest> INSERT INTO state (state, description) VALUES('AZ','Arizona');
<jamest> but you can enter these directly into the form so no need to run them
<marioct> ok, very thanks... :)
<jamest> no problem
<marioct> but, I need more one table called samples ?!?!?!
<jamest> we really need to get our samples in better order
<jamest> what database are you using?
<marioct> Mysql .
<jamest> ok, I'm not a mysql user so I'm not going to be much help
<jamest> but i'll try
<jamest> you really don't need our samples if you've installed designer
<marioct> What can I do ? I have gnue-designer
<jamest> in your connections.conf file setup an entry for your database
<jamest> [gnue]
<jamest> comment = Production DB(G)
<jamest> provider = psycopg
<jamest> host = gnue
<jamest> dbname = gnue
<jamest> replacing the provider with the database you're using 
<jamest> provider = mysql
<marioct> yes, I setup connections.conf to run with mysql.
<jamest> ok, cool
<jamest> run designer
<jamest> gnue-designer
<marioct> ok
<jamest> file->new->from wzard
<marioct> ok
<jamest> lets do a simple one to start
<jamest> Simple Form Wizard
<marioct> cool
<jamest> run that
<jamest> do you see a title entry box
<jamest> and a dropdown with a list of connections available?
<marioct> ok... login required, I enter username and pass... 
<jamest> lol, you're in better shape than me
<jamest> i need to setup 0.4.0 real quick
<marioct> I'm trying to understand this gnue... :)
<marioct> now, I'm  on a screen named : Select Base TAble/Source
<jamest> do you see tables listed?
<marioct> one moment, I forgot to create tables. :)
<jamest> you can create any tables you like
<jamest> if you already have data in a database feel free to use it
<marioct> I'll create a sample table.
<jamest> let me know when you're ready to contine
<marioct> I'm ready. now "Select Fields to include" !
<jamest> ok select the fields you want to have visible on your form
<jamest> then click add
<jamest> on the bottom of this listing is an Arrangement method
<jamest> pick any of them you like
<marioct> ok.
<jamest> grid is kinda handy for few field tables
<jamest> but not huge tables
<jamest> then click finished
<marioct> ok. cool..  Now I have a form on my screen
<jamest> file save 
<jamest> just in case
<marioct> ok
<jamest> now we can exit 
<jamest> we'll come back to it in a sec
<jamest> once back at the prompt gnue-forms yourfile.gfd
<marioct> exit gnue-designer ?
<jamest> sure, or we can play some if you'd like?
<jamest> i was going to have you run the form
<jamest> but lets go ahead and make some changes
<marioct> you rule !
<jamest> double click on any field on the screen
paqan (~paqan@202.155.120.221) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jamest> now in 0.4.0 there is a nasty bug that prevents a person from changing a property in the Property Inspector if a scrollbar is present on the Property Inspector dialog
<jamest> you have to get creative and stretch the box really, really long
<marioct> ok..
<jamest> using the alt-key left mouse drag to move the dialog 
<jamest> or whatever you windows manager supports
<jamest> once the evil scrollbar is gone 
<jamest> do you have a property called case?
<marioct> yes, is the first one.
<jamest> you should be able to open up a dropdown box here and choose upper
<marioct> cool..
<jamest> you should also have a maxLength property
paqan (~paqan@202.155.120.221) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> and a property called required
<jamest> if you turn on required then you cannot save changes unless you've filled this value
<jamest> it's a UI based NOT NULL
<jamest> if you're a sql person that is :)
<marioct> how can I turn REQUIRED on ?
<jamest> double click and set to true
<marioct> sorry...  double click :)
<marioct> what is DisplayMas??
<jamest> it's a displayMask
<jamest> but not functoinal in 0.4.0
<jamest> pretend it's not there :)
<marioct> hehe :)
<jamest> however you can go down to typecast
<jamest> and it'll implement some rather crude input masking
<jamest> plus it prevents the user from entering the wrong type of data in the field
<jamest> btw - what platform you running on?
<marioct> linux.
<marioct> and you ?
<jamest> debian linux
<marioct> me too debian.
KeithJagrs (trilluser@63.74.24.9) left irc: "later"
<jamest> you apt get this thing?
<jamest> we have our repository on our server
<marioct> not really,. I wget, and dpkg -i .debs
<marioct> my apt-get isn working...
<jamest> and I think jbailey pushed snapshots of our cvs into  sid
<marioct> I will reinstall debian on my machine in decenber...
<marioct> so apt-get will work again.
<jamest> anyway please save your form fairly often
<jamest> designer is, um, how do you say....fiesty
<marioct> ok....  and where is the databsae connection ?
<jamest> it'll work wonderful long enough for you to forget it's pre 1.0 then blam
<jamest> exit designer and run
<jbailey> blue?
<jamest> gnue-forms yourfile.gfd
<marioct> haha.. but ... what is fiesty ?
<jbailey> jamest: Yes, yesterday's snapshots.  Should be at your friendly neighbourhood mirror.
<jbailey> but only common, forms and designer.
<jbailey> The others will follow later, and will likely be from yesterday's snapshot so that I have a known working base.
<jamest> 1 chiefly Southern & Midland a : full of nervous energy : FIDGETY b : being touchy and quarrelsome
<jamest> from w-m.com
<marioct> ohh...  it doesn't work.
<jamest> er
<jamest> m-w.com
<jamest> what is your error?
<marioct> there are one screen of error messages...
<jamest> i only need the last few lines
<jamest> is this in forms or designer?
<marioct> in forms.....
<marioct> DB000:     AttributesNSImpl(newattrs, {}))
<marioct> DB000:   File "/usr/lib/gnue/lib/python/gnue/common/GParser.py", line 249, in startElementNS

<jamest> ah crap
Action: jamest didn't want to do this to you
<jamest> you a coder?
<marioct> I know C++ not phyton... yet. :)
<jamest> our wizards got a little wierd in the 0.4.0 release  (please note the last .0 on there :)
<jamest> cool
<jamest> edit the gfd file
<jamest> anyone that groks c++ can grok gfd :)
<marioct> hahaha..
Action: chillywilly is grokking some c++ right now
<jamest> in there you'll find some tags named <option>
<jamest> what do they look like
<marioct> wait a minute please... i think I make a mistake....
<marioct> I ran another .gfd...
<marioct> Now I run the correct .gfd and I received this error message...

<marioct> DB000: TypeError: unsupported operand types for +
<jamest> argh!
<marioct> After, gnue-forms asked username and password....
<jamest> this means that the file /usr/lib/python2.1/site-packages/MySQLdb/cursors.py has issues
<jamest> at least with our code
<jamest> I imagine this is part of the mysql database driver?
<jamest> outside of ours which would be in /usr/lib/gnue/lib/python/gnue/common/dbdrivers/mysql
<jamest> sigh, what debian you running?
<marioct> 2.2 potato.
<marioct> release 6.
<jamest> ok
<jamest> with source installed python2.1?
<jamest> or woody .debs for python 2.1
<jamest> or other :)
<jbailey> potato?  Are you not able to upgradE?
<jamest> he's upgrading in december
<jamest> his apt-get is broken
<marioct> I will upgrade in december.. :) with backups in hands...
<jamest> marioct: jbailey is our debian maintainer.....please refrain from feeding him and keep your hands on this side of the bars
<jbailey> Or if you feed me, please get *vegan* donuts.
<jbailey> They're rather hard to come by, sadly.
<marioct> :)
<jamest> we just have to let you run a form
<jamest> in samples/intro/intro.gfd
<jamest> that form does not require a data connection
<jamest> and it shows off triggers, buttons and such
<marioct> I have a lot of .debs for python... 2.1.3-3
<jamest> pages, etc
<jamest> a person can tinker with it in designer to their hearts content
<marioct> I don't have this file :)
<jamest> intro.gfd didn't make it in?
<jamest> argh!!!!
<marioct> haha.
Action: chillywilly slabs jbailey with a trout
<jamest> 0.5.0 is looking very much like it's going to be a no new features only cleanpu and docs release
<marioct> Docs, is very good for new person like me..
<jamest> cvs has some nice docs
<Mr_You> and GNUe-SmallBiz release?
<jamest> in openoffice format
<jamest> Mr_You: that's a derek question
<Mr_You> ok, its not in CVS yet
<jamest> marioct: you up for trying CVS?
<jamest> or do you buy the bandwidth by the byte?
<Mr_You> I think it would do GNUe some good promoting the release of SmallBiz..
<Mr_You> is someone doing freshmeant.net (was going to correct, but its kinda funny) ;-)
<Mr_You> freshmeat.net
<marioct> I'm up, but not now.... I have to sleep, it is 1a.m here in Brasil 
<jamest> oush
<jamest> ouch
<jamest> where are our samples in the .debs?
<Mr_You> if no one is doing freshmeat.net updates I could volunteer.
<jamest> i can mail you intro.gfd if you like
<chillywilly> oush! that hewrtz
<marioct> I downloaded from gnue page.
<jbailey> Hmm..  I don't remember if the samples wne into the tarball.
<jamest> sigh
<marioct> if you can.....  mario@mitus.com.br
<jamest> i leave for a few months.................
<jamest> and it's as big a mess as when I was around the first time :)
<marioct> haha.. I'm feeling ....  I'll be here (IRC) tomorrow night...
<jamest> sent
<jamest> ok, have a good, um, night
<marioct> Do you always come here ?
Action: jamest hangs head in shame
<jamest> yes
<marioct> I'll try more with gnue-designer and forms... If I need some help... :)
<jamest> ok
<jamest> if you can get cvs
<jamest> or if you like I can mail you an openoffice doc or pdf
<jamest> of a designer guide for forms that jcater is working on
<jamest> a tutorial of sorts
Action: jbailey cries
<jbailey> Why doesn't MS Access love me?
<chillywilly> don't hang your head, hold it p with pride!
<jamest> jbailey: it loves you
<chillywilly> the goats cannot defeat us!
<marioct> if you can ... Send -me this stuff by e-mail.
<jamest> it's just in a "you shouldn't have been walking alone in the alley at midnight" kind of way
<marioct> thanks again...  tomorrow I have numerical calculus lessons.... :)
<jamest> marioct: ok, i'll try and get a pdf made tonight

<jbailey> ROAR.  Forms display differently than table rules.
<jbailey> This isn't worth the 10 marks!
<jamest> what?
<jbailey> I'm doing a school assignment.  I have to do it in access. =(
<jamest> dude
Action: jamest is feeling pity for jbailey
<jbailey> And 10% of the mark is on extra features and such.  "Use of a Query, Input Form or Report or use of Field Attributes, ie: Input Mask, Caption or Default Value."
<jbailey> I have managed to avoid learning access for almost a decade!
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> use gnue
<jamest> then show it running on unix, windows, and OS X
<jamest> that's an extra feature! :)
<jbailey> Ah yes, but probably a 0 for me.
<jamest> well, yeah 
<chillywilly> schools are lame
<chillywilly> they always make you learn useless crap
<jbailey> Yeah, well.  work offered it under my training budget, so hey.  Do it while the option's there.
<jbailey> I'm registering for 3 university classes this month. =)
<jamest> ahhhh
<jamest> another dcl ticket bites the dust
<SachaS> what do you guys do to boost your motiviation ? hack gnue :)
<jamest> um, not hack gnue for a few months
<chillywilly> jbailey: well if yo don't have to pay then it is all good ;)
<SachaS> i am short of sleep as I installed a new usb all-in-one printer under cups last night
<chillywilly> it took all night?
<SachaS> and it is working :)
<chillywilly> yay :)
<SachaS> thank you chillywilly :)
<chillywilly> for what?
<chillywilly> I didn't help
<chillywilly> ;P
<jamest> NOTE: the GParser now honors the Required and SingleInstance attributes in set in the G*Paser.py files
<chillywilly> wooo
<jamest> so if some app starts not loading files complaining about multiple instances or required tags missing
Action: chillywilly should finish the parser for godl, but I have other *stupid* things to do...
<jamest> then check that apps G*Parser.py file 
<jamest> let me rephrase
<jamest>  if some app starts not loading VALID files
<jamest> :)
<chillywilly> heh
<jamest> do we have any mysql users here?
<jamest> here mysql user, here mysql user
<jamest> i won't trash your db , honest, i need to install it

<jamest> ok, now I need to admin it
<jbailey> Keep in mind that I'm studying something else right now - specific questions good.  General statements will probably remain unanswered.
<jamest> ah, cool
<jamest> all I want is an easy way to admin the thing
<jamest> setup a test user, test database, and test tables
<jamest> mysql permissions always seem like a complete mess to me
<jamest> so
<jamest> is there a .deb package for something that will let me do this easily
<jbailey> phpmyadmin
<jbailey> God's gift to MySQL administration.
<jamest> lol, ok, so I have to install apache and php on my workstation
Action: jamest has decided to just take it like a man and learn how to do it manually
<jbailey> *blink*.
<jbailey> You don't have apache loaded?
<jamest> on my personal workstation?
<jamest> at home?
<jamest> no
<jamest> i don't even have it on my database/file server
<jamest> no need
<SachaS> jamest: i use apache alot to access html manuals.
<jamest> i just point konq at the html file I need
<jamest> i think I'm there
<jamest> lol
<jamest> bugz
<Mr_You> man I'm reading this book about an Aikido Sensei... when they were learning they use to go test their skills against cocky gangsters and such
<Mr_You> in the book they describe one scene with 30 gangsters (they were expecting 4 or so)

<chillywilly> O'Sensei
<Mr_You> some guys would come back from the dojo showing how they got beat up the night before and the following night they'd be out there looking for someone to pick a fight with them ;-)

<chillywilly> I was trying to get all the iptables output to go to only one file
<Mr_You> I have read Japanese Yoga / Shin Shin Toitsu Do
<chillywilly> instead of to any terminal and kern.log
<jamest> ok
Action: Mr_You has www.japaneseyoga.org ;-)
Action: Mr_You bows to jbailey.
<chillywilly> although only thing that now works is to the screen
<chillywilly> jamest: you want my syslog.conf?
<jamest> not yet
Action: jbailey bows to Mr_You
<jbailey> onageishemasu (sp?)
<jbailey> Time to go home.
<jamest> chillywilly: you want all other kern loggin to still go to console though?
<Mr_You> onegoshimasu (sp?) heh
<chillywilly> jamest: well wherever it goes now
<chillywilly> whatever the debian default is
<chillywilly> see I set my rule swith --log-level info
<chillywilly> then tried this line at the top
<chillywilly> kern.info     /var/log/iptables
<chillywilly> it created the file but it remains empty
<chillywilly> but even kern.* /var/log/kern.log isn't getting appended too either now
<chillywilly> it used to log to console and kern.log before I started mucking about
<chillywilly> at any rate if you have some sys admin guru setup for syslogd that you cold part with that would be appreciated
<chillywilly> could
<jamest> not for something like this
<chillywilly> oh
<jamest> the only thing I've done w/ syslog is route to remote host
<jamest> hang on a sec
<chillywilly> wwhatver.whatever   @host
<chillywilly> right/
<chillywilly> ?

<jamest> yeah

<chillywilly> ok

<ajmitch> sighm only about 7GB free here
<chillywilly> how about you ajmitch, know anything about making iptables log to a file via syslog?
<chillywilly> man, this doesn't make any sense
<chillywilly> mutt is diaplying the mails but the headers are all empty
<chillywilly> WEIRD
<chillywilly> if I select a new one it tells me it cannot copy the message'
<chillywilly> maybe a perms thing
<chillywilly> *sigh* this blows
<Mr_You> chilly, you tried sending kern.debug and other priorities to other log files?
<chillywilly> nope, but if I set the log-level it should work shouldn't it?
<chillywilly> I dunno I didn't have time to play with it frther
<ajmitch> depends
<Mr_You> I think you want to config other kern.=debug (=info,=blah) lines in the syslog.conf and see which debug levels send to which priorities (debug, info)
<Mr_You> or I think someone mentioned maybe a later version having an option to log elsewhere
<chillywilly> yea, someone said I could do --to-log file.log
<chillywilly> but I didn't see that in the iptables man page
<Mr_You> might be a newer version
<chillywilly> one would think that sid would have a newer version of iptables
