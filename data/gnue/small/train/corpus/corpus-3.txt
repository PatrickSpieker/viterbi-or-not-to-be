<Arturas> Hello guys :)
<Arturas> i have one idea about i18n (internationalization) - why i doesn't work in forms
<Arturas> now we create all data (labels & etc.) as strings, encoded in UTF-8
<Arturas> UTF-8 is unicode variable-width encoding
<Arturas> the problem was that standart ASCII characters (ASCII code < 128)
<Arturas> were displayed correctly
<Arturas> and other characters (national characters)
<Arturas> were displayed incorrectly
<Arturas> and there was no idea
<Arturas> why were displayed incorrect symbols
<Arturas> there is possibility
<Arturas> UTF-8 is variable-width encoding
<Arturas> that means that all characters that fall in standard ASCII range (ASCII code < 128)
<Arturas> have "one-to-one"
<Arturas> [i don't know the word in English]
SachaS_away (sacha@203.190.196.228) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<Arturas> "[A] in UTF-8 is [A] in ASCII"
<Arturas> and so for all characters what code are <128
<Arturas> theoretically this was thought
<Arturas> to enable read at least basic text without any i18n characters if you have no UTF-8 support
<Arturas> in forms
<Arturas> when we have i18n character
<Arturas> that's width is 2 bytes
<Arturas> (if it's width would be 1 byte, that would be "synonim" for ASCII)
<Arturas> (and it's code would be both in ASCII and UTF-8 < 128)
<Arturas> it is displayed incorrectly
<Arturas> i think it is possible
<Arturas> that 2 byte width i18n character in form
<Arturas> is considered as two one-byte width ASCII characters
<Arturas> that's why we get so strange results and constant results
<Arturas> forms work perfectly with one-byte width characters
<Arturas> if we go in localization
<Arturas> we can have forms display
<Arturas> local characters (real i18n characters; correctly)
<Arturas> but these would be encoded not in UTF-8
<Arturas> but in, for example, koi8
<Arturas> iso-8859-13
<Arturas> or even iso-8859-1
<Arturas> but this is one-byte encoding, not unicode
alexey (Alexey@195.151.214.33) left irc: "[x]chat"
<Arturas> i'm not sure about this, but i guess that Aditya has not made support for UTF-8
<Arturas> but only support for his local one-byte width fonts
<Arturas> hope i expressed myself clearly enough
<Arturas> comments?
<ra3vat> may be his fonts are not one-byte width as he did much more then me
<ra3vat> with one-byte encoding there are not much problem just setting everithing up properly
<ra3vat> agreed with above how it is interpreted now
<Arturas> his fonts had to be one-byte width
<Arturas> lower part of font
<Arturas> (<128)
<Arturas> was basic ASCII
<Arturas> and upper part (>128)
<Arturas> his countries charset
<Arturas> his country's charset
<Arturas> he had had the same problems as we
<Arturas> if his fonts were real unicode
<Arturas> (although i might make a mistake here :)
<ra3vat> i think forms works properly with utf or unicode strings right now
<ra3vat> we should look closely on wxpython and system level
<Arturas> somewhere in their docs found short and interesting string that
<ra3vat> properly in internal representation
<Arturas> 'unicode is not yet fully supported' :(
<ra3vat> can give a link?
<Arturas> hm
<Arturas> wxwindows
<Arturas> sory
<Arturas> www.wxwindows.org
<Arturas> and then they
<Arturas> offer to download documentation
<Arturas> in different formats
<Arturas> :/
<ra3vat> ok and there is differences between linux and w32 status of that support i think (derek gave an reference to this also) 
<Arturas> may be no
<Arturas> may be not
<Arturas> linux as well as w2k support unicode
<Arturas> i think it might be their wxwindows problem
<Arturas> not of the base-system
<ra3vat> the reference was to wxpython problem that encoding=wxFONTENCODING_UTF8 is not supported yet under linux
<ra3vat> that's why i'm trying to test it under w32

<dneighbo> ?
<jamest> you just wanting to see whats in the files?
<dneighbo> no
<dneighbo> i have a python program

<dneighbo> i basically looking for somethign in python that given prefix*.txt for a dir
<dneighbo> can give me back a list or dictionary of files matching that patter
<dneighbo> n
<jamest> in unix the *.txt is expanded prior to being passed to the program

<jamest> myfoo *.txt
<dneighbo> jamest: not on unix
<jamest> is passed as

<Arturas> something like "cmd dir C:\*.txt|type"
<nickr> that'd be pretty unportable
<Arturas> unportable to what?
<nickr> anything other than windows
<Arturas> => to linux?
<nickr> anything other than windows
<jcater> that's pretty portable imho
<jcater> it's just overkill for unix
<Arturas> ok, how many OSes do you know exept for win and nix to support GNUe?

<jcater> but overkill isn't the same as unportable

<jamest> download the rescue and root floppy images
<jamest> boot from resuce
<jamest> put root in when prompted
<jamest> configure network and select it as the source for your files
<dneighbo> will it do apt via network?
<dneighbo> so this is all via conf files
<nickr> dneighbo: get the netinst CD
<dneighbo> netinst CD?
<nickr> dneighbo: search for woody netinst CD, hownload the image (30 megs), burn it, boot it
<jamest> yes apt over network
<jamest> if you can do that why not grab the real deal?
<jamest> the 2 floppy approach is 1.44*2 MB :)
<nickr> the real deal is 8 x 600 megs
<jamest> lol
<jamest> true
<nickr> actually to netinst woody you need 6 disks
<nickr> well, I guess the have a 4 disk one
<dneighbo> you have a url
<nickr> floppies
<nickr> dneighbo: don't you know how to use google? you are such a baby. Just a sec.
<dneighbo> dont worry not for me having to tell someone :)

<nickr> don't worry about the nasty warnings, the people I've suggested this method to have had good luck with it
<Arturas> :) funny problem - how do i cat all files in the folder and in all subfolders?
<nickr> yep
<nickr> find . -print |xargs cat
<Arturas> and if i want find some string in the files, so i have to add "|grep strin"?
<Arturas> and if i want find some string in the files, so i have to add "|grep string"?
<nickr> er
<nickr> yea
<nickr> Unless you only want to cat files with specific strings
<Arturas> ? what do you mean by 'specific string'?
<Arturas> i'd like to fing one string
<Arturas> somewhere in files
<Arturas> so i do cat
<Arturas> for all files
<Arturas> and grep for the cat
<nickr> probably
<nickr> it'd be better to do find . -print | xargs grep "string"
<nickr> because that will print out tnhe file name also
<nickr> what is your obsession wil catting files?
<Arturas> that's one nix command for viewing contents of file that i know
<Arturas> so
<Arturas> i'm using what i know :)

<Harald1> am I right, that gnue depends on python > 2.1? If yes should I report code whose only purpose python 1.5.2 compatibility is via dcl as a ticket or as a wo, or shouldn't I do anything?
<dneighbo_> i dont understand the question
<dneighbo_> gnue depends on python 2.0 2.1 2.2
<dneighbo_> i.e. > 1.5.2
<dneighbo_> 2.2 python has some bugs
<Harald1> and GConfigParser.py contains code which is only needed for 1.5.2
<dneighbo_> gotcha
<dneighbo_> um submit it as a ticket probably
<dneighbo_> or work order
<dneighbo_> either way would be fine
<Harald1> ok
<dneighbo_> were you one i told to send patches via dcl?
<dneighbo_> if so send to info@gnue.org as well because dcl gateway appears to be eating attachments
<Harald1> one can send patches via dcl?
<dneighbo_> well there is way to include 'attachments'
<dneighbo_> to workorder/tickets
<dneighbo_> so if you find a bug and fix it
<dneighbo_> submit it as a bug and attach the patch
<dneighbo_> then when patch applied ticket can be closed etc
<dneighbo_> but for somereason attachments arent working quite right and i havent had time to look into it

<chillywilly> you lazy bum
Action: jcater looks around
<jcater> me?
<jcater> I do have concerns about people submitting bugs against cvs head
<jcater> as that's a given :)
<chillywilly> it's just a good way for you to keep track of them ;)
<chillywilly> muwaahahahha
<jcater> I'd prefer to handle it like I handle it here at work
<jcater> "um, yeah... well, just email me"
<jcater> 6 months later
<jcater> "what email? I don't recall an email?!!?"
<chillywilly> heh
<jcater> "besides, 90% of the time, it's a user error... just try again"
<chillywilly> quality work
<jcater> well, actually I get away with it here at work
<jcater> because usually the "bug mysteriously disappeared and has never happened again"
<chillywilly> a BTS should be more than just users reporting bugs, I think it should be more like a TODO type thing for developers too ;)
<jcater> iow, they did something wrong the first time and won't admit it
<jcater> um, yeah
<ajmitch> morning
<jcater> afternoon
<ajmitch> howsit?

<chillywilly> ok, I am taking a chance but you guyys have to tell me what's shitty about this logo --> http://frell.dyndns.org/~danielb/
<chillywilly> ;)
<jcater> is that a bird taking a crap?
<chillywilly> uh?
<chillywilly> it's the liberty bell silly
<jcater> dude
<jcater> that seriously looks like a yellow bird
<jcater> providing some, um, droppings
<jcater> incidentally, don't rip off our logo :)
<jcater> that's not nice
<jcater> the "Free Your Enterprise" :)
<chillywilly> how's that your 'logo'?
<jcater> ok
<jcater> sales mark
<nickr> its a tagline not a logo
<chillywilly> I thought it was somethign different
<chillywilly> Free Software For Your Business
<jcater> well
<chillywilly> it's not yours then is it?
<jcater> I've been saying "free your enterprise" for over a year
<ajmitch> after watching the matrix? 'free your mind...'
<jcater> I've also said "putting the free back in free enterprise"
<jcater> then from that, I came up with "free your enterprise"
<chillywilly> when?
<nickr> saying something and having it be a servicre mark or trademark aren't the same thing :P
<jcater> nickr: in the US, sure it can
Action: jcater is well-versed in trademark law
<nickr> jcater: only if you use it as a trademark in business afaixk
<chillywilly> sue me then
<jcater> that's a big component of my responsibilities :)
<jcater> nickr: he was
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> I don't believe you said it before anyone else
<nickr> but you weren'
<nickr> t
<jcater> I was using it in a non-profit capacity
<chillywilly> the second one I heard you mention before
<jcater> and who said I wasn't using it in a business?
<jcater> I'm not... but I was curious why you assumed that :)
<nickr> beceause you are trying to claim trademark on it
<jcater> trademarks don't have to be owned by companies
<nickr> I never claimed they did.
<chillywilly> they have to be registered don't they?
<jcater> a "registered trademark" has to be registered
<chillywilly> or mayeb just in use
<jcater> just defended
<chillywilly> show me some proof where the damn thing is used in some capacity
<nickr> regular trademarks have to be defended
<jcater> a trademark has to be defended
<jcater> hence, I was defending it :)
<chillywilly> I am insulted that you accuse me of ripping off 'your' slogan
<jcater> it's a slogan I donated to GNUe
<jcater> at least as far as I'm concerned
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> bah, I thought of it plenty of times, it's nothing new
<jcater> I still say the torch looks like a little birdie taking a crap
<chillywilly> the toch does?
<chillywilly> er, torch
<jcater> ya
<chillywilly> why did I even bother asking you anyway?
<jcater> beats me
<chillywilly> everyone else seeems to know what it is
<jcater> but I was giving you an honest answer
Action: jcater will have to remember to not give honest feedback to chilly as he can't handle it
<chillywilly> oh please
<chillywilly> where's the bird at?
<chillywilly> in the flame or something?
<jcater> sigh
<chillywilly> I don't see a 'bird'
<jcater> the yellow flame
<jcater> looks like a bird mooning everyone
<dneighbo_> um jcater you will hate FSF
<chillywilly> inside it?
<dneighbo_> one of the requests brad has for dcl is 'nagware' :)
<jcater> see the fluffy tail
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> nagware?
<dneighbo_> i.e. you can set a 'date' on a ticket and have it notify you if the date passes
<ajmitch> ooh
<chillywilly> oh
<dneighbo_> so people can set nags to tickets
<jcater> if that happens on ash, I'll use my mighty r00t poweres
<dneighbo_> so not only can they give you work
<dneighbo_> they can be reminded when you arent doing it :)
<chillywilly> ban nagware now (tm)
<ajmitch> nagware good! nagware good!
<drochaid> NAGWARE NAGWARE NAGWARE NOW !!!!
Action: ajmitch is saying this from a users perspective ;)
Action: drochaid returns to the corner
Action: ajmitch gives drochaid a cheer
<jcater> seeing as to how most of the stuff in designer's BUGS file is pre-0.1.0, I definitely don't want nagware
<jcater> :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> jcater: you just need nagware with an option to disable ... or ostricise

<chillywilly> and jcater you're just going to have to get everyone to raise a stink before I will stop using it

<chillywilly> I can't even remember last week half the time
<jcater> chillywilly: I think that's unprofessional and rude... but I expect no less :)
<jcater> it sounds like something ximian would do
<dtm> hi all
<jcater> howdy
<ajmitch> yo dtm
<dtm> werd
<dtm> HOW ARE YOU GENTLEMEN
<chillywilly> no one deemed it an 'official' slogan and you bet your ass if it was anywhere on tyhe web site I wouldn't use it, but somehting someone said once in IRC doesn't seemt o count much for me as I didn't come to the slogan thinking oh people said this beofre so I'll go steal it
<ajmitch> dtm: WE ARE FINE THANKS
<chillywilly> and to assumke so like you said the first time is insulting
<chillywilly> but I can find a different one to make people happy
<jbailey> dtm: <AOL/>
<chillywilly> jcater: but I just proved your inital claim to be incorrect so my mission is complete ;P
<jcater> bah
<chillywilly> go look your damn self
<jcater> I'm still not so sure
<chillywilly> if you don't believe me
<jcater> but I'll take it at your word
<jcater> as it's not exactly worth arguing over
<chillywilly> I just greedd through the logs
<chillywilly> er, grepped
<jcater> I've been here longer than those logs, btw
<jcater> but that's fine
<chillywilly> and I've been here longer than you
<jcater> my whole point was that it was a GNUe thing
<chillywilly> and I have all the logs in my stash
<jcater> and I thought it improper for you to use for your thing
<chillywilly> sure, and I renig it then
<chillywilly> I will not use it
<jcater> and I'll concede I might not be the first
<chillywilly> but I didn't some to it through a GNUe thing
<chillywilly> just thoguht it sounded cool
<jcater> it does
<jcater> which is why I wanted GNUe to use it :)
<ajmitch> so we have agreement then?
<jcater> yes
<chillywilly> then put it up on the site as the current slogan sucks
<ajmitch> ok, every kiss & make up
<jcater> neither of us like kiwis
<jcater> that's the agreement
<jcater> right chillywilly?
<chillywilly> right

<dneighbo_> btw: jcater started the phrase and mr you completed it 
<dneighbo_> so you are right there
<dneighbo_> BUT jcaters point was it was a gnue slogan, not necessarily that he said it
<dneighbo_> furthermore looking back at the log i like nickr's slogan
<dneighbo_> <nickr> GNUe doesn't smell like ass
<ajmitch> ah, still good to have an argument, right? ;)
<ajmitch> hehe
<jcater> rofl
<jcater> I missed that slogan
<jcater> I like it too
<jcater> how about"

<chillywilly> fuck them up their stupid asses
<dneighbo> i have talked to linas about this before
<dneighbo> i wont state his opinion as its in the archives publically now :)
<dneighbo> but its a humorous discussion
<ajmitch> why can't GNUe have a decent flamewar?
<dneighbo> we did
<dneighbo> just no one from gnue was involved :)
<chillywilly> uh?

<jcater>  really really wanna zigazig ah
<jbailey> Ah.
<jbailey> Spice girls.
<jcater> jbailey: what's the protocol for requesting that a library be added to debian?
<jcater> or do you have to find a friendly maintainer and wine & dine them?
<jbailey> jcater: Get a Debian Developper to build the package and upload it.
<jbailey> Or build the package yourself and find a sponsor.
<jcater> ah
<jcater> ok
<jcater> I may try that route
<jbailey> But it won't happen between now and Woody's release.  I think they've blocked new packages for now.
<jbailey> Which library?
<jcater> the python bindings for Sablotron (an XSLT processor)
<jcater> sablotron is in woody
<jcater> and the perl and php bindings are there
<jcater> but no one did the python ones :(
<jbailey> I'd offer, but I don't speak snake.
<jcater> I may give it a try... it'd be good for me to learn :)
<jbailey> =)
<jcater> btw, I'm not gonna complain about woody being locked down :)
<jcater> if that brings us closer to a release
<jbailey> *lol*
<jbailey> No kiddin'
<jbailey> I think the release manager isn't enough of an asshole
<jcater> is there a really good place to learn how to do debs
<jcater> like for redhat, the "extreme rpm" book was good
<jcater> or something like that
Action: jcater has mostly regressed his redhat memories
<jcater> is the "Debian Policy Manual" readable?
<jcater> or is it like most policy manuals?
<jbailey> It's like most policy manuals.
<jbailey> There's a reason it takes so long to get through the DD process.
<jcater> I don't doubt it
Action: jcater was hoping he could just do a deb package and send it to one of the big python packagers and hopefully he'd like/approve and upload for me
<jcater> is that a reasonable goal
<jcater> or do I have it all backwards?
<jcater> ewe
<jcater> after reading thru the manual
<jcater> maybe I better stick to gnue gruntwork
<jbailey> *lol*
<jbailey> If I spoke snake better, I would've had gnue packages up.  I still can't get gnue-f to run.

<derek> can you make that a work order
<derek> and then add a time card against it
<derek> and close it
<derek> i want to make sure anything you do for gnue is getting in dcl
<derek> so that we can make sure you are getting compensated properly by m

<ajmitch> yo jbailey
<jbailey> Yo ajmitch!
<ajmitch> finally got a new hard drive running
<jbailey> Cool.
<ajmitch> means i can dump the 8GB drive in another box, then use the 6GB drive just for GNU/Hurd
<ajmitch> better than the 450MB partition it currently has ;)
<ajmitch> how's the Hurd going with the change to libio?

<jbailey> Quite well.
<jbailey> Marcus has a whole slew of packages built now, and the CVS for glibc-2.2 now does the right thing without special patches.
<ajmitch> excellent
<ajmitch> so you got it past the crashing when trying to run anything? :)
<jbailey> Yeah. =)
<jbailey> And marcus had uptime last night of like 12 hours.
<ajmitch> pretty good
<jbailey> There was another weird hang that he could kill, so he had to reboot, but so far that's really good.
<ajmitch> anything for mere users yet?
<ajmitch> masochistic users, that is ;)
<jbailey> There we go. =)
<jbailey> Actually, Marcus has built X, so if you felt like testing it, sure. =)
<ajmitch> heh, pretty good
<jbailey> There's a tarball.  You need to update the glibc in order to get apt running, but after that we're in good shape.
<ajmitch> i'll wait until DSL is up
<ajmitch> then i can download stuff at slightly faster speeds :)
<jbailey> Cool.
<jbailey> When will taht be?
<ajmitch> dunno, maybe next week sometime
<jbailey> Nice.
<jbailey> Perhaps by then we'll be uploading stuff to the main Debian archive.
<ajmitch> got the modem sitting here
<ajmitch> cool
<ajmitch> the dsl modem won't work in the Hurd until there's usb support :)
<jbailey> I just emailed BenC to ask him to fix the Debian package for libc0.3 support.
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> you been doing much for GNUe lately?
<jbailey> I have some not-finished debs for DCL.
<ajmitch> ok cool
<ajmitch> i need to get into packaging
<jbailey> I'm trying to decide if I Should automate database selection and creation, and whether that's an abuse of debconf.
<jbailey> It's a hard question.
<ajmitch> yeah
<ajmitch> so who wants to be DCL maintainer? :)
<jbailey> I will be.
<jbailey> It was placed up for adoption and I've announced my intention to adopt it already.
<ajmitch> alright then
<jbailey> Although, we could probably co maintain it.  Now that I think about it, those patches have gone in.
<ajmitch> doesn't worry me too much
<jbailey> Maybe we should get a debian-gnue@lists.debian.org setup for good group discussion, and do the uploaders thing.
<ajmitch> would be useful
<jbailey> Do you have time to organize that?  I don't for a little bit.
<jamest> that would rock
<dnWork> feel free to use the gnue-dev list
<jbailey> But the we can bring all of the Debian packages under that group.
<dnWork> we will be making a new product in DCL
<dnWork> called 'packaging'
<jbailey> dnWork: The advantage of a Debian list just ofr packaging is visibility.
<dnWork> so deb, rpm, exe etc tasks can be put against it
<jbailey> while you're different, most upstream folks tend to chew a new asshole in people who report packaging bugs to them.
<ajmitch> jbailey: yeah, how would i go about getting a list organised?
<jbailey> ajmitch: Excellent question!
<jbailey> That's part of why I say I don't have time to do it right now. =)
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> i'll look into it when i get time :)

<Arturas> morning :)
<dneighbo> i love the gnucash list
<dneighbo> rate they are going they will demand smoething like gnue for personal finances :)
<dneighbo> i.e. sql database with middle ware via RPC
<dneighbo> etc etc etc
<dneighbo> i did just convert all my finances there
<dneighbo> what is funny
<dneighbo> they have NO budgeting
<dneighbo> and the reporting sucks
<dneighbo> i would suspect rather than retooling the backend for the 10th time
<dneighbo> it would make more sense for them to fix other parts :)
<jcater> I plan to use GNUe for personal finances?
<jcater> what's the big deal?
<jcater> plus then the wifey can use it on her Win98 machine :)
<jcater> and I can use it on my palm pilot
<jamest> i use wife for personal finance
<jcater> and hell even view via a web interface while I'm at work

<chillywilly> was you cable modem havign issues before?
<chillywilly> s/you/your/
<^chewie> no
<^chewie> I installed a new kernel at work and decided it'd be easier just to kill everything
<^chewie> ;-)
<^chewie> embrace the inevitable
<Arturas> Hello chillywilly :)
<chillywilly> I mean drochaid
<chillywilly> was his cable modem having issues
<chillywilly> hi Arturas
<chillywilly> last night he kept disconnecting and reconnecting
<chillywilly> over and over
<nickr> thousands of times
<drochaid> chillywilly: I think NTL were having a few serious routing issues
<drochaid> someone should have banned me for a while :/
<chillywilly> heh, well I am not worthy of having ops in here or some shit
<drochaid> maybe openprojects.net needs some onjoin flood protection
<chillywilly> well lilo is the guy to talk to as he runs things here
<nickr> there was slight delays
<drochaid> aye, but so many joins per hour should still suggest a prob
<chillywilly> it would probably have to be at a higher frequiency to be considered a join flood
<^chewie> sed rocks
<^chewie> just a random thought for you all ;-)
<drochaid> awk & sed are rather nice together
<nickr> pipeline tools in general rock
<^chewie> though I look at awk and think "ick"
<drochaid> that's what I think when I look in the mirror ...
<chillywilly> hey now
<^chewie> it's nice and small and allows basic flow control, but python is so much nicer
<nickr> awk has a specific purpose as does python
Action: drochaid thinks everyone should program in oberon 2
<^chewie> heh
Action: nickr is fairly sure everyone should program in Intercal
<nickr> that way, programmers would make a lot more money, and it'd keep dumb people out of programming

<chillywilly> dneighbo: how's it his fault?
<dneighbo> and if he denies responsibility then i just shift the blame to jamest
<nickr> dneighbo: well, the guy who packaged them hard coded the debian temp diroctry rigcht into setup.py, I'm fairly sure this is the wrong thing to do
<chillywilly> blame me
<chillywilly> blame me!

<chillywilly> yay!
Action: drochaid blames the fact he can't afford a Halberg-Rassy HR62 on chillywilly

<chillywilly> they are doing run-time testing of a class to amke sure it implements the interface?
<chillywilly> no
<chillywilly> this is form the python cookbook
<chillywilly> er, from
<Arturas> have to go :)
<Arturas> have a good time ;)
<Arturas> bye
<^chewie> hmm, time for lunch now that I figured out the whole network connections problem
Arturas (arturas@gsk.vtu.lt) left irc: "ircII/tkirc"
<chillywilly> I guess the only thing I don't get there are the asserts
<^chewie> btw, as an aside note for the Linux users in the bunch, don't enable CONFIG_INET_ECN, the Explicit Congestion Notification
<chillywilly> any python gurus can help?
<^chewie> you will run into hosts that'll refuse you connections
<chillywilly> I don't think I have that turned on in my kernel
<nickr> chillywilly: I say 'don't worry about it becaus you don't need to use those features'
<chillywilly> I just like to understand the code, but looking in my python refernce manual is sysa if those assertions prove false and AssertionError exception is thrown
<chillywilly> so it makes sense now
<chillywilly> hey i think I get their example stack interface now too
<jcater> that's truly ugly python code dude
<chillywilly> I just love the broken english descriptions
<chillywilly> jcater: hey python masta
<chillywilly> jcater: yea, just a bit ;)
<jcater> howdy
<jcater> I have a simpler stack:
<jcater>  myStack = []
<chillywilly> but not after you read it a million times
<jcater> pretty impressive, eh?
<chillywilly> this is an 'Interface'
<jcater> and just as functional :)
<chillywilly> not a tack in itself
<jcater> I got that :)
<jcater> looks like they are trying to turn python into java
<jcater> if they wanna do that, just use java to begin with :)
<chillywilly> only reason I am looking at it is that ODMG has several interfaces that I'd like to create python bindings for
<chillywilly> s/tack/stack
<chillywilly> I suppose it is unnecessary
<chillywilly> you just write the class and write the methods all in one swoop ;)
<chillywilly> screw interfaces
<chillywilly> but I thought it might be interesting to look at
<chillywilly> in the c++  binding they use abstract classes
<chillywilly> (classes with pure virtual methods)
<chillywilly> well one thing is if you write a python binding using some 'Inteface' implementation I suppose the cool thing would be somone else could use it or something
<chillywilly> whatever ;P
<nickr> its silly that C++ makes a distinction between virtual and nonvirtual methods
<chillywilly> yea, just one downfall of c++
<chillywilly> but that's not my point either :P
<chillywilly> hey smalltalk only uses 'interface' declarations it seems
<drochaid> did they fix that in C#?
Action: drochaid runs
<chillywilly> actually I think I like this run-time interface checking as python is dynamically typed langauge
<nickr> Smalltalk doesn't check the interfac afaik
<nickr> messages are passed between objects and are either handled or not
<chillywilly> well I don't know smalltalk very well just that it is dynamically typed like python
<jcater> python is a loosely message-based object
<jcater> it appears dynamically typed
<jcater> but is actually message-based when you get into the nitty gritty 
<chillywilly> could you explain that?
<chillywilly> 'message-based'?
<jcater> attributes (functions, variables, etc) are actually retrieved via a __getattr__ and __setattr__ call
<jcater> you can override those methods
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> to make any object look like it has any attribute you'd like
<jcater> hence a "message" is sent to __getattr__ which usually just returns an attribute of an object
<chillywilly> yea
<jamest> you can see sort of an example of this in common/src/GTrigger.py
<chillywilly> well see this is why I am here to get feedback fromt eh pythin gurus ;)
<jcater> s/sort of/
<chillywilly> er, python
<chillywilly> btw. how do you guys get the gnu. namespace? I don't see a __init__.py in the gnue dir
<chillywilly> er, gnue.
<chillywilly> but I do see something inm
<chillywilly> build/lib/...
<chillywilly> I'm just curious
<chillywilly> the package layout is fucking with my head
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> hrm there's an __init__.py in common/gnue
<chillywilly> hello?
<chillywilly> did you guys disappear?
<dneighbo> jcater i want to use python
<dneighbo> but i like java
<dneighbo> so i make python look like java
<dneighbo> i would just use java you see
<jcater> ah
<jcater> reminds me of something else
<jcater> I wanna use GNUe
<jcater> but I like Delphi
<jcater> so make GNUe look like Delphi
<chillywilly> sorry guys but I do NOT think the interface concept is a Java only concept
<jcater> and I would just use GNUe you see
<jcater> ;)
<chillywilly> it's an OO concept
<chillywilly> can be expressed in UML
<jcater> it's java's interpretation of objects
<chillywilly> is useful
<jcater> if you go back to the message-based objects that nickr brought up
<chillywilly> every object has an 'interface'
<jcater> most think that non-message-based OO languages are not really OO
<chillywilly> the interface are the methods you can call on it
<chillywilly> this is not a Java thing
<jcater> hence java isn't really OO
<jcater> just wants to be
<chillywilly> but I don't want to debate this I want to know about the package layout ;)
<jcater> chillywilly: one word of advice
<chillywilly> please help a stupid pythin newbie
<jcater> DON'T OVERCOMPLICATE :)
<jcater> keep it simple
<jcater> it's easy to do that in python
<jcater> but we are here to help :)
<jcater> I'm glad to see you embracing python
<chillywilly> well I ahve no idea whether or not I will use this convoluted Interface hting
<chillywilly> probably not
<chillywilly> since no one likes it
<jcater> I would recommend against it
<jcater> you gain little
<jcater> from a python perspective
<chillywilly> and it is complex
<chillywilly> I had to read it a billion times to understand it
<chillywilly> ;P
<chillywilly> which means it is not simple and breaks KISS
<dneighbo> but i cant seem to get java vm to work on anything but windows
<chillywilly> I was just making an aside point about how an 'interface' is not necessarily a Java thing
<chillywilly> will some one please ecplain how we get the gnue. package?
<chillywilly> er, explain
<jcater> huh?
<chillywilly> also how can you use gnue.forms
<chillywilly> the dir layout doesn't seem to be intuitive to me
<chillywilly> but maybe I am an idiot
<jcater> I'm confused
<jcater> oh, you mean you want to get to gnue.common from inside your python script?
<chillywilly> well in the python book it is like dir/__init__.py/dir/__init__.py/....blah blah
<chillywilly> my python book anyway
<chillywilly> but it doesn't seem that we follow that layout
<chillywilly> so I am confused
<jcater> well, our cvs layout doesn't necessarily correspond to the installed layout
<jcater> are you working from cvs?
<chillywilly> oh, ok
<chillywilly> of course...well looking at cvs code
<jcater> if so, then run the ./setup-cvs.py
<chillywilly> wait I think I get it....you setup the dir layout in the build dirs?
<chillywilly> the installed layout
<chillywilly> right?
<jcater> it will create a .cvsdevelbase directory in cvs/gnue
<jcater> if you set your PYTHONPATH=~/cvs/gnue/.cvsdevelbase
<jcater> then in python, you can just od
<jcater>   import gnue.common
<jcater> this is handled by the install routines
<jcater> but you have to do this when working from cvs
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> btw, the setup-cvs.py script does create
<jcater> gfcvs, grcvs, gfdes scripts
<jcater> and if you look at those scripts
<jcater> they are basically setting the PYTHONPATH for you
<chillywilly> ah
<jcater> so you might want to copy one of those to gnue-chilly
<chillywilly> how do you go about adding a module to common?
<jcater> and change what they execute
<jcater> :)
<chillywilly> like gnu.common.odmg for example or whatever
<chillywilly> er, gnue
<chillywilly> I mean package
<chillywilly> a module is a .py file right?
<chillywilly> nevermind I think I understand now
<jcater> no
<jcater> a module is a directory that has a __init__.py
<jcater> well
<jcater> yeah a .py file is a module
Action: jcater is on crack today
<jamest> um
<jamest> you really don't have to point that out jcater
<chillywilly> http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/102187
<jcater> lol
<chillywilly> this is harier
<jamest> i mean, why would today be any different that any other day
<chillywilly> er hairier
<jcater> chillywilly: a word of advice
<jamest> #gnuenterprise person = crack smoker
<jcater> there's very little useful stuff on aspn
<jcater> *very* little
<chillywilly> you have to go through all that just to create a singelton?
<chillywilly> er, singleton
<chillywilly> where's a good place?
<jcater> no
<jcater> that's just that guy's idea of a singleton
<jcater> chillywilly: hang on 
<jcater> lemme find a url
<chillywilly> it's his 'solution'
<chillywilly> a very fuckes up one
<chillywilly> fucked
<jcater> ok
<jcater> found a url
<chillywilly> that makes me nautious
<jcater> http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/gnue/
<chillywilly> doesn't python 2.2 support class members?
<chillywilly> just curious
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> ****keep it simple****
<chillywilly> what
<chillywilly> 's a simpel way to make a thread safe singleton in python then ;)
<nickr> wtf is a singleton anyway? Sounds like CS jerkoff
<chillywilly> an object that only has 1 instance
<chillywilly> it's a design pattern
<chillywilly> I use it here and there if the situation calls for it
<nickr> ugh
<nickr> thats stupid
<chillywilly> no it's not
<nickr> it IS CS jerkoff.
<jcater> there's no need for that
<jcater> none
<jcater> not a bit
<jcater> nadda
<jcater> nilch
<jcater> donut
<nickr> mm donutes
<nickr> actually i can see where it'd be useful, but I don't see why you need the language to 'support' it
<jcater> that's what I mean :)
<jcater> we have a few "singletons" (if you want to call them that(
<jcater> where we only have one instance
<jcater> thing is, we only *create* one instance of the class
<jcater> pretty simple implementation, eh?
<chillywilly> because you don't want multiple instances and people can create another one and fuck things up
<nickr> chillywilly: then those people are stupid
<jcater> chillywilly: if you are the coder and you create multiple ones, then you fscked it up :)
<chillywilly> they call obj.Instance() and get back the same one
<nickr> and you did something really stupid
<jcater> not the user
<chillywilly> no, you don;t get it you don't use the constructor but a method to returna  refernce to the one and only one instance
<jcater> maybe I do get it
<jcater> and know how to code properly to not need a language feature
<chillywilly> it's not a lnaguage feature
<nickr> thats actually really, really simple in python
<chillywilly>  you can use a class variable to implement it, but that's just one way
<nickr> does python have 'class variables'? Hrm, sort of I guess
sledge_ (~sledge@B2c4a.pppool.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<nickr> yea
<chillywilly> it just pushed the responsibility to the class for leeping track that there is only one instance
<chillywilly> psuhes
<sledge_> hi
<nickr> hey
<chillywilly> that's all it is good for
<dneighbo> for the record i concur aspn is bad news for python
<chillywilly> can you live without it? you bet you can...but of course it makes you have to manage things
<dneighbo> basically its visual c++ developers
<dneighbo> and vb develoeprs
<dneighbo> trying to make python work like their tools
<dneighbo> and i agree STRONGLY with nickr
<dneighbo> so much of this stuff is CS jerk off material
<jcater> chillywilly: you have to "manage" things?
<jcater> heavan forbid!
<sledge_> aspn?
<chillywilly> mange that there's only going to be one instance ever created throughout all the code
<dneighbo> i worked with fellow that was a STUD in database design
<dneighbo> like master degree in it
water (water@c207-202-221-160.sea1.cablespeed.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<nickr> dneighbo: thank you
<nickr> dneighbo: I knew you were cool when I first met you
<water> howdy
<dneighbo> i looked at his table structure for our company app
<dneighbo> and i was like wtf?
<dneighbo> you will NEVER be able to right a GUI for this
<chillywilly> it's a pattern that I find useful and it has nothing to do with a stinking language
<dneighbo> and he was like its in the x normal form w/ blah etc etc etc
<dneighbo> and im like yeah
<dneighbo> you are right
<nickr> heheh
<dneighbo> but you arent listening to me
<dneighbo> you will NEVER be able to write a useable front end to this son of a bitch
<nickr> the moment they mention Djkstra or something, you know you're in trouble...
<dneighbo> and it has PRACTICAL problems
<dneighbo> i.e. techincally it was correct (read CS jerk off material)
<nickr> yea
<nickr> well CS is really a science
<dneighbo> but practically it didnt meet business requirements and usage
<nickr> like real CS
<sledge_> dneighbo: i like that term, "CS jerk off material" :-)
<chillywilly> me either
<dneighbo> im not saying knowing the stuff isnt important
<nickr> and its interesting and useful, but not applicable to real life
<dneighbo> it is
<nickr> er, not directly applicable
Action: jcater strives for 3rd normal form
<dneighbo> but constantly saying because a 'theory' exists it must be relative is nuts
<nickr> just like quantum mechanics isn't applicable to real life in a direct way
<jcater> anything above is usually academic
<dneighbo> generally i think the sucessful folks keep two principles
<dneighbo> KISS
<dneighbo> and 
<dneighbo> everything in moderation
<nickr> yea
<dneighbo> if a theory cant be applied with passing both of those litmus tests it will probably fail in the long run
<nickr> sometimes it is fun to have a nice jerk session of real elegent things :)
<dneighbo> imho
<drochaid> I'm not having router issues .... just rebooting :)
<dneighbo> btw sledge_ that 'cs jerk off material' is a service mark of nickr not i :)
<sledge_> if CS is jerk off, then Python coding must be something like sex
drochaid (drochaid@pc2-kirk2-0-cust175.ren.cable.ntl.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
Action: dneighbo wanted to make that in the log ;)
<dneighbo> sledge_ actually i suppose thats relative
<jcater> sledge_: well, considering all the time we put into our python code, I sure hope so
<jcater> lord knows theres not much elsewhere :)
<dneighbo> theory says missionary position is the easiest most used position
<dneighbo> now you ask a 600 pound gal how often she is in the missionary position
<nickr> not all CS is jerkoff
<dneighbo> and i suppose your theory will be found not to work in practice :)
<nickr> But like any sience, there is a lot of wanking involved
<nickr> scrience
<nickr> science
<dneighbo> nickr i like to think of it in precision
<dneighbo> if im creating a kernel or a device etc
jamest (jamest@hobbes.math.ksu.edu) left irc: "[x]chat"
<dneighbo> my precision is much more reasonable as there are less external variables
<dneighbo> but if im writing an accounting application
<dneighbo> its less science more art
<dneighbo> as the variables become much greater
<sledge_> dneighbo: writing an accounting app is art? tell that these uspto people...
<nickr> Indeed
<chillywilly> you guys are something I ask how to implement a known design pattern in python and you write it off as CS jerkoff business, wtf?
<dneighbo> um you specifically said why doesnt python natively do this
<jcater> if its overkill and academic, then, well....
<nickr> All programming is art and science (a craft like horseshoeing) to some degree imho
<dneighbo> our answer was its academic
<jcater> KISS
[14:00] Last message repeated 5 time(s).
<chillywilly> it's not overkill
<chillywilly> I don't want to have to manage how many instances can be created in my mind
<chillywilly> I want the class to do it
<dneighbo> if you asked me how to get like 10th normal form in postgres and can you do so with a union, nest and subquery with 55 primary keys
<chillywilly> I can just say give me an instance
<jcater> imho that's just bad programming
<dneighbo> i would say if you need to do that you live in academia
<chillywilly> hell I can ever say only let me create 5 instances
<nickr> chillywilly: The thing about python, though, is that you don't have to create ANY instances
<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> am i in a gnucash channel ?
<dneighbo> ;)
<nickr> the object just exists
<jcater> dneighbo: were either chillywilly or I claiming one of our "members" was bigger?
<nickr> theres your singleton right there. Bam.
<jcater> no!
<jcater> so you must not be in #gnucash
<nickr> my member is huge!
<jcater> mine is efficient
<jcater> but has a singleton pattern
<nickr> thats just an excuse people use to make up for tiny members
<dneighbo> rofl
<chillywilly> the point is not to do it to be hip retards
<sledge_> nickr: i hate it when other people talk about size
<dneighbo> hey mine isnt small its a singleton
<chillywilly> point is it makes my life easier
<jcater> chillywilly: not really
<chillywilly> it's a known solution that can be communicated to others
<jcater> it's one more structure/function to manage/debug
<jcater> let me put it this way
<jcater> if I'm debugging your code
<nickr> wouldn't it be best in python not to use an object at all for singletons?
<jcater> and I'm see you creating instances of something all over the place
<jcater> and I can't figure out wtf is going on 
<nickr> you just make a module which is like a self-instantiating object ssort
<nickr> a
<jcater> because you chose to do a singleton pattern
<jcater> instead of smarter management
<jcater> I'm gonna be PISSED
<jcater> and stop working with your code
Action: dneighbo goes to read up on this singleton pattern to see what happens when jcater gets PISSED ;)
<jcater> btw
<jcater> that's PISSED off
<jcater> not on
<nickr> or pissed in the british sense
<dneighbo> well mom always said,
<dneighbo> "better to be pissed off, than pissed on"
<chillywilly> jcater: that's stupid
<nickr> better to be pissed than pissed off or on
<jcater> dneighbo: do you not agree w/my argument?
<dneighbo> well my dad once gave me an ancedote after 30 years in teh business
<dneighbo> he wrote an api that was all non object based for amex
<dneighbo> a year later a hot shot Phd came in
<nickr> Its just pointl/ess overhead trying to make a singleton object, make a singleton pattern using modules
<dneighbo> and rewrote it all in objects
<dneighbo> everything an objects
<jcater> nickr: we've done that in gnue-forms
<dneighbo> within a month of gonig live they called my dad back and asked him to please come put all the new specs back in his version
<dneighbo> they were throwing away the object version
<jcater> we create an instance of a class in the module at startup
<nickr> jcater: I realize that, I'm just reiterating :)
<jcater> ah
<jcater> ok
<jcater> :)
<dneighbo> as the people using the API found it horribly convulted and an utter bitch to work with
<nickr> you don't even need to make an object instance
water (water@c207-202-221-160.sea1.cablespeed.com) left #gnuenterprise ("Parting").
<nickr> because a module is object-ish
<dneighbo> having to create and destroy objects and such
<dneighbo> now my dad will be the first to say that objects are great
<dneighbo> when used properly and in moderation
<chillywilly> blah blah
[14:10] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<dneighbo> so jcater yes i agree
<jcater> well, thanks
<dneighbo> something that might be TECHINICALLY superior
<jcater> although I fail to see how that anecdote applies
<jcater> but thanks for agreeing
<dneighbo> but is not maintainable or debugable is useless
<chillywilly> it is not very difficult of a concept
<dneighbo> basically that because its the way the Phd (computer stud) says is technically correct
<chillywilly> even I can understand it
Action: nickr proposes dumping python and implimenting it all in quantum computer simulator
<dneighbo> doesnt mean its EASIER to use/maintain/modify etc
<jcater> chillywilly: it's not about "understanding"
<jcater> it's about maintenance
<dneighbo> and in the REAL world (amex)
<dneighbo> dollars count
<chillywilly> how is it hard to maintain?
<jcater> bah
<chillywilly> how is it not real world(tm)?
<jcater> read the backlog
<dneighbo> and they went BACK to somethign that easier for them
<dneighbo> btw: i dont want to bring this up but i do
<dneighbo> we had a case of this in GNUe once already
<sledge_> I prefer stupid code.
<chillywilly> it's a mechanism to solve a problem in a given situation and that's all it is
<dneighbo> a certain sectino of gnue code was written to be all objects
<jcater> chillywilly: one of jamest's and my MAJOR points about python
<dneighbo> and it made things a nightmare
<jcater> is that any one of us can pick up the other's code
<dneighbo> and had to be refactored back into a mixture
<jcater> and within a minute
<jcater> undesrstand wtf is going on
<dneighbo> now thats not to say that the code wasnt BETTER technically
<dneighbo> but when 5 out of 5 developers
<nickr> chillywilly: we told you hov to do a 'singleton pattern'
<chillywilly> just because it has goofy jargon to make it sound complex does not mean it is
<dneighbo> couldnt reasonably follow the code
<dneighbo> it was deemed regardless that it was the WRONG way to do it :)
<chillywilly> in fact most of the time it's not complex at all just made to sound that way
<chillywilly> 'singleton'....oooh fancy name for one stinking instance
<chillywilly> I can't believe I am arguing about the usefulness of a singleton
<jcater> sigh
<chillywilly> it's mental
<jcater> then stop arguing and accept our standards
<jcater> :)
<nickr> chillywilly: just make a fucking module that acts like a singleton class bitch
<sledge_> hey, today i received my copyright assignment papers
<dneighbo> cool
<chillywilly> nickr: well that's one way and probably a good way
<chillywilly> instead of helping meut you guys are just 
<dneighbo> and after this discussion you decided you wouldnt be needing them :)
<nickr> chillywilly: in python its the best way
<chillywilly> arguing about how stupid I am being
<chillywilly> insted of providing a 'solution'
<jcater> chillywilly: how have we not provided a solution from the beginning?
<chillywilly> thanks
<jcater> we've said "manage your objects better"
<chillywilly> it's not about object mangement
<jcater> <cough>bullshit</cough>
<chillywilly> why shouldn't the class manage it's own instances? I write the code once
<chillywilly> and I just call obj.Instance() and that's it
<chillywilly> that's real hard
Action: jcater has been describing "readability" all along
<jcater> not difficulty in programming
<dneighbo> im sorry we dont run that kind of channel here
<dneighbo> if its 'real hard' we will have to ask you to leave until you 'soften up a bit'
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> there are children present
<sledge_> jcater: daddy?
<nickr> porn!
<jcater> :)
Action: dneighbo was reference back to the CS jerkoff + member size thing
<chillywilly> is there any situation whatsoever that i will need to have only one instance of an object?
<dneighbo> there is a rule about nazi means its degraded in conversation or soemthing
<dneighbo> here if it goes to goat sex
<dneighbo> or p0rn 
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> id the answer is yes then the singleton patterns solves this problem
<chillywilly> s/id/if
<dneighbo> i think its sufficient to call the thread dead :)
<chillywilly> that's all I am saying
<dneighbo> psu: im curious to see how you author the last hour of conversation via the KC
<chillywilly> if you can't see the elegance behind making the obkect ensure there is only once instance of itself then you really are a  moron
<sledge_> dneighbo: okay, let's return to pr0n with python-coding chicks
Action: dneighbo restates for the record "Honest, its not small, its a singleton"
<nickr> I'd like to restate for the record that message passing object systems r00l..
<psu> dneighbo: cut-off is Wed, so I get a whole week to read & decypher the log ;-)
<dneighbo> sledge_ oh i think you are lookign for www.pythonbimbos.com
<jcater> sledge_: you misunderstood
<nickr> psu: its not the difficulty of decyphering
<jcater> we use wxPython
<jcater> not XXXpython
<nickr> www.xxxbigpython.com
<sledge_> jcater: damnit. do you want to tell me that i'm *not* on #py-pr0n ?
<chillywilly> no one in the python channel thinks a singeton is stupid if implemented correctly and used appropriately
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> chillywilly: please drop it
<jcater> what are you trying to prove?
<jcater> eh?
<chillywilly> that you guys hate me
<chillywilly> ;P
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> we could prove that in 1 sentence
<chillywilly> any idea I have is met with criticism
<jcater> why all this commotion?
<jcater> j/k
<jcater> :)
<nickr> whats all this then?
<sledge_> chillywilly: we love you, seriously. except for that singleton.
<jcater> yes
<chillywilly> fuck off
<jcater> please keep all singletons to yourselves
<jcater> this is a PG-13 rated channel
<jcater> let's try to keep it that way
<chillywilly> you just proved to me that you are morons and the only way you deal with things you don't understand or heard of is to ridicule it
<sledge_> okay. back to constructive mode.
<nickr> chillywilly: you're right.
<jcater> #gnuenterprise constructive?
<nickr> I don't understand Quantum Mechanics
<jcater> sledge_: you are new here, right?
<jcater> :)
<nickr> damn quanta! be linear!
<sledge_> jcater: i'm an optimist (like Orwell).
<chillywilly> I bet the singleton pattern is used in kdelibs
<chillywilly> or QT for that matter
<chillywilly> and many other places
<nickr> kde is a paragon of good design
<chillywilly> but nah, it's just a stupid thing use by us CS jerkoffs
<sledge_> qt is well-designed imho
Action: chillywilly notes he's an engineer not a CS jerkoff
<jcater> chillywilly: you remind me of my wife
Action: nickr is an artist so dismisses anything that sounds complex and nonintuitive as jerkoff
<nickr> like that math stuff!
<jcater> take anything thats said and turn it around to be a personal attack
<nickr> Sheez!
<chillywilly> jcater: nope, that was a joke hence the ;P
<chillywilly> jcater: so get a clue
Action: jcater searches for the last reference to ;)
<sledge_> where's the code, anyway?
<chillywilly> there is none I just asked how one would implement a singleton out of curiousity and then all hell broke loose ;)
<nickr> man caffiene is the coolest drug
<nickr> I'm glad its legal
<chillywilly> so it's pretty pointless and I wasted a lot of time
<chillywilly> yay!
<chillywilly> go GNUe!
<jcater> and our time too :)
<nickr> yes
<nickr> our time is very valuable
<nickr> at least mine is
<chillywilly> s/I/we
<chillywilly> sorry
<chillywilly> mother fucker it is cold in here
<dneighbo> chillywilly i think you take things too personally
<chillywilly> I am not taking ANYTHING personally
<dneighbo> but beyond that
<chillywilly> I'm sorry if I make you think
<chillywilly> it might hurt your little head
<dneighbo> you asked an academic question
<dneighbo> and didnt liek the response
<chillywilly> well google proves to be more useful
<dneighbo> if you wanted to make a STRONGER point
<chillywilly> than this channel
<dneighbo> you would look at gnue code
<chillywilly> I don't care about making my point
<dneighbo> find an example of a 'singleton'
<chillywilly> you already admitted that such things exist
<dneighbo> and see if it was done to the degree you liked
<dneighbo> if not
<dneighbo> then redo it as your pattern
<dneighbo> and ask
<dneighbo> isnt this better than that
<dneighbo> to which a real (non academic) discussion could occur
<chillywilly> I don't have the time right nwo to dig through all of it
<dneighbo> but basically saying python sucks it doesnt do singletons
<chillywilly> I thought it would be something used
<dneighbo> and getting a response of
<chillywilly> here already
<chillywilly> and that you guys would know wtf I am talking about
<dneighbo> well we dont find them to be overtly useful in what we do and where we do this kidn of thing we do X
<chillywilly> no no no no
<dneighbo> you retort, 'fuck you moron, you dont get it'
<dneighbo> then claim the world hates you
<chillywilly> I didn't say it didn't do singletons
<chillywilly> I asked if you knew a methods that was less complex than the url I pated
<dtm> HI GUYS
<jcater> and the response was "write your code to only create a single instance"
<chillywilly> but some took this as an arttack ot something
<jcater> to which the response was "you don't get it" (explitive deleted)
<chillywilly> jcater: I was just surious if you knew of a way or a place where it was done but don't worry I found one
<chillywilly> yes, I got angry because you all started talking shit right wawy and not listening
<dneighbo> chillywilly you say 'some took it as an attack'
<dneighbo> but when your response if F You moron, you dont get it
<chillywilly> it was a simple inquiry not an attack on python
<nickr> I want chillywilly's remarks stricken from the record
<dneighbo> i think you find generally in return you will get attacked :)
<chillywilly> I said that after the fact
Action: dtm strikes chillywilly with a record
<chillywilly> after you guys were going on and on about how academic it is, how it is bad management, blah blah
<dtm> whooops!  that's not what i meant to do!
<dtm> chillywilly: hi dan
Action: dneighbo hands dtm a trout, we dont use records here
<dtm> chillywilly: i hope you got more sleep than i did :)
<chillywilly> who fucking cares
<sledge_> my patch has still not been applied :-/ is this default caution?
<chillywilly> dneighbo: you know how rms will sit there and lecture someone instaed of answering their question, this is exactly what happened here, imho
<chillywilly> I didn't come to debate the usefulness of a singleton pattern but to know if you knew anythig about doing it in python
<chillywilly> done!
<nickr> chillywilly: we told you how to do that on several occations
<nickr> in several ways
<dtm> singletons suck!   i mean..  singletons rule!!!
Action: dtm waits for a side to pick himj
<dtm> s/himj/him/
<chillywilly> nickr: nope, you made one suggestion a little while ago
<chillywilly> that was it
<chillywilly> there was no 'serveral' occasions
<nickr> chillywilly: i'm fairly sure that jcater made a similar suggestion, and that we all said 'just instantiate it once'
<chillywilly> that has problems
<chillywilly> it's not 'defensive'
<chillywilly> that's one reason for the wholw pattern it guarantees
<chillywilly> there can only be one
<nickr> the module method is best in python
<chillywilly> or a limited pool
<nickr> import Highlander;
<chillywilly> hehe
<sledge_> chillywilly: mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/1999-April/000151.html
<dneighbo> sledge_ did i tell you to send patch to dcl?
<sledge_> dneighbo: you did
<dneighbo> i told someone that and i cant remember who
<chillywilly> I just hope that next time I have a question about implementing a design pattern in python that people won't be getting all jumpy
<chillywilly> I like python damnit!
<dneighbo> and then realized our mail gateway and normal dcl operations are eating files
<dneighbo> so please send to info@gnue.org
<nickr> chillywilly: Don't you like python!? Bitch!!
<chillywilly> python sucks rocks
<sledge_> dneighbo: i did, but forgot to attach the patch itself :) i'll resend it tomorrow.
<chillywilly> anyway...
<chillywilly> thanks sledge_
<chillywilly> that is a lot better than the other one
Action: chillywilly is freezing his nuts off
<chillywilly> damn it's cold down here
<sledge_> chillywilly: singletons can be implemented quite easily
<sledge_> chillywilly: ah, now we know the reason for flaming <g,d&r>
<nickr> first throw out your UML book. THen forget about singletons.
<chillywilly> sledge_: ?
<nickr> actually I have a really good book on UML and design patterns that I should reread
<chillywilly> I bet the singelton is in there
<chillywilly> factory pattern is useful too ;)
<sledge_> chillywilly: i was referring to your complaint about your cold $ENV :)
<chillywilly> yea, I am a bit purturbed
<chillywilly> as I am freezing
<nickr> Yea actually singleton is in there
<nickr> "Don't ever use the singleton pattern. It sucks. Just trust us. Look at these pictures of nude women instead."
Action: chillywilly looks at the naked chicks
<sledge_> nickr: UML is nice, but not all ideas can be used in a free software bazaar development model.
<chillywilly> why is that sledge_?
<nickr> sledge_: what does that have to do with UML?
<nickr> chillywilly: any UML book with naked chicks is a good UML book
<chillywilly> because people are too busy hacking away and not thinking about how they should do something before they just go off and do it ;P

<chillywilly> jcater loves the cocks
<chillywilly> er cock
<chillywilly> dneighbo cries like a bitch with a skinned knee

<jcater> makes me not want to meet him at a developers convention
<chillywilly> you don't want that anyway, I will have a special trout for you
<nickr> jcater goes 'hrglbrglburf'?

<sledge_> head shot
<nickr> i have it on good authority that chillywilly bites the wax tadpole

<sledge_> that was a good head shot
<nickr> what an odd thing to say

<chillywilly> this is pythin d00d

<chillywilly> jcater: help!
<chillywilly> you python freak ;)
<ajmitch> variable length arguments
<chillywilly> one is a list
<chillywilly> the other is a dict/
<jcater> chillywilly: those are used when you don't really care what the user passes as arguments
<chillywilly> ?
<ajmitch> what jcater said
<jcater> for example
<jcater> if I have
<jcater> def myfunc(self, *args, **params)
<chillywilly> ooooh, examples
<jcater> and call it as
<jcater> myfunct(1,2, 'barf', type='notreally', parent="dad")
<jcater> then
<jcater> args = (1,2,'barf')
<jcater> and params = { 'type':'notreally', 'parent': 'dad' }
<nickr> whoa
<nickr> neat
<chillywilly> I see
<chillywilly> nifty
<sledge_> like print?
<jcater> somewhat
<jcater> it's really useful in cases like: 
<jcater> class a: 
<jcater>   def __init__(self, parent, type, somethingmore): 
<jcater>    ...
<jcater>  
<jcater> class b(a): 
<jcater>   def __init__(self, *args, **params): 
<jcater>     a.__init__(self, *args, **params)
<jcater>     ...
<jcater>  
<sledge_> indeed, useful
<jcater> in this case you really don't care what the underlying constructor is
<jcater> and don't want to have to repeat any changes with any subclasses
<jcater> but each subclass needs to do something in their __init__
<chillywilly> it is like void* or something?
<chillywilly> pass anythgin you want
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> but I was giving you the typical usage
<chillywilly> uhuh
<jcater> but you can use it in cases like you said
<chillywilly> thank you

<chillywilly> I dunno wtf a brueller is
<chillywilly> dict doesn't turn anything up
<chillywilly> so plz elaborate
<chillywilly> damnit
<chillywilly> ;P
<sledge_> it's something e.g. when someone makes a joke that I don't find funny, i say it's a brueller.
<chillywilly> so it's a word you made up?
<sledge_> it's a very basic word, hard to define, like god, soul, ghost (or python). it's not my invention.

<dneighbo> jcater: serious note, im ready to cry w/ reporting solution here
<dneighbo> have you formalized the 'tags' yet

<dneighbo> if so im ready to beta test
<jcater> speak of the devil
<jcater> that's what I've been working on last 2 days
<jcater> I wanna release reports 0.0.1 when we do forms/designer
<dneighbo> i will write an xsl for the output to excel
<psu> ack
<jcater> dneighbo: fwiw, I'm doing a "generic" tag format
<dneighbo> as im hurting here
<chillywilly> wtf us da matta wit you?
<jcater> that doesn't have to be the "formal" format
<ajmitch> hey psu
<chillywilly> s/us/is
<jcater> but I need something
<dneighbo> the report tool sucks so bad here
<jcater> that will demo what it will do
<dneighbo> ive dumped the data out to access (from olap)
<jcater> (and it'll be something useful, but not necessary the "real" thing :)
<dneighbo> and am using access to write a report and its SHIT
<jcater> as I need something here ASAP
<chillywilly> when are we going to get our olap backend dneighbo ;)?
<dneighbo> i would rather dump to postgres
<dneighbo> then use gnue reports
<dneighbo> and push to excel (thats what they build the budget book in and most of our reports are there)
<psu> cvs commit uses vi as default editor for changelog - which I've never used before
Action: jcater really wants to see an XML to XSLT converter :)
<psu> any vi min-gurus can help?
<psu> s/min/mini
<chillywilly> psu: set CVSEDITOR
<chillywilly> to emacs ;)
<chillywilly> or whatever
<psu> can I do that now, or is it too late?
<ajmitch> or nano if you want something easy
<chillywilly> just abort
<sledge_> it's late late, har har
<chillywilly> abort the commit
<psu> ctrl-?
<jcater> psu: just press Ctrl + Backspace a few times :)
<chillywilly> then set CVS EDITOR in your shell file
<chillywilly> :q!
<chillywilly> in vi
<chillywilly> er, CVSEDITOR
<chillywilly> is there an apply function in the python lib?
<chillywilly> apply()
<dneighbo> your samples true to life?
<ajmitch> probably
<dneighbo> if so i might try a convertor tonight to html
<chillywilly> i dunno where thet are getting this crap from
<nickr> jcater: you could use xslt for that
<dneighbo> from the output
<dneighbo> nickr it will be xslt
<dneighbo> pysablot
<jcater> I didn't say it couldn't be done
<dneighbo> want to write debs for it :)
<jcater> I just stated it'd be interesting to see
<dneighbo> pysablot that is
<jcater> nickr: yes, could you package pysablot.sf.net??
Action: jcater would be your best friend
<nickr> pysablot eh?
<jcater> or at least nicer to you than I am to chillywilly
<ajmitch> hehe
<chillywilly> jcater: I'm so deeply and emotionally scarred now
<chillywilly> I'll never be the same
<nickr> jcater: well shit, you already are that
<jcater> oh
<jcater> um
<sledge_> sablot rocks, use it all the day
<jcater> well, I'll share a donut and take you to Graceland if you're ever in town
<psu> woo hoo - cvs commit done
<nickr> hrm, that sounds like a really good deal
<psu> only took me 3 goes
<nickr> but why not use 4front instead
<nickr> which is already packaged
<jcater> sablotron plus the perl and php bindings are already in woody
<jcater> just no python bindings
<chillywilly> jcater, a donut? there's a difference between these things?
<nickr> I'll look at it
<chillywilly> I thought jcater was part donut
<chillywilly> and part AI
<sledge_> chillywilly: at least he has creme
<jcater> I've been told I'm quite tasty at that
<chillywilly> hey man my nick allows for much creme production ;)
<chillywilly> you keep them babies chilled ;)
<chillywilly> and you can fill up many holes with creme
<chillywilly> ok, that was pretty sick

<dneighbo> nickr mainly sablotron was used by me anyhow
<dneighbo> as its what mdean and i found to have best docs :)
Action: sledge_ has no open browser window, so he doesn't know what it is
<dneighbo> both beign new to xslt this was important :)
<dneighbo> we got it working for DCL
<dneighbo> and it seems very easy and simple to use
<chillywilly> dneighbo: I love you
<dneighbo> and has a plethora of bindings
<nickr> I was going to use sablotron at one time but then I found 4front which did everything I needed-
<sledge_> dneighbo: have you already found the xslt faq? -> www.dpawson.co.uk, *very* useful
<dneighbo> its in debian too, just not python binding
<psu> ok, I even closed my work order in DCL as well
<dneighbo> sledge_ i bout orielly's XLST

<chillywilly> what do you do about an absatrct class in python?
<chillywilly> jsut don't instantiate it ;)
<dtm> hi guys
<ajmitch_> greetings dtm
<dtm> ajmitch_: shalom, my brother
<dtm> whatever that means.
<dtm> it's a good thing though
<ajmitch_> it means peace
<chillywilly> anyone?
<chillywilly> how to do an abstract class in python
<chillywilly> you can define an AbstractError to throw, but I am not sure that is a nice way to do it
<jamest> abstract?
<chillywilly> def abstract_method():
<chillywilly>   throw AbstractError
<chillywilly> you do not instantiate an instance of it
<chillywilly> it like a shape class and you derive all your shapes from it
<jcater> we usually don't distinguish between an abstract and a non-abstract class
<nickr> just say 'all shapes use this protocol'
<chillywilly> you only make instances of lines, ploygons, etc.....and shape defines various methods liek draw(), etc.
<nickr> and then make all your shapes do that
<nickr> or think of a base 'shape' and derive shapes from that
<nickr> like a point object
<nickr> that you subclass
<chillywilly> I suppose you habe to rely on people being good
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> jcater: please no sighing ;)
<nickr> yea
<nickr> THeres no point in abstract classes in python because all classes are polymorphic due to the message passing nature of them
<chillywilly> bare with me
<ajmitch_> hehe
<nickr> so as long as an object impliments the protocol, it doesn't matter
<jcater> python reinforces bottoms-up programming vs top-down programming
<ajmitch_> sigh
<chillywilly> ack!
<chillywilly> stop that ajmitch_
Action: jcater prefers not to "bare" anything w/ chillywilly
<jcater> ;)
<ajmitch_> sorry, was just thinking of bad joke related to your misuse of 'bare' and jcater's 'bottoms-up'
<ajmitch_> heh
<chillywilly> yea, keep your bottoms-up covered
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> sorry I am still in a C++ mode of thinking about objects
<chillywilly> I have to pythonize myself
<jcater> snap out of it, man!!
<chillywilly> I can;t help it
<chillywilly> it was spoon fed to me in college
<chillywilly> I'll get over it
Nick change: ajmitch_ -> ajmitch
<dneighbo> hey if in the south (now everywhere) they have white hanes tank top tee's that are donned offical 'wife beater' garb
<dneighbo> what is the outfit of the 'dead horse beater'?
<jcater> rubber gloves?
<nickr> I'm pretty sure a smock is involved
Action: dneighbo wonders if its a coincidence that az has a stark park called 'dead horse state park'
<dsmith> Someone should think up a humerous relationship between GNU Enterprse and Captain Kirk (or Picard)

<Mr_You> I have 3 business models I'm putting in a local contest
<chillywilly> I know you sorta have somehting going
<chillywilly> business plans?
<Mr_You> yeah
<chillywilly> I am starting my own thing too
<chillywilly> just gotta set some goals and stuff
<Mr_You> its tough going I'll tell you
<chillywilly> dtm had been a big help and inspiration
<chillywilly> sure, I don't see it as being easy at all
<chillywilly> but life is never easy'
<Mr_You> I've got two projects to go for the computer biz deal..
<Mr_You> GNUe included in one of them

<chillywilly> working on this thing right now
<Mr_You> thats great

<Mr_You> GNUe and Debian are the other two projects

<chillywilly> Debian Jr.?
<Mr_You> that included yeah
<chillywilly> or just plain debian?
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> I thought I remember you being a big debian junior guy
<Mr_You> Debian Jr. is really just encouraging packages to be included in Debian releases, etc..
<Mr_You> yeah I idle there consistently like here heh
<chillywilly> darn what is the command to set the column width in emacs
<chillywilly> I wish I could get it to stay
<Mr_You> I don't use it myself
Action: chillywilly has various hacks in his .emacs which don't seem to keep it
<dtm> chillywilly: yay
<jamest> anyone here have a source installed python?
<dtm> Mr_You: a contest?!?  COOL   DETAILS?!
<Mr_You> man looking in the wanted ads and seeing only "rotating shift for backup restorations" is depressing :-( heh
<jamest> or a non-debian python install
<Mr_You> yeah.. lemme find some of the cash prizes
<jcater>  I have a win32 install
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> hmm
<jamest> would --profile work there?
<dtm> Mr_You: hey for some encouragement, look at the press releases on http://echostorm.net for a contest my buddy was in.  not sure of the results.  he's the CEO of Echo Storm.

<jcater> ????
<Mr_You> yeah
<dtm> Mr_You: i have a 25 page first draft of mine :)
<jamest> i forgot I had a win32 install
<jamest> like I ever use that machine:)
<dtm> Mr_You: it's all complete except Executive Summary and a touch of financials which i dont have the track record for yet
<dtm> Mr_You: and which are relatively unimportant
<dtm> chillywilly: how are you today sir
<chillywilly> ok
<chillywilly> not that it matters ;)
<dtm> Mr_You: refresh me on your business idea -- gimme the elevator pitch
<dtm> chillywilly: Oh, Eeyore!
<dtm> Bother.
<Mr_You> well
<dtm> chillywilly: watch Mr_You give the elevator pitch
<dtm> ;)
<Mr_You> first, I don't do that ;-)
<dtm> TIME'S UP  I'M NOT CONVINCED!!
<dtm> ;->
<dtm> lol
<chillywilly> heheh
<dtm> hehhehe
<Mr_You> but I'll just say that currently have a VPS hosting service, plan on GNUe and Debian products
<dtm> Mr_You: ok you just lost your first potential investment, pal!  ;>
<dtm> Mr_You: oh, it's that open source stuff, huh?
<dtm> yeah i heard that stuff's not good enough to sell, so they have to GIVE it away
<Mr_You> business model #2 is Aquaponic Farming, #3 is ecostruction.com consulting
Action: Mr_You doesn't want investments yet heh
Action: dtm imitates what's known in business parlance as the Hard Sell, aka "a jackass"
<dtm> h0h0
<jcater> ecostruction.com?
<Mr_You> yeah you gotta have some sort of name..
<chillywilly> you contruct buildings over the net ;)
<jamest> anyone running gnue on a non-debian system?
<chillywilly> nope
<Mr_You> it will involve aquaponic/grey water systems.. 
<dtm> Mr_You: hey man.  you can't send construction materials via tcp/ip
<Mr_You> and go beyond into dome construction
<jcater> coolness
<dtm> Mr_You: that violates so many zoning laws i can't even count!
<Mr_You> not if you do it right ;-)
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> that's not too uncommon these days
<chillywilly> http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/
<dtm> ok well obviously Mr_You is too smart for us.  ok lemme talk to some business dummies so I can feel smart again.
<Mr_You> hehe 
<dtm> Mr_You: seriously, sounds awesome bro
<Mr_You> yeah, I can dream, lets see if I can produce
<dtm> Mr_You: i would like to cooperate in any way that's materially feasible :)
<Mr_You> maybe some of these "leaders" around here will believe in my vision too
<dtm> Mr_You: i'll be on your board of advisors
<jcater> Mr_You: what exactly is your "vision"?
<Mr_You> also, would consult on land restoration..
<dtm> jcater: he's got Magic Glasses
<Mr_You> dead parking lot?  turn it back "good earth"
<dtm> Mr_You: fantastic
<Mr_You> I'm guessing this is possible ;-)
<dtm> yeah we need more _good_ parkign lots.
<chillywilly> would you say python uses 'dynamic memory management semantics'?
<dtm> those dead ones are unsightly
<Mr_You> one cool think about an underground dome home.. for building codes.. just build in escape hatches ;-)
<dtm> Mr_You: dood   i want an ecologically sound home, virtually nonimpacting
<chillywilly> I suppose that includes garbage collection and such
<jcater> my favorite magazine is Mother Earth News :)
<dtm> Mr_You: i hear those are illegal in a lot of places just coz they're different
<chillywilly> I dunno just trying to figure out what the hell that means
<Mr_You> so my vision is to build provide consulting services on all aspects of construction from ecosystems to underground residential and commercial buildings
<Mr_You> dtm: heh
<jcater> I was reading up on alternate construction methods the other day
<dtm> Mr_You: do you have an Executive Summary for us bruh?
<jcater> such as sandbag constructionb
<dtm> Mr_You: you can trust us.
<Mr_You> nah 
<jcater> or tire construction
<dtm> jcater: yeah or recycled tires
<Mr_You> I'll offer it up as I make it complete for the contest..
<dtm> and windows that heat the house with solar power
<Mr_You> pending NDA is required
<dtm> you can make a house where one room is, in itself, the household heater
<Mr_You> get this.. fiber optic solar lighting
<dtm> Mr_You: wicked.
<Mr_You> 2-3 years off..
<dtm> Mr_You: how about grants so that the average Joe can make the initial investment?
<Mr_You> but basicly redirects the light through fiber optics to anywhere
<dtm> Mr_You: cool, 
<Mr_You> oh, and I don't think I mentioned it yet.. HUGE NEWS
<Mr_You> the Zero-Point/Free Energy patent has finally been issued
<Mr_You> http://www.unknowncountry.com/news/?id=1406
<jcater> do any of y'all read JourneyToForever.org ?
<Mr_You> basicly the "Motionless Magnetic Generator" takes a small amount of energy and increases it
<jcater> on of my favorite bedtime reading sites
<jcater> s/on/one
<Mr_You> x100
<Mr_You> :-)
<Mr_You> or more
<chillywilly> wow
<chillywilly> that's cool
<Mr_You> eek nightmares jason ;-)
<jcater> Mr_You: ???
<Mr_You> that website
<jcater> ah
<jcater> I'm a freak
<jcater> I freely admit it
<jcater> I was trying to buy 40 acres a month or two ago
<jcater> to try some of the stuff :)
Action: jcater especially wanted to get some of those Muscovy ducks :)
<Mr_You> my dad has some land, but I wanna do it on my own
<Mr_You> tho it might be possible I build on it at some point..
<Mr_You> he has a nonworking farm rather
<jcater> I really wanted this farm
<jcater> I may still get it
<jcater> but the "estate" wouldn't budge
<dtm> hey if you guys come across an extra farm, lemme know and i'll consider it  
<dtm> like if they're givin' em away and stuff
<Mr_You> heh
<chillywilly> muscovy ducks?
<dtm> and if i can get broadband there
<chillywilly> a type of duck?
Action: jcater was actually goona get broadband down there
<Mr_You> direcduo.com I think ;-)
<dtm> seriously -- i was literally recently given an offer to move back to our ancestral homestead in Kansas for several years
<dtm> Mr_You: yeah
<jcater> I really want to homestead
<jcater> as long as I have broadband
<chillywilly> heheh
<jcater> I'm not joking
<chillywilly> gotta gte those prioriies in order ;)
<jamest> broadband additics
<dtm> well this one originally a log cabin built by German immigrants :)
<dtm> jcater: i wouldn't think for amoment that you're joking about that, sir.  :_I
<dtm> :-I
<chillywilly> poor jamest and I still live in dialup land
<jamest> 56k modems is good enough for 99% of kansas
<dtm> jamest: i wasn't a broadband addict when i was in KS though :)  i dialed into the Equinox data switch as 9600 7e1  ;)
<jamest> it's good enough for you
<jamest> :P
<Mr_You> dialup isn't bad, but I wanna get off the grid completely heh
<dtm> jamest: which was quite an upgrade from when i had to do it via Information Network of Kansas at 1200/2400 7e1
<chillywilly> wireless?
<jamest> dialup licks the bag
<dtm> Mr_You: yeah
<chillywilly> jamest: indeed
<Mr_You> wireless or satelite via direcduo
<chillywilly> jamest: but I could get a cable modem anytime
Action: jamest is in a horrid mood tonight
<chillywilly> I should get one
<jamest> but it shouldn't take 15 minutes to put 3MB
<dtm> chillywilly: you might come up with a hobby business plan to resell it to the neighbors wirelessly
<Mr_You> direcpc is talking about doing voice service... would seem logical to provide two way voice service with their two way net service
<jamest> which is actually pretty smoking for my connection
<dtm> chillywilly: take up a collection for a basestation, have them prepay for several months, and have them buy client equipemtn
<Mr_You> could use VoIP with direcduo
<dtm> Mr_You: last i knew, direcpc was very much latent and not realtime
<chillywilly> dtm: bah
<dtm> Mr_You: not to mention horrendous floating TOS
<Mr_You> it is.. so how do they plan to offer VoIP?  ;-)
<dtm> Mr_You: unpredictable enforcement of TOS
<Mr_You> but I think you can adjust something to lower latency.. and for voice maybe its good enough
<dtm> Mr_You: low throughput consumption caps
<dtm> Mr_You: oh
<Mr_You> this is a direcduo hardware solution
<chillywilly> is there an official python IDL binding?
<Mr_You> direcpc hardware solution first rather
<chillywilly> how many different Free python orbs are there?
<chillywilly> like 2?
<Mr_You> which isn't two way.. so I dunno how they will provide voice service except VoIP.. 
<chillywilly> python binding even
<chillywilly> I know there's ORBit
<chillywilly> what else is there?
<Mr_You> I guess you could do VoIP just to the switch with a dialup modem, but blah..
<Mr_You> right now, I'd like to find some land to restore and build on.. and maybe one day a mountain home
<dnWork> any good stuff happen

<chillywilly> haha
<jamest> you sure we have to have family channel
<chillywilly> you luser
<jamest> can't we just ignore you instead
<chillywilly> go ahead

Action: angie is a woman
<angie> got that, jamest?

<jamest> told the server to give me operator status
<angie> my OWN woman.  he's MY amn!!
<chillywilly> lol
<angie> er, man
<jamest> so I could kick chillywilly and make this a family channel
<chillywilly> yea, that's consistent
<jamest> chillywilly: you're married right?
<chillywilly> NOT
<chillywilly> nope
<jamest> ah
<jamest> you see after marrage the man enters a state called "dependent"
<chillywilly> puh-lz
<jamest> at that point we're capable of little more than making messes and dumb remarks
<chillywilly> that's me right now

Harald1 (Peter1234@pD9EB138A.dip.t-dialin.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Harald1> hi
<chillywilly> wow, she's a woman alright
<angie> pretty honest
<jamest> is so, then the answer is no
<jamest> hey Harald1
<angie> ai'll train him to lie yet!
<jamest> Harald1: one issue with the win32 patch on multilines that jcater pointed out
<angie> I have to go to bed.  I'll get locked out again.
<jamest> in his (and my environments) we have both win32 and unix clients
<jamest> later angie, nice talking to you
<angie> bye!
<jamest> if you are really you and not jeff
<jamest> :)
<Harald1> jamest: and the problem ist that under windows both \n characters get saved?
<jamest> if a win32 client saves cr/lf to the db
<jamest> and a unix client reads it and modifies it
<jamest> then we have a problem :)
<angie> I'm me.  jeff's alter ego is ... well, I should go now.
<jamest> lol
angie (jbailey@HSE-Toronto-ppp287168.sympatico.ca) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> I know his name is NOT jeffrey
<chillywilly> that's a crock
<jamest> I'm pretty sure it is
<chillywilly> it isn't
<chillywilly> are you calling me a liar?
<Harald1> jamest: well actually, that's not a problem with the patch. one just has to make a workaround, when things get saved into the database
<chillywilly> thems fightin words
<jamest> Harald1: i started to play with that tonight but didn't get too far
<jamest> chillywilly: :)
<chillywilly> you craaaazy
<Harald1> jamest: I might take a look, but I'm not sure if I understand enough of forms. How is the transfer from GFObjects into the database done?
<jamest> Harald1: i'll try and find some time over the next few days as this is going to be  a pain in the rear
<jamest> GFObjects never really hold anything
Action: chillywilly reads the python IDL binding
<jamest> they pass it all to the data system
<jamest> even forms not connected to a database create dummy datasources to store their info
<jamest> so the edits would probably need to go into common
<chillywilly> jamest: blackened is the end
<chillywilly> jamest: winter it will send
<chillywilly> jamest: throwing all you see
<chillywilly> jamest: into obscurity
<chillywilly> jamest: death of mother earth
<jamest> am I being cursed?
<chillywilly> jamest: never a rebirth
<chillywilly> jamest: neeeeeeveeeeeeeeerrrr
Action: jamest grabs his lucky mouse
<Harald1> jamest: ok, and what exactly does FieldDisplayHandler do?
<jamest> that's new
<chillywilly> jamest: fiiiire, to being whipping dance of the dead
<chillywilly> jamest: blackened is the end
<chillywilly> jamest: don't you know old school metallica?
<jamest> while an edit is taking place the value of the field is passing into the handler once the edit is completed then value is passed back to the entry which store it in the datasource
<jamest> i removed internal event name translation into lower case today and make a cool error
<jamest> where the event handler events were not being seen
<jamest> so you go to a field , try and edit it (it'd go blank), then the old value would return on exit :)
<chillywilly> jamest: I though you were 'hesh'
reinhard (~rm@N812P008.adsl.highway.telekom.at) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> sup reinhard
<Harald1> hi reinhard
<jamest> chillywilly: i don't know old metalica lyrics
<reinhard> morning
<Harald1> jamest: that's the best errors. how long did it take till you found out, what the problem was?
<jamest> not very
<jamest> as i was profilling code today
<jamest> and string.lower() was one of our major function calls
<chillywilly> jamest: booo
<chillywilly> jamest: you are not a true head banger
<jamest> i knew removing it would probably break things :)
<jamest> odd fact
<chillywilly> I cat you into the firery pit
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> cast too
<chillywilly> but cat it probably something you would more easily understand
<jamest> my test case was calling lower something like 11700 times 
<chillywilly> cat jamest > /dev/null
<jamest> removing it from the encent system saved a few calls
<jamest> however adding a single
<jamest> try:
<jamest>   something(field)
<jamest> except KeyError:
<jamest>   something(lower(field))
<jamest> in one function dropped that to about 1200
<jamest> profiling is good :)
<jamest> sigh s/encent/event
<chillywilly> what did you profile the code with/
<chillywilly> ?
<chillywilly> gprof?
<jamest> no
<jamest> it's built into commons GBaseApp
<chillywilly> oh
<jamest> forms, designer, reports, nav all based upon it
<jamest> just do
<jamest> gfclient --profile file.gfd
<jamest> replace gfclient w/ gnue python app of choice
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> i need sleep
<chillywilly> how does it work?
<jamest> badly
<chillywilly> nah
<chillywilly> sleep is for the weak
<jamest> python has an internal profiler module
<chillywilly> oh, ok
<jamest> you import it , set up a profiler
<chillywilly> which probably uses gprof somehow
<jamest> no
<chillywilly> er, gcc profiling
<chillywilly> that is
<jamest> nope
<chillywilly> sure, python is written in C
<jamest> but the profiler is written in python
<jamest> and uses the way python works to hook into it
<jamest> read the module manual profile section 
<chillywilly> well I dunno

<Harald1> jamest: ok, do you think the idea with saving the newline works?
<jamest> Harald1: i haven't had time to look :(
<Harald1> jamest: ok
<sledge_> i mean, does it work with attributes that define physical positioning, e.g. x="5" y="10" or is it structured like XHTML and other logical markup formats?
<jamest> in it's current state I don't believe it will
<jamest> however I know one of the needs is to fill out preprinted forms which would require exact placement

<drochaid> huff
<dsmith> We use orinoco gold cards.  We have an access point too.  They work well under Linux and OpenBSD with the access point.  obsd and Linux don't get along well in peer mode though.
<dsmith> We use Debian exclusivly for Linux.
<drochaid> well I guess that answers my orinoco and deb lack :)
<dsmith> But we are running unstable and 2.4.x kenrels. I'm not sure how good the Debian stable support is.
<dsmith> Just installed an new package today: airsnort
<drochaid> cool!!!
<dsmith> Cracks WEP encription.
<dsmith> Needs some kernel patches though.  Heven't tried it yet.
<drochaid> an old lappy and pringles tin cracks wep encryption :)
<drochaid> did my comments come through before I was cut off?
<dsmith> Ya.  The (W)eak (E)ncription (P)rotocol is junk.
<drochaid> heh
<dsmith> You can just use a debian package to break it! Sheesh!
<drochaid> I've got a friend [ex-friend recently sadly :(] who refuses to accept that wlans are crackable if you use ipsec instead of wep
<dsmith> I'm having a hard time parsing that.
<drochaid> sorry
<drochaid> I say that a wlan using ipsec is still hackable
<drochaid> he says it's 100% completely secure
<dsmith> Ok.
<dsmith> Well, *nothing* is 100% secure.
<drochaid> my point exactly
<drochaid> it will be a helll of a lot better than wep, but caution and other methods are still needed
<drochaid> I'm popping up and down at the mo while I install another 128mb into my printer...
<drochaid> ok .. Epson are lying through their teeth
<drochaid> my printer [and tech support for it] claim I can use any standard PC66/100/133 DIMM to upgrade it

<dneighbo> which is an rpc abstraction library
<dneighbo> it will support
<ajmitch> drochaid: but with the power of pnet i'm sure we can write it in C# if you really really want ;)
<dneighbo> XML-RPC, SOAP, CORBA probably right away
<dneighbo> but its design is such that it can support any rpc that one wishes to write a driver for
<steu> I'm writing a generic system for distrib objects in corba, and I have found geas, but I not know it
<dneighbo> geas is not really distributed corba objects
<dneighbo> i.e. our approach is to not lock ourselves into things
<dneighbo> the idea is we use rpc as a transport only
<dneighbo> not to actually deal with the objects
<dneighbo> i.e. you end up with a generic rpc object to handle things
<dneighbo> even under the CORBA geas v1 we did things this way
<dneighbo> we didnt pass CORBA objects around
<dneighbo> i.e. you defined objects via a class definition
<dneighbo> that got loaded into GEAS
<dneighbo> but there was not individual IDL for every object
<steu> my problem is not how to write a system like this, but how a medium developer can interoperate with it without knowledge of corba and c++. 
<steu> for example, a VB or delphi developer
<dneighbo> i wont talk to you anymore if you consider delphi and vb developers as equals
<dneighbo> ;)
<steu> sorry :) I'm also a delphi developer (vb is bad... but in italy we have a lot of vb programmer)
<ajmitch> dneighbo: what about java developers?
<drochaid> ajmitch: java is for satanists!!
<dneighbo> we are talking about computer professionals here ajmitch , no need to bring the conversation down :)
<drochaid> and yet, I don't program in java .. weird huh? :)
<ajmitch> drochaid: umm...
<dneighbo> steu our view was that if you merely have an abstraction
<steu> java is good but no skills
<drochaid> oops, misspelled
<drochaid> *santaists ;)
<dneighbo> the developer really need not understand much of CORBA etc
<dneighbo> as they have a lightweight CORBA api to deal with
<ajmitch> drochaid: guess what language we use at uni ;)
<drochaid> ajmitch: swahili?
<dneighbo> instead of having to use CORBA to ineract with every object
<drochaid> ajmitch: you know Opera comes in Scottish Gaelic now? :D
<ajmitch> drochaid: no, maori & english :P we code in java tho
<steu> ok, but I want that a normal developer (form designing, and etc) can use my system with delphi and vb. my system is multiplatform, obviusly
<ajmitch> drochaid: really?
<steu> for example: db server and corba server on linux
<steu> clients on win32
<steu> the problem is the speed of app development
<steu> with this infrastructure
<ajmitch> drochaid: how fluent are you, btw?
<drochaid> ajmitch: nowhere near as fluent as I want to be
<ajmitch> drochaid: right, i'd like to learn some more, but don't have time to make it to the lessons a group runs here
<drochaid> ajmitch: if you have some available cash, Canan developed the Speaking our Language series shown on tv over here a few years ago ... it's available in book, audio and video format from them and a few bookshops
<drochaid> it's a superb series
<ajmitch> yeah, so i've heard
<dneighbo> steu: and the question is
<dneighbo> i.e. what im saying about the basic corba piece 
<dneighbo> what does that have to do with multi platform or using vb/delphi
<dneighbo> any environment supporting corba could use it
<dneighbo> our current geas v1 works this way
<drochaid> ajmitch: http://www.canan.co.uk/sol.htm
<dneighbo> if you ahve any programming environment that can talk CORBA you can use it
<dneighbo> including vb delphi
<dneighbo> infact one company was using it with a java front end
<ajmitch> thx drochaid 
<steu> yes, but I need to integrate my corba objects (C++) in delphi or vb, transparently for programmers that use it. simply like use visual components
<steu> the solutions that now I use is a DLL that use CORBA Objects and comunicate with VB and Delphi
<dneighbo> sigh i think you miss what i am saying altogether
<dneighbo> gnu enterpise doesnt have the goal of being a component company for vb/delphi (which it sounds like what you are looking for)
<dneighbo> so i guess my short answer is that geas has little value in that context
<dneighbo> there are plenty of folks that would discuss such things here as we discuss about anything
<dneighbo> but i think most of those folks are not currently here
<steu> yes yes. but I can't find developers that can use gnue... I find only vb developer.
<steu> now I go. thanks and bye
<dneighbo> no problem
<dneighbo> sorry we couldnt be of more help
<steu> no problem. bye

<jamest> argh!
<drochaid> in fact, I was wondering myself about using delphi/kylix and GNUe for the same system
<jamest> why don't these people use Oracle's SQL*Forms the way nature intended things to be?
<drochaid> but I least I wasn't planning to use delhi to access GNUe :)
<jamest> drochaid: i'm just giving derek a hard time :)
<drochaid> aww, poor derek ;)
<dneighbo> there is some misnomer that i love delphi
<dneighbo> i think some things in delphi are great
<dneighbo> adn i think borland builds much better tools than say m$
<dneighbo> but i dont think gnue should be delphi
<drochaid> I agree, there are a couple of reaonable tools out there that work like kylix
<drochaid> oh wait, that doesn't start an argument ...
<drochaid> dneighbo: you are completely wrong, I think GNUe should be *exactly* like delphi ;)
<ajmitch> you mean GNUe isn't?
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> ajmitch: no, at the moment it's more like a java tool ;)

<drochaid> wb jcater
<jcater> thx
Action: drochaid is putting slack 8 on his new [??] machine
<dneighbo> are you sick
<dneighbo> seriously 
<jcater> he must be mental
<dneighbo> slack is great an all but managing a system like that is hell
<jcater> I finally got rid of slack 8 :)
<dneighbo> i would either
<dneighbo> a. install debian
<dneighbo> b. if you are pro source install gentoo linux
<dneighbo> gentoo is a distro that basically uses the equiv of BSD ports
<drochaid> dneighbo: I've never used debian, and I'm used to MDK/RHL/Slack type environments
<drochaid> what's wrong with the management?
<dneighbo> i.e. its packaging uses source but is more managable than slack
<drochaid> you learn how to use the apps and it's no trouble
<jcater> I loved slack
<jcater> until I had to upgrade
Action: dneighbo cant imagine anything other than something similar to apt
<dneighbo> and that is after trying several different distros
Action: drochaid doesn't care how the majority of apps get on the system
<dneighbo> put it this way i think redhat does a lot correct in way of user presentation and installs
<drochaid> as long as I have absolute compile time control over things like openLDAP and PostgreSQL
<dneighbo> but debian kicks their ass on maintainability
<drochaid> I really do need to play with deb at some point
<jcater> I have no reservations upgrading one of my remote machines from 90 miles away
<drochaid> of course, if I get the other machine up in a few days [I only need a floppy and nic now ... and I think a friend has a spare floppy] I might try it on that
<jcater> with debian that is
<dneighbo> well here is my case
<dneighbo> i have an alpha box running red hat 5.2
<dneighbo> i dont use anymore as its out of date
<dneighbo> i would love to 'upgrade' it
<dneighbo> but i really dont want to spend time doing so
<dneighbo> if it were running debian
<dneighbo> i change an sources.list file
<dneighbo> apt-get update
<dneighbo> apt-get dist upgrade
<dneighbo> and come back in the morning (or a few hours)
<dneighbo> and i have an upgraded box
<drochaid> cool
<drochaid> but isn't development on deb rather dead now? :)
<dneighbo> ?
<jcater> huh?
<dneighbo> hmmm they have to 'reboot' the file server
<dneighbo> guess that means its tiem to go home

<drochaid> back
<drochaid> ok, seriously tho

<chillywilly> dude, debian rocks
<chillywilly> the stable version is a bit old
<chillywilly> but testing is a nice compromise
<chillywilly> and sid is for people who like to live on the edge
<chillywilly> but it has the most packages of any distro, is built by the community, has free software guidelines, is easy to maintain, and is upgradable like a mofo
<nickr> One wonders how the impression that the development is dead could be had
<nickr> er
<jcater> gawd
<drochaid> and is anyone willing to talk me through the install and general use? or at least point me to some semi readble docs?
Action: jcater forgets how much graphics design tools under linux truly suck the big one
<drochaid> lol jcater
<drochaid> that's why I still use windows dood
<jcater> I'd be 100% linux if it wasn't for QuarkXPress / Freehand / Illustrator / Photoshop
<jcater> I'm ALMOST happy w/the photoshop replacements under linux
<jcater> especially ImageMagick
<chillywilly> boohoo
<drochaid> it doesn't do it for me
<chillywilly> gimp is the photoshop replacement bitch
<jcater> chillywilly: I've used gimp
<jcater> KWord is the closest thing to PageMaker / QuarkXPress we have
<drochaid> KWord?? :o
<chillywilly> balah
Action: drochaid uses openoffice
<drochaid> on windows :)
<jcater> sodipodi and Kontour look like they'll contend w/Illustrator and Freehand
<jcater> but not quite yet
<jcater> drochaid: I was referring to page layout
<nickr> there is nothing even similar to Quark on Linux
<jcater> not ot word processing
<jcater> kword is the closest thing
<drochaid> openoffice doesn't do word processing, it does page layout
<jcater> as it is a frame-based application
<nickr> sodipodi is missing the ease of use and 'togetherness' of Illustrator
<jcater> drochaid: not by most definitions
<drochaid> you're reffering to dtp
<drochaid> nah
<jcater> yes I am
<jcater> referring to dtp
<drochaid> textual processing like wordperfect for DOS or emacs is wordprocessing
<drochaid> word, openwrite [??] wordpro etc are page layout
<drochaid> and pagemaker, express etc are dtp
<nickr> uh
<nickr> Not
<jcater> well then openoffice is the poorest excuse for a page layout program I've seen
<nickr> I don't agree with that definition
<jcater> but I still maintain that word and family ARE NOT page layout
<jcater> the point of dtp is layout
<drochaid> they are page layout
<drochaid> they allow you to lay objects out on the page
<nickr> dtp implies that you press on your desktop also
<drochaid> no, dtp is a step further
<nickr> page layout is just the first part of publishing
<jcater> I concur with nickr's definition
<jcater> or start of one
<nickr> quark is a page layout tool that you could use for DTP
<drochaid> nickr: which word etc are a crossbreed of dtp and wordprocessing
<nickr> but also for non dtp press
<drochaid> nickr: dtp has nothing to do with offset lithos .. it's the method of page creation, not page production
<nickr> Desk Top Publishing
<nickr> its the entire process
<nickr> not just layout 
<jcater> word et al are word processors that have become overly bloated with wysiwyg
<drochaid> no, it's only a single stage in the entire process
<jcater> but that doesn't fall into my definition of "layout"
<drochaid> jcater: which is why they are called page layout
<jcater> wysiwyg != page layout
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> it does
<nickr> word is a word processor with some layout ability
<nickr> quark is a layout system that can be used for dtp
<drochaid> no, emacs is wordprocessing, word is page layout
<nickr> among other things
<drochaid> express is dtp
<jcater> drochaid: emacs is text processing
<drochaid> uh .. s/text/word .. same thing dood
<jcater> not hardly
<nickr> emacs is an editor with some word processing ability
<drochaid> text is merely a sequence of words
<jcater> word processing implies the flow of text
<drochaid> no, word processing implies the processing of text
<jcater> um, that fits in with my argument :)
<drochaid> a text flow package implies the flow of text

<psu> hi bobacus
<bobacus> hi
<psu> a fellow NTL customer, too 
<psu> even if I can't get broadband yet ;-)
<psu> any gnue questions, or just lurking like the rest of us ? ;-)
<nickr> <its dark in here, you're likely to be eaten by a grue>
<bobacus> well, I came across gnue on the web a couple of weeks ago, and it looks like an exciting development
<bobacus> particularly if it can replace MS Access :)
<psu> well, it's a bit more than that (or will be, anyway)
<psu> I am (partially) responsible for spreading that 
<bobacus> yep, i've had a look at the web site - it's just that the way i think gnue would particularly benefit me would be by taking away my dependency on access
<bobacus> ATM I'm trying to set up the designer and forms tools on my debian (sid) box,
<psu> the beauty of GNUe Forms as an Access replacement is that you get to use *your* choice of "real" back end database
<psu> be it postgresql, SAP-DB, mysql, firebird or one of the non-free "famous names" DBs
<psu> bobacus - I'm not sure how "solid" the debs are at the moment - I know that some of our lurkers who are Debian maintainers 
<psu> don't think they are wonderful
<psu> but should be enough to get you started
<nickr> the debs are being dropped from the distirbution I think because the latest ones are unbuildable
<psu> It's a tad embaressing for a free software project (and a GNU project at that), but the "easiest" platform to install on at the moment is M$ Windows
<psu> just grab the setup.exe and go 
Action: ra3vat wonders why so many peoples do not like access that much?
<psu> bobacus - I suspect you may be better installing from source on Debian GNU/Linux 
<bobacus> psu: okay, will try that
<psu> I don't believe the dependancies are too awful to hack manually
<psu> and are reducing anyway ;-)
<nickr> bobacus: installing from CVS is very easy
<psu> ra3vat - I think it's fair to say that M$ Access is a "toy" rather than a real RDMBS
<psu> but it gets (ab)used for fairly big d/b jobs because 
<psu> most people on Win platforms have it as part of Office 
<nickr> Access also uses VB most of the time
<psu> and hence it is "free" (as in beer) to them
<psu> The timesheet system at work for instance is all done in M$ Access 
<nickr> I get to learn MS Access soon
<bobacus> ra3vat - i don't like the Access (97) GUI very much - would prefer hierchical polymorphic containers so i can organise forms and queries better
<nickr> that should be, how do you say, fun?
<ra3vat> psu: is there any info like well known Why-not-Mysql only about Access?
<psu> work timesheets are a classic example of (ab)using a file-based d/b when we really need a (small) db server
<psu> there's some very nify VBA code in there to do replication to everyone's PCs
<psu> to keep everything in sync
<ra3vat> psu: i'm forced somehow to use it with the reason described above
<ra3vat> psu: how to find where it exceeds its "toy" limit?
<bobacus> ra3vat: access does horrible locking stuff with its mdb files, which seems to interact badly with samba, afaict
<bobacus> ra3vat: but it can be used with other back-ends via ODBC
<psu> ra3vat - personally, I would say that whenever you go beyond single user
<psu> Acess started as a single user d/b
<psu> and had mutli-user overlaid 
<psu> a bit like Windows, really
<psu> and it shows
<psu> For *real* MS Access horror stories
<psu> I suggest you ask Toyman
<psu> ToyMan even
<psu> "his stories will freeze your very bone marrow" ;-)
<psu> gotta go - bbl
<ra3vat> bobacus: in this case it works only as a frontend tool, right?

<bobacus> I'm playing with Forms Designer at the moment, but I don't seem to be getting very far. How should I create a data source?
<bobacus> (I'm trying to connect to a MySQL database BTW)
<psu> look at connections.conf
<drochaid> I think everyones hiding now you asked that :)
<psu> that has several predefined connections 
<psu> find the one for MySQL & change u/name, p/w etc to your setup
<psu> always assuming you have't already ;-)
<bobacus> okay I set that up and I can authenticate using the designer, but I can't edit the data sources using it

<bobacus> What I've tried to do, is to create a new Data Source, and opened the Data Source Editor. But I don't see how to associate this with anything.
<psu> warning - I am almost cratinly the worst person to talk to 
<psu> but the only one here at the moment ;-)
<psu> have you tried the Designer wizards? They do a fairly good job of auto 
<psu> setting up, so I'm told
<psu> just point them at a table in a d/b & away they go
<bobacus> I'll give them a try...
<psu> I know the guys are (rightly) proud of the wizards
<psu> to the extent that they find it quicker to fire up designer & run a wizard 
<psu> for a one-shot form 
<psu> than have to work out the SQL by hand 
<drochaid> we have wizards? :o
Action: drochaid never spotted them
<bobacus> I just tried the Simple Form Wizard, and got to "Select Base Table/Source", selected the table I wanted, and pressed 'Continue', but
<derek> um
<derek> i assume your dataconnection is bad

<derek> and you have the python mysql driver installed?
<derek> you running cvs?
<derek> if so can you do me a favor?
<bobacus> I am running CVS
<bobacus> i mean the cvs version of gnue of course

<derek> so lets start there
<derek> do
<derek> python2.1
<derek> type that
<derek> then in python type
<bobacus> okay, btw I think python is using /usr/lib/python2.1 because

<derek> try

<bobacus> fine

<derek> cool
<derek> seems you python2.1 dependencies are probably good
<derek> exit out of python shell
<derek> try mysql -h localhost personal
<derek> and tell me if you can connect ok
<bobacus> no I need to use 'mysql -u rob -p -h localhost personal' and then enter the password :)
<derek> that works :)
<derek> i.e. if that works you should be cool
<derek> can you tell me a table and two fields in that table for the personal database
<bobacus> Yep, table "Person" and columns "person_id" and "surname"

<derek> http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/tester.gfd

<derek> and paste output here
<bobacus> that won't work cos I only installed it today :) i'll use find...
<bobacus> /usr/src/gnue/cvs/gnue/forms/client/gfcvs
<bobacus> so I'll run that with tester.gfd as parameter?
<bobacus> okay, if I modify tester.gfd like this:
<bobacus> -  <datasource prequery="" cache="5" database="personal" name="dtsrcphone_type"
<bobacus> -              table="person"/>
<bobacus> +  <datasource prequery="" cache="5" database="Personal" name="dtsrcphone_type"
<bobacus> +              table="Person"/>
<bobacus> then it opens a form, but doesn't show any data. There are 2 records in the table (checked through mysql cli)
<derek> ok with form open
<derek> click on the little button that paper with pen writing on it
<derek> then click on the little button that has paper with magnifying glass
<derek> do you see your data?
<bobacus> yes I do...i was expecting it to show all records by default
<derek> you can do that by changing that datasource tag to have a 
<derek> prequery=""
<derek> in it
<bobacus> But it's already got that.
<derek> hmmm
<derek> thats right i think cvs is broked on prequery :)
Action: derek keeps forgetting to submit the bug report :)
<bobacus> :)
<derek> normally that prequery="" would make it so your data is autoqueried on start up

Action: drochaid is off to bed
<derek>   The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite diet is either adventurers or enchanters, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its horrible fear of light. No grues have ever been seen by the light of day, and only a few have been observed in their underground lairs. Of those who have seen grues, few ever survived their fearsome jaws to tell the tale.
<derek> Grues have sharp claws and fangs, and an uncontrollable tendency to slaver and gurgle. They are certainly the most evil-tempered of all creatures; to say they are touchy is a dangerous understatement. "Sour as a grue" is a common expression, even among themselves.
<drochaid> what be from that derek?
<derek> i know nickr i guess ;)
<nickr> thats why derek is the masta
<derek> I would tell you it was from the Frobozzica, but i assume that would only result in more questions
<nickr> hehe
<chillywilly> what's the frobozzica?
<chillywilly> hehe, had to ask
<chillywilly> you brought it on yourself

<jcater> wtf!?!?!?!?!
<jcater> derek: wasn't mdean using pysablot?
<jcater> or was he using sablotron from the command line?
<chillywilly> wtf is pysablot?
<chillywilly> xml parser?
<jcater> xslt
<chillywilly> oh
<jcater> Description: an XSL processor fully implemented in C++
<jcater>  Sablotron is an XSL processor fully implemented in C++.
<jcater>  .
<jcater>  The goal of this project is to create a reliable and
<jcater>  fast XSLT processor conforming to the W3C specification, which is
<jcater>  available for public and can be used as a base for multiplatform XML
<jcater>  data distribution systems.
<jcater>  .
<jcater>  This package includes Sablotron binaries, which need libsablot0 to work.
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> derek: ah, nevermind
<nickr> uh, you guys do know that pysablot was last released in nov 2000?
<nickr> and that its still alpha?
<jcater> I forget w/debian you have to explicitly install -dev stuff to get headers
<jcater> nickr: well, all it is is a wrapper to sablotron
<jcater> so there's not much to it iirc
<nickr> I'll make a deb of it, but I don't think I should put it in the debian archive if upstream is dead
<derek> :)
<derek> pysablot :)
Action: chillywilly is away: church
<jcater> upstream is dead?"
<derek> no more woody
<derek> i.e. they want to release woody as stable on may 1st (or so is the rumor)
<jcater> sure
<derek> those they are blocking all upstream packaging
<jcater> but there's sid right
<derek> if im understanding correctly?
<jcater> or is sid blocked too?
<derek> no should only be woody
<nickr> Pysablot looks pretty dead to me
<derek> ?
<derek> any reason you think its dead?
<jcater> nickr: there's not really much to it to maintain
<nickr> yes, aj said he wants to release may1
<derek> i mean all it is a wrapper to sablotron
<derek> and from what i have used it works w/o issue
<nickr> derek: because its listed as alpha and the only release was nov 2000
<derek> and seemed to have all functionality
<derek> so unless sablotron changes i wouldnt expect a lot from pysablot to change
<derek> i am willing to contact the maintainer of pysablot to see if they have abandoned it or not
<nickr> can you first veryfy what I'm seeing about its deadness?
<derek> thats what i mean
<derek> i will contact the project lead there and say is pysablot dead
<derek> if he says yes i will probably see if he is willing to turn it over
<derek> call me sick but i like it :)
<nickr> whoa, no docs or anything
<nickr> he
<nickr> h
<nickr> well if there is an upstream maintainer I'll take it on
<nickr> it looks pretty trivial

<derek> ok pysablot is probably really dead
<derek> er soory
<derek> misread that
<nickr> ?
<derek>  The very first version of Python extension to Sablotron was created as soon as in May 2000 but it never reached a stable state. The first seriouse attempt is then Guenter Radestock's Sab-pyth  released in October 2000. The latest version is 0.52 and the extension is well documented.
<derek> i read on sablotron page thinking that the first version was pysablot
<derek> but next paragraph reads
<derek>  Just a few weeks after Guenter, Andreas Jung announced his Python bindings for Sablotron called PySablot. The current version is 0.1 and it is still supposed to be an alpha version.     .
<nickr> yea
<derek> iirc there were only like 2 or 3 xslt packages for python
<derek> sablotron and pysablot were the only combo that were BOTH GPL
<derek> i also liked that sablotron is maintained by a commercial company that puts money into the development
<nickr> python 4suite is free
<nickr> and maintained
<derek> i would go as far as saying if pysablot isnt maintained still it might be worth maintaining it
<nickr> hm.
<derek> im really rather impressed with the gingerall folks
<derek> fwiw i suppose in reports and such we could treat it like db drivers
<derek> where you can use your 'favorite' xslt engine
<derek> to me i think one issue with 4suite
<jcater> derek: already there :)
<derek> is it is a REAL suite
<derek> i.e. its a LOT of junk we dont use
<derek> although it does have
<derek>  4ODS is a Python implementation of the ODMG 3.0 object database standard. Different drivers can be plugged in to 4ODS to provide back-end storage, even in other models such as relational.
