<chillywilly> for the record if you hack the klogd config file and do KLOGD="-c 4" it will turn off the crap on the console

<psu> ok, web site has been updated to include brief descriptions 
<psu> of the non-main Forms clients 
<psu> available via http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/forms.php
<psu> Let me know of any omissions or corrections needed 
<jcater> err
<jcater> that's a little confusing to me
<psu> Is there a "freedom-loving" name for Java?
<jcater> but maybe that's because I'm a developer
<jcater> the Curses and GTK are slightly different than the others
<jcater> java, emca, php are separate forms clients
<jcater> curses, gtk, and wx are modes of our main, reference client
<jamest> yeah
<jamest> i think it should be grouped together
Action: psu will re-word accordingly
<jamest> and said that it supports wx, gtk, curses
<jamest> actually
<jamest> the java client is so old i bet it'd be a major overhaul to get it to even remotely function
<jcater> dude
<jcater> have you looked at jforms
<jcater> there's no code in there
<jcater> it's all files w/blank class defs iirc
<jamest> if that's the case then I'd be tempted to drop it
<jcater> we need to look at the whole way we're handling this
<jcater> I'm not sure this is clear
Action: psu will try again
<psu> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/forms.php
<psu> I can see a case for not mentioning the "Other Forms Clients" at all
<psu> but they exist, even if
<Mr_You> JForms is Java no?  who is working on that?
<psu> only as prototypes (jscript)
<psu> Mr_You: No-one. 
<psu> or (like the Java) as failed experiments to be kept around as an awful warning ;-)
<Mr_You> ahh
<jamest> maybe we shouldn't mention them
<Mr_You> Jans javascript code could replace JForms
<jamest> as people will try them out and they ask about them
<jamest> until we have a live one
<Mr_You> yeah but its cvs james, no releases ;-)
<Mr_You> they get what they deserve ;-)
<jamest> i mean not on the main page
<jamest> as no one is working on java one so why mention it
<Mr_You> yeah
<Mr_You> maybe archive it, or create an "old" directory.. for failed attempts ;-)
<psu> well, the other Forms clients are fairly well hidden
<psu> Not on the status page, not on the left toolbar, etc
<psu> Only accessible from /tools/forms.php

<psu> masta may have some ideas
<Mr_You> for a second, I looked around to see if you could "authenticate" groups, but I couldn't find anything in pam.
<jcater> psu: my issue is with "official" vs "other people's implementations"
<jcater> as jsforms != the html mode for gnue-forms
Action: jcater is just worried about confusion
<Mr_You> it would require local machine specific group checking
<Mr_You> what do you mean jsforms != html moe for gnue-forms?
<Mr_You> what is then?
<jcater> I dunno what it is
<Mr_You> so why not jsforms?
<jcater> we have planned all along to have an html mode for gnue-forms
<jcater> that's no secret
<Mr_You> yeah but no one has put anytime or ideas into it cept me and Jan, AFAIK
<Mr_You> and the best thing we came up with was using js.
<jcater> I'm not saying don't do jsforms.. go for it
<jcater> I never said that
<Mr_You> but saying its not going to be included is kinda a time waster
<jcater> included?
<jcater> included in what?
<revDeke> my opinion is that we have 3 distinct things (perhaps 4)
<Mr_You> let me put it this way...you won't create a sufficient HTML client WITHOUT JS
<jcater> Mr_You: maybe so
<Mr_You> inclued as a GNUe Forms client.
<jcater> but the jsforms plans do not hold up to the reference implementation needs
<Mr_You> jcater: maybe you'd prefer active-x?  ;-)
<revDeke> 1. UI Drivers - (python based drop in drivers, curses, pygtk2, wx fit this bill) that are official
<jcater> at least, if they will require appserver
<jcater> as the webpage reads
<jcater> I mean, that's completely useless for me
<Mr_You> well you gotta start somewhere
<jcater> we have
<revDeke> 2. Forms Implemenations - complete rewrites of forms that are not drivers that are official
<jcater> and it's called gnue-common
<jcater> and gnue-forms.uidriver.base
<revDeke> 3. same thing as 1 only non official
<Mr_You> umm
<revDeke> 4. same thing as 2 only non offical
<Mr_You> that would be fine to implement a python-based CGI for "2-tier"-like connectivity
<Mr_You> but its not going to be persistent
<revDeke> i think that 3 and 4 dont belong on the gnue.org website except maybe as links to non official gnue stuff
<jcater> like hell its not
<Mr_You> umm
<psu> official == in our CVS, or likely to be?
<revDeke> 1 and 2 belong there but need to be distinct
<Mr_You> tell me how you will make HTTP persistent using CGI?
<revDeke> as there is a difference between running gnue-forms -u gtk2 someform.gfd
<revDeke> and running
<revDeke> phpforms someform.gfd
<revDeke> if that makes sense
<jcater> Mr_You: you added the CGI part
<Mr_You> jcater: how else would you connect to a DB from an "HTML client"?
<Mr_You> way I see it this.. atleast for the immediate future:
<revDeke> psu: im not sure how to define official
<revDeke> ultimately it should be if its in our cvs its 'official'
<Mr_You> for unencrypted 2-tier LAN service you could use local machine clients..
<revDeke> but i think jcater and jamest mentioned that perhaps the java version shouldnt be in there anymore
<revDeke> as its not maintained
<revDeke> and is nearly worthless now
<Mr_You> for encrypted 3-tier WAN service over the net, you could use appserver and HTML or local machine clients.
<jcater> Mr_You: that's not our vision, though
<jcater> that defeats the mission
<jcater> "All our tools can be used together or independently"
<revDeke> in the future i would say the only kind of java implementation that coudl be official woudl be one that used all free software 
<revDeke> i.e. a free java virtual machine and toolkits
<Mr_You> jcater: but why would you use an HTML client AND local clients in the same "group?
<jcater> huh?
<revDeke> Mr_You: i think you are overseeing the basic principles of gnue
<revDeke> and looking with far too narrow of a scope
<jcater> why would I use curses, win32, and gtk in the same group then?
<jcater> because of different user's needs
<revDeke> certainly one could make an HTML client that did not require apserver
<Mr_You> I'm trying to understand how you would use HTML client independently
<revDeke> er appserver
<revDeke> Mr_You: that wasnt the point
<revDeke> the point is you could use an HTML client w/ or w/o appserver
<revDeke> w/ or w/o reporter
<revDeke> w/ or w/o integrator
<Mr_You> rev: absolutely, but lets talk technical
<revDeke> just like you should be able to use appserver w/o ANY forms implementation
<Mr_You> how is it POSSIBLE to use an HTML client without middleware?
<revDeke> um
<Mr_You> HTML client can't talk to the DB directly
<revDeke> how is it possible to write client server applications w/o middleware?
<revDeke> i.e. i dont see how middleware is 'special'
<revDeke> er html
<revDeke> the UIhtml.py driver for forms
<Mr_You> I don't see what middleware is being used in a 2-tier setup.. its only 2 hehe
<revDeke> would be what the 'middleware' would become
<revDeke> the browser kind of becomes the 'toolkit' (like wx or gtk)
<Mr_You> I'm not refering to "internal middleware"
<revDeke> Mr_You: thats my point
<Mr_You> man this is frustrating
<revDeke> im not seeing WHY you need middleware
<Mr_You> lets get on the same page
<jcater> Mr_You: I'm not discouraging any of y'all from doing the jsforms thing
<revDeke> at one time someone was writing an UIhtml.py (its in cvs if i remember correctly)
<jcater> I never said that
<Mr_You> what is the gripe?  that HTML client requires appserver and it won't run alone in 2-tier setup, correct?
<jcater> I just said we have plans for a UIhtml client
<revDeke> that basically used forms and was just a driver
<revDeke> Mr_You: the gripe is some folks dont want an EXTRA layer called appserver
<Mr_You> rev: ok
<revDeke> by forcing the client to use appserver you are forcing htem to use a layer they feel is unnecessary
<Mr_You> rev: so tell me now, how you would expect to get persistent connections using a webserver and HTML client?
<revDeke> much like the wx client
<revDeke> i woudl expect the html client
<revDeke> to allow use of appserver or allow use of common db system directly
<revDeke> where the forms developer makes that decision
<Mr_You> but you can't have persistent connections with "common db system directly"
Action: revDeke could be wrong, but i think that was the crux of jcaters argument
<Mr_You> and it still requires a web-server, your middleware/extra component
<jcater> Mr_You: I connect to websites everyday
<jcater> that have database backends
<jcater> and my browswer isn't talking to their database
<revDeke> like all crapp^H^H^H^H web applications you often have to 'fake' your persistence
<Mr_You> jcater: it is "persistent-like" it is not truly persistent.
<jcater> well
<jcater> lemme tell you
<revDeke> again i STRONGLY suggest you look at UIhtml.py
<jcater> I'm not opening up a pipe back to my database
<jcater> for a remote web browser to use
<jcater> :)
<revDeke> jcater: chicken
<Mr_You> correct... so what I'm saying is.. you can't create an HTML client WITHOUT extra components, which in this case it would require APPSERVER OR Apache/webserver.. it wouldn't work without one or the other
<jcater> Mr_You: yes it can
<Mr_You> how so?
<ra3vat> psu: "here" link from http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/jsforms.php is broken
<psu> ra3vat: thanks
<Mr_You> persistent-like is a whole other ballgame
<Mr_You> its going to be a PITA to code.. IMO
<jcater> um
<jcater> as opposed to javascript
<jcater> that opens connections back to home office
<jcater> ?
<jcater> :)
<Mr_You> javascript is just implementing xmlrpc
<Mr_You> I'm still waiting for your explaination
<jcater> Mr_You: I've pasted links to my rough outline many times
<jcater> lemme dig it up
<Mr_You> no no
<Mr_You> I'm refering to your response "<jcater> Mr_You: yes it can"
<Mr_You> how is it possible to run an HTML client without a webserver?
<jcater> Mr_You: gnue-forms can stand by itself and communicate back to a webbrowser
<jcater> there's no magic to that
<Mr_You> so gnue-common has a builtin webserver now?
<jcater> ya
<Mr_You> ok, and this isn't news worth mentioning?
<jcater> um
<jcater> it's part of python's library
<Mr_You> ok
<jcater> it formed the basis
<Mr_You> frustrating again
<jcater> of the initial gnurpc implementation
<jcater> how do you think
<Mr_You> its either in gnue-common or is planned to be in gnue-common or what?
<jcater> gnue-common is serving xmlrpc calls?
<Mr_You> ok ok
<jcater> not by magic
<Mr_You> so 
<revDeke> hmmm isnt magic just science unexplained :)
<Mr_You> this is bizare
<jcater> psu: I have one concern/suggestion
<revDeke> so if he didnt know that python had webserver capabilities it could be construed as /magic/ no?
<revDeke> ;)
<jcater> I strongly feel, whatever appoach we take w/the various forms
<jcater> ...user
<Mr_You> so where would this gnue-common webserver code be executed?  on the local machine?
<Mr_You> you would startup the gnue-web-server on the db machine?
<Mr_You> I'm very aware that many programming languages have http libraries.
<jcater> pk, back
<Mr_You> way I look at it is this... create a jsforms client that does xmlrpc then when the "gnue-web-server" begins to work you just integrate it with the javascript client.. cause javascript is going to be required for screen writes.
<jcater> psu: I strongly feel, whatever appoach we take w/the various forms
<jcater> the website layout should be more like
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/forms/.......
<jcater> e.g., 
<jcater> you have 
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/curses
<jcater> this could just as well refer to the curses navigator client
<Mr_You> no one has explained to me how you can run webserver code without a webserver.
<jcater> you would be your own webserver
<Mr_You> you mean gnue would have a webserver
<jcater> gnue has a webserver
<jcater> I don't understand why you're arguing with me
<jcater> I don't even understand what this is about
<Mr_You> why not just build the webserver into appserver?
<jcater> um
<jcater> why?
<Mr_You> I'm trying to figure out the roadmap!
<jcater> then just build forms into appserver while you're at it
<Mr_You> and the argument is still this..
<jcater> if the other tools can use the code, it goes in common
<jcater> we all agree to that so far
<Mr_You> formsclients shouldn't require extra software for 2-tier setup.. I'm ASKING YOU.. HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE with HTML client?  ITS NOT.
<Mr_You> AFAICS
<Mr_You> understand?
<Mr_You> ie. it requires a webserver or appserver.. either way one is required, you said it wasn't, but I haven't heard how.
<Mr_You> you can't build an HTML 2-tier client without something executing and connecting to the DB.. that ain't gonna be the browser, like you mentioned.
<Mr_You> if I'm wrong, correct me already.
<jcater> 2 tier refers to database access
<jcater> I never said "no server of any type"
<jcater> app server != a general purpose server like a webserver
<Mr_You> you said it would work without appserver or webserver.
<jcater> as I said earlier
<Mr_You> "yes it can" was your response to mine.
<revDeke> btw: psu i agree with jason on tools/curses and such
<jcater> ok, maybe I misunderstood you 
<jcater> you said apache/webserver
<jcater> so I thought you meant cgi + apache
<jcater> which is not the case
<jcater> but I also said
<jcater> early on
<jamest> mod_forms :)
<jcater> the gnue-forms client can be its own server
<Mr_You> I said apache/webserver because if a webservr is required it should be able to use apache
<Mr_You> thats good too
<Mr_You> so you see.. I stand by my thoughts that js is required for dynamic screen writes.. you build the layout code into JS then add on xmlrpc and 2-tier connectivity
<jcater> and I said that's great
<jcater> I'm not discouraging jsforms
<Mr_You> the 2-tier connectivity requires backend coding just as the xmlrpc route does also.
<Mr_You> but you just can't have an HTML client with both functionalities until both backends are coded.
<Mr_You> I understand ya'lls point now.
<Mr_You> it comes down to the requirement of configuring and running appserver vs the requirement of configuring and running a webserver.
<Mr_You> and the only answer I see is that one will have to come later at the expensive of the other
<jcater> I wasn't asking for an answer about anything
<jcater> I don't remember asking a question
<Mr_You> and I could be wrong, but appserver+jsforms is further along than webserver+jsforms
<jcater> webserver+jsforms?
<jcater> who said anything about webserver+jsforms
<jcater> ?
<Mr_You> oh man
<jcater> I think that's where we're getting confused
<ajmitch> morning
<Mr_You> s/webserver/gnue-web-server
<Mr_You> that better?
<jcater> s/jsforms/html client
<jcater> that's better
<Mr_You> why not call it jsforms?
Action: revDeke remembers at one time a UIhtml.py floating around
<revDeke> that seemed to acutally kind of work
<Mr_You> and you said webserver was confusing not jsforms wtf?
<revDeke> it required webware or something
<ajmitch> did UIwebware.py ever work?
<Mr_You> uggh
<Mr_You> nm
<revDeke> yeah that one
Action: ajmitch is into webware stuff
Action: revDeke thought it kind of worked
<Mr_You> I don't understand why I keep getting a response that a webserver isn't required for html client hehe
<jcater> what?
Action: revDeke would like to see a python/html implemenation first at it should require LEAST amount of work
<jcater> you aren't
<jcater> you never did
<Mr_You> yer confusing the hell out of me, I'm trying to lay it out as simple as possible
<revDeke> rather than a full forms rewrite in javascript or php
<jcater> you said
<Mr_You> you're not going to have a dynamic client with JS
<jcater> and I could be wrong, but appserver+jsforms is further along than webserver+jsforms
<revDeke> but thats just me, im not writing the the client so its not for me to dictate
<ajmitch> revDeke: well, that was what the webware one was like, no?
<jcater> and I said? webserver+jsforms
<jcater> it should be 
<revDeke> ajmitch: yes
<jcater> .... and I could be wrong, but appserver+jsforms is further along than webserver+html client
<jcater> which I kind of disagree with as well
<jcater> but that's another story
<Mr_You> revDeke: a python/html client would still require javascript for any sort of dynamic on screen functionality.
<ajmitch> tho it'd ideally need js for client-side processing of things like input masks, keystrokes, etc
<ajmitch> as Mr_You said :)
<jcater> and I keep on saying, I'm not discouraging/competing w/jsforms
<jcater> it's a good idea
<jcater> go for it
Action: ajmitch thinks there is a degree of confusion here
<Mr_You> ajmitch: correct, so why not write all of the layout in JS I say.. ;-0
<Mr_You> anyways.. this is pointless.. siesel has a good deal of work done on the jsforms client and its looking good
<jcater> great!
<jcater> I'm glad
<Mr_You> slap on some sort of cgi component and you have eliminated your appserver requirement
<Mr_You> easy as that ;-)
<Mr_You> from what I understand ya'll are talking about having a client that requires a backend cgi component to do most of the forms layout and processing.. and having a "lite weight" javascript functionality to maintain dynamic screen writes and persistent-like capability..
<Mr_You> going the route that has been taken, you can reuse the js code for the 2-tier connectivity.
<jcater> not at all!
<jcater> but I give up
<jcater> y'all do your thing
<Mr_You> well jason, I'm sorry, but no one has explained to me how 2-tier connectivity will be done without the use of some sort of "CGI"
<jcater> why do I have to design the html client right here in IRC?
<jcater> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/HTMLClient.txt
<jcater> are my plans
<Mr_You> because we've been discussing this everyone keeps their comments to themselves?
<jcater> what?
siesel (jan@dial-194-8-205-204.netcologne.de) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel> hi all
<Mr_You> hi
<Mr_You> that last comment was wrong, my bad.
<Mr_You> what I meant to say..
<Mr_You> is how do you plan on not using js?
<jcater> sigh
<siesel> cool. seems like web clients are being discussed
Action: Mr_You sighs too.
<revDeke> btw: Mr_You i never said that js couldnt be used in a python client
<revDeke> for html
<revDeke> i.e. i would expect it
<Mr_You> rev and all
<Mr_You> lets not just expect it... it is REQUIRED for dynamic screen writes
<jcater> revDeke: my vision on that is
<jcater> the html client would NOT require JS
<jcater> but if there
<revDeke> i think you could do that
<jcater> it could take advantage of it
<Mr_You> ok
<revDeke> the biggest thing that becomes an issue
<Mr_You> I understand more now.
<revDeke> is client side triggers
<jcater> dudes
<jcater> I never said every detail had been worked out
<Mr_You> I personally don't want to touch a forms client that has to reload the screen every click or key stroke or whatever.. I would use a js client 
<revDeke> but the data stuff and such i see no problems
<jcater> Mr_You: great!
<Mr_You> jason: no problem
<jcater> neither would I
Action: revDeke thinks its an implementation detail not an architectural one
<Mr_You> I'm trying to explain why JS is in our best interest for the enduser
<ajmitch> revDeke: aye
<revDeke> as jcater points out, we dont have to design it here today
<jcater> Mr_You: let me state this
<jcater> I would fully expect y'alls jsforms to be a better experience for the end-user
<jcater> BECAUSE
<jcater> it is a specific, targeted version of forms
<jcater> BUT
<Mr_You> now tell me why you would not want to use JS
<jcater> that doesn't mean we don't want a version using our gnue-forms core
<jcater> Mr_You: because support for JS is very, very lackluster/unstandard
<jcater> I never said we wouldn't use it... just not require it
<Mr_You> bigger issue than all of this is triggers in HTML client..
<jcater> sigh
<jcater> I'm ending this discussion right now
<jcater> we are not designing this today
<jcater> I am happy you guys are doing a jsforms client
<jcater> I am
<jcater> another implementation will keep us in check
<Mr_You> well I'm not a coding madman like jan
<jcater> and it will be something very useful
<jcater> that doesn't negate use having a more general purpose one in gnue-forms
<jcater> even if it's not as robust/user friendly
<dsmith> One of the problems of js is that it is different for every browser.  Some don't even support it (like dillo).
<jcater> now, that's all I have to say on the matter
Action: jcater out
<Mr_You> I'll say this... I expect to leave it up to the developer (siesel) as to the point of where incompatibilities become an issue
<Mr_You> between browsers on whether to code that functionality or not.
<jcater> psu: did you catch my comment on the site layout
<jcater> wrt forms/
<jcater> ?
<psu> jcater: I have already fixed to distinguish modes of ref client
<psu> and "other" clients
<psu> Just need to be told which of the "other" clients we regard as unofficial at the moment
<psu> and I'll remove them completely
<jcater> I think it's safe to say Java
<jcater> has jan abandoned phpforms in favor of jsforms?
<jcater> or are those both still being developed?
<jcater> siesel?
<Mr_You> I dunno if I should mention this on the list, but we could begin group and user based access control using the system group file (requiring local system lookup) or internal objects.
<siesel> just one word to the whole stuff: IMHO 1. choices are good 2. there has to be ONE standart implementation (more than one will allways become unmaintainted) 3. 
<jcater> 3. ???
<jcater> is that like
<jcater> 1. Write GNUe
<jcater> 2. ???
<jcater> 3. Profit?
<jcater> ;)
<Mr_You> heh
<Mr_You> 3. ??
<Mr_You> 4. Profit
<siesel> 3. jsforms should be so modular that you can easily implement three different setups: a) standalone jsforms b) jsforms with preloaded data, +...  c) ... d) just take triggers from jsforms the rest will keep on the server side (php or python or perl ....)
<Mr_You> maybe.. lik datasources.. we could also have access list, would be an XML file.. and use internal objects/group file to find out who is a part of which.
<ajmitch> jcater: CSV db driver inherit from _static ?
<siesel> jcater: 3. Profit like in joining Greanpeace.
<jcater> siesel: :)
<revDeke> btw: i dont know if anyone caught my CSV driver comment
<ajmitch> revDeke: i did
<jcater> revDeke: no
<Mr_You> anyone comments about what I mentioned?
<jcater> when was it said?
Action: siesel is listening
<ajmitch> revDeke: you said you didn't want it to be complex
<revDeke> i think good things were discussed, but im curious about making db driver more complex than need be
<ajmitch> revDeke: how owuld it be more complex?
<Mr_You> rev: when is smallbiz gonna be in the cvs?
<revDeke> i.e. some of the things sounded more like 'integrator' issues than db driver issues
Action: ajmitch will probably work on it after work today
<jcater> revDeke: possibly
<revDeke> im not saying anything said shouldnt be in the db driver
<revDeke> im just saying i woudl be cautious
<jcater> which things specifically are you thinking about?
<revDeke> as generally there are two types of things 
<revDeke> csv files in which you wnat to read and write
<revDeke> and csv files which are used to 'move' data
<revDeke> jcater: i think you brought up a VERY good point in the dont assume 1 line
<revDeke> some wierd files dont start data until two or three lines in
<revDeke> and the issue of do you have header rows or not etc
<revDeke> another good point
<revDeke> both of those should be in the driver i htink
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> you don't think field renaming should be?
<revDeke> but one must evaluate how can one reasonably read/write is for some things
<revDeke> i.e. is it only valid for import/export
<siesel> read write files and files to just "move" data could be differenciate by a "mode=RW|R|W|R_seq|W_seq" field
<jcater> well
<jcater> I wouldn't expect to run GNUe Forms off of it
<jcater> I suppose one "could"
<ajmitch> heh
<revDeke> again im picking nits here
<revDeke> im not saying anything discussed doesnt belong in the dbdriver
<revDeke> BUT
<ajmitch> are there any docs (yet) for writing db drivers?
<revDeke> if things are more for import export i think defining them in the conf file sucks :)
<revDeke> i.e. it should be part of integrator imho
<revDeke> i.e. i deal with flatfile passing for mainframe for a living
<ajmitch> yuck
<revDeke> and having to setup connections.conf stuff for it would be ugly
<jcater> ajmitch: source code
Action: jcater ducks
Action: revDeke might be envisioning too far out to what integrator will be like
<jcater> revDeke: true
<jcater> however
<jcater> hear me out for a sec
<siesel> revDeke: I thought of this thing too. In normal case the names of the csv file are changing all the time.
<ajmitch> jcater: ok, so i'm expected to write up docs as i go? :)
Action: jcater faces similar issues you are
<jcater> I'm really thinking, wherever you define it, this really boils down to a <datasource> issue
<jcater> so there's really two options
<revDeke> ajmitch: didnt i send you the GNUe Telepathy Headband in via post?
<jcater> 1. do as I originally suggested
<ajmitch> revDeke: must have missed it
Action: revDeke was envisioning another file format..... for integrator that is XML based
<jcater> and have a <datasource type="fixed"><flatfiledef>.........</flatfiledef></datasource>
<ajmitch> yaff
<revDeke> that could be as simple as holding this kind of data
<revDeke> and as complex as providing mappings and triggers etc
<revDeke> again maybe im thinking too much into integrator here
<revDeke> im not against what has been proposed it will be great to see a csv driver of any type 
<revDeke> as i would expect it to evolve, so i dont want to 'over complicate' things
<Mr_You> what does csv stand for?
<revDeke> just thinking outloud
<jcater> well, IF it's a part of the datasource definition
<jcater> (since we are considering other things now)
<revDeke> comma separated value
<jcater> 1. it can be part of the <datasource> tag (or a subtag)
<jcater> 2. it can be part of the connections.conf file
<jcater> those are basically the 2 options
<jcater> I'm ok with either
<jcater> IF it's 2
<revDeke> is there a way like FORMS where we can override
<jcater> you could still leave out connections.conf (for one-time stuff)
<revDeke> i.e. i can define a connections.conf file
<jcater> and have a <database> tag
<revDeke> OR
<revDeke> i can define a <database> tag
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> :)
<revDeke> if so im totally cool with it
<jcater> now, I'm totally cool with my 1 or 2
<revDeke> as the integrator xml file im thinking of
<jcater> I honestly have no preference
<jcater> well
<revDeke> could then if one time stuff just write out the db tag
<jcater> the advantage for #2
<revDeke> if its reused it could be in a connections.conf
<jcater> is if it IS a cvs file you need to reference very often
<jcater> it could be in connections.conf
<revDeke> yip
Action: Mr_You sighs.
<jcater> maybe I need to shut up
<jcater> and let derek talk
<revDeke> im in 100% agrteement here
<jcater> we are talking in parallel here :)
Action: revDeke hopes im thinking like them and not them thinking like me (or we are all doomed) ;)
<jcater> I'm reasonably sure you're thinking like us
Action: jcater ducks
<jcater> did hell freeze over today?
<jcater> my feet are cold
<ajmitch> nope, still warm here
<Mr_You> I love being ignored.
<Mr_You> way it goes
<revDeke> smallbiz is in cvs now
<Mr_You> what is csv?
<siesel> revDeke: I thought of XML input for Integrator too. But then we need a new directorys "sources","filters","destinations" like report has.
<ajmitch> Mr_You: comma separated values
<revDeke> comma separated value (i answered that earler)
Action: Mr_You feels like an idiot once again.
<Mr_You> I've never refered to it as acronym.
<revDeke> siesel: more ithink like jcater (or something like that)
<ajmitch> i only see it as an acronym :)
<revDeke> i think that integrator is just a different front end to reports
<jcater> siesel: I'm not sure about all of that
<jcater> imho
<jcater> integrator is
<revDeke> i.e. im thinking the reports engine with little work will do most of what integrator needs to
<jcater> <datasource>s  <-----> <datasource>s
<jcater> providing a mapping layer between them
<jcater> to do complex stuff
<revDeke> just that you get a UI that is slightly different
<jcater> (with triggers if need be)
<revDeke> jcater: i agree with that 
<revDeke> maybe its reports with a little more
<jcater> so I'm not sure what "filters" and "destinations" would be for
<jcater> in integrator
<revDeke> at one time i thought completely separate, but i see more and more shared to a degree
<revDeke> i tried to not get lost in the details and just kind of observe
<jcater> revDeke: in my mind.. it's reports with a SINGLE destination... another datasource :)
<revDeke> i like this converstion in that the CSV driver to me is a HUGE first step for integrator
<revDeke> ie. i have needs for integrator but mostly with CSV
<revDeke> as soon as we have CSV driver i can start to torture test integrator with sample usages :)
Action: revDeke notes that i opened a credit like with ye lowly donut shoppe in Memphis
<revDeke> s/like/line
<jcater> ooooo
<ajmitch> bbl, time for me to work :)
<Mr_You> my bank offers Quicken (QIF) and MSMoney (OFX)
<Mr_You> should be easy enough to integrate
<psu> Ok, so I'll remove the Java forms client from the website
<psu> Is someone going to tag it then remove it fromCVS too?
<psu> And should I drop the ECMAScript/Javascript as well?
<psu> At least until siesel and Mr_You get something that is CVS-able?
<siesel> tell me where to put it into cvs then I will commit
<psu> <irony>/jforms?</irony>
<siesel> psu: possibly just commenting (jsClient) out would be good for now.
<siesel> jcater: you asked about phpforms. At the moment I will first make jsforms a bit more complete before combining it with phpforms, moving much code from it into phpforms and make phpforms still work with non ECMAscript capable clients.
<siesel> But now I need a working Integrator (<datasource>s  <-----> <datasource>s)
<jcater> um
<jcater> we need to hash out what a gmd file is gonna look like
<jamest> ack!
<jamest> i leave for 1/2hour and have 25 pages of logs to read
<jcater> jamest: psu will have an executive summary by Sunday :)
<jamest> i can wait then :)
ColeMarcus (~ColeMarcu@p50805C31.dip.t-dialin.net) left irc: 
<siesel> my thoughts about are kind of the following: 1. define source and destination datasources 2. define fields to be directly copied
<psu> heh, it's Thursday
<psu> That makes it next week in KC-land ;-)
<jcater> I didn't specify which sunday :)
<psu> jcater: true
<siesel> 3. source fields split into multiple dest fields 4. source fields merged into single dest. fields 5. source fields being input for triggers only and populate dest fields
<siesel> 6. multiple rows from source which get merged into one row in the dest. datasource 7. "row splits" 8. submappings for detail datasources
<siesel> Jason: what do you think?
reinhard (~reinhard@M693P020.adsl.highway.telekom.at) left irc: "Everything that is worth fighting for, is worthy fighting dirty for"
<jcater> I'd say thats a pretty good use-case listing :)
<psu> forms section on website changed again
<psu> hopefully now definitive 
<psu> www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/forms.php
<jamest> psu: i like that better
<jamest> 1 possible change :)
<jamest> would it be cleaner to have 1 page on the reference client with #section tags for the various drivers
<jamest> as I know that I want to see a native win32 driver and a qt driver 
<jamest> and I'm sure we need an emacs driver too :)
<psu> The main justification for separate pages is 
<psu> that each mode of the ref client may have diff statuses
<psu> and it's confusing to have too many "Status" lines on one page
<psu> IMHO
<siesel> if we have the emacs driver, we possibly won't need anymore. Even unicode would be handled perfectly ;)
<siesel>  /anymore/any other driver/
<jamest> psu: good point
<jamest> wx: flaky
<jamest> curses: unusable
<jamest> gtk2: who knows?
<jamest> hmmmm, maybe we should just leave status off :)
<jamest> j/k
Action: jcater would still rather see
<jcater>  /tools/forms/
<jcater>  /tools/forms/curses
<jcater>  /tools/forms/gtk2
<jcater>  /tools/forms/wx
<jcater> if you want to keep separate pages
<jcater> as I think /tools/curses 
<jcater> is ambiguous
<jcater> considering we have a curses navigator too
<jamest> true dat
<jamest> as reports almost has a curses and wx mode i think
Action: psu will fix that in the pending site overhaul for when we get it into CVS
<psu> as the current site assumes things that make that difficult
<psu> but I intend to "unassume" them once I need to get site working in both locations 
<psu> i.e. www.gnu.orh/software/gnue & www.gnuenterprise.org
Action: psu sometimes whishes we had stuck with Zope
<psu> but I got so blocked with that, I even did the unthinkable
<psu> and RTFM-ed
<psu> and even that didn't work ;-/
<jamest> :)
<psu> documentation == the last step before apt-get remove
<grib> hey any of you gnue-ers have any experience with EDI?  are there any free libraries to deal with it, pref C? 
<jcater> I know derek dealt heavily w/EDI
<jcater> but I don't know if he had any free libraries to play with
ToyMan (~stuq@smtp.dstoys.com) left irc: ": I'm off to make more toys..."
<grib> jcater: from what I can tell it doesn't seem like rocket science, but I'm just sort of trying to get a handle on the big picture from a dev perspective... looking at source is generally the way I learn best :)
<Mr_You> from what I understand EDI is a broad concept..
<grib> I guess I'm thinking specifically about ANSI X.12 and EDIFACT, which seem to be the most prevalent standards. 
<Mr_You> ok
<grib> but the whole "Value Added Network" concept and how EDI transactions actually take place is sort of eluding me.  Anyway I figured somebody around here might have a clue about it... when's derek generally around? 
<psu> theoretically, EDI is meant to be a dead duck with ebXML and the like about
<psu> but like many legacy technologies
<jcater> like my fax machine?
<jcater> :)
<psu> it's proving much more resistant than the tech consultants expected/hoped
<revDeke> rofl
Action: psu sits opposite a COBOL programmer at work
<revDeke> you poor naive innocent developer
<revDeke> EDI is TECHNICALLY is as simple as it gets
<revDeke> tis the politics of EDI that is a nightmare
<nickr> psu: man, you really have derek disease.
<revDeke> everyone has different EDI standard
<revDeke> i.e. doctype
<revDeke> and uses different VANs (carriers)
<revDeke> the price is LUDICROUS
<psu> nickr: i find that if i wait until the end of the sentance 
<psu> to press return
<psu> someone else has already said what I was going 
<psu> to
<revDeke> i suspect there will be little hope of free EDI stuff until the cost of EDI comes down
<revDeke> as free software develoeprs can afford to test it
<nickr> psu: I have a touch of that myself unless I'm hopped up on caffiene and type like the wind.
Action: revDeke could look into whether LDC would gpl stuff its not likely though
<revDeke> as over time it became cheaper in ways to outsource some of it and deal with it on an outer level
<revDeke> as customizing for each vendor was tedious
Action: revDeke still thinks the best biz model in the world would be FREE EDI
<revDeke> i.e. all libraries and such are completely free
<revDeke> all software free
<revDeke> and the 'HUB' van could be 1/3rd the price of what exists today
Action: jcater thinks the best biz model in the world is FREE DONUTS.... I'm just waiting for someone to try it next door to me
<revDeke> and you would still make serious cash
<nickr> EDI does seem like mostly a service type situation.
<revDeke> anyhow grib you are sick sick sick man if you want to do EDI in C
<revDeke> as much as i hate perl it would make sense because of its good text parsing capabilities
<revDeke> but C is well just not optimal for slicing and dicing text files
<revDeke> imho
<nickr> It can be with the right support libraries.
<jcater> true
<revDeke> python would is fun for edi cause its all about the lists baby :)
<jcater> you could compile in perl support :)
<nickr> haha
<nickr> or pcre
<revDeke> i.e. you just read the file in as dictionaries and go to work
<nickr> yea
<revDeke> but back to grib's original issue, there arent any free ones i know of
<revDeke> i plan on authoring some (they will be in python)
<revDeke> for now its not high priority
<grib> revDeke: you seem, to know what yer talking about :) thanks for the info (still reading scrollback)...
<revDeke> at some time i think might close a contract deal that would involve paying to author an EDI VAN
<revDeke> and corresponding libraries
<revDeke> if you want i can put you contact with the EDI guru
<revDeke> ive been removed from it for a bit and he does all of it now
<grib> revDeke: I know --><--- that much about EDI and I would waste a guru's time at this point.  I'm just trying to figure out which direction is up.  
<revDeke> i owe him a lunch so i can meet with him and get update of what is being done there now
<revDeke> well it kicks ass in sense that if you do volume
<revDeke> it saves you a lot of money
<revDeke> even though its expensive
<jcater> grib: follow the $$$$$$ ... that's the direction it goes
<grib> revDeke: what's expensive?  is it using a VAN, who charges per document?  
<revDeke> VANs generally charge per document (or per byte)
<revDeke> a transaction might be in neighborhood of say 1.00 
<revDeke> well it might take 4 docs to complete a transaction
<revDeke> order
<revDeke> invoice
<revDeke> payment
<revDeke> so 4 for a roudn trip transaction
<revDeke> shipping manifest
<revDeke> if you do say 1000 orders a day
<grib> I take it that EDIFACT is an XML based text format ... is that what really gets used, or is the older X.12 stuff still more common?  
<revDeke> that s4,000 a day with say 20 business days
<revDeke> thats 80,000 a month
<revDeke> er month w/ 20 days not day with 20 days
<revDeke> x.12 is more common (or was last i played)
<revDeke> though many were starting to support XML variations
<revDeke> think of a VAN as a good ole boy network
<revDeke> when i was playing there were like 4
<revDeke> GM owned one
<revDeke> Sears owned one
<revDeke> Walmart owned one
<revDeke> and a bank owned one
<revDeke> most peopel were going through GM's
<revDeke> but say you do business with business X and he uses GM
<revDeke> you have to sign up with GM
<revDeke> to do business with him
<revDeke> then you get an accoutn with business Y and he uses Sears
<revDeke> you ahve to sign up with Sears to do business with him
<revDeke> you can use GM
<revDeke> er cant
<grib> yep, sounds like a typical squeeze play. 
<revDeke> the 'setup fees' are kind of costly 
<revDeke> and everyone does it a little different
<revDeke> then even with the same VAN
<revDeke> you might have walmart use 874 for invoices
<revDeke> but mcdonalds uses 872
<revDeke> the documents are 'similar' but different
<revDeke> anyhow there has been some shake out and there are a lot more than 3 now
<revDeke> and people are starting to belong to more than one or two
jbailey (~jbailey@atlas.fundserv.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> so some ofthose barriers are dropping
<revDeke> but they are still there and frustrating
<revDeke> however EDI rocks when it works
<grib> revDeke: but generally a transaction is just an exchange of text documents following a "knowable" (i.e. purchasable) format?  and the protocol for connecting to and delivering documents to the VAN is knowable too? 
<revDeke> someone sends an order electronically hits the floor and pick ticket is generated, product packed and shipped... the person ordering gets a shipping manifest
<revDeke> whenthey get the shipment the invoice goes out electronically their system auto deposits the payment and sends a receipt
<revDeke> and you just cut out half the human labor process :)
<revDeke> and got paid quicker to boot
<revDeke> grib: yes
<revDeke> its purely shoving around text files
<revDeke> thats why i say 'techinically' its pretty simplistic
<revDeke> gnue will support it REALLY well
<revDeke> with integrator
<revDeke> which we were discussing earlier
<revDeke> in fact once someone makes a 'document' they coudl put under the gpl for others to use
<revDeke> then all they would have to do is map their data into it :)
<grib> revDeke: so it would be moderately reasonable to use XML report formats, process them to generate report output, and then transform that into an EDI doc, at least on the output direction...
pattieja (~pattieja@www.pcxperience.com) left irc: "[x]chat"
<revDeke> absolutely
<revDeke> im more thinking that if you XML-EDI you could have reports actually just output that
<revDeke> but either way you have flexibility
psu (psu@manorcon.demon.co.uk) left #gnuenterprise.
<jbailey> revDeke: Is designer eventually supposed to let you setup the database too?
<revDeke> yes
<revDeke> i think we want strong database support in our IDE
<revDeke> there is start of schema editor in there
<revDeke> i suspect that will just continue to be built on
<revDeke> because its so plugin oriented it should be easy for people to continue to enhance functionality without know the internals
<revDeke> i would like to see it be able to design queries and create views and many other things (though its not high priority)
<revDeke> i.e.. someone not wanting to touch GNUe
<revDeke> might be interested in GNUe Schema and the Designer portion that manages databases
<revDeke> as a consistent cross platform / cross database mangament tool doesnt really exist

<chillywilly> ok, ok
<chillywilly> I didn't check

<nickr> someone should update the link for that, btw

<nickr> it should be http://nick.industrialmeats.com/proj/etc ...
<nickr> I should rewrite the proposal
<nickr> I've had several good ideas since I wrote it.
<chillywilly> you should write some python too ;)
<nickr> I write python all day at work
<chillywilly> yea, but what abot gnue

<ajmitch> oh dear
<derek> sorry for now gnuebot and chanserv want to bitch fight if over t
<derek> so you will have to wait until i can fix gnuebot :)
<ajmitch> so deop gnuebot
<derek> um he will come back
<derek> he is persistent little bi0tch
<derek> and i dont want to ban him
<derek> i woudl rather fix him, i just cant right now
<ajmitch> i didn't say ban, i said deop
<derek> he will reop himself
<derek> he's not dumb you know
<jbailey> Take away his perms in chanserv. =)
<jbailey> That might just break him, though
<jamest> why do we even have him?
<jamest> we have 2 bots in here
<jbailey> And the everpresent chanserv. =)
<derek> jamest its nice to have a back up
<derek> however
<derek> he shouldnt be an op
<derek> and shouldnt have any rights except to log the channel :)
<ra3vat> why is that so many messages on form's startup DB003: [EventController:57] Unknown Event: updateENTRY
<jamest> events are now defined per object instead of globaly
<jamest> so if you've events on objects we've missed then they won't fire
<jamest> if the form is in sampes i can fix
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> does the form have buttons?
<ra3vat> no
<ra3vat> with what sample form i can try?
<jamest> i was asking if it was a sample form
<ra3vat> no
<jamest> if it's not then we've got issues
<jamest> ok
<jamest> hang on
<jamest> oooo, nevermind
Action: jamest read that as trigger issue not event issue
<jamest> triggers are now defined per object
<jamest> the event system 
<jamest> sigh, were to start :)
<jamest> any object can register to listen to any other object (basically)
<jamest> however that object may only understand what to do with a few of those events
<jamest> example: so if you and i both did something crazy like register to listen to derek
<jamest> and derek says "jump off a bridge"
<jamest> i may know how to jump off a bridge so I go do it
<ra3vat> :)
SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-246.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<SachaS> hello everyone
<jamest> you on the other hand don't know how (or are too smart to listen to him) and instead say "Unknown Event: jump off bridge"
<jamest> hi
<derek> jamest.jumpOffBridge(true)
<derek> rofl
<derek> i typed that originally as
<derek> jamest.jumpOffBridget(true)
<jamest> lol
Action: jamest took a while to see the typo
<ra3vat> jamest: ok, i will look into that (fridge?) later
<derek> jamest: what do you guys need testing on?
Action: derek will be ready to rock in a few minutes
<jamest> everything
<jamest> but specifically
<jamest>  try and break query by detail
<jamest>   designer issues
<jamest> any issue you find please let me know
<jamest> any database drivers you can test
<jbailey> On Monday I have to demo Gnue to my boss against a mysql database.
<jbailey> And he'll decide if we'll use it for our purchase order system and network database. =)
<jamest> then you'll want me to commit the fixes
<jamest> :)
<jamest> actually
<jamest> the python-mysql in woody has issues 
<jamest> or we have issues working with it
<jamest> i just built 0.9.2 mysql from source and it works fine
<jbailey> I'm running unstable.
<jamest> yeah
<jbailey> It'll be using the debs I uploaded, so it's all python 2.2
<jamest> oh, your computer
<jbailey> I don't have anyone elses handy.
<jamest> well, i'm happy to do what I can to make demo success
<jbailey> Well - this demo is the whole reason I could spend paid time packaging it.
<jbailey> We might be saving ourselved liek 25 licenses of filemaker.
<jamest> are you getting things working ok?
dsmith (dsmith@oh-strongsvillecadent1-1c-20.clvhoh.adelphia.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jamest> then I'm much much more interested in making things work for you
<jbailey> I haven't tried designer yet against a database source.  I ran out of time, and it turns uot I wasn't logging the conversation where you told me what to put in. =)
<jamest> i'll test tonight
<jbailey> I can read the website and dig it out though.  tommorow maybe.
<jamest> as I have mysql working
<jbailey> Sure - I'm doing another CVS upload this weekend, so let me know if that's a good snapshot.
<jamest> if you have openoffice
<jamest> read jcaters guide in OO format
<jbailey> I've also gotten confirmation from the folks in #python that I can change it from arch: any to arch: all.
<jbailey> That'll speed up the time it takes to get into testing.
<jbailey> Hmm.  I don't know if abiword reads OO format or not.
<jbailey> He hasn't got it in pdf?
<jamest> it teaches form creation from both text editor and designer
<jbailey> Ah, nice.
<jamest> dunno
<jamest> i'll look
<ajmitch> jbailey: what reasons for choosing mysql?
<jbailey> ajmitch: two reasons.
<jbailey> ajmitch: 1) I know how to make it work
<jbailey> ajmitch: 2) phpmyadmin
<ajmitch> heh ok
<ajmitch> phppgadmin is ok, i guess
Action: ajmitch uses both mysql & pgsql
<jbailey> I don't know of a nice equivalent for pgsql.
<ajmitch> phppgadmin does pretty much the same
<jbailey> Ah, really?  I had heard that it sucked.
<jbailey> It's been a while though.
Action: ajmitch hasn't used it enough to say if it sucks or not
<jbailey> Dunno.  I used mSql way back when.  I switched to Mysql when the rest of the world did.
<ajmitch> good to hear that designer is being nice :)
<ajmitch> i wonder if it's worth me printing out the developers guide
<ajmitch> even with all it's TODOs
<jamest> i don't think I would yet
<ajmitch> ok
<jamest> crap
<ajmitch> costs me 15c a page to print at uni
<jbailey> Ouch
<jamest> then dont
<jbailey> Go to kinkos or something.
<ajmitch> kinkos?
<jamest> copyco
<ajmitch> sounds dodgy
<jamest> i can't make the pdf file
<jbailey> No Kinkos in the correct hemisphere?
<jamest> it bombs on my system
<jbailey> jamest: Can you make a .ps?
<jbailey> Like print to file?
<jamest> trying
<jamest> uploading
<jamest> http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jamest/
<jamest> ps format
<jbailey> Cool - Do you want the pdf? =)
<ajmitch> excelletn
<jbailey> Ah, cool.  Anjuta supports python syntax highlighting.
<jamest> does mysql support subselects?
<jbailey> I think mysql 4 might.
<jbailey> the current version definetly doesn't.
<jamest> argh
<jbailey> (unless I just have the syntax horribly wrong)
<jamest> what you using to make the pdf files
<jamest> ps2pdf?
<jbailey> ps2pdf
Action: jamest will install on ash and make them
<jamest> seems that mysql doesn't
<jamest> unless we both have the syntax horribly wrong
<jamest> jbailey: what will you demo monday?
<jbailey> I haven't decided.
<jbailey> I might reproduce our network database.
<jbailey> If I do that and can show him it on Linux and windows that would be cool.
<jbailey> If I can figure out how phpforms works, even better. =)
<jamest> all in a weekend ?
<jamest> :)
<jbailey> Hmm..  I was thinking in 2 hours tommorow afternoon. =)
<jamest> well, i know you're feeling the python love right now
<jbailey> Is phpforms supposed to work off of the same gcd files as gnuef?
<jamest> the same gfd files yes
<jbailey> typo, sorry. =)
<jamest> in fact jan had a webpage that you could upload your form
<jamest> it had 0 privacy though
<chillywilly> gnuef sounds a LOT like queef
<jamest> i wouldn't try and sell gnue on phpforms yet though
<jamest> as I'm not sure if it's ready
<jbailey> dict queef doesn't give me anything.
<jamest> jbailey: you don't want to know
<jbailey> jamest: It's not the critical selling features.  The win32 client will be.
<chillywilly> it's slang ;)
Action: jamest whimpers
<jamest> win32 with wx is a complete bitch
<jbailey> *lol* 
<jbailey> Looks bad?
<jamest> functions wierd
<jbailey> Joy. =)
<ajmitch> jamest: found a vic^H^Holunteer to do a python win32 client?
<jamest> i haven't tried cvs on it yet
<jamest> ajmitch: all we need is a UIdriver.py file for win32all
<jamest> and we're golden
<ajmitch> yeah
<jamest> i actually started digging this morning on that 
<ajmitch> i know, but there's not too much docs for the win32 stuff
<jbailey> Would it distress you to know then that part of this proposal is to use it as a purchase order system for millions of dollars a year?
<jamest> jbailey: nope
<jbailey> And that if it works that it would be on almost everyone's desk in a 70 person company? =)
<jamest> i feel good about forms iand common
<jamest> i feel ok about designer
<ajmitch> jbailey: only 70 people?
<jamest> i feel ok about reports
<ajmitch> appserver still a bit iffy
<jbailey> I haven't looked at reports yet.
<jbailey> Only designer and forms.
<jbailey> (and obviously common by extension)
<ajmitch> navigator might need some love, i guess, but it's fairly simple 
<jamest> yeah
<jamest> jbailey: to be completely honest
<jbailey> Well, hey, it's in Debian now - it *must* be stable. =)
<jamest> i'd be more worried about mysql :)
<jamest> but then I'm bias
<jamest> and if it works for you it works for you
<jbailey> *lol*  I've run millions of transactions on mysql before. =)
rdean (~rdean@12-221-229-247.client.insightBB.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<ajmitch> keep good backups :)
<jbailey> It's starts to suck wind when you load 20 million records into it.
<jbailey> But so did pgsql. =)
<ajmitch> i know
<jbailey> ALthough... pgsql would at least still load. =)
<jamest> jbailey: if you have a sec I can give a 90 second demo of designer/forms
<jamest> well, if you have 90secs 
<jamest> and currnet cvs
<ajmitch> cool
<jamest> mysql works no
<jamest> now

<jamest> though without subselects query by detail will fail

<ajmitch> hehe

<ajmitch> yeah, there have been a few more around lately
<jbailey> Especially since the story is so stupid.  RMS was stupid in proposing a release date this year and got caught with his pants down.
<ajmitch> don't know why he thought it'd be ready
<jamest> he had jbailey working on it
<ajmitch> i haven't seen a massive speedup in development lately
<jbailey> jamest: I'm not a core developper. =)
<jbailey> I just provide abuse and have been around longer than all but one person who still commits to the Hurd tree. =)
<ajmitch> jamest: chillywilly perhaps?
<jamest> perhaps
<ajmitch> jbailey: you also provided an autobuilder
<jbailey> And still do.
<chillywilly> hmmm?
<ajmitch> it's alive again?
<jbailey> Although it's spent most of its time recently building toolchains.
ToyMan (~stuq@glvv-dsl1-116.citlink.net) got lost in the net-split.
<jamest> what are we looking at timewize for a hurd based system in production
<ajmitch> depends on what developers focus on - if they focus on L4 porting, then it could be awhile
<jbailey> I can't asnwer that, but here's what I can give you.
<jbailey> We got pthreads about a month ago.
<jbailey> Marcus spent the last two nights hacking on oskit-mach and chasing stability bugs.
<jbailey> Using oskit mach has the neat advantage that it has a serial debugger.
<jbailey> Whcih means that we can get backtraces off of kernel crashes.
<jbailey> This summer we switched to the same "io" core of glibc that linux uses.
<jbailey> Neal claims that he has a solution to the partition limit ready to implement after christmas.
<jamest> so things are moving along
<ajmitch> ah, he does? useful
<jbailey> I've been working with Matthias Klose on getting our toolchain up to date.
<jbailey> Earlier this week we finally got pascal and chill running on our boxes.
<jbailey> and as soon as ajmitch fixed libffi we'll have gcj,.
<jbailey> ;)
<jbailey> s/fixed/fixes/
<jbailey> So you can generally expect apps to run.
Action: derek hasnt read back log
<ajmitch> hmm
<jbailey> XFree works - I've seen it on Marcus' laptop.
<derek> jbailey: if you want purchase order system PLEASE use gnue
<derek> i can promise to help
<derek> as part of gnue-sb
<jbailey> derek: The decision isn't mind.
<derek> i.e. if he is willing to do it as gpl
<jbailey> s/mind/mine/
Action: ajmitch should try & compile that stuff
<derek> he will get additional help
<derek> the network database of course you are on your own :)
<jbailey> jamest: So things are moving along and picking up speed.
<jamest> did gnue-sb get in cvs?
<jbailey> MArcus' console is now in use on a bunch of systems and he's porting it to oskit-mach.  That gives us all the virtual terminal support that Linux has.  Scrollback buffers in each window, *and* unicode support on the console.
<derek> jamest: csi is on after that i can start testing
<jbailey> And we also have multi-attach like screen -x.
<derek> jamest: yes its in cvs
<ajmitch> jamest: the savannah project is up, i think
<derek> though we need it to be gnu.org not nongnu.org
Action: derek doesnt know the issues there
<derek> but its in gnue-sb cvs
<jbailey> jamest: And that's all in the last few months.
<derek> the gsd's are busted unless jcater got around to fixing the schema stuff in cvs
<ajmitch> derek: just a setting on savannah
KeithJagrs (trilluser@63.74.24.9) joined #gnuenterprise.
Action: derek runs back to CSI see you a few
<ajmitch> jbailey: time for me to try & resolve build dependencies for gcc-3.2...
Action: chillywilly has tun X on the Hurd before
<chillywilly> er, run
<ajmitch> this could be a minor nightmare :)
<jbailey> ajmitch: I haven't uploaded the bison and something else, sorry.
<jbailey> All of the build deps build no prob, though.
<ajmitch> doxygen?
<jbailey> dpkg-buildpackage -B
<ajmitch> doing apt-get -b source :)
<ajmitch> generally works better when i don't have the source to play with yet
jbailey (~jbailey@atlas.fundserv.com) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<Maniac> so linux fans, should my next install be debian?
<ajmitch> there can be no other!
<jamest> depends
<jamest> it's the only thing I'd install
<jamest> if at all possible
<derek> there is something other than debian gnu/linux
<derek> hmmmm
<jamest> but it's frustrating to see it trail behind the other distros wrt to package version numbers
<derek> ?
Action: derek found redhat frustrating
<Maniac> i run mandark loonuks now
<jamest> woody ships with kde 2.2
<derek> for that reason
<derek> you all would have new cool toys
<derek> and i couldnt even get the stinking software in a package
<derek> i was compiling so much it was sick
Action: derek thinks
<jamest> that's the love part of debian
<jamest> apt-get
<derek> sid + other sources.list lines
<derek> = pure bliss
<jamest> the bad thing is you either run testing or sid
<jamest> (no way in hell on productoin equipment)
<derek> i.e. you might not be able to get kde3 or gtk2 or such 
<jamest> or stable
<derek> but with a sources.list file addition generally will get it
<jamest> or learn like i finally did how to run a mixed system
<derek> and as jamest says i might not put a SERVER on testing/sid
<ajmitch> nor would i generally have a workstation on sid
<derek> but generally a server shouldnt be running 'brand new' software
<derek> as its likely not fully tested
<ajmitch> except for my home box which i develop on
<derek> i.e. when a new redhat comes out with latest gcc and kde and such
<derek> no way its had proper testing already :)
<derek> anyhow its all opinion, i still say the best thing you can do is run what your friends run
<derek> (or whoever you get support from)
<derek> jamest: you know where jcater is or if he will be back?
Action: derek is curious about schema stuff
<derek> i want to convert our samples over to using gsd's
<derek> as well as get gnue-sb working properly
<jamest> um
<jamest> his cable modem fried
<jamest> so he's off line at night until he gets replacement
<derek> ouch
<derek> thats wrong
<derek> i wouldnt go home
<jamest> he had some work to do at the store
<jamest> but talked about going to work late tonight to work on some things
<jamest> so he may be here later
<derek> cool
<jamest> l8r
<jamest> derek: update cvs again before you test things
<derek> ok
<derek> hey where do you get mailman?
<jamest> and I'm cleaning out the dcl tickets
<derek> the reporst are debian version is very old
<jamest> so submit more
<ajmitch> list.org
<derek> anyone have a sources.list
<jamest> l8r
jamest (~jamest@adsl-64-216-107-182.dsl.tpkaks.swbell.net) left irc: "[x]chat"
<derek> l8r
<ajmitch> not that i know of
<derek> well what do you know ;)
<ajmitch> 2.0.13 is the version in sid, and is the latest stable mailman version
<derek> yeah looks like 2.1 is on beta4
<derek> but still how can debian test it if its not in sid?
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> debian tests software as stable for inclusion in a distro
<ajmitch> they don't track the gnome 2.1.x series, for example
<derek> yeah i know
<derek> but generally on bigger patches there are sources.list of stuff that is close
<derek> i.e. whomever is the maintainer puts in his home dir as he is brewing the packages until they become stable
<ajmitch> ah
<ajmitch> mithrandir is maintainer for mailman
<derek> i thought salve wass
<ajmitch> hmm
<ajmitch> lemme check
<ajmitch> Maintainer: Tollef Fog Heen <tfheen@debian.org>
<ajmitch> which is mithrandir - debian-installer guy
<ajmitch> people.debian.org/~tfheen has no mailman stuff
<derek> yeah i checked too
KeithJagrs (trilluser@63.74.24.9) left irc: "later"
<ajmitch> he's online now, ask him about it :)
<derek> where is he
<derek> and who is him (tfheen or mithrandir)
<ajmitch> uses the nick mithrandir
<derek> what channel?
<ajmitch> he's in #debian-devel, might not be a good idea to ask there ;)
Action: ajmitch points derek in the direction of /whois
<derek> ah why not its fun to be flamed
<derek> by know it all ^H^H^H^H^H^H good guys
<ajmitch> it's your skin that'll get roasted
<chillywilly> mithrandir is a LOTR reference derek ;)
<chillywilly> Gandalf Mithrandir the wizard :)
<chillywilly> in case no one knew but I suspect many did, so I dunno why I bothered to state the obvious
Action: chillywilly is on crack
Action: chillywilly passes it around
<derek> ymmmy
Action: derek bogarts the crack
<derek> pip
<derek> e
