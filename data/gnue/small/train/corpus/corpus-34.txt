<SachaS> what is the gnue python xml parser based on? libxml?
<SachaS> libxml is licened under MIT licence ....
<dimas> SachaS: one that is shipped with python 
<SachaS> dimas: what is that one based on? written from scratch in python???
<dimas> i'm do not know exactly
<SachaS> libxml is licences ad mit licence which is obviously gnu gpl compliant.
<dimas> but licence should be like for others main python libs
<SachaS> everything gnu or what? :)
<dimas> i hope it is appropriate :)
<ajmitch> all recent python licenses are gpl compatible
<SachaS> ok. thanks ajmitch.
<SachaS> ajmitch do you roughly know the difference between ruby and python? 
<SachaS> as i am looking at ruby to do some programming.
<ajmitch> nope, haven't looked at ruby
<ajmitch> ruby has c-like syntax i've heard

<grib> hey y'all.  just brainstorming with some folks and thinking about how it all fits in with gnue.  a few thoughts/questions: 
<nickr> kadink
<grib> so the application server.  does Zope fit in there at all?  it has many of the properties of an application server and gives you a lot of freebies. 
<grib> and it's already python.
<grib> for example, the ZPT mechanism and TAL/METAL could be used to process a report definition (in XML) into a filled-out report (in XML)
<grib> essentially for free. 
<grib> since it already talks XML-RPC every which way it seems like it could interoperate with some of the existing gnue stuff, no? 
StyXman (~mdione@ADSL-200-59-86-17.cordoba.sinectis.com.ar) left irc: "ircII EPIC4-1.1.7 -- Are we there yet?"
<grib> anyway.  just thinking.  I don't have enough experience with the state of the art in gnue to really know how the pieces fit together so the above is likely to make no sense.

<revDeke> oh studs de la network
<revDeke> do any of you have experience with duplicate packet transfer?
<revDeke> i.e. whenyou do a ping you get say 3 packets for every 1 requested
<revDeke> with a (DUP!)
<grib> revDeke: are you pinging a broadcast address, x.x.x.255 for example? 
<revDeke> well if its a broadcast its not x.x.x.255
<revDeke> its actually the proxy server
<revDeke> so i dont think it should be 'broadcasting'
Action: revDeke is far from a networkign guru
<revDeke> but i think they have some routing tables messed up here
<revDeke> OR they ahve multiple machines with same mac address or something
Action: revDeke was going to try to use tcpdump but i dont knw what to really look for
<revDeke> i did a traceroute and only 3 machiens between me and this box
<revDeke> if i ping each intermediate machine

Action: jcater drools
<Varadhan> jcater: according to the supplied doc, it doesnot have any "runinstall" program to install the Oracle...
<Varadhan> jcater: rather, it asks us to do some pre-installation configuration and some post-installation configuration...
<jcater> ok
<jcater> that sounds familiar
<Varadhan> jcater: and the main installation is just "un-tarring" the dowloaded tar.gz file...
<Varadhan> jcater: we have done as per the document... and we are able to run system queries like "Select sysdate from dual" etc...
<Varadhan> jcater: the actual problem is we are not able to create a database...
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> let me send you my script that I use
<jcater> I've hung on to it for the last 5 years
<jcater> and slightly modified it for each release of oracle
<jcater> maybe you can gleen some information from it
<jcater> where would you like it emailed?
Action: revDeke thwacks jcater on head

<jcater> um
<jcater> I have never done clustering
<jamest> revDeke: you get any testing done last night?
<Varadhan> jcater: even we are going to run gnue on that machine... :) after this successfull installation...
<revDeke> no i caught up watching obidiah on tvU after CSI
<Varadhan> jcater: can you email that script to me???
<revDeke> and fell asleep before i made it back to pc (so sad, im getting old i guess)
<jcater> yeah, but be forewarned, I haven't upgraded to Oracle 8i
<jcater> and I don't use clustering

<revDeke> on both accounts

<jamest> i know people have said that the roadmap exists only in a few heads of the developers
<jamest> in an effort to do something about that I present
<jamest> http://ash.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/forms.html
<jamest> or www even :)
<jcater> and I present
<jcater> http://ash.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/reports.html
<jamest> it is very much a work in progress
<jamest> all of it is
<jamest> it's based heavily upon kde
<jamest> er
<jamest> kde's release feature list with some tweaks
<jamest> while it's not as strick as a roadmap it does attempt to give people an idea where things are going
<jamest> how we think it'd work
<jamest> as the 0.5.x releases progress things get moved from the red area, to the yellow, then to the green
<Mr_You> Varadhan: you may be interested in the GNUe-SmallBusiness apps which are currently only in cvs
<jamest> 0.6.0 will not appear until either everything in 0.5.0 section is in the green OR something causes us to move items holding us back into a later release section
<jcater> I like KDE's release plans better than the traditional roadmap you see w/projects
<jcater> as it is more fluid
<jcater> and, I think it fits our model of development better
<jamest> so should jason and I  continue to work on these or are we waisting our time?

<revDeke> sorry
<revDeke> work is good on the roadmap stuff
<jcater> no
<jcater> it's a feature plan
<revDeke> over time i hope to get these generated directly from dcl
Action: jcater ducks
<revDeke> jcater: im fine with calling it a featureplan
<revDeke> as thats what i pretty much am defining by saying roadmap
<revDeke> i.e. a list of what features are targeted for what release
<revDeke> i woudl call it release schedule
<revDeke> but that sounds like it has a 'time' connotation
<revDeke> and we all dont want that 
<jcater> I don't care for release schedule at all
<jcater> roadmap is better than that
<revDeke> rofl
<btami> may i suggest layout engine plugins (independent from xslt) for reports 0.3.x feature plan
<revDeke> we can call it foo as long it exists
<revDeke> i like the way its going, will give me idea of what i need to add to dcl
<revDeke> so that someday it can configure them
<jcater> btami: we are independent from xslt now
<Varadhan> Mr_You: sorry had gone for a tea.. can you name some of such apps (small business apps)???
<Varadhan> Mr_You: can i get links to such apps sources???
<btami> jcater: ?
<nickr> FuturePlan(tm)
<revDeke> already i plan to add 'versions' properly into DCL
<jcater> btami: maybe I misunderstood your suggestion
<jcater> revDeke: I thought about using DCL for this
<Mr_You> varadhan: go to the cvs page at www.gnue.org and instead of "gnue" use "gnue-sb" in the cvs command lines.
<revDeke> so that people can file bugs against versions more like bugzilla
<revDeke> but also allow developers to put 'release version'
<revDeke> i.e. what version its slated to be fixed
<jcater> but I'm a little concerned about the flexibility
<btami> jcater:i have to use xslt now to make a html or text or pdf ...
<jcater> but we could try
<revDeke> same could go about its workorders 9features)
<revDeke> jcater: so am i
<revDeke> right now NO WAY it coudl do it
<revDeke> it will take some shifting of DCL
<jcater> btami: that's because "xslt" is the only plugin we've written for those report types
<revDeke> for now i would suspect that DCL be done to track the work (bugs) not so much plan it
<siesel> revDeke, could you add Q&A to DCL too? Like gnue-forms passed test X and failed test Y...
<jcater> btami: actually, that was implied by the 0.2.x section
<revDeke> yes
<jcater> on GNUe:Reports:Standard Documents
<jcater> I'm hungry
<jcater> anyone have any food?
<siesel> hehe 
Action: siesel had orderd piza and lasagne :)
<btami> jcater: i mean no intermediate xml, just layout events
<siesel> delicious :)
<revDeke> siesel : well over time yes to Q&A
<revDeke> i would see new features as being WorkOrders
<revDeke> and then when a work order is filed instead of being 'closed' it goes to Q&A
<revDeke> and Q&A has extra fields yada yada yada
<Varadhan> Mr_You: except DCL, other projects have the status of "Not yet started"...
<revDeke> but thats far down the road
<jcater> btami: ah, I see
<revDeke> im sooo happy to see loose feature lists
<btami> jcater: you talked about before :)
<Varadhan> Mr_You: is there any other smallbusiness apps just to show as a gnue-demo???
<revDeke> i dont want to get out of control
<Mr_You> varadhan: go to the cvs page at www.gnue.org and instead of "gnue" use "gnue-sb" in the cvs command lines.
<jcater> btami: no, I haven't discussed, but I've been personally thinking about that
<Mr_You> its only accessible via cvs
<Varadhan> Mr_You: OH!! lemme try...
<btami> jcater: ok
dsmith (~dsmith@208.40.56.34) left irc: "later.."
<btami> jcater: and maybe some visual reports support in designer 0.6.x ?
<jcater> btami: that would go into the designer feature-plan, which we haven't started on
<jcater> but, definitely
<jcater> that's going to be a biggie
<btami> http://ash.gnuenterprise.org/feature-plans/designer.html
<btami> :)
<jcater> btami: that was a "cp common.html designer.html"; notice the header...
<jcater> I'm still in the reports.html right now
<siesel> reinhard and I talked about autocreated forms out of database metadata.
pradhap (~pradhap@61.11.56.27) left irc: 
<jcater> you could almost take the Designer wizard examples and use them as is
<jcater> to do that
<jcater> (well, and make them non-interactive)
Action: siesel thought doing that :)
<siesel> can you add it to forms roadmap?
<siesel> (or add me to www-users group :) )
<revDeke> we need our website in cvs pretty badly but thats another discussion
<jamest> what you want on forms?
<jamest> autocreated forms from database metadata?
<jamest> is that it
<jcater> would that go into forms?
<jcater> or appserver?
Action: jcater would think that'd be an appserver thing
<jcater> actually
<jcater> can I ask the usefulness of such a thing?
Action: Mr_You &
<jcater> as designer can easily spit out forms
<revDeke> jcater / jamest when i get a chance one thing i can do on these maps is replace
<Varadhan> Mr_You: i got the code, thanx for your help... though, i could not figure out the starting file, can you help me pls???
<jcater> but I rarely see an autocreated form that doesn't need a "little" tweaking
<revDeke> All outstanding critical bugs in dcl, if any 
<revDeke> with actual bug numbers and desc w/ links
<Mr_You> Varadhan: maybe someone else can I need to run.
<jcater> if appserver plans to serve up forms files
<revDeke> as often we might not actually schedule to close every bug for a release some might be better closed in subsequent releases
<jamest> jcater: i think they want a data browser
<siesel> jcater: we discussed that it would be better if forms would have that functionality
<jcater> oh
<jamest> point forms at a database and it opens a tree
<jcater> hmm
<jamest> click on a table and it opens a grid
<jcater> is that a forms thing
<jcater> ?
<jamest> that I don't know
<jamest> I wanted a grid view 
<revDeke> ????
<Varadhan> can any1 help me to run the gnue-sb application??? i just downloaded from the CVS... i don't know how to start it... pls help me..
<revDeke> a grid view is nice
<jamest> as then I could replace pgaccess here
<jamest> which i dislike stongly
<jcater> jamest: but that gridview would probably be a gridview of an existing form, right?
<jamest> yes
<revDeke> but i dont know if forms should be a table manager like that
<jcater> revDeke: that's my fear
<jcater> I don't think it should either
<jamest> I'm not defending it
<revDeke> i suspect designer is better suited to hav e that functionality
<jcater> I would like to see what jamest wants though
<jcater> revDeke: well, it almost does
<jcater> File | New | From Wizard | Simple Wizard
<jcater> click save
<revDeke> jcater: pretty much
<jcater> clijc Debug | Run
<jcater> :)
<revDeke> but i mean real time
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> but seriously
<jcater> it's amost there anyway
<revDeke> more like pgaccess/such
<jcater> you just add a menu option
<revDeke> but yeah the wizard save is what i use all the time :)
<jcater> that automates a few of those steps
Action: revDeke thinks maybe what people are wanting is dynamic forms
<Varadhan> can any1 help me to run the gnue-sb application??? i just downloaded from the CVS... i don't know how to start it... pls help me..
<revDeke> i know thats what the geas people want
<siesel> the idea was to produce a form on the fly. 
<revDeke> Varadhan: you cant
<revDeke> until the gsd engine is fixed
<jamest> siesel: you have an ash accout right
<revDeke> you wont be able to make valid schema's
<revDeke> from the gsd's
<siesel> yep.
<Varadhan> revDeke: Oh!!!
<siesel> revDeke, gsd is broken???
<revDeke> sorry for the breakage/cruft
<revDeke> siesel: VERY broken
<revDeke> VERY VERY broken
Action: revDeke wasnt pleased but i promised to not get too mad about it
<Varadhan> revDeke: is there anyother sample application available in gnue except DCL and gnue-sb???
<revDeke> the gsd's worked fine with my local setup from a different cvs Varadhan, but as part of fixing gsd engine
<revDeke> we decided to do things differently
<revDeke> i have since changed the gsds in gnue-sb to reflect those decisions so no engine will parse them currently :)
<revDeke> hopefully by monday
<revDeke> Varadhan: gnue/forms/samples/
<revDeke> has plenty simple one's
<revDeke> if you have a database with data
<revDeke> dont bother looking for an app make one
<jcater> siesel: I understand creating forms on the fly... but I question that being a function of forms
<revDeke> in 3 minutes or less you can have a form
<revDeke> jcater: i would say it should not be function of forms 
<revDeke> well let me restate that, as long as i can always have flat file forms im content
<revDeke> not saying i wouldnt use dynamic or database ones, but for now its nice to have flatfile ones
<siesel> The idea was that for some simple tables you don't even have to startup designer.
<Varadhan> revDeke: thanx for your suggestion... i have a question... 
<revDeke> siesel: whats the diff
<revDeke> if you start forms or designer
<siesel> Just point form on it. "gnue-forms gnue:mytest" 
<revDeke> i.e. if we add more dbmanager like functionality to designer (which i think we plan to)
<Varadhan> revDeke: you said that there is some problem in gsd's... is it with the gnue-sb gsd's or any other gsd's that you create using gnue-designer???
<jamest> man
<revDeke> all gsd's at this point (iirc)
<revDeke> unless jcater has modified designer to match the new specification
<jamest> wouldnt this data browser be fairly simple standalone app
<siesel> the diff is that the end-user shouldn't use or install designer
<revDeke> jamest: i think so
<jamest> based on gnue-common
<revDeke> im thinking maybe its a 'plugin' to designer
<jamest> and wx
<revDeke> than could be called indpendently
<revDeke> i see many of things in designer being like that
<revDeke> where you can access them from within designer
<revDeke> or launch on their own
<revDeke> but maybe im crazy
<revDeke> Varadhan: for now if you have tables and data go to designer and choose the wizard
<revDeke> and follow it
<jamest> well, I really don't have strong feelings for or against
<revDeke> and you will get a form that works :)
<jamest> as honestly a small plugin to forms would do it too
<revDeke> assuming your connections.conf is correct
<revDeke> jamest: true
<jamest> just have it build the xml form on the fly
<revDeke> thast something we hadnt really talked about before
<siesel> reinhards idea was NOT to have a data browser, but to use dynamic forms for 80% of all cases.
<revDeke> forms plugins
<jcater> I'm thinking standalone app myself
<revDeke> siesel: thats what i said when 'appserver guys want dynamic forms'
<Varadhan> revDeke: I have just chosen a simple form wizard, it works.. i can browse thru the records of my Oracle table...
<reinhard> yes
<jcater> but wouldn't that be something appserver serves up?
<reinhard> we want dynamic forms
<reinhard> :)
<reinhard> jcater: the problem would be
<reinhard> that forms can "better" do the dynamic form
dimas (~ds@ics.elcom.ru) left irc: "Вышел из XChat"
<reinhard> as forms knows things about the UI which appserver doesn't know
<reinhard> like
<reinhard> point sizes of the current font
<reinhard> or
<revDeke> wouldnt this be a component of common
<revDeke> that designer uses?
<reinhard> even
<reinhard> size of the screen
<revDeke> i.e. if designer takes a table def and makes a form via a wizard
<reinhard> (for example to distinguish how many rows a "pseudo grid" has)
<jcater> reinhard: actually, no forms definitions ever mention point sizes
<revDeke> instead it just makes the choices passed the values
<jcater> or anything like that
<revDeke> and isntead of writing a file writes and xmlstream and passes it to forms?
<revDeke> i.e. i would suspect the functionality really already exists
<reinhard> jcater: yes sorry point sizes are a bad example
<revDeke> its jsut a matter of making it accessible to forms or appserver to invoke
<btami> reinhard: why not a standalone app ?
<siesel> revDeke: its more a philophical than a implementation problem :)
<jcater> siesel: yes it os
<revDeke> i think thats a plus of dealing with xml in this case is forms shoudnt care if the definition is coming from a file or directly from a stream
<jcater> it doesn't fit in with any model of forms client we have... the client is always given a definition
chillywilly (danielb@mke-24-167-202-50.wi.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<revDeke> siesel: my theory is as long as its a choice there is room for it in a sense
<revDeke> jcater: i propose that forms does NOT do this
<jamest> jcater: actaully I wanted more dynamic widgets eventually
<siesel> the reason to put it in forms was that it should work in 2-tier too.
<revDeke> i.e. it always just builds from a definition
<jamest> so tthat triggers could adjust the UI on the fly
<chillywilly> you guys suck
<jcater> jamest: yes
<revDeke> some other application (or common) could prebuild streams and hand it to forms
<chillywilly> who moderates gnue-announce?
<jcater> but I think this is slightly diffferent
<jcater> I think I'm in agreement with derek on this
<siesel> but possibly the best place would be in common. like the GPD creation out if a gear file
Action: jcater washes his mouth out)
<reinhard> jcater: lol
<revDeke> siesel: thats where i was going
<jcater> siesel: I'd agree with that
<revDeke> is if it were in common
<jamest> so who whats to update the appserver.html ?
<revDeke> gpd's or reports or appserver could get at it
<revDeke> in fact forms could in a sick way :)
Action: siesel can't read as fast as he writes :) :)
<revDeke> you coudl have a form that called a trigger to make a dynamic form
<revDeke> rofl that would be funny
<jamest> siesel?
<reinhard> sorry
<jamest> reinhard?
<reinhard> this is a good discussion but i'm dog tired
<reinhard> and i'm not even sure if i can still follow ist

<jcater> you've been hanging around us American's so long

<jcater> nothing personal
<chillywilly> corse it was
<chillywilly> yea right
<jcater> but we promise that list will be low traffic
<jcater> so a "woot!" response
<jcater> was moderated out :)
<jcater> you could reply to gnue-dev if you'd like

<jcater> I understand it

<jcater> gnue-announce --> psu's mail list
<jcater> gnue-discuss --> arguments

<jcater> that doesn't include the hours they actually pay me while driving (3 - 3 1/2)
<jcater> that's just mileage :)_
<Mr_You> I'd tell them "it ain't getting fixed until someone can read the lights" hehe
<jcater> Mr_You: well, it's not that easy
<jcater> they are our "sales" branch
<jcater> and "sales", well, um, let's just say they like to blame bad days
<jcater> on IT stuff
<ajmitch> haha
<Mr_You> requirment for opening aticket "what are the lights indicating?"  ;-)
<jcater> Mr_You: the brass's response is always "oh, just jump in the car and go... you haven't been up there in a month anyway... you should check everything out"
<jcater> I don't like to give them that excuse :)
<Mr_You> yeah I know what you mean.
Action: jcater can't stand that place
<jcater> normally I wouldn't mind getting a mileage check plus my normal time
<jcater> to just drive
<jcater> but sometimes there's just people that absolutely grate on your nerves
<Mr_You> I actually enjoy getting out of the office when its not mileage on my own vehicle
<jcater> normally I do too
<jcater> it's just this place......
Action: jcater shudders
<Mr_You> sales droids?  ;-)
<jcater> worse
<ajmitch> clueless sales droids?
<jcater> 40 x 18/19 yr old telemarketing chicks
<jcater> who's average turn-over is 6 weeks
<ajmitch> heh
Action: jcater grits his teeth
<jcater> that has to be the worst
<jcater> group to provide tech support to!
<ajmitch> yeah
<Mr_You> man, but they gotta be cute.
<jcater> a few.....
<jcater> but the others offset that advantage
<Mr_You> I worked at a startup that had a bunch of girls like that.. they were not cute..
<jcater> ok, in retrospect, they might be cute
<Mr_You> heh
<jcater> but that whole "cuteness" kinda goes away
<jcater> after so many calls in a day
<jcater> explaining the same thing over and over
<jcater> and over and over
<Mr_You> this is tech support for your GNUe apps that they use?
<ajmitch> makes you want to scream
<jcater> we are still in the process of converting them to GNUe
<jcater> but, yeah
<jcater> a good chunk are still on Oracle Forms
Action: jcater is agressively working on that though
<ajmitch> you usually work on GNUe within work time?
<jcater> shhhhh
<jcater> not in public
<jcater> j/k
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> I usually get to put a few hours a day into GNUe
Action: jcater is Vice President/IT... I've saved a few bucks here and there to get quite a bit of freedom :)
<jcater> there's a reason you rarely see me in #gnue before 10:00 am my time :)
<ajmitch> :)
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> these xcams look cool
<jcater> I wish I could find one a little bigger
<jcater> just for "user friendliness"
<jcater> I really need a Sony Camcorder w/Viewport
<jcater> that also transmits X10 :)
<jcater> wow
<jcater> these things are < $100
<jcater> I'm surprised
<drochaid> aye, they're cheap
<drochaid> but not as cheap as a 320x200 webcam :)
<jcater> are 320x200 wireless?
<drochaid> no, just shite
<drochaid> I'm trying to recall someone else that was doing wireless ethernet cams
<drochaid> could have been axis, although you'd be able to buy several xcam 2s for the cost of a single axis
<Mr_You> someone came out with a new 802.11a for doing broadcast TV.. but its still new.
<jcater> gack
<jcater> I didn't want to spend that much $$$$ 
<jcater> :)
<drochaid> lol
Action: jcater is away: selling my soul to MPAA and watching Spider-Man on DVD
SachaS_away (~Sacha@dialup-196-176.wasp.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
Nick change: SachaS_away -> SachaS
Action: drochaid points out to jcater and Mr_You that X10 is actually a Scottish technology, developed by pico in edinburgh in the 1970's
<drochaid> hmm, sun will be up soon, should I go to bed now?
<ajmitch> nah
<drochaid> mmm, wrong answer
<ajmitch> you asked
<drochaid> i did
<drochaid> oidche mhath
<ajmitch> night
Action: drochaid is away: tha i breagha an-diugh ... you don't hear me say THAT often :)
<ajmitch> heh
