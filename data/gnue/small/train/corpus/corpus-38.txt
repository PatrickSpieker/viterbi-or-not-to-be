<ajmitch> evening all
<IsoosI> G'evenin' aj :)
<ajmitch> hey IsoosI
<ajmitch> what's up?
Nick change: IsoosI -> Isomer
<Isomer> oh, shrug
<Isomer> I was reading the KC last night
<ajmitch> heh
<Isomer> someone was saying that LDAP was insecure and ActiveDirectory is a much better solution
<ajmitch> very very very silly
<ajmitch> seems like i've been quoted in about the last 30 KC's ;)
<Isomer> well, they're obviously missing the point that ActiveDirectory is an implementation LDAP :)
<Isomer> er
<Isomer> of LDAP
<ajmitch> heh
<ajmitch> decided to use GNUe anywhere yet? :)
<Isomer> Not yet
<Isomer> but I'm watching the Small Business stuff closely
<Varadhan>  if i call form.runForm(), it is saying "Attribute Error: runForm".. i am using the latest CVS version... can any1 help me???
<ajmitch> we saw your question before, noone that knows anything seems to be awake
<ajmitch> the lazy beggars are all probably in bed
<Varadhan> ufff....
<Varadhan> do you use gnue tools???
<Isomer> ajmitch: they appear to have some fascination with this whole sleeping thing :)
<ajmitch> yes
<ajmitch> i use GNUe stuff
<ajmitch> 'form' might not be a GFClient instance or derivative thereof
<Varadhan> yes.. but in D-G.pdf, it has been mentioned that if i want to invoke another form within a form, i can use form.runForm...
<ajmitch> try runForm("form-file-name", params) without the 'form.' prefix
<ajmitch> i haven't done much with forms lately
<ajmitch> Isomer: what small biz stuff are you interested in?
<ajmitch> i think most NZ businesses are small :)
<Varadhan> yeah... thanks ajmitch... its working...
<Varadhan> thanx a lot...
<ajmitch> cool
<Varadhan> btw, how can i trap the selection change event of a drop-down box????
<ajmitch> hmm
Action: ajmitch doesn't know
<Isomer> ajmitch: Customer contact, stock management are both kinda important I think
<ajmitch> Isomer: small biz accounting is what i want to work on this summer :)
<Isomer> Neat!
<ajmitch> yeah, in past KCs you might have seen FTBA mentioned
<Isomer> yeah a li'l :)
Action: ajmitch has been quoted in KC 1,2,4,10,13-16,23-30,32-34,36-54 ;)
<ajmitch> i must spend far too much time here
<Isomer> heh
<ra3vat> hi all
<ajmitch> hi ra3vat
<ra3vat> Varadhan: why do you need to trap it? is not master/detail do the work?
<ra3vat> hi ajmitch
<ajmitch> ra3vat: depends, you might want to do extra stuff on selection
<ajmitch> i think esands was asking about opening forms from a combo box selection
<ajmitch> oh beautiful, someone fixed the property dialog bug :)
Action: ajmitch is reading the KC
<ra3vat> ajmitch: that's why i asking. i was taught yesterday not to be that trigger nazi and master/detail solved most of the thing for me :)
<ajmitch> hehe
<Varadhan> ra3vat: i need to fetch other values of the record on selecting the drop-down value..
<Varadhan> ra3vat: something like, i have a list of "ids"... on-selection of a 'id' i have to fetch values for other columns...
<Varadhan> ra3vat: can you give me an example for Datasource.simpleQuery???
<ra3vat> i did not use it yet
<Varadhan> ra3vat: is that "sql" stuff working???
<Varadhan> ra3vat: can i get some time of yours to look into my problem???
<ra3vat> i did not use it. my demo has a few related tables that use master/detail and it work well 
<Varadhan> by defining foreign keys in table definitions???
<ra3vat> Varadhan: miost probably not now as i'll be out of computer, i'm in a hurry already
<Varadhan> ra3vat: can you do me a favour???
<Varadhan> ra3vat: can you mail me your demo source, so that i can use it as a sample program to code my demo program????
<ra3vat> Varadhan: it is enough that it has unique value and logic relationship
<Varadhan> i have got a primary_key in my table.. and has 3 tables for my demo purpose...
<Varadhan> how do i define logic relationship between them ( i have a common key field in all the three tables...)...
<ra3vat> i can post it but it'd better be cleaned up first for your sake
<ajmitch> for your sanity ;)
<ajmitch> sigh, one problem with the KCs is that my volunteering to write code is on public record '_

<reinhard> when our friends from the U.S. are up
<reinhard> sorry i don't think i can help you
<ra3vat> Varadhan: it was quick fix upon your's yesterday request 
<Varadhan> ra3vat: ok.. anyway.. the existing datasource.extensions.gettimestamp() should work... isn't it???
<Varadhan> ra3vat: even that is not working... :(
<Varadhan> ra3vat: anyway... can you pls explain about static data sources???
<ra3vat> your demo is too complicated for me, i do not use that functions. 
<ra3vat> you can fetch that data you need and get/change any values in the entries and that save, why each time you need to address datasource directly?
<Varadhan> ra3vat:  yeah.. you are right, actually i need to fetch *one particular record* based upon a condition... how to do this??
<Varadhan> ra3vat: i have suppressed the *MENUBAR* and *TOOLBAR*.. :)
Action: drochaid is back (gone 10:28:42)
<ra3vat> Varadhan: are you able to fetch all data? 
<ra3vat> forms done for user interaction, will it be user who decide what should be fetched?
<Varadhan> ra3vat: if i put "pre-query"="y", i am able to fetch all the data...
<Varadhan> ra3vat: yes.. user decides what to fetch...
<Varadhan> ra3vat: do you have time... if so, i will mail you the tar of my demo... just help out.. pls..
<ra3vat> if so unsuppress menubar :) and you will find that hit f8 let you start query, then you input what you want to find, then hit f9
<ra3vat> and all is done
<Varadhan> ra3vat: hmmm...
<ra3vat> Varadhan: i'll be out for about 2 hours your first mail did not even come
<Varadhan> ra3vat: yeah.. it returned back to me saying "unable to deliver"... :(
<Varadhan> ra3vat: could you tell me how "f8" and "f9" are working???
<Varadhan> ra3vat: is it possible to simulate "f8" and "f9" programatically, without actually asking the user to do so!!!

<siesel> ra3vat: static datasource fixed.
<siesel> you mean integrator file format?
<siesel> if you speak of integrator, yes
<lupo> siesel: this is integrator stuff?
<siesel> which mappings are you refering to?
<lupo> http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/gnue-dev/2002-November/000322.html
<siesel> Varadhan: the date time format send to the database is defined in: common/src/dbdrivers/_dbsig/DBdriver.py L 238
<siesel> Varadhan: it would be the best if you add a line " self._dateTimeFormat="'%c'"   to the file common/src/dbdrivers/oracle/DBdriver.py for your early testing.
<siesel> Varadhan: the next step would be to add an option for that in a configfile 
<siesel> lupo: thats integrator stuff. mapping 1+ datasource/s into 1+ datasource/s
<siesel> I thought of an editor with a view on a gsd file (or a real database schema) on the left side, and the same for the right side, and then you can draw lines between them

SachaS (~Sacha@dialup-196-198.wasp.net.au) left #gnuenterprise ("Client Exiting").
<jcater> reports + appserver + navigator
<ajmitch> ok
<jcater> oh, were you asking jbailey?
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> looks like some interesting stuff going into cvs for forms & designer?
<ajmitch> hmm, more stuff being put in common, actually :)
<jcater> stuff for gnue-sb
<jcater> err
<jcater> stuff missing for gnue-sb :)
Action: jcater is back in curses mode for the rest of the night though
<jcater> unless derek comes back in
<nickr> curses!
<jcater> if so, I never said that
<jcater> mdean!
<ajmitch> anything been put into gnue-sb cvs yet?
<jcater> you kick ass!
<ajmitch> huh?
<jbailey> jcater: I was at work and wanting to know if I should do a new CVS pull for Gnue packages.
<jbailey> I'll fix them on Thursday or so when I'm thinking about it again.
<jcater> he fixed an annoyance I had w/DCL :)
<ajmitch> ah :)
<jcater> jbailey: hmmm
<jcater> the funny thing about being deep in programming wrt gnue
Action: ajmitch pulls up the KC to see what people wanted from CSV
<jcater> is I'm not sure what's happened with it since your last package
<ajmitch> hehe
<jbailey> You guys don't seem to maintain ChangeLogs =)
<jcater> we run cvs2cl prior to a release
<ajmitch> cvs2cl ;)
<jbailey> Does sdist do that automatically?
<jcater> no
<jcater> but that's not a bad idea
<jcater> we could add it
<jbailey> That and the man page generation. =)
<jcater> that is a little tougher
<jcater> but needs to be done too :)
<jbailey> But I think jamest promised me that one. =)
Nick change: jcater -> jamest
<jamest> I'll handle that cvs2cl thing too
Nick change: jamest -> jcater
<jcater> jamest: thanks dude!
<jbailey> Sweet!
<jbailey> (Psu, did you catch that?)
<jbailey> "Jamest volunteered for a bunch of stuff..."
<ajmitch> lol
<jbailey> "I saw it on IRC mommy, it MUST be true!"
<ajmitch> jbailey: that's one thing i don't like about the KCs
<ajmitch> psu records when i volunteer for something & publishs it for the world to see :)
<jcater> ajmitch: how do you think I feel!
<ajmitch> heh
<jcater> sometimes I feel like I need to change my nick
<ajmitch> has anyone thought of producing a visual class hierachy for gnue?
Nick change: jcater -> OffTheRecord
<OffTheRecord> like this
<ajmitch> to see how classes are related?
Nick change: OffTheRecord -> jcater
<jbailey> The next kc will be code named "you can run but you cannot hide"
<jcater> I think ra3vat has to get the headquote this week
<jcater> with his
<jcater> "cvs update is my favorite editor"
<jcater> or something like that
<ajmitch> :)
<jcater> although the KCs aren't done in a democratic process
<jcater> those darn brits
<ajmitch> hmm, there is a lot of useless cruft that i don't need in a csv driver
<ajmitch>   def _beginTransaction(self):
<ajmitch>     try:
<ajmitch>       self._dataConnection.begin()
<jcater> lol
<ajmitch> that's pretty useless when self._dataConnection is just a simple object
<jcater> I'd expect to see
<jbailey> Hmm.  That reminds me that I'm supposed to demo forms tommorow. 
<jcater> $ grep -c pass  csv/DBdriver.py 
<jcater> 55
<ajmitch> hehe
<ajmitch> how'd you guess i was doing that? ;)
<ajmitch>   def getSchemaTypes(self):
<ajmitch>     return [('view','View',1), ('table','Table',1)]
<ajmitch> what types should i have?
<ajmitch> present a single table?
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> that'd be best I imagine
<ajmitch> k
<ajmitch> in connections.conf, i have dbname, for the filename, and directory
<ajmitch> might as well just let dbname be filename, and drop the directory part
<jcater> probably
<jcater> oooo
<ajmitch> ooo?
<jcater> be sure to use common's FileUtils.openResource()
<jcater> well
<ajmitch> ah that'd be good
<jcater> shiit
<jcater> err
<jcater> shoot
<jcater> that won't work if you plan to have writable csv files
<ajmitch> ok
Action: ajmitch doesn't know the limitations of common's stuff
<ajmitch> does common have decent docstrings in each class?
<jcater> define decent
<jcater> nevermind
<jcater> doesn't matter how you define it
<jcater> the answer is "probably not"
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> i imagine that GNUe's docs are lacking in some areas for people like me
<ajmitch> your developers guide is good, but i want to know about what common offers :)
<ajmitch> how to write db drivers, etc
<jcater> we have a few technotes
<jcater> now
<jcater> I'm not sure if any are relevant to that or not
<jcater> but those are in doc/technotes/
<ajmitch> yup
<ajmitch> technotes are good, i might look at writing up some other stuff if i get time & motivation :)
Action: ajmitch looks at importing webware's doc mess :)
