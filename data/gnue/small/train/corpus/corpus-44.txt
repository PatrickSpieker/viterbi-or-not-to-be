<reinhard> ariel_: i could read it
<reinhard> i just mailed the document to another computer where openoffice is installed and printed it out
<grib> hey gnue peoples.  what's the skinny on gtk2/libglade on win32?  is it a no-brainer yet, or even a half-brainer?  
Action: grib doesn't have too much to spare
<jamest> grib: has anyone even tried it?
<jamest> i haven't heard of anyone trying it
<ariel_> reinhard: are you still working on proposal or can i add more stuff?
<btami> jamest: i'v tried before 
<jamest> btami: really?  did it work or bomb?
<btami> work
<jamest> ooooo
<jamest> did it work better than the wx driver?
<jamest> the wx driver on windows sucks
<jamest> read (our code not the wx code :)
<btami> gtk2 driver isn't full featured IIRC
<btami> but hasn't got that ugly bugs like
<btami> "focus nightmare" and "tabbed pages" problems
<jamest> btami: how hard is it to get the gtk2 driver running on any platform?
<jamest> i thought it required custom patches to gtk or something
<jamest> so avoided it for now
<btami> i'v tried it only on winXP
<jamest> what was involved?
<btami> just downloaded the necessary stuff from sourceforge
<reinhard> ariel_: i would like to talk a few points to you
<btami> and it worked
<jamest> oooooo, does it require cygwin?
<btami> no
<jamest> do you have a url
<jamest> the only thing I'm finding is gtk 2.0.6 source for windows
<jamest> and talk of using cygwin
<btami> i'm trying to find...
<btami> wait

<btami> i have 1 table with many fields, and
<btami> want use tabbed pages, but with only one datasource and one block
<reinhard> ariel_: sorry my telephone has decided to trout slap me today
<btami> but i failed
<StyXman> can someone confirm that?
<StyXman> btami: I have no similar problems
<btami> wait, i try it again...
<jamest> btami: I don't think it can run with a block spread across pages
<jamest> i can think of at least one point in the code where this would puke (unless someone altered the way navigation worked in my absence)
<btami> huh, i'v tried it now and failed :(
<jamest> StyXman: lemme look
Action: ariel_ is away: busy
<jamest> there was talk about moving projects not being worked on into an archive
<jamest> maybe someone did that over the weekend
<btami> jamest: so what pages are for ?
<jamest> pages are just that pages
<jamest> however they were designed with a block setting inside a page
<jamest> not spread across them
<btami> why ?
drochaid (~drochaid@pc2-kirk1-3-cust16.renf.cable.ntl.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<jamest> when I set them up i was following what I remembered about Oracles SQL*Forms
<jamest> this is the way it worked
<jamest> we're talking about doing away with that restriction
<jamest> in fact
<btami> i think pages are to split info , not for "blocks"
<jamest> back
<jamest> have fields display across pages is in the forms TODO
<jamest> the blocks nested inside pages have been around since the start
<jamest> I'm not saying were tied to that idea only that is was the 1st implementation and we've never adjusted it :)
<jamest> what we want to provide is a way to say
<jamest> this field belongs on all pages, or on pages 1, 3 and 5, or on page 1
<jamest> however I wouldn't expect this feature until after 0.5.x series is complete
<jamest> btami: have you seen the feature plans?
<btami> i think we talking diffrerent things
<btami> my problem is:
<btami> jamest: yes
<btami> what to do if i have 1 table with 100 fields
<btami> and want tu use 1 form
<jamest> right now you're going to suffer
<jamest> :)
<jamest> i see the problem
<jamest> honestly
<btami> ok
<btami> :)
<jamest> however i never thought about that size table when I did the page inside block thing
<jamest> a very nasty workaround
<jamest> make a master/detail/detail/detail setup
<jamest> all using the same table
<jamest> it would be ugly to setup, editing would be a major pita
<jamest> is this page limitation going to be a showstopper for you?
<jamest> StyXman: they are definately missing

<derek> and have suggestions or know where a 'compatiability list' is
<nickr> yep
<nickr> any camera with removable media would be preferred
<derek> ooo ooo where where
<nickr> most cameras have remavble media
<derek> yeah i think i want removable media
<nickr> otherwise, you can look at the usb compat list
<nickr> http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/
<derek> well how do i know the removable media is supported?
<nickr> you look at the specs
<nickr> if it supports SmartMedia, SD, MMC, Memory Stick or Compact Flash you're good

<nickr> ah
<derek> i have 10% off at best buy and they have 12mos no interest on any 299.99 or more
<derek> i know i want something 2mega pixel or more
<derek> 3 megapixel preferred
<derek> the one that seems to fit that bill in the add

<nickr> my friend has one and its very limiting
<derek> does it work under linux ?
<derek> that is most important to me :)
<nickr> I don't think its a huge issue, but yea, you just need a usb memorystick reader
<derek> the olympus looks sweet but its a bit more than i want to spend
<derek> i would like to be under 400.00

<nickr> $299
<nickr> http://www.bestbuy.com/detail.asp?e=11177736&m=82&cat=83&scat=0
<nickr> hmm, it takes xD Picture Card..
<nickr> I'm not sure what that is
<derek> would you recommend it over the olympus and sony?
<nickr> its cheaper
<jamest> or
<jamest> grab a halfway nice  SRL
<jamest> regular camera and a scanner
<nickr> jamest: traitor
<derek> jamest: scanners under linux suck and its too much work for wife
<derek> jamest: i planned on getting both SRL and Digital
<jamest> you'll save money and the digital images are probably as good
<jbailey> derek: My scanner's been fine and Angies coping with it well.
<jbailey> It integrated very nicely into the Gimp.
<derek> but found that walmart has upload digital to them and they print on paper for .28 a print
<derek> our friend does it and they come out as nice as SRL
<nickr> http://www.bestbuy.com/detail.asp?e=11075241&m=82&cat=83&scat=84 this is the one I have
<derek> so we are going digital only
<derek> as it will be cheaper than buying film and only printing shots we really need in print will save a fortune in processing

<nickr> derek: yep!
<jcater> derek: never ask a hacker if something works under linux! 
<jcater> :)
<nickr> either directly with a slight kernel modification or with a CF reader
<nickr> I like CF a lot.
<nickr> slight = adding 1 line to a file and recompiling
<derek> jcater you have a digital
<derek> nickr: i woudl go CF i think
<derek> i assume thats a card reader of sorts
<nickr> CF or SmartMedia are good
<nickr> they are formats
<nickr> readers exist for them
<derek> think looks sweet BUT about twice what i want to spend
<derek> well not want to, can :)
<nickr> hehe
<nickr> its pretty good
<nickr> I have some gripes about image quality in certain conditions
<nickr> I'd rather have a Nikon D100 or Fuji S2
<nickr> someday. :Q)
<derek> http://www.bestbuy.com/detail.asp?e=11102083&m=82&cat=83&scat=84
<nickr> Yea
<nickr> like
<nickr> it probably takes godo pictures and all
<derek> is SD Secure Digital
<nickr> but the UI on the kodak's I've used is TEH SUCH
<nickr> yea
<nickr> * 16MB removable CompactFlash memory card included
<derek> you said xD isnt supported or is questionable
<nickr> I think its somewhat questionable
<derek> ok now to clarify jcaters point
<derek> how hard is it to get SmartMedia/SD/MMC/MemoryStick/CompactFlash to work?
<derek> i.e. i buy the reader 
<derek> and under debian what must i 'really' do
<nickr> modprobe usb-storage
<nickr> plug it in
<nickr> er
<nickr> modprobe scsi-mod and other things.I think in recent installations its already installed
<nickr> plug it in
<nickr> mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
<nickr> wow, hard!
<nickr> pretty much the same for the camera
<nickr> except some require kernel tweaking
<derek> well i might be bugging you later :)
<derek> i have like 2 or 3 scsi devices already in CD's
<derek> what program do you use to download?
<derek> gphoto?
<nickr> they'll just be enumerated higher
<nickr> No
<nickr> because its just a storage device I use cp
<derek> ok so nautilus
<nickr> yea
Action: derek has to get this workign for my wife
<derek> so cp isnt an option :)
<derek> i will use cp :)
<jbailey> derek: I tell you that scanners under linux are fine for non-techies now.
<jbailey> As long as they don't have to set them up at first.
<nickr> scanners are no problem
<nickr> digital photography is easier faster at the cost of quality
<derek> well great i will ask you guys later to help me get my scanner working :)
<derek> but i still will be getting a digital camera
<jbailey> nickr: Concur, but a scanner's nice for other things too.
Action: derek has other uses for scanner
<jbailey> derek: Sure.

<ajmitch> nah :)
<jbailey> So now that I'm sitting in designer...
<jbailey> How do I make it work? =)  I've logged into the database this time, but when I right click on the textbox to do a new datasource, nothing happens.
<jamest> easiest way
<jamest> file->new->from wizard
<ajmitch> or emacs file.gfd ;)
<ajmitch> is right-click on form widgets meant to work?
<jamest> i don't think we have right click menus
<jamest> you can dbl click on a widget
<jamest> to get properties box
<jbailey> Hmm.  Can you recommend which wizard for a simple one page form? =)
<jamest> how many tables?
<jbailey> Two, unless postgres supports infinitely long varchars, in which case one. =)
<jamest> it does
<jamest> well
<jamest> type text is limited to 2gb
<jamest> er
<jamest> 2tb
<jbailey> That's fine. =)
<jbailey> Even better!
<jamest> if it's 1 then do simple wizard
<jamest> as it does 1 table
<jbailey> Then one page should be fine.  The database shows no sign of normalization in its source form, so I'm trying to make the conversion easy.
Action: ajmitch thinks designer is looking sexy
<jamest> the simpleDetail will do a single master/detail
<jamest> the formBuilder will do as many tables and pages as you like
<jbailey> Woohoo!  Backtrace!
<jamest> now, you are working from an existing table structure right?
<ajmitch> jamest: think there'd be any chance of a multi-column dropdown?

<jbailey> I got this when I clicked "continue" after giving my form title and picking my connection.
<jamest> it's saying that a query resulting in nothing returned
<jamest> which is wacked in the wizard as it uses pgsql system tables
<jbailey> Lemme exit and start again in case I did something earlier that screwed it up.
<jamest> ok

<jbailey> 1.0.13-1
<jcater> boing!
<jbailey> Too old, too new?
<jcater> too new
<jbailey> Joy.
<jcater> either they changed the API
<jcater> or have a serious bug
<jamest> one thing that rocks about having 4 different pgsql drivers
<jcater> given the 1.0.12 -> 1.0.13 change
<jamest> is you have 4 different interpretations of the python db api
<jcater> I couldn't imagine them doing a major API chang
<jbailey> (rocks like good rock and roll, or rocks like sucks rocks soaked in cow piss?)
<jcater> jamest: yeah, but now 5 :)
<jcater> as apparently they changed their interpretation
<jcater> jbailey: I have the 1.0.12-1 debs at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/debian/
<jcater> this sucks though
<jcater> it sucks the rocks socked in cow piss

<jamest> ah

<jbailey> Oh, it came back.

Action: derek is back (gone 02:01:18)
<derek> nickr: i went with the kodak.... 
<nickr> derek: GAH
<nickr> derek: after my dire warnings?
<derek> the olympus had sucky interface and felt 'cheap' (with kids thats important issue)
<derek> the sony was very nice
<derek> nice interface
<derek> wife liked it better than kodak interface (though she didnt mind kodak ui)
<derek> kodak was 50 more
<derek> BUT
<derek> it was 4.0 instead of 3.0 megapixels
<nickr> ja
<derek> and it took compact flash insetead of memorystick
<nickr> yea
<derek> and the compact flash was WAY cheaper
<nickr> not really much diff
<nickr> really depends on where you buy it
<derek> i.e. i got the reader and 256mb of flash for cheaper than a 128mb stick
<derek> nickr: yes long term i agree
<derek> but again no interest was a factor
<nickr> they have 128mb sticks for $60 at costco here
<derek> all in all it was up to wife
<ajmitch> hey derek
<derek> she liked both the kodak and the sony
<derek> oh other factor
<ajmitch> jbailey: they're 0 wide in forms or designer, or both? :)
<derek> kodak had builtin batteries (with charger)
<jbailey> DEsigner.
<ajmitch> jbailey: object navigator
<jbailey> But I can't imagine how I am supposed to grab them and drag them around like this. =)
Action: derek also didnt hear your dire warnings
<derek> you said something about good quality but not great interface
<ajmitch> jbailey: object nav is in the tools window
Action: derek hopes that was only yuck
<jbailey> The default width is -5 for these?
<jbailey> woo.
<ajmitch> jbailey: uhh, shouldn't be :)
<ajmitch> you acn right click on things in tree & edit properties
<nickr> derek: it uses AAs no?
<derek> nope CRV3 lithium
<nickr> GAH
<nickr> suck
<derek> gah?
<derek> suck?
<jbailey> There's no 'save' button on the property inspector.
<jbailey> Is that expected?
<derek> jbailey: why woudl there be?
<derek> if you save the form the property selection you have made will be saved
<nickr> getting something that runs on NiMH AAs is great. You get a gew sets on the cheap
<nickr> and a couple chargers
<jbailey> derek: Because when I change the length from -5 to 10 and close the window it doesn't change.
<jbailey> So I can only assume there's a missing 'apply' or 'save' button or something.
<jbailey> Oh, I see.  I had to change 'lenght' & maximum length from -5.
<ajmitch> jcater: i thought that bug where property navigator didn't work with scrollbars on screen was fixed? :)
<jcater> is it not?
<jcater> worked for me
<jcater> (tm)
<ajmitch> jcater: doesn't seem to work here (ran setup-cvs.py a few min ago)
<ajmitch> what is appropriate input mask for date entry? :)
<jbailey> Which element contains the gray box width in the background.
<jcater> BUGGER
<jbailey> It doesn't seem to support a right-click option.
<jbailey> In fact right clicking on the background hangs designer for 10 to 15 seconds.
Action: jcater runs screaming into the street!
Action: ajmitch feels sorry for bringing up that bug
<ajmitch> jcater: when did you commit the fix?
<jcater> it's been a few weeks
<jamest> 0 wide?
<jamest> wtf?
<jbailey> Hmm, at this speed It hink it will take me 2 hours to correct all of the -5 entries to being a reasoable length.  I'll have to do this another time.  Oh well.
<jcater> how did you get -5 sizes?
<jbailey> That's what the wizard did by default.
<jamest> jbailey: the default size is based upon the size reported by the database
<jcater> how fscking bizarre
<jamest> I'm running the 1.0.8 pyscopg from debian
<jamest> woody
<jcater> I use 1.0.12
<jamest> and it's fine
<jamest> hang on
<jamest> jbailey: you have a working mysql setup too?
<ajmitch> so sid's psycopg could be more broken than you think :)
<jamest> as this is not a positive note to end on 
<jbailey> jamest: No, I was concerned that someone said that some queries would silently break without subselects being available.
<jamest> no, query by detail would break
<jamest> that feature is < 1 week old :)
<jbailey> Ah, nice. =)
<jamest> std forms should work fine
<jbailey> Perhaps I'll try it with mysql then in a bit.
<jbailey> I need to do some paperwork and take lunch soon, though.
<jamest> you can also try other postgresql drivers
<jamest> popy, pgsql (postgresql in our connections.conf)
<jamest> they seem to be in the newer debians

Action: Chipaca waltzes in
<ajmitch> ah, found what i need (block with multiple rows
<Chipaca> is there any way currently implemented or currently dreamed up for specifying "total" columns in the datasource?
<jamest> yeah
<derek> nickr: ok scsi-mod and usb-storage loaded
<ajmitch> like a psuedo-field? :)
<derek> card inserted and such
<derek> but
<jamest> a field not tied to a datasource with a named trigger tied to the fields that effect the total
<derek> latitude:/# mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/camera/
<derek> mount: you must specify the filesystem type
<derek> latitude:/# 
<derek> am i missing something?
<derek> jcater / jamest / ajmitch any suggestions?
<jamest> an entry in /etc/fstab
<jbailey> bbiab
jbailey (~jbailey@atlas.fundserv.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<derek> what is steh file type?
<ajmitch> umm
<Chipaca> jamest: but wouldn't that still bring all the fields?

<jcater> ajmitch: what form is that on?
<ajmitch> jcater: one i'm putting together
<Chipaca> derek: so you find out the filesystem type
Action: derek doesnt know what that does so im nervous to do it
<ajmitch> that occured when i trying adding a dropdown
<Chipaca> derek: reads the first megabyte (overkill, make it 1k) from the disk and looks at it

<derek> plug and replug still says unused
<Chipaca> jamest, jcater: similar to sum() thing, but I don't want to bring in the whole thing from the db, I'd really like the dbdriver to be smart enough to pass the sum on to the db :)

<lupo> hi
<derek> so i can understand as i will need to do this on more than one box
<Chipaca> derek: hold on, let me get the names straight
<lupo> anyone of you who also has submitted projects to savannah and got them rejected despite correct copyrights?
<jcater> lupo: yes
<derek> i have rejected projects on savannah despice correct copyrights
<lupo> i ask myself whether this is new savannah policy
<derek> as its more than copyright, license
<lupo> "reject everything"
<ajmitch> heh
<Chipaca> derek: question, are these debian machines?
<lupo> derek: let's assume correct license
<derek> well let me rephrase that, i have rejected 'gnu project applications' even with propery copyright
<ajmitch> complain to savannah-hackers@gnu.org if you feel it's not right :)
<derek> Chipaca: yes
<Chipaca> derek: maybe just installing hotplug will get you rolling
<lupo> savannah-hackers@gnu.org seems to be the problem
<ajmitch> lupo: yes, the volunteers that do the project approval might be overly strict
<derek> Chipaca: removed all usb
<Chipaca> derek: anyhow, you need USB support (usbcore), support for your host controller (usb-uhci, uhci, or usb-ohci), the device type driver (scsi-whatever), the driver for the usb-to-device-type (usb-storage), and possibly the driver for the particular usb device you have if it's not "standard"
<derek> now give me step by step
<Chipaca> derek: apt-get install hotplug
<Chipaca> derek: uninstall the thing before hotplug gets up and running
<Chipaca> derek: plug it back in once it is
<derek> ok so load all modules
<derek> then unplug
<lupo> i have recently submitted an XML-to-Videotext converter and got it rejected despite correct copyright notices
<lupo> and COPYRIGHT file
<derek> then install hotplug
<derek> then plug it back in
Action: ajmitch cries
<Chipaca> derek: no, hotplug should take care of the modules part on its own :)
Action: ajmitch reminds himself not to learn without wizards in the future ;)
Action: Chipaca consoles ajmitch
<derek> oh crap i installed them and am apt-getting hotplu
<derek> will that be a problem
Action: ajmitch swears profusely
<Chipaca> derek: heh, probably not, but you could remove them again just in case :)
Action: Chipaca hands ajmitch a 6-pack
<ajmitch> this probably would have taken 2 minutes with the wizard ;)
<ajmitch> at least i'm learning...
<ajmitch> hah! it worked

<jcater> um
<jcater> ok
<ajmitch> impressive
<ajmitch> so that resizes the dialog to match?
<jcater> it resized the grid to match the notebook control
<jcater> only we were grabbing the outer dimensions of the notebook
<ajmitch> ok
<jcater> not the inner
<ajmitch> hmm
<derek> jcater: my 3 year old was with her aunt last night
<derek> they were going to in and out burger (a burger joint) at like 11pm
<derek> uncle asked her what she wanted from there
<derek> her response
<derek> "a donut"
<derek> when told they didnt have donuts she said
<derek> "well if they dont have donuts I GUESS i will just have a hamburger and french fries"
<ajmitch> haha
<jcater> rofl
<jamest> how long has jcater been w/ us now?
<jcater> 2 yrs come the new year
<jamest> ok, i'd be worried if it was over 3 years
<Chipaca> derek: that's the problem
<jcater> what?
<jcater> the 3 year old daughter?
<Chipaca> jcater: sorry, that was private :)
<Chipaca> jcater: /me is trying to get derek's usb thing working
<jcater> ah
Action: Chipaca considers the futility
<jcater> well "that's the problem"
<jcater> after the daughter comment
<jcater> made me wonder if you'd traced it
<jcater> to peanut butter in the USB port
<Chipaca> jcater: ROTFL
<lupo> lol
<Chipaca> jcater: peanut butter is nothing
<Chipaca> jcater: you should see dulce de leche in usb slots
<Chipaca> jcater: imagine a runny peanut butter
<derek> its that darn tit shaped bread that is clogging the usb port
<Chipaca> umm
<lupo> jamest: reg testing framework, what are your requirements? how should something look like?
<lupo> is it possible that debian 3 has ruled out python2.1 wxgtk libs?
<lupo> do current gnue tools now work with python2.2 from woody?
<lupo> (or do they still mess with unicode?)

<Chipaca> lupo: or ba, for that matter
<lupo> well
<lupo> that's one of the risks you take
<btami> huhuuu, finally i can stick attachments into DCL tickets (you can see in #159 and #162)
<dsmith> dneighbo: What are you trying to do with usb? (over in #debian)
<dneighbo> kick its fscking teeth in
<dneighbo> thats what im wanting to do with usb :0
<dneighbo> dsmith: basically i have new digital camera
<dneighbo> i was told if i got compact flash i should be pretty good with a reader regardless of camera
<dneighbo> unfortunately the 'reader' isnt working AT ALL
<dneighbo> im game to getting camera or reader to work
<dneighbo> at this point it seems to find the device just istn making it scsi
<dsmith> Hmm. I receently plugged in a usb cdrom burner into my laptop.
<nickr> dneighbo: what device is it?
<nickr> what camera too
<dneighbo> camera Kodak EasyShare DX4900 
<dsmith> dneighbo: You do need scsi enabled in your kernel, and some other stuff too. Not needed are any scsi contollers
<dneighbo> reader: PNY CompactFlash USB card reader
<nickr> ah
<nickr> CF Meudia Shuttle?
<nickr> or Compactflash Reader
<nickr> http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/showdev.php?id=576 
<nickr> hm
<dsmith> dneighbo: You will need CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_* and CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS
<dneighbo> dsmith: with debian?
<dsmith> dneighbo: Yep.
<nickr> dsmith: quiet you
<nickr> http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/showdev.php?id=1318
<nickr> weird
<dneighbo> nickr: so you telling me this reader wont work?
<nickr> dneighbo: Looks that way.
<dneighbo> what about camera
<dsmith> dneighbo: Sorry.
<nickr> dneighbo: see second link
<nickr> says 'supported by gphoto2'
<nickr> which is odd
<dneighbo> why is that odd?
<nickr> gphoto2 IS in unstable though
Action: dneighbo suspects (100 dollar bet) that its supported under gphoto2 only ifyou have the 80 base i refused to buy
<dneighbo> sucky thing is that the reader i got was free
<dneighbo> and part of why i went with this camera over one that took memorystick memory
<dneighbo> i will try gphoto2 directly with camera
<nickr> what the fuck
<nickr> dneighbo: yea, some readers are good (eg usb-storage devices) and some just suck
<dneighbo> OUCH
<Chipaca> this one is an usb-storage, shows up in /proc/scsi/usb-storage, but not in /proc/scsi/scsi
<dneighbo> word to the wise
<dneighbo> if you have a LONG goatee do not get it near the exhuast fan of a pc
<Chipaca> "never plug an usb device into the mains"?
<dneighbo> getting it caught hurts
<Chipaca> oh, THAT
<Chipaca> :)
<dsmith> Ouch!
<nickr> dneighbo: so you don't have a usb cable for the camera itself?
<dneighbo> yeah
<dneighbo> im downloading gphoto2 now
<nickr> yea you don't or yes you do?
<nickr> you need gtkam also
jamest (~jamest@leibniz.math.ksu.edu) left #gnuenterprise.
<nickr> gphoto2 doesn't have a graphical interface
<dneighbo> yeah i do
<dneighbo> no gui, ouchie
<dneighbo> gtkam
<dneighbo> ok getting that too
Action: dneighbo REALLY hopes i can get something easy for wife to use
<dneighbo> or im having to install windows :(
<jcater> rofl
Action: jcater thinks its funny
<dneighbo> i dont
<jcater> you think it'll work under windows
<dneighbo> jcater: thats the problem
Action: jcater HATES setting up digital cameras for friends
<dneighbo> its an illusion
<nickr> gtkam has a gimp plugin too
<dneighbo> it will install and work
<jcater> on their win32 machines
<dneighbo> but then will stop in 2 days
<jcater> dude
<dneighbo> and be irrevocably fixable
<jcater> you'll smack me for this
<jcater> but you need to get your wife a mac
<jcater> and be done with it
Action: jcater hides
Action: Chipaca smacks jcater
<lupo> ?
<dsmith> os X mac
<dsmith> good
<dneighbo> libgtk2.0-0 l
<dneighbo> jcater: if i had money i would consider it
<dneighbo> she has habits of a mac user
<dneighbo> i.e. artsy stuff
<Chipaca> jcater: would the mac be for when you push her out in the rain due to her ridiculous demands wrt computers?
<dneighbo> wants to print cards and photos and stuff
<dsmith> mac, definitly
<dneighbo> guess im getting gtk2 :)
<jcater> I can see the switch commercial now
<dsmith> It's all FreeBSD now
<jcater> "My husband used to make me us Linux"
<dsmith> Sort of.
<jcater> "But now I just plug my digital camera in"
<jcater> "And it just works"
<jcater> "Sort of"
<nickr> hah I was wondering why gtkam was running so slow
<jcater> "Well, 90% of the time"
<jcater> "But it's much cooler"
<nickr> and It turns out that I'm running it remoteely over the cable modem
<nickr> from my home machine
<nickr> the wonders of remote desktop.
<jcater> "I'm Laurie.... and I switched"
<jcater> then there's derek's switch
<jcater> "My name is Derek"
<nickr> and I broke it.
<jcater> "I used to put my wife on a linux computer"
<jcater> "But the couch got too uncomfortable at night"
<jcater> "Now my back doesn't hurt in the morning"
<jcater> "And I get nookie again"
<dneighbo> ok gtkam and gphoto2 installed
<dneighbo> any tips
<jcater> "That's why I switched"
<nickr> dneighbo: gtkam, add camera
<nickr> dneighbo: select camera model from list
<nickr> er, you should probably make sure its plugged into the usb
<nickr> before
<dneighbo> hmm its plugged in but its not finding it
<dneighbo> is there way to view usb devices
<Chipaca> dneighbo: mount usbdevfs /proc/bus/usb -t usbdevfs
<dneighbo> hot damn it shows in usbview!
<dneighbo> snot
<nickr> dneighbo: detect in add camera doesn't find it?
<dneighbo> it autodected it
<dneighbo> nickr: it does now
<dneighbo> i started hotplug
<nickr> sweet
<dneighbo> unplugged and replugged
<dneighbo> and it seems to be working
<dneighbo> now to try to get images :)
<dneighbo> ok 
<dneighbo> this is EASIER than windows
<dneighbo> gtkam + hotplug
<nickr> yea
<dneighbo> is a 30 second setup
<nickr> incredible.
Action: dneighbo kicks all small children and dogs in sight
<Chipaca> dneighbo: usbdevfs mounted? or without that?
<nickr> hotplug automatically mounts that I think.
<dneighbo> Chipaca: not mounted
<ajmitch> lol
<Chipaca> nickr: not for dneighbo, it doesn't :)
<dneighbo> well at least not manually
<ajmitch> so now it's working? :)
<dneighbo> yip
<dneighbo> direct from camera
<nickr> sweet
<dsmith> When I plugged in that usb cdrom burner, it just worked.  cdrecord found it with no problems whatever.
<dneighbo> the kodak dx4900 is supported on debian :)
Action: ajmitch only has one usb device he relies on absolutely
<dneighbo> nickr: you mentioned a gimp something
<dsmith> But it took hours and hours to get it to work under windows.
<ajmitch> i _have_ to have usb for my internet connection :)
<nickr> dneighbo: gtkam-gimp
<ajmitch> so the free reader thing is no good? :)
<nickr> I'll sell you my extar one, all you have to do is bend the little pins back into place
<nickr> :O
<dneighbo> must one be root?
<nickr> you can adjust something or other and not have to be
<nickr> or you can make a launcher that uses sudo with no password
<nickr> teehee
<dneighbo> hmm second option sounds good
<dneighbo> i need to look into sudo
<nickr> its probably better to fix the perms
<nickr> because then the gimp plugin will work right
<nickr> and you won't have random files owned by root

<Chipaca> dneighbo: apt-get install task-universe
<ajmitch> an excuse to visit people & demand money?
<Chipaca> in spanish they'd probably be 'obligations'
<ajmitch> be sure to take along a baseball bat :)
<nickr> dneighbo: dunno.
<Chipaca> I mean the legal IOUs that you sign and are upholdable in court
<nickr> dneighbo: ah, its only for gimp1.3
Action: ajmitch does not know
<nickr> dneighbo: so it'll be in gimp if you run gimp1.3
<nickr> gimp1.3 has certain ... instabilities though.
<jcater> Chipaca: contract? loan?
<Chipaca> jcater: it's less than those
<dneighbo> well i have 1.3
<dneighbo> how do i use it :)
<nickr> are you running gimp-1.3
<dneighbo> head in ass
<dneighbo> no
<dneighbo> i installed it
<dneighbo> but gimp runs 1.2 not 1.3
<nickr> yea, run gimp-1.3
<ajmitch> gimp-1.3
<dneighbo> yah starting now
<nickr> wow, this is slow over a remote connection
<dneighbo> btw: battery TYPE 
<dneighbo> 1.2 AA Ni-MH batteries 
<dneighbo> isnt that what you suggested?
<nickr> yea
<dneighbo> cool
<dneighbo> it can use that or CRV3
<dneighbo> ok gimp 1.3 up but not seeing readily how to get to gtkam
<nickr> you'd think it'd be under Acquire
<dneighbo> thats what i thought
<dneighbo> but dont see it tere
<nickr> I don't see it anywhere, hmm
<nickr> maybe you neude to run gtkam first and save the settings under the user that runs gimp also
lupo (~lupo@pD95423A1.dip.t-dialin.net) left irc: "using sirc version 2.211+KSIRC/1.1"

<dneighbo> its ok gtkam should be enough
<nickr> hmm
<nickr> okay
<dneighbo> although my camera saves images at like 2644x something huge
<dneighbo> almost crashed X viewing them
<nickr> yea, they are big
<nickr> unless you're doing something exquisitly silly, it shouldn't crash X though.
<nickr> but look who I'm talking to

<Chipaca> "obligation" it is! (webster 1913, # 5)
<nickr> In Other News, I want to make a list of requirements for my revised docustore design. Any help?
<dneighbo> yeha
<Chipaca> dneighbo: apt-get install feh
<nickr> dneighbo: hm?
<nickr> I prefer gqview
<Chipaca> nickr: feh blew me away with it's speed
<Chipaca> nickr: especially when compared with imagemagick :)
<dsmith> Well, yeah.
<nickr> everything is fast compared to imagemagick
<dsmith> The onlything slower than imagemagick is staroffice.
<dsmith> ;^)
<Chipaca> but actually feh is fast on its own right
<Chipaca> as in I look at a 14000x14800 pic in under 10 secs
<nickr> thats a big picture
<Chipaca> http://200.59.86.175/~john/map.png
<Chipaca> or .jpg for a smaller one (only 4MB)
<nickr> this one of those pictures that'll crash galeon
<nickr> I ask as the galeon error dialog pops up
<dsmith> How does feh compare to xv ?
<ajmitch> mmmm, openoffice.org running on an old pentium, with 16MB of ram ;)
Action: dsmith weeps for ajmitch
<ajmitch> Chipaca: how much ram do you have, too?
<Chipaca> ajmitch: 640MB
<Chipaca> dsmith: feh is free
<dsmith> Chipaca: True
<dneighbo> http://gnuenterprise.org/~dneighbo/ximian_barbie.jpg to prove its true there is a ximian ken doll
<nickr> sick
<dneighbo> and twisted
<dneighbo> might i add
<dneighbo> btw: my children did this
<dneighbo> they took a rupert doll (ximian monkey)
<dneighbo> and a few days later i went in and ken was wearing ruperts shirt
<Chipaca> dneighbo: the "sick and twisted" fits in just fine
<dneighbo> ok enough playing time for real work
<nickr> so ken and rupert were ... uhh
<nickr> y'know
<ajmitch> that scares me
<dsmith> Chipaca: http://200.59.86.175/~john/map.png crashed dillo
<nickr> crashes galeon too
Action: nickr wgetting
<Chipaca> dsmith: I think your kernel crashed dillo (as in OOM: kill the sucker)
<ajmitch> wouldn't surprise me
<ajmitch> i have a 9.3Kx9.3K image here that uses a lot of ram to open
<nickr> might crash galeon because of my display situation
<ajmitch> remote?
<Chipaca> nickr: galeon is very sucky wrt images, that's a mozilla thing
<nickr> yea
<nickr> true
<Chipaca> nickr: even the jpg will crash galeon
<ajmitch> gqview up to 570MB...
<dsmith> What the heck is that thing?
<ajmitch> > 700MB...
<Chipaca> dsmith: a map
<Chipaca> dsmith: of america
<Chipaca> dsmith: compelte with sea monsters and land giants
<Chipaca> dsmith: circa 1500
<ajmitch> lol
<dsmith> It wouldn't have Ohio on it then. :(
<ajmitch> gqview has peaked at 710MB for this image i have :)
<Chipaca> dsmith: probably not, as the names of the places are still mostly spanish
Action: ajmitch ctrl-c's it :)
<Chipaca> ajmitch: now try feh
<ajmitch> pity i only have 512MB of RAM at the moment
<ajmitch> not bad, feh only uses 336MB for the same image
<dsmith> What kind of connection is 200.59.86.175 ?
<ajmitch> better at scrolling too
<nickr> the jpeg loaded instantly for me in gqview
<dsmith> feh is just a thin wrapper around imlib, iirc.
<nickr> zoom and scroll instantly
<nickr> tha map is way cool
<Chipaca> dsmith: 256/128 ADSL
<dsmith> I'm only getting it at 6 kB a sec. and I'm on dual ds3's.

<dsmith> Chipaca: Not me anymore.
<Chipaca> dsmith: :)
<Chipaca> dsmith: imlib2
<ajmitch> the .png is a little big to download ;)
<Chipaca> ajmitch: you can get it from the library of congress, but only in chunks
<ajmitch> bbl
<dsmith> Chipaca: Did you glue it together with imagemagick ?
<Chipaca> dsmith: yes
<dsmith> It might be slow, but it sure can do a *lot* of stuff.
<Chipaca> dsmith: slow and memory hungry, but it's the kind of project I'd pitch in to. Does lots of stuff, reads and writs nearly anything, etc etc
<Chipaca> dsmith: I needed 2GB of swap to build that image :)
<Chipaca> dsmith: it was    s  l  o  w
<dsmith> Chipaca: yep.  I used it to cut out the images in wmMoonClock to make the images in gkrellmoon. Very scriptable.
<Chipaca> dsmith: so we agree it sucks in a cool way :)
<dsmith> Yes.

<nickr> good lesson not to use try's unless you're catching a specific exception
<nickr> I just spent 40 minutes debugging variable name typos
<nickr> it took using pdb to actually find the orrors because I had forgotton that I wrapped the call in a try further up the object chain
<nickr> DOH

<chillywilly> slap yourself

<jamest> my bad....that's the start of the autoconf setup 
<chillywilly> you're going to rip on autoconf? what do you have that is better disutils?

<jamest> as it doesn't
dsmith (~dsmith@p165.n-chpop06.stsn.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> autoconf is easy, all it consists of is a macro langauge and shell scripts
<jamest> which changes at random during it's development
<jamest> oh AM_FOOBATE_DA_BAR?  That's a version #.#.1 setting
<chillywilly> I don't think so
<dsmith> autoconf is a maze of twisty little config files, all different
<jamest> you need AC_FOOBATE_DA_BAR?  Introdced in #.#.2
<jamest> dude, those changes were eating my lunch when I used C exclusively
<jamest> maybe I just got unluck but it was one of my #1 gripes about it

<jamest> but distutils is no better
<jamest> it's my fault they changed the config files?
<chillywilly> no they libs you depended on the autoconf macros don't change much between releases
<jamest> ah, ok
<chillywilly> and when they do it is a pretty major revision
<jamest> all I know is it was driving me nuts
<jamest> but now that's distutils job
<chillywilly> I had to change once when I started sing commoncpp from cvs
<chillywilly> using
<dsmith> jamest: What's distutils?
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> it's the python building shtuff
<ajmitch> it's beautiful
<chillywilly> ./setup.py build
<chillywilly> ./setup.py install
<dsmith> Oh, ok.
<chillywilly> uh, it's not that great
<jamest> distutils is bad
<jamest> it's original goal was to provide an equiv to autoconf
Nick change: drochaid_ -> drochaid
<jamest> but lurking on the lists it was very aparent that  that was no longer a goal
<jamest> they made something ok for installing python modules
<jamest> but not apps
<dsmith> the IDEA's are great, but auto* is an ugly wart that keeps getting ulier.
<chillywilly> all build systems suck
<jamest> and even python modules are iffy
<chillywilly> dsmith: I find it rather easy to write my own macros when I need to
<chillywilly> cause there are plenty out there to look at fr inspriation ;)
<chillywilly> mwahaha
<dsmith> They plan to re-write all the auto* tools in Guile Scheme.  Then life will be happy.
Action: dsmith ducks
<chillywilly> that would be col
<chillywilly> cool
<chillywilly> they should write it all in elisp and require emacs to be installed ;)
<dsmith> chillywilly: Actually, I agree with you.  Copyying and tweaking isn;t so bad, but starting from scratch is nasty.
<chillywilly> muuuuwaahahahahaa
<chillywilly> dsmith: it's just shell scripting for the most part
<chillywilly> if you can't shell script you should shoot yourself ;)
<dsmith> What's whacky, is you use configure to generate the Makefile from Makefile.in, but it's too diffucult to write that, so you write Makefile.am and use automake to make Makefile.in.
<chillywilly> no, it's that Makefiles all are pretty generic
<jamest> then you put on the goat head, sacrafice a squirel to the build tool gods, run the autotools and prey the moons are in proper alignment
<dsmith> chillywilly: Yes, shell is pretty easy, and m4 is too once you understand it.
<chillywilly> with similar targets that you don't feel like rewriting every time
<jamest> distutils required you use the head of a yak
<chillywilly> eeek
<chillywilly> no goat?
<chillywilly> real men use goats, imho ;)
<jamest> no, but in NZ i think you can use a sheep for any or all of the above animals

<dneighbo> hey in xvncviewer is there a way to send 'shift' clicks across the net?
<dneighbo> no xvncviewer users?
<jcater> ya
Action: dneighbo is thinking this is a MAJOR bug if you cant do this
<jcater> but I didn;t know it didn't send shift+clicks
<dneighbo> as it screws everything i do at work :(
<jcater> ah
<dneighbo> well how would you say send ctrl-alt-del
<jcater> the pr0n viewer maps shift+rclick?
<jcater> that I don't know
<jamest> the break tracker too?
Action: dneighbo unfortunately moves alot of objects via highlight object
<dneighbo> then select libraries to copy it to (shift-click/ctrl-click) press button (as there is no Keyboard way to do this
<dneighbo> smokey no way
<dneighbo> you cna run vnc on an ipaq
<dneighbo> how sweet
<chillywilly> way
<dneighbo> anyone have vnc tips on this?
<dneighbo> i found something on keymaps
<dneighbo> but it left me more confused than anything
<dneighbo> this sucks
<jcater> dneighbo: what window manager are you using
Action: jcater guesses it's the window manager capturing that, not vnc
<jcater> as vnc will pass anything it actually receives
<jcater> e.g., I can't use Alt-Tab or Alt-F4 in KDE
<dneighbo> fluxbox
<jcater> because KDE interprets those
<dneighbo> but wont about any window manager grab a ctrl
<dneighbo> there must be some way to force it to client
<jcater> for the purpose of testing, why don't you start up a raw X session on another terminal with only an xterm
<dneighbo> i can hit F8 and get a popupp to send ctrl-alt-del
<jcater> thus no window manager
<jcater> and see if it works
<dneighbo> jcater: if i knew how to do that i would be glad :)
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> kdm gives that as an option :)
<dneighbo> gdm might too
<dneighbo> but im a bit afraid to drpo my connection
Action: jcater is thinking
<dneighbo> as getting back on can be a bitch
<dneighbo> i have found way to do keymaps and such but its horridly ugly
<dneighbo> http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/xvncviewer.html
<dneighbo> i guess at this point i dont have much choice as to do work i have to have this
<jcater> dneighbo: 
<jcater> Ctrl+alt+F1 to a console login
<jcater> then login
<jcater> then
<jcater> xinit -- :1
<jcater> should bring up a window-managerless session
<jcater> then try xvncviewer
<jcater> btw, if this works, then this tells us the problem
<jbailey> That's a frightening amount of work. =)
<jcater> and we can find a cleaner solution :)

<dneighbo> no xterem in PATH

<dneighbo> no net when dialed up

<jcater> bugger

<jcater> what do you use?
<dneighbo> 6 months ago i would have kicked someone that suggested using evolution

<dneighbo> my wife hated everything
<jcater> prior to installing

<jcater> as it has the same interface as evolution
<jcater> but with the KDE widget set
<chillywilly> jcater: the kompany is evil
<jcater> maybe
<jcater> I suppose they are KDE's version of Ximian
<chillywilly> hmm, wrose I would say
<jcater> although I like the kompany better than ximian
<jcater> I don't think so
<chillywilly> cause they develop a LOT of prop. stuff
<jcater> at least they are always honest about what they're doing
<chillywilly> I dunno evil is evil ;)
<chillywilly> anyway, even the KDE developers can't stand the kompanyt
<dneighbo> jcater: im with chilly on this onnly because to me KDE is like Caldera
<dneighbo> its not that they are doing prop development its the attitude
Action: dneighbo speaks only CEO to CEO
<dneighbo> not the developers working for Kompany
<chillywilly> you mean the Kompany is like Caldera ;)
Action: dneighbo isnt thrilled always with Ximian and what it does, but the leaders there arent quiet as nose up turned to the community
<dneighbo> it sucks as they actually do some cool stuff
<chillywilly> agreed
<dneighbo> if the attitude were better they would likely do better (even with prop stuff)
<chillywilly> Ransom Love and Shawn Gordon could be best buddies ;)
<dneighbo> maybe they are same person?
Action: chillywilly hears the x-files theme
<chillywilly> a conspiracy?!?
<dneighbo> fsck csi miami
<dneighbo> thanks chilly
<chillywilly> for what?
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> I may put my users on evolution
<chillywilly> ;)
<chillywilly> ugh
<jcater> but I've gotten so used to the slimmed down sylpheed
<jcater> I don't know if I can deal with evolution myself
<chillywilly> you can't
<chillywilly> it SUCKS
<chillywilly> it is almost as bad as outlook
<jcater> that's a good reason to put my users on it
<chillywilly> in fact i think they were trying to emulate outlook's bloatedness
<jcater> as I've had them cry over losing outlook
<jcater> and that's not an exageration
<chillywilly> how does anyone tolerate it?
<chillywilly> hell I've seen my buddy have it lock up a thousand times ona  1GHz laptop
<dneighbo> i kind of like it
<jcater> I had withdrawal when dropping Outlook
<jcater> but I've grown to like slimmed down email
<jcater> (btw, this is Outlook, not Express)
Action: chillywilly uses mutt
<jcater> does evolution support LDAP?
<jcater> if so, that's probably the selling point
<chillywilly> dunno
<chillywilly> I tried using evolution for a while about a few weeks ago
<chillywilly> I hate it
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> dneighbo: you use the calendar stuff?
<dneighbo> i looked into it
<dneighbo> im about to try at home i think

Action: dneighbo might have to use phpgw
<dneighbo> wife and i need way to be in sync
<jcater> hmmm
<jcater> if you slow down, it might help
<jcater> or try other positions
<chillywilly> rofl
<jcater> oh, with calendars
<jcater> doh!
<chillywilly> what about GNUe Groupware eh? ;)

<ra3vat> hello all
<ra3vat> how to add % to all my search input?
--- Tue Nov 12 2002
<dneighbo> %
<dneighbo> if you have field name
<dneighbo> do f8
<dneighbo> in the name entry
<dneighbo> do 
<dneighbo> ra%
<dneighbo> hit f9
<dneighbo> it should return all results starting with ra
<dneighbo> if you do f8
<dneighbo> %ra%
<dneighbo> f9
<dneighbo> it should get you any name containing ra
jcater (~jcater@cpe-066-061-083-220.midsouth.rr.com) left irc: "nite"
<chillywilly> anyone know if gettimeofday(&now, NULL); and then now.tv_usec would give me the current time in milliseconds?
<chillywilly> anyone? anyone?
<chillywilly> bueler? bueler?
<ra3vat> for now i would like % to be added from beginning of non empty search entry
<ra3vat> do f8
<ra3vat> do 
<ra3vat> ra
<chillywilly> hmmm that gives microseconds
<ra3vat> it expands to %ra 
<chillywilly> gess you need to divide by 1000
<chillywilly> grooovy
<ra3vat> dneighbo: any hints?
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> there is something called 'sloppyquery'
rdean (~rdean@12-221-229-247.client.insightBB.com) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<dneighbo> or there was
Action: dneighbo thinks what you are describing might have been what that was for, but have never used it
<dneighbo> can you try sloppyquery
<ra3vat> i saw some sloppy related part commented out in the code, will try it anyway
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> ra3vat: if you put sloppyquery=""
<dneighbo> in a block
<dneighbo> i "think"
<dneighbo> what will happen is everytime you execute a query
<dneighbo> it will append a % to the end
<dneighbo> actually it looks like it will have effect of doing the following
<dneighbo> you enter ra it converts to
<dneighbo> %r%a%
<dneighbo> and you might have to do it as sloppyQuery
<dneighbo> and you might have to do it as sloppyQuery=""
<dneighbo> you can look in forms/src/GFObjects/GFBlock.py to see exactly what its doing 
<dneighbo> or if you need to patch it
<dneighbo> please let me know if this works
<dneighbo> as right this second i can not readily test
<ra3vat> dneighbo: D-G.pdf defines sloopyQuery only among entry attributes
<dneighbo> doh you are right
<dneighbo> try entry
<dneighbo> i was thinking block as its in block code
<dneighbo> but thasts cause it fires onProcessQuery
<dneighbo> but it checks entry.xxx
<ra3vat> form works but search fails

<btami> yes

<dneighbo> grr anyone have sources.list for player stuff?
<dneighbo> nmeos.net seems toastified
<btami> i havn't
Nick change: SachaS_uni -> SachaS
<Arturas> btami: how did you build GNUe.exe's for Windows? did you have any problems with gettext?
<dneighbo> found one
<btami> Arturas: McMillan+Inno
<btami> what problems do you think?
<Arturas> yesterday i finished setup-cvs.py for Windows
<Arturas> but when trying to run form
<Arturas> it gives traceback on gettext (some string is NULL or something like that)
<Arturas> i thought i maybe you have met with this problem while building exe's
<btami> no, i havn't met any problems with gettext
<btami> can you send me your script to try
<Arturas> setup-cvs for win?
<btami> yes
<Arturas> it's in the CVS as setup-cvs2.py
<btami> ooo
<Arturas> (at least it should be there)
<Arturas> but it's now finally finished - still some bugs exist
<btami> i see
<Arturas> now => not
<btami> i will try
<Arturas> i warned you :)
<btami> ok :)
<dneighbo> probably a little late but why setup-cvs2.py
<dneighbo> instead of setup-cvs-win.py or somethign?
<Arturas> it's not ready to replace current setup-cvs.py and it's working (=> should be working) both on Linux and Windows
Action: Arturas is away: meeting (10 min.)
Action: Arturas is back (gone 00:10:52)
<btami> Arturas: why do you put fsutil.exe and linkd.exe into CVS, they aren't free software
<btami> maybe there are free alternetives on the net
fixe (~adam@dsl081-147-022.chi1.dsl.speakeasy.net) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<Arturas> if you're using Windows (legally of course), you may use these tools
<Arturas> and as far as i heard, there are no alternatives yet
fixe (~adam@dsl081-147-022.chi1.dsl.speakeasy.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> i included them because although these tools are included by default with WindowsXP, they are not included with Windows2000
<Arturas> (it's possible to download them somewhere from Microsoft web site)
<Arturas> do you think we should refuse from using them?
<btami> no, just not from our CVS
<ajmitch> non-free software is a bad thing to have in GNU CVS :)
<btami> maybe a README about where to find/download these would be better
<Arturas> i don't like this idea too, but can we say to the user "if you want to install GNUe, make sure you have ...exe and ...exe or download them and put into specified folder and only then you can install GNUe"? :/
<btami> hey, setup-cvs.py is for developers
<btami> not for end users
<Arturas> hm, sorry :)
<btami> :)
<btami> Arturas: can i bugreport for you?
<btami> about setup-cvs2.py
<Arturas> btami: ??
<btami> i got: cannot create a link at: c:\python22\lib\gnue
<btami> oh, wait 
<btami> i was wrong
<btami> tried it on VFAT volume
<Arturas> :)
<btami> trying again :)
<Arturas> the error is correct :)
<ajmitch> Arturas: derek will shoot you if you leave those files in there ;)
<ra3vat> could anyone interested in web forms driver comment on http://openthought.net/cgi-bin/demo_app/demo.pl
<Arturas> Derek will shoot me for putting these files there :) ok, i'll remove them in about 10 mins
<btami> Arturas: i got the same error
<btami> i have c: VFAT
<btami> e: NTFS
<btami> the win2k is in e:
<btami> i wanted to install into e:\gnue\bin, e:\gnue\conf
<btami> but the script forces c:\python22\lib\gnue
<btami> becouse my python resides there
<btami> hmm
<Arturas> that's one of the problems i had - how do i enter gnue into python's modules search path
<Arturas> somewhere in the middle of setup-cvs2.py is the call
<ajmitch> PYTHONPATH, or sys.path :)
<Arturas> under Windows
<Arturas> i solved it by creating a link in python..\lib\gnue pointing to gnue folder
<Arturas> but this is wrong solution
<Arturas> removed ...exes, added readme (-> win-links.txt)

<reinhard> good morning ariel_
<reinhard> sorry that i was so unresponsive yesterday
<reinhard> just a few remarks to the object repository document you sent me
<reinhard> first (and most important) thanks for your work :)
<reinhard> on the general design
<reinhard> i'm not sure if we want to include inheritance at all
<reinhard> and if we want to include versioning and compounds in the very first version
<reinhard> when i looked at your document i got the feeling that XML is not a perfect way of explaining something to a human
<ra3vat> anyone can drop me a test message on ds at ics.elcom.ru, please
<reinhard> ra3vat: ok
<reinhard> sent
<ra3vat> reinhard: thanks, got it
<reinhard> ariel_: i like the tablular explaination you did much better
<reinhard> i thought i might try to change it into an object oriented explaination
<reinhard> (like the old (current) api definition of appserver)
<reinhard> thanks also for the diagram of appserver structure
<reinhard> it seems like my installation of dia is hosed
<reinhard> if i open the diagram i get errors about missing fonts :(
<reinhard> is it possible for dia to export .eps and .png ?
<ariel_> reinhard: 
<reinhard> if yes i could easily include into the whitepaper
<reinhard> -o
<ariel_> don't care about fonts warning, i also have, just click OK 
<ariel_> to export right-click on open diagram
<ariel_> choose file then export
<reinhard> when i click ok for the warning
<reinhard> the diagram doesn't look right
<reinhard> the text is outside the boxes
<ariel_> uhmm
<ariel_> i dunno it changes mine from Hevetica boldOblique  to adobe courier medium-r-normal that fits well
<reinhard> it changes everything to "fixed" for me
<reinhard> however i have about zero idea how fonts work in X
<reinhard> i have this problem with other diagrams too
<reinhard> so it's certainly my own fault
<ariel_> if there aren't changes i can send png btw the first picture in the note is png export of the dia
<reinhard> ariel_: thanks
<reinhard> ariel_: btw i am talking about appserver architecture diagram
<reinhard> not about the class diagram
<ariel_> i can send png just tell me if you prefer the classical package shape (rectangle with label) instead of the component shape (rectangle with side ellipses and smaller rectangles)
<reinhard> um
<reinhard> i don't care that much i think
<reinhard> what you like better :)
<ariel_> ok

<hjibds2> hi
<hjibds2> Is GNUe ready for production use
<Arturas> hi
<Arturas> it's pretty hard to say
<Arturas> it depends :/
<Arturas> practically it almost ready
<Arturas> but it depends on what you want from GNUe
<hjibds2> we are a small business and need some kind of ERP system - my knowledge is very limited in this area
<jamest> we have no prebuilt packages for you to use
<jamest> we're (slowly) getting the tools in place to make building such packages easy
<hjibds2> u mean install from source?
<jamest> no, i mean we have no Inventory Control package, or general ledger package
<hjibds2> what kind of time scale is there for these packages?
<jamest> we have tools that let you easily create data entry screens (what we call forms) and reports
<jamest> dneighbo is working on a small biz package right now that is strickly client/server
<jamest> i _think_ he was getting it checked into gnu's cvs server but I'm not sure where that is at
<hjibds2> sounds intresting
<jamest> I'm also not sure what stage it's at
<jamest> jcater has also submitted a package called RentFree (or something like that) to gnu's cvs that manages rental property
<jamest> again, I'm also not sure what stage it's at
<jamest> so the tools work in 2 tier mode (client/server)
<jamest> and work on appserver is progressing but it is not ready yet to build systems around it
Action: drochaid is away: it's pissing down and I'm in full gore-tex :)
<btami> jamest: have you any success with GTK2 on win32 ?
<jamest> btami: i've had 0 time to try it out
<jamest> i've got a few deathlines at home that all fall on the 1st of dec
<jamest> which is sucking up all my free time
<hjibds2> Are there any systems of a similar nature I can look at?
<jamest> hjibds2: i don't know
<jamest> i know there are other projects but I'm not sure the state of any of them
<jamest> hjibds2: do you have an existing system in place?
<hjibds2> head office are looking at implementing a larger version of the system that we need based on asp and M$ SQL server - i don't want to go down that route
<jamest> btami: i plan to take a few days off to get ahead so I can GNUe again
<btami> ok :)
<hjibds2> jamest - not yet - we are looking at getting some form of system in place in the next 6 months
<jamest> hjibds2: is middlewear important to you?  or are you happy w/ a 2-tier system?
<hjibds2> we would be happy with a 2-tier system
<jamest> what platforms are the clients ?
<hjibds2> win32
<jamest> well, dneighbo's small biz thing might give you what you need
<jamest> and I'd hope to have most the issues w/ win32 worked out in 6 months
<jamest> (the UI driver for windows isn't native win32api so we have to create one)
<jamest> but I can't say for sure
<jamest> the salesman would say "You bet we can."

<revDeke> ok on newsforge they are running an article on openMFG
<revDeke> which doesn appear free, open or even available
<revDeke> and that well kind of got my goad
<revDeke> it was an interview
<revDeke> i took the liberty of responding to the same questions from a gnue standpoint
<revDeke> and was going to submit back as an opinion piece
<revDeke> but wanted to get consensus from this group if that was ok
<jcater> I suppose

<jcater> I just don't see where they get off associating themselves with open source/free software
<jcater> they are just trying to be the peachtree of the manufacturing world
<revDeke> well that is what made me irrate
<revDeke> and i thought putting them to the 'open fishbowl' way our community works
<revDeke> might do some good :)
<drochaid_> revDeke: do you have a copy to hand of what you're planning to post?
<siesel> Quite funny: "(...) [OpenMFG] is certainly a better deal than the much-discussed "Shared Source" initative from Microsoft (...) 
<jcater> oooo
<jcater> we better get busy
<jcater> several references to GNUe

<revDeke> sup psu
<revDeke> read recent backlog and feel free to comment on newsforge
Action: revDeke suspects you will have a good opinion on the subject
<ra3vat> <ra3vat> could anyone interested in web forms driver comment on http://openthought.net/cgi-bin/demo_app/demo.pl
<ra3vat> ?
<psu> heh
Action: siesel looked at it. jsforms is using a similar aproach.
<siesel> I don't think that we can get much from it, because we would have to add too much and even write a perl->python interface, or reimplement gnue-common in perl
<psu> For us, having a company (ab)use the open source label like this is almost a positive
<psu> shows that RMS was right to insist on "free s/w" rather than "open source" as a label
<psu> as it's harder for people to twist that 
<ra3vat> siesel: i usually remember complains about web interface when any new data require to reload a page and fighting about not to let jave in. is that link demostrate one possible solution? 
<siesel> yes, it is one possible solution, and it is the solution choosen by the jsforms client (alpha stage at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jan/jsclient/gnue-forms.html
<revDeke> psu good point you should make that a comment :)
<nickr> its easy to twist free software
<siesel> I also looked at a quite similar but (IMHO) more powerful project than openthought, 
<ra3vat> siesel: thanks for clarifying :)
<siesel> which was quite good, but had one bad point: at the moment it just worked with netscape 4.x
<siesel> ra3vat: it's allways good to know other projects which do quite similar stuff. If the webclient is once working, it could f.e. use openthought plugins for authetification etc.

<marioct> hello people, good night !
<jamest> hello
<marioct> Hello james.
<marioct> I've just downloaded gnue via CVS, and I'll read docs... but I have one question...
<jamest> ok
<marioct> how can I run gnue-forms with curses ? 
<jamest> for any optons you can run
<jamest> gnue-forms --help
<jamest> gnue-forms --interface curses
<jamest> should do it
<jamest> well
[16:59] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<jamest> gnue-forms --interface curses form.gfd
<marioct> ok, but I got this : Error: Unable to load any valid UI drivers.  Aborting.
<jamest> oooooo
<jamest> jcater: do we need to install nstti from our cvs seperately?
<jcater> no
<jcater> but I'm not 100% sure setup.py has been updated to install curses
<jcater> for common
<marioct> can I install ?
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> it should be installing
<jcater> err, wait
<jcater> are you using our CVS code
<jcater> or the last 0.4.0 release?
<marioct> the 0.4.0 release
<jcater> ok, curses wasn't present then
<jcater> a preview will be in the 0.4.1 that we hope to release this week
<jcater> (it's also in cvs)
<jcater> but it's not fully usable yet
<marioct> where in CVS ?
<revDeke> savannah.gnu.org
<jcater> it should be fully supported by 0.5.0
<revDeke> sorry read that as where is not where in
<jcater> I don't have the link handy
<jcater> but if you open www.gnue.org
<jcater> towards the bottom of the left column
<jcater> you'll see "CVS"
<jcater> that has instructions
<jcater> I think it's something like http://www.gnuenterprise.org/community/cvs.php
<jcater> oh, yay
<jcater> I got it right
<marioct> ok... thanks. Do you know about some good book that teaches python ?
<nickr> book!?
<marioct> yes... or tutorials ?!....I must learn python to help build gnue !!!
<nickr> there is a good tutorial in the documentation section of python.org
<nickr> http://www.python.org/doc/current/tut/tut.html
<marioct> ok. thanks.. bye !

<jcater> ===========
<jcater> After the next point release, we are moving away from
<jcater> cvs numbers being '?.?.?a' and instead are doing:
<jcater>   0.1.0 (cvs) ==> 0.0.99
<jcater>   0.1.1 (cvs) ==> 0.1.0.99
<jcater>   1.0.2 (cvs) ==> 1.0.1.99
<jcater>   1.0.0 (cvs) ==> 0.99.0
<jcater>   1.1.0 (cvs) ==> 1.0.99
<jcater> So, whereas the current post-0.4.0 code is called 0.4.1a
<jcater> until the 0.4.1 release, it would, under this new system, 
<jcater> be 0.4.0.99.

<jcater> siesel_: no, unintended
<jcater> we have some big restucturing for both forms and the forms module in designer scheduled for 0.5.0
<revDeke> ok will test prelease when get home
<jcater> to eliminate crap like that
<revDeke> are changelogs updated?
<revDeke> and the feature maps?
<jcater> no, I can't do that for here
<revDeke> i.e. so i have some idea of some things to test for
<jcater> with this first thing, just test a few forms you have that were working
<jcater> by tonight
Action: revDeke will do some general torture testing, but would like to beat on new features and buglets s well
<jcater> we'll have news and changelog and a few install things worked out

Action: revDeke wonders if i shouldnt pay more attention to the release
<revDeke> as i should be doing the 0.4.1 release so you guys can continue on with 0.5.0
<revDeke> i will try to keep things updated for teh 0.4.2 release (if necessary)
Action: revDeke will play wiht feature maps too
<revDeke> or at least study them enough to ask questions :)
<revDeke> siesel_: i think if we are making testing stuff it shouldnt fall in samples perhaps?
<revDeke> unless we just want to make our samples our test bed
<siesel_> you're free to move it to a more apropriate place

<siesel_> revDeke: I think we need to discuss again, how we handle samples and what do we want to provide samples
<jcater> I want to rm -rf samples
<jcater> and start all over
<jcater> I want one interesting schema
<jcater> with sample data and all
<jcater> and all forms / reports / etc
<jcater> use this schema/ theme
<jcater> and I want to use the same schema/theme in the developers guides
<jcater> much like Access' Northwind (or whatever) test database
<jcater> and I don't find zipcodes interesting :)
<siesel_> I thought of something similar.
<siesel_> But what schema/thema should we use?
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> I brought it up a few weeks ago wrt the developer's guide
<revDeke> i have no problem with that
<revDeke> sounds like gnue-sb :)
<jcater> but neither I nor anyone else could come up with one
<jcater> revDeke: maybe a simple version of that only 2-3 tables
<revDeke> yeah
<revDeke> thats what i meant
<revDeke> literal sb now :)
<jcater> anywho
<jcater> that's not going to happen this release
<revDeke> actually i have something
<jcater> but I would like to see it in 0.5.0
<revDeke> that i use for demos
<jcater> 0.5.0 is going to be big
<revDeke> its a video catalog database
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> something like that would be nice
<jcater> it's simple
<revDeke> its really simple
<siesel_> 0.5.0 will have a 0.1.0 webclient
<jcater> most people can relate to it
<revDeke> one main table and a few foreign key tables
<revDeke> for type = vhs, dvd etc
<revDeke> and rating = R, PG, PG-13
<jcater> 0.5.0 will have a lot more than a web client
<siesel_> yes and we can add simple reports
<revDeke> could probably put directors or actors or something for child parent
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> maybe we do need something slightly more complicated
<jcater> well, no
<revDeke> well ideal for me would be a music database
<revDeke> CDs parent
<revDeke> Songs Child
<jcater> that seems even better
<jcater> as that opens the door for more interesting/complicated forms and reports
<revDeke> lots of lookup tables for year put out, label etc
<revDeke> i.e. i WANT to manage my music with gnue
<revDeke> as kmusicdb is only somewhat sane thing out there but it relies on whacked versions of kde
<revDeke> its all postgres 
<revDeke> so as soon as gsd is ready in designer
<revDeke> i will suck out the schema (its gpl) ;)
<revDeke> and viola whip up some forms
<siesel_> complicated database schemas are not so important as complicated forms / reports IMHO
<revDeke> you can evaluate if you want to use it as a 'sample' or not
<revDeke> siesel_: this schema should be REALLY straight forward
<revDeke> i suspect some cool triggers as i want to tie it into CDDB :)
riandouglas (~riand@031.mel0605.mel.iprimus.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> I think I like this schema
Action: siesel_ thinks that a sample application for gnue should have connections with business, like a very simplistic app for a shop who lends music
<jcater> I'm not sure I agree
<jcater> sorry, phone....
<jcater> I'm not sure I agree because a 
<jcater> sample with a pure business theme
<jcater> will tend to try to outgrow itself
<jcater> and try to become an actual app
<siesel_> that's a point
<siesel_> ok, so lets use a music database as standart sample
<jcater> revDeke: you think you can whip up us a GSD schema?
<jcater> sometime in the next few weeks?
<revDeke> yeah i can likely do that
<revDeke> that said i plan on making it a real app likely at some point :)
<revDeke> but i can certainly do that outside the sample
<revDeke> for now i have a spreadsheet with my music and i need that to go away 
<revDeke> so i am driven by simple replacement
<revDeke> :)
<revDeke> how about tonight
<revDeke> actually i MUST work on gnue-sb tonight
<jcater> yes
<jcater> you must
<jamest> yes
<jamest> please
<jamest> we're preping prereleases so working on forms/designer/etc will be good testing

<jcater> fyi, anyone who looked at the prereleases
<jcater> I did a Python 2.2 -only thing
<jcater> that's being fixed
<jcater> but if you are on python 2.1, please wait for round two :(
<jcater> jan: what is scale?
<siesel_> the second parameter for a decimal: POSTGRES SQL: "CREATE TABLE ... myval DECIMAL(precision,scale), ..
<jcater> no
<jcater> postgres uses a funky definition for precision
<jcater> using our parameters, that's DECIMAL(length, precision)
<siesel_> ok, then the XSLT file are wrong.
<jcater> we are working on the schema system
<jcater> trying to get it back together
<jcater> it has been totally trashed
<jcater> so yeah it's out of whack right now
<siesel_> the last time I worked on it was quite ok.
<jcater> it was way out of spec
<siesel_> ok, that means that the XSLT files etc. has to be updated
