<chillywilly> hmmm that gives microseconds
<ra3vat> it expands to %ra 
<chillywilly> gess you need to divide by 1000

<dneighbo> there is something called 'sloppyquery'

<dneighbo> or there was
Action: dneighbo thinks what you are describing might have been what that was for, but have never used it
<dneighbo> can you try sloppyquery
<ra3vat> i saw some sloppy related part commented out in the code, will try it anyway
<dneighbo> ok
<dneighbo> ra3vat: if you put sloppyquery=""
<dneighbo> in a block
<dneighbo> i "think"
<dneighbo> what will happen is everytime you execute a query
<dneighbo> it will append a % to the end
<dneighbo> actually it looks like it will have effect of doing the following
<dneighbo> you enter ra it converts to
<dneighbo> %r%a%
<dneighbo> and you might have to do it as sloppyQuery
<dneighbo> and you might have to do it as sloppyQuery=""
<dneighbo> you can look in forms/src/GFObjects/GFBlock.py to see exactly what its doing 
<dneighbo> or if you need to patch it
<dneighbo> please let me know if this works
<dneighbo> as right this second i can not readily test
<ra3vat> dneighbo: D-G.pdf defines sloopyQuery only among entry attributes
<dneighbo> doh you are right
<dneighbo> try entry
<dneighbo> i was thinking block as its in block code
<dneighbo> but thasts cause it fires onProcessQuery
<dneighbo> but it checks entry.xxx
<ra3vat> form works but search fails

<dneighbo> now if i can get the sound to work
<Arturas> Hi Bajusz
<btami> hi Arturas
<btami> yes
<btami> yes: for i have time
<dneighbo> grr anyone have sources.list for player stuff?
<dneighbo> nmeos.net seems toastified
<btami> i havn't
Nick change: SachaS_uni -> SachaS
<Arturas> btami: how did you build GNUe.exe's for Windows? did you have any problems with gettext?
<dneighbo> found one
<btami> Arturas: McMillan+Inno
<btami> what problems do you think?
<Arturas> yesterday i finished setup-cvs.py for Windows
<Arturas> but when trying to run form
<Arturas> it gives traceback on gettext (some string is NULL or something like that)
<Arturas> i thought i maybe you have met with this problem while building exe's
<btami> no, i havn't met any problems with gettext
<btami> can you send me your script to try
<Arturas> setup-cvs for win?
<btami> yes
<Arturas> it's in the CVS as setup-cvs2.py
<btami> ooo
<Arturas> (at least it should be there)
<Arturas> but it's now finally finished - still some bugs exist
<btami> i see
<Arturas> now => not
<btami> i will try
<Arturas> i warned you :)
<btami> ok :)
<dneighbo> probably a little late but why setup-cvs2.py
<dneighbo> instead of setup-cvs-win.py or somethign?
<Arturas> it's not ready to replace current setup-cvs.py and it's working (=> should be working) both on Linux and Windows
Action: Arturas is away: meeting (10 min.)
Action: Arturas is back (gone 00:10:52)
<btami> Arturas: why do you put fsutil.exe and linkd.exe into CVS, they aren't free software
<btami> maybe there are free alternetives on the net
fixe (~adam@dsl081-147-022.chi1.dsl.speakeasy.net) left irc: Read error: 113 (No route to host)
<Arturas> if you're using Windows (legally of course), you may use these tools
<Arturas> and as far as i heard, there are no alternatives yet
fixe (~adam@dsl081-147-022.chi1.dsl.speakeasy.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Arturas> i included them because although these tools are included by default with WindowsXP, they are not included with Windows2000
<Arturas> (it's possible to download them somewhere from Microsoft web site)
<Arturas> do you think we should refuse from using them?
<btami> no, just not from our CVS
<ajmitch> non-free software is a bad thing to have in GNU CVS :)
<btami> maybe a README about where to find/download these would be better
<Arturas> i don't like this idea too, but can we say to the user "if you want to install GNUe, make sure you have ...exe and ...exe or download them and put into specified folder and only then you can install GNUe"? :/
<btami> hey, setup-cvs.py is for developers
<btami> not for end users
<Arturas> hm, sorry :)
<btami> :)
<btami> Arturas: can i bugreport for you?
<btami> about setup-cvs2.py
<Arturas> btami: ??
<btami> i got: cannot create a link at: c:\python22\lib\gnue
<btami> oh, wait 
<btami> i was wrong
<btami> tried it on VFAT volume
<Arturas> :)
<btami> trying again :)
<Arturas> the error is correct :)
<ajmitch> Arturas: derek will shoot you if you leave those files in there ;)
<ra3vat> could anyone interested in web forms driver comment on http://openthought.net/cgi-bin/demo_app/demo.pl
<Arturas> Derek will shoot me for putting these files there :) ok, i'll remove them in about 10 mins
<btami> Arturas: i got the same error
<btami> i have c: VFAT
<btami> e: NTFS
<btami> the win2k is in e:
<btami> i wanted to install into e:\gnue\bin, e:\gnue\conf
<btami> but the script forces c:\python22\lib\gnue
<btami> becouse my python resides there
<btami> hmm
<Arturas> that's one of the problems i had - how do i enter gnue into python's modules search path
<Arturas> somewhere in the middle of setup-cvs2.py is the call
<ajmitch> PYTHONPATH, or sys.path :)
<Arturas> under Windows
<Arturas> i solved it by creating a link in python..\lib\gnue pointing to gnue folder
<Arturas> but this is wrong solution
<Arturas> removed ...exes, added readme (-> win-links.txt)

<reinhard> good morning ariel_
<reinhard> sorry that i was so unresponsive yesterday
<reinhard> just a few remarks to the object repository document you sent me
<reinhard> first (and most important) thanks for your work :)
<reinhard> on the general design
<reinhard> i'm not sure if we want to include inheritance at all
<reinhard> and if we want to include versioning and compounds in the very first version
<reinhard> when i looked at your document i got the feeling that XML is not a perfect way of explaining something to a human
<ra3vat> anyone can drop me a test message on ds at ics.elcom.ru, please
<reinhard> ra3vat: ok
<reinhard> sent
<ra3vat> reinhard: thanks, got it
<reinhard> ariel_: i like the tablular explaination you did much better
<reinhard> i thought i might try to change it into an object oriented explaination
<reinhard> (like the old (current) api definition of appserver)
<reinhard> thanks also for the diagram of appserver structure
<reinhard> it seems like my installation of dia is hosed
<reinhard> if i open the diagram i get errors about missing fonts :(
<reinhard> is it possible for dia to export .eps and .png ?
<ariel_> reinhard: 
<reinhard> if yes i could easily include into the whitepaper
<reinhard> -o
<ariel_> don't care about fonts warning, i also have, just click OK 
<ariel_> to export right-click on open diagram
<ariel_> choose file then export
<reinhard> when i click ok for the warning
<reinhard> the diagram doesn't look right
<reinhard> the text is outside the boxes
<ariel_> uhmm
<ariel_> i dunno it changes mine from Hevetica boldOblique  to adobe courier medium-r-normal that fits well
<reinhard> it changes everything to "fixed" for me
<reinhard> however i have about zero idea how fonts work in X
<reinhard> i have this problem with other diagrams too
<reinhard> so it's certainly my own fault
<ariel_> if there aren't changes i can send png btw the first picture in the note is png export of the dia
<reinhard> ariel_: thanks
<reinhard> ariel_: btw i am talking about appserver architecture diagram
<reinhard> not about the class diagram
<ariel_> i can send png just tell me if you prefer the classical package shape (rectangle with label) instead of the component shape (rectangle with side ellipses and smaller rectangles)
<reinhard> um
<reinhard> i don't care that much i think
<reinhard> what you like better :)
<ariel_> ok

<hjibds2> hi
<hjibds2> Is GNUe ready for production use
<Arturas> hi
<Arturas> it's pretty hard to say
<Arturas> it depends :/
<Arturas> practically it almost ready
<Arturas> but it depends on what you want from GNUe
<hjibds2> we are a small business and need some kind of ERP system - my knowledge is very limited in this area
<jamest> we have no prebuilt packages for you to use
<jamest> we're (slowly) getting the tools in place to make building such packages easy
<hjibds2> u mean install from source?
<jamest> no, i mean we have no Inventory Control package, or general ledger package
<hjibds2> what kind of time scale is there for these packages?
<jamest> we have tools that let you easily create data entry screens (what we call forms) and reports
<jamest> dneighbo is working on a small biz package right now that is strickly client/server
<jamest> i _think_ he was getting it checked into gnu's cvs server but I'm not sure where that is at
<hjibds2> sounds intresting
<jamest> I'm also not sure what stage it's at
<jamest> jcater has also submitted a package called RentFree (or something like that) to gnu's cvs that manages rental property
<jamest> again, I'm also not sure what stage it's at
<jamest> so the tools work in 2 tier mode (client/server)
<jamest> and work on appserver is progressing but it is not ready yet to build systems around it
Action: drochaid is away: it's pissing down and I'm in full gore-tex :)
<btami> jamest: have you any success with GTK2 on win32 ?
<jamest> btami: i've had 0 time to try it out
<jamest> i've got a few deathlines at home that all fall on the 1st of dec
<jamest> which is sucking up all my free time
<hjibds2> Are there any systems of a similar nature I can look at?
<jamest> hjibds2: i don't know
<jamest> i know there are other projects but I'm not sure the state of any of them
<jamest> hjibds2: do you have an existing system in place?
<hjibds2> head office are looking at implementing a larger version of the system that we need based on asp and M$ SQL server - i don't want to go down that route
<jamest> btami: i plan to take a few days off to get ahead so I can GNUe again
<btami> ok :)
<hjibds2> jamest - not yet - we are looking at getting some form of system in place in the next 6 months
<jamest> hjibds2: is middlewear important to you?  or are you happy w/ a 2-tier system?
<hjibds2> we would be happy with a 2-tier system
<jamest> what platforms are the clients ?
<hjibds2> win32
<jamest> well, dneighbo's small biz thing might give you what you need
<jamest> and I'd hope to have most the issues w/ win32 worked out in 6 months
<jamest> (the UI driver for windows isn't native win32api so we have to create one)
<jamest> but I can't say for sure
<jamest> the salesman would say "You bet we can."

<ra3vat> <ra3vat> could anyone interested in web forms driver comment on http://openthought.net/cgi-bin/demo_app/demo.pl
<ra3vat> ?
<psu> heh
Action: siesel looked at it. jsforms is using a similar aproach.
<siesel> I don't think that we can get much from it, because we would have to add too much and even write a perl->python interface, or reimplement gnue-common in perl
<psu> For us, having a company (ab)use the open source label like this is almost a positive
<psu> shows that RMS was right to insist on "free s/w" rather than "open source" as a label
<psu> as it's harder for people to twist that 
<ra3vat> siesel: i usually remember complains about web interface when any new data require to reload a page and fighting about not to let jave in. is that link demostrate one possible solution? 
<siesel> yes, it is one possible solution, and it is the solution choosen by the jsforms client (alpha stage at http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jan/jsclient/gnue-forms.html
<revDeke> psu good point you should make that a comment :)
<nickr> its easy to twist free software
<siesel> I also looked at a quite similar but (IMHO) more powerful project than openthought, 
<ra3vat> siesel: thanks for clarifying :)
<siesel> which was quite good, but had one bad point: at the moment it just worked with netscape 4.x
<siesel> ra3vat: it's allways good to know other projects which do quite similar stuff. If the webclient is once working, it could f.e. use openthought plugins for authetification etc.

<marioct> hello people, good night !
<jamest> hello
<marioct> Hello james.
<marioct> I've just downloaded gnue via CVS, and I'll read docs... but I have one question...
<jamest> ok
<marioct> how can I run gnue-forms with curses ? 
<jamest> for any optons you can run
<jamest> gnue-forms --help
<jamest> gnue-forms --interface curses
<jamest> should do it
<jamest> well
[16:59] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
<jamest> gnue-forms --interface curses form.gfd
<marioct> ok, but I got this : Error: Unable to load any valid UI drivers.  Aborting.
<jamest> oooooo
<jamest> jcater: do we need to install nstti from our cvs seperately?
<jcater> no
<jcater> but I'm not 100% sure setup.py has been updated to install curses
<jcater> for common
<marioct> can I install ?
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> it should be installing
<jcater> err, wait
<jcater> are you using our CVS code
<jcater> or the last 0.4.0 release?
<marioct> the 0.4.0 release
<jcater> ok, curses wasn't present then
<jcater> a preview will be in the 0.4.1 that we hope to release this week
<jcater> (it's also in cvs)
<jcater> but it's not fully usable yet
<marioct> where in CVS ?
<revDeke> savannah.gnu.org
<jcater> it should be fully supported by 0.5.0
<revDeke> sorry read that as where is not where in
<jcater> I don't have the link handy
<jcater> but if you open www.gnue.org
<jcater> towards the bottom of the left column
<jcater> you'll see "CVS"
<jcater> that has instructions
<jcater> I think it's something like http://www.gnuenterprise.org/community/cvs.php
<jcater> oh, yay
<jcater> I got it right
<marioct> ok... thanks. Do you know about some good book that teaches python ?
<nickr> book!?
<marioct> yes... or tutorials ?!....I must learn python to help build gnue !!!
<nickr> there is a good tutorial in the documentation section of python.org
<nickr> http://www.python.org/doc/current/tut/tut.html
<marioct> ok. thanks.. bye !

<jcater> ===========
<jcater> After the next point release, we are moving away from
<jcater> cvs numbers being '?.?.?a' and instead are doing:
<jcater>   0.1.0 (cvs) ==> 0.0.99
<jcater>   0.1.1 (cvs) ==> 0.1.0.99
<jcater>   1.0.2 (cvs) ==> 1.0.1.99
<jcater>   1.0.0 (cvs) ==> 0.99.0
<jcater>   1.1.0 (cvs) ==> 1.0.99
<jcater> So, whereas the current post-0.4.0 code is called 0.4.1a
<jcater> until the 0.4.1 release, it would, under this new system, 
<jcater> be 0.4.0.99.

Action: revDeke not to be out banter, really starts to put on a raucous display of persiflage   
<revDeke> yummy please email jbailey@gnu.org and have him deb them up
<revDeke> and i will test debs too :)

dsmith (firewall-u@cherry7.comerica.com) left irc: "later.."
<jcater> not ready for debs yet
<jcater> siesel_: no, unintended
<jcater> we have some big restucturing for both forms and the forms module in designer scheduled for 0.5.0
<revDeke> ok will test prelease when get home
<jcater> to eliminate crap like that
<revDeke> are changelogs updated?
<revDeke> and the feature maps?
<jcater> no, I can't do that for here
<revDeke> i.e. so i have some idea of some things to test for
<jcater> with this first thing, just test a few forms you have that were working
<jcater> by tonight
Action: revDeke will do some general torture testing, but would like to beat on new features and buglets s well
<jcater> we'll have news and changelog and a few install things worked out
<revDeke> ok
mdean (~mdean@mkc-65-28-72-76.kc.rr.com) left irc: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)
Action: revDeke needs to look at feature map to see if schema stuff is schedule for 0.5.0 or 0.4.2
<revDeke> er 0.4.1
<siesel_> revDeke: some of the new features have test forms  in samples/testcases
Action: revDeke wonders if i shouldnt pay more attention to the release
<revDeke> as i should be doing the 0.4.1 release so you guys can continue on with 0.5.0
<revDeke> i will try to keep things updated for teh 0.4.2 release (if necessary)
Action: revDeke will play wiht feature maps too
<revDeke> or at least study them enough to ask questions :)
<revDeke> siesel_: i think if we are making testing stuff it shouldnt fall in samples perhaps?
<revDeke> unless we just want to make our samples our test bed
<siesel_> you're free to move it to a more apropriate place
Action: siesel_ thinks that every feature needs an implementation by an form/report etc. 
<siesel_> which can be used for testing as for learning

mdean (~mdean@mkc-65-28-72-76.kc.rr.com) joined #gnuenterprise.
<siesel_> revDeke: I think we need to discuss again, how we handle samples and what do we want to provide samples
<jcater> I want to rm -rf samples
<jcater> and start all over
<jcater> I want one interesting schema
<jcater> with sample data and all
<jcater> and all forms / reports / etc
<jcater> use this schema/ theme
<jcater> and I want to use the same schema/theme in the developers guides
<jcater> much like Access' Northwind (or whatever) test database
<jcater> and I don't find zipcodes interesting :)
<siesel_> I thought of something similar.
<siesel_> But what schema/thema should we use?
<jcater> I dunno
<jcater> I brought it up a few weeks ago wrt the developer's guide
<revDeke> i have no problem with that
<revDeke> sounds like gnue-sb :)
<jcater> but neither I nor anyone else could come up with one
<jcater> revDeke: maybe a simple version of that only 2-3 tables
<revDeke> yeah
<revDeke> thats what i meant
<revDeke> literal sb now :)
<jcater> anywho
<jcater> that's not going to happen this release
<revDeke> actually i have something
<jcater> but I would like to see it in 0.5.0
<revDeke> that i use for demos
<jcater> 0.5.0 is going to be big
<revDeke> its a video catalog database
<jcater> yeah
<jcater> something like that would be nice
<jcater> it's simple
<revDeke> its really simple
<siesel_> 0.5.0 will have a 0.1.0 webclient
<jcater> most people can relate to it
<revDeke> one main table and a few foreign key tables
<revDeke> for type = vhs, dvd etc
<revDeke> and rating = R, PG, PG-13
<jcater> 0.5.0 will have a lot more than a web client
<siesel_> yes and we can add simple reports
<revDeke> could probably put directors or actors or something for child parent
<jcater> hmm
<jcater> maybe we do need something slightly more complicated
<jcater> well, no
<revDeke> well ideal for me would be a music database
<revDeke> CDs parent
<revDeke> Songs Child
<jcater> that seems even better
<jcater> as that opens the door for more interesting/complicated forms and reports
<revDeke> lots of lookup tables for year put out, label etc
<revDeke> i.e. i WANT to manage my music with gnue
<revDeke> as kmusicdb is only somewhat sane thing out there but it relies on whacked versions of kde
<revDeke> its all postgres 
<revDeke> so as soon as gsd is ready in designer
<revDeke> i will suck out the schema (its gpl) ;)
<revDeke> and viola whip up some forms
<siesel_> complicated database schemas are not so important as complicated forms / reports IMHO
<revDeke> you can evaluate if you want to use it as a 'sample' or not
<revDeke> siesel_: this schema should be REALLY straight forward
<revDeke> i suspect some cool triggers as i want to tie it into CDDB :)
riandouglas (~riand@031.mel0605.mel.iprimus.net.au) joined #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> I think I like this schema
Action: siesel_ thinks that a sample application for gnue should have connections with business, like a very simplistic app for a shop who lends music
<jcater> I'm not sure I agree
<jcater> sorry, phone....
<jcater> I'm not sure I agree because a 
<jcater> sample with a pure business theme
<jcater> will tend to try to outgrow itself
<jcater> and try to become an actual app
<siesel_> that's a point
<siesel_> ok, so lets use a music database as standart sample
<jcater> revDeke: you think you can whip up us a GSD schema?
<jcater> sometime in the next few weeks?
<revDeke> yeah i can likely do that
<revDeke> that said i plan on making it a real app likely at some point :)
<revDeke> but i can certainly do that outside the sample
<revDeke> for now i have a spreadsheet with my music and i need that to go away 
<revDeke> so i am driven by simple replacement
<revDeke> :)
<revDeke> how about tonight
<revDeke> actually i MUST work on gnue-sb tonight
<jcater> yes
<jcater> you must
<jamest> yes
<jamest> please
<jamest> we're preping prereleases so working on forms/designer/etc will be good testing
<revDeke> both jamest and jcater are begging for me to break things
Action: revDeke looks for alan funk or some other prank video camera crew
<revDeke> must run
revDeke (www-data@alt1.libertydistribution.com) left #gnuenterprise.
<jcater> fyi, anyone who looked at the prereleases
<jcater> I did a Python 2.2 -only thing
<jcater> that's being fixed
<jcater> but if you are on python 2.1, please wait for round two :(
<jcater> jan: what is scale?
<siesel_> the second parameter for a decimal: POSTGRES SQL: "CREATE TABLE ... myval DECIMAL(precision,scale), ..
<jcater> no
<jcater> postgres uses a funky definition for precision
<jcater> using our parameters, that's DECIMAL(length, precision)
<siesel_> ok, then the XSLT file are wrong.
<jcater> we are working on the schema system
<jcater> trying to get it back together
<jcater> it has been totally trashed
<jcater> so yeah it's out of whack right now
<siesel_> the last time I worked on it was quite ok.
<jcater> it was way out of spec
<siesel_> ok, that means that the XSLT files etc. has to be updated
