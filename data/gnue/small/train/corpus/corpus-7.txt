<chillywilly> haha
<jamest> you sure we have to have family channel
<chillywilly> you luser
<jamest> can't we just ignore you instead
<chillywilly> go ahead

Action: angie is a woman
<angie> got that, jamest?

<jamest> told the server to give me operator status
<angie> my OWN woman.  he's MY amn!!
<chillywilly> lol
<angie> er, man
<jamest> so I could kick chillywilly and make this a family channel
<chillywilly> yea, that's consistent
<jamest> chillywilly: you're married right?
<chillywilly> NOT
<chillywilly> nope
<jamest> ah
<jamest> you see after marrage the man enters a state called "dependent"
<chillywilly> puh-lz
<jamest> at that point we're capable of little more than making messes and dumb remarks
<chillywilly> that's me right now

Harald1 (Peter1234@pD9EB138A.dip.t-dialin.net) joined #gnuenterprise.
<Harald1> hi
<chillywilly> wow, she's a woman alright
<angie> pretty honest
<jamest> is so, then the answer is no
<jamest> hey Harald1
<angie> ai'll train him to lie yet!
<jamest> Harald1: one issue with the win32 patch on multilines that jcater pointed out
<angie> I have to go to bed.  I'll get locked out again.
<jamest> in his (and my environments) we have both win32 and unix clients
<jamest> later angie, nice talking to you
<angie> bye!
<jamest> if you are really you and not jeff
<jamest> :)
<Harald1> jamest: and the problem ist that under windows both \n characters get saved?
<jamest> if a win32 client saves cr/lf to the db
<jamest> and a unix client reads it and modifies it
<jamest> then we have a problem :)
<angie> I'm me.  jeff's alter ego is ... well, I should go now.
<jamest> lol
angie (jbailey@HSE-Toronto-ppp287168.sympatico.ca) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<chillywilly> bah
<chillywilly> I know his name is NOT jeffrey
<chillywilly> that's a crock
<jamest> I'm pretty sure it is
<chillywilly> it isn't
<chillywilly> are you calling me a liar?
<Harald1> jamest: well actually, that's not a problem with the patch. one just has to make a workaround, when things get saved into the database
<chillywilly> thems fightin words
<jamest> Harald1: i started to play with that tonight but didn't get too far
<jamest> chillywilly: :)
<chillywilly> you craaaazy
<Harald1> jamest: I might take a look, but I'm not sure if I understand enough of forms. How is the transfer from GFObjects into the database done?
<jamest> Harald1: i'll try and find some time over the next few days as this is going to be  a pain in the rear
<jamest> GFObjects never really hold anything
Action: chillywilly reads the python IDL binding
<jamest> they pass it all to the data system
<jamest> even forms not connected to a database create dummy datasources to store their info
<jamest> so the edits would probably need to go into common
<chillywilly> jamest: blackened is the end
<chillywilly> jamest: winter it will send
<chillywilly> jamest: throwing all you see
<chillywilly> jamest: into obscurity
<chillywilly> jamest: death of mother earth
<jamest> am I being cursed?
<chillywilly> jamest: never a rebirth
<chillywilly> jamest: neeeeeeveeeeeeeeerrrr
Action: jamest grabs his lucky mouse
<Harald1> jamest: ok, and what exactly does FieldDisplayHandler do?
<jamest> that's new
<chillywilly> jamest: fiiiire, to being whipping dance of the dead
<chillywilly> jamest: blackened is the end
<chillywilly> jamest: don't you know old school metallica?
<jamest> while an edit is taking place the value of the field is passing into the handler once the edit is completed then value is passed back to the entry which store it in the datasource
<jamest> i removed internal event name translation into lower case today and make a cool error
<jamest> where the event handler events were not being seen
<jamest> so you go to a field , try and edit it (it'd go blank), then the old value would return on exit :)
<chillywilly> jamest: I though you were 'hesh'
reinhard (~rm@N812P008.adsl.highway.telekom.at) joined #gnuenterprise.
<chillywilly> sup reinhard
<Harald1> hi reinhard
<jamest> chillywilly: i don't know old metalica lyrics
<reinhard> morning
<Harald1> jamest: that's the best errors. how long did it take till you found out, what the problem was?
<jamest> not very
<jamest> as i was profilling code today
<jamest> and string.lower() was one of our major function calls
<chillywilly> jamest: booo
<chillywilly> jamest: you are not a true head banger
<jamest> i knew removing it would probably break things :)
<jamest> odd fact
<chillywilly> I cat you into the firery pit
<chillywilly> heheh
<chillywilly> cast too
<chillywilly> but cat it probably something you would more easily understand
<jamest> my test case was calling lower something like 11700 times 
<chillywilly> cat jamest > /dev/null
<jamest> removing it from the encent system saved a few calls
<jamest> however adding a single
<jamest> try:
<jamest>   something(field)
<jamest> except KeyError:
<jamest>   something(lower(field))
<jamest> in one function dropped that to about 1200
<jamest> profiling is good :)
<jamest> sigh s/encent/event
<chillywilly> what did you profile the code with/
<chillywilly> ?
<chillywilly> gprof?
<jamest> no
<jamest> it's built into commons GBaseApp
<chillywilly> oh
<jamest> forms, designer, reports, nav all based upon it
<jamest> just do
<jamest> gfclient --profile file.gfd
<jamest> replace gfclient w/ gnue python app of choice
<jamest> sigh
<jamest> i need sleep
<chillywilly> how does it work?
<jamest> badly
<chillywilly> nah
<chillywilly> sleep is for the weak
<jamest> python has an internal profiler module
<chillywilly> oh, ok
<jamest> you import it , set up a profiler
<chillywilly> which probably uses gprof somehow
<jamest> no
<chillywilly> er, gcc profiling
<chillywilly> that is
<jamest> nope
<chillywilly> sure, python is written in C
<jamest> but the profiler is written in python
<jamest> and uses the way python works to hook into it
<jamest> read the module manual profile section 
<chillywilly> well I dunno

<Harald1> jamest: ok, do you think the idea with saving the newline works?
<jamest> Harald1: i haven't had time to look :(
<Harald1> jamest: ok
<sledge_> i mean, does it work with attributes that define physical positioning, e.g. x="5" y="10" or is it structured like XHTML and other logical markup formats?
<jamest> in it's current state I don't believe it will
<jamest> however I know one of the needs is to fill out preprinted forms which would require exact placement

<drochaid> huff
<dsmith> We use orinoco gold cards.  We have an access point too.  They work well under Linux and OpenBSD with the access point.  obsd and Linux don't get along well in peer mode though.
<dsmith> We use Debian exclusivly for Linux.
<drochaid> well I guess that answers my orinoco and deb lack :)
<dsmith> But we are running unstable and 2.4.x kenrels. I'm not sure how good the Debian stable support is.
<dsmith> Just installed an new package today: airsnort
<drochaid> cool!!!
<dsmith> Cracks WEP encription.
<dsmith> Needs some kernel patches though.  Heven't tried it yet.
<drochaid> an old lappy and pringles tin cracks wep encryption :)
<drochaid> did my comments come through before I was cut off?
<dsmith> Ya.  The (W)eak (E)ncription (P)rotocol is junk.
<drochaid> heh
<dsmith> You can just use a debian package to break it! Sheesh!
<drochaid> I've got a friend [ex-friend recently sadly :(] who refuses to accept that wlans are crackable if you use ipsec instead of wep
<dsmith> I'm having a hard time parsing that.
<drochaid> sorry
<drochaid> I say that a wlan using ipsec is still hackable
<drochaid> he says it's 100% completely secure
<dsmith> Ok.
<dsmith> Well, *nothing* is 100% secure.
<drochaid> my point exactly
<drochaid> it will be a helll of a lot better than wep, but caution and other methods are still needed
<drochaid> I'm popping up and down at the mo while I install another 128mb into my printer...
<drochaid> ok .. Epson are lying through their teeth
<drochaid> my printer [and tech support for it] claim I can use any standard PC66/100/133 DIMM to upgrade it

<dneighbo> which is an rpc abstraction library
<dneighbo> it will support
<ajmitch> drochaid: but with the power of pnet i'm sure we can write it in C# if you really really want ;)
<dneighbo> XML-RPC, SOAP, CORBA probably right away
<dneighbo> but its design is such that it can support any rpc that one wishes to write a driver for
<steu> I'm writing a generic system for distrib objects in corba, and I have found geas, but I not know it
<dneighbo> geas is not really distributed corba objects
<dneighbo> i.e. our approach is to not lock ourselves into things
<dneighbo> the idea is we use rpc as a transport only
<dneighbo> not to actually deal with the objects
<dneighbo> i.e. you end up with a generic rpc object to handle things
<dneighbo> even under the CORBA geas v1 we did things this way
<dneighbo> we didnt pass CORBA objects around
<dneighbo> i.e. you defined objects via a class definition
<dneighbo> that got loaded into GEAS
<dneighbo> but there was not individual IDL for every object
<steu> my problem is not how to write a system like this, but how a medium developer can interoperate with it without knowledge of corba and c++. 
<steu> for example, a VB or delphi developer
<dneighbo> i wont talk to you anymore if you consider delphi and vb developers as equals
<dneighbo> ;)
<steu> sorry :) I'm also a delphi developer (vb is bad... but in italy we have a lot of vb programmer)
<ajmitch> dneighbo: what about java developers?
<drochaid> ajmitch: java is for satanists!!
<dneighbo> we are talking about computer professionals here ajmitch , no need to bring the conversation down :)
<drochaid> and yet, I don't program in java .. weird huh? :)
<ajmitch> drochaid: umm...
<dneighbo> steu our view was that if you merely have an abstraction
<steu> java is good but no skills
<drochaid> oops, misspelled
<drochaid> *santaists ;)
<dneighbo> the developer really need not understand much of CORBA etc
<dneighbo> as they have a lightweight CORBA api to deal with
<ajmitch> drochaid: guess what language we use at uni ;)
<drochaid> ajmitch: swahili?
<dneighbo> instead of having to use CORBA to ineract with every object
<drochaid> ajmitch: you know Opera comes in Scottish Gaelic now? :D
<ajmitch> drochaid: no, maori & english :P we code in java tho
<steu> ok, but I want that a normal developer (form designing, and etc) can use my system with delphi and vb. my system is multiplatform, obviusly
<ajmitch> drochaid: really?
<steu> for example: db server and corba server on linux
<steu> clients on win32
<steu> the problem is the speed of app development
<steu> with this infrastructure
<ajmitch> drochaid: how fluent are you, btw?
<drochaid> ajmitch: nowhere near as fluent as I want to be
<ajmitch> drochaid: right, i'd like to learn some more, but don't have time to make it to the lessons a group runs here
<drochaid> ajmitch: if you have some available cash, Canan developed the Speaking our Language series shown on tv over here a few years ago ... it's available in book, audio and video format from them and a few bookshops
<drochaid> it's a superb series
<ajmitch> yeah, so i've heard
<dneighbo> steu: and the question is
<dneighbo> i.e. what im saying about the basic corba piece 
<dneighbo> what does that have to do with multi platform or using vb/delphi
<dneighbo> any environment supporting corba could use it
<dneighbo> our current geas v1 works this way
<drochaid> ajmitch: http://www.canan.co.uk/sol.htm
<dneighbo> if you ahve any programming environment that can talk CORBA you can use it
<dneighbo> including vb delphi
<dneighbo> infact one company was using it with a java front end
<ajmitch> thx drochaid 
<steu> yes, but I need to integrate my corba objects (C++) in delphi or vb, transparently for programmers that use it. simply like use visual components
<steu> the solutions that now I use is a DLL that use CORBA Objects and comunicate with VB and Delphi
<dneighbo> sigh i think you miss what i am saying altogether
<dneighbo> gnu enterpise doesnt have the goal of being a component company for vb/delphi (which it sounds like what you are looking for)
<dneighbo> so i guess my short answer is that geas has little value in that context
<dneighbo> there are plenty of folks that would discuss such things here as we discuss about anything
<dneighbo> but i think most of those folks are not currently here
<steu> yes yes. but I can't find developers that can use gnue... I find only vb developer.
<steu> now I go. thanks and bye
<dneighbo> no problem
<dneighbo> sorry we couldnt be of more help
<steu> no problem. bye

<jamest> whew
Action: jamest gets worried when more delphi coders show up
<drochaid> lol
Action: drochaid sorta uses delphi >:)
<jamest> argh!
<drochaid> in fact, I was wondering myself about using delphi/kylix and GNUe for the same system
<jamest> why don't these people use Oracle's SQL*Forms the way nature intended things to be?
<drochaid> but I least I wasn't planning to use delhi to access GNUe :)
<jamest> drochaid: i'm just giving derek a hard time :)
<drochaid> aww, poor derek ;)
<dneighbo> there is some misnomer that i love delphi
<dneighbo> i think some things in delphi are great
<dneighbo> adn i think borland builds much better tools than say m$
<dneighbo> but i dont think gnue should be delphi
<drochaid> I agree, there are a couple of reaonable tools out there that work like kylix
<drochaid> oh wait, that doesn't start an argument ...
<drochaid> dneighbo: you are completely wrong, I think GNUe should be *exactly* like delphi ;)
<ajmitch> you mean GNUe isn't?
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> ajmitch: no, at the moment it's more like a java tool ;)
<ajmitch> drochaid: at least it's not like VB (yet) ;)
<drochaid> give it time >:)

<drochaid> wb jcater
<jcater> thx
Action: drochaid is putting slack 8 on his new [??] machine
<dneighbo> are you sick
<dneighbo> seriously 
<jcater> he must be mental
<dneighbo> slack is great an all but managing a system like that is hell
<jcater> I finally got rid of slack 8 :)
<dneighbo> i would either
<dneighbo> a. install debian
<dneighbo> b. if you are pro source install gentoo linux
<dneighbo> gentoo is a distro that basically uses the equiv of BSD ports
<drochaid> dneighbo: I've never used debian, and I'm used to MDK/RHL/Slack type environments
<drochaid> what's wrong with the management?
<dneighbo> i.e. its packaging uses source but is more managable than slack
<drochaid> you learn how to use the apps and it's no trouble
<jcater> I loved slack
<jcater> until I had to upgrade
Action: dneighbo cant imagine anything other than something similar to apt
<dneighbo> and that is after trying several different distros
Action: drochaid doesn't care how the majority of apps get on the system
<dneighbo> put it this way i think redhat does a lot correct in way of user presentation and installs
<drochaid> as long as I have absolute compile time control over things like openLDAP and PostgreSQL
<dneighbo> but debian kicks their ass on maintainability
<drochaid> I really do need to play with deb at some point
<jcater> I have no reservations upgrading one of my remote machines from 90 miles away
<drochaid> of course, if I get the other machine up in a few days [I only need a floppy and nic now ... and I think a friend has a spare floppy] I might try it on that
<jcater> with debian that is
<dneighbo> well here is my case
<dneighbo> i have an alpha box running red hat 5.2
<dneighbo> i dont use anymore as its out of date
<dneighbo> i would love to 'upgrade' it
<dneighbo> but i really dont want to spend time doing so
<dneighbo> if it were running debian
<dneighbo> i change an sources.list file
<dneighbo> apt-get update
<dneighbo> apt-get dist upgrade
<dneighbo> and come back in the morning (or a few hours)
<dneighbo> and i have an upgraded box
<drochaid> cool
<drochaid> but isn't development on deb rather dead now? :)
<dneighbo> ?
<jcater> huh?
<dneighbo> hmmm they have to 'reboot' the file server
<dneighbo> guess that means its tiem to go home
dneighbo (dneighbo@tmp-200253.flinthills.com) left irc: "cant wait until we are on w2k"
<drochaid> back
<drochaid> ok, seriously tho
<drochaid> a couple of friends who are big deb fans and use it almost exclusively have been saying they are disapointed with the speed of development over the past couple of years
<drochaid> any thoughts on that jcater?
jbailey (jbailey@HSE-Toronto-ppp319187.sympatico.ca) left irc: "Client Exiting"
<drochaid> guess jbailey doesn't ...
<jcater> yeah... but han gon a sec
<jcater> err, hang on a sec
<drochaid> okies
Action: chillywilly is back (gone 00:52:21)
<drochaid> wb
<chillywilly> dude, debian rocks
<chillywilly> the stable version is a bit old
<chillywilly> but testing is a nice compromise
<chillywilly> and sid is for people who like to live on the edge
<chillywilly> but it has the most packages of any distro, is built by the community, has free software guidelines, is easy to maintain, and is upgradable like a mofo
<nickr> One wonders how the impression that the development is dead could be had
<nickr> er
<jcater> gawd
<drochaid> and is anyone willing to talk me through the install and general use? or at least point me to some semi readble docs?
Action: jcater forgets how much graphics design tools under linux truly suck the big one
<drochaid> lol jcater
<drochaid> that's why I still use windows dood
<jcater> I'd be 100% linux if it wasn't for QuarkXPress / Freehand / Illustrator / Photoshop
<jcater> I'm ALMOST happy w/the photoshop replacements under linux
<jcater> especially ImageMagick
<chillywilly> boohoo
<drochaid> it doesn't do it for me
<chillywilly> gimp is the photoshop replacement bitch
<jcater> chillywilly: I've used gimp
<jcater> KWord is the closest thing to PageMaker / QuarkXPress we have
<drochaid> KWord?? :o
<chillywilly> balah
Action: drochaid uses openoffice
<drochaid> on windows :)
<jcater> sodipodi and Kontour look like they'll contend w/Illustrator and Freehand
<jcater> but not quite yet
<jcater> drochaid: I was referring to page layout
<nickr> there is nothing even similar to Quark on Linux
<jcater> not ot word processing
<jcater> kword is the closest thing
<drochaid> openoffice doesn't do word processing, it does page layout
<jcater> as it is a frame-based application
<nickr> sodipodi is missing the ease of use and 'togetherness' of Illustrator
<jcater> drochaid: not by most definitions
<drochaid> you're reffering to dtp
<drochaid> nah
<jcater> yes I am
<jcater> referring to dtp
<drochaid> textual processing like wordperfect for DOS or emacs is wordprocessing
<drochaid> word, openwrite [??] wordpro etc are page layout
<drochaid> and pagemaker, express etc are dtp
<nickr> uh
<nickr> Not
<jcater> well then openoffice is the poorest excuse for a page layout program I've seen
<nickr> I don't agree with that definition
<jcater> but I still maintain that word and family ARE NOT page layout
<jcater> the point of dtp is layout
<drochaid> they are page layout
<drochaid> they allow you to lay objects out on the page
<nickr> dtp implies that you press on your desktop also
<drochaid> no, dtp is a step further
<nickr> page layout is just the first part of publishing
<jcater> I concur with nickr's definition
<jcater> or start of one
<nickr> quark is a page layout tool that you could use for DTP
<drochaid> nickr: which word etc are a crossbreed of dtp and wordprocessing
<nickr> but also for non dtp press
<drochaid> nickr: dtp has nothing to do with offset lithos .. it's the method of page creation, not page production
<nickr> Desk Top Publishing
<nickr> its the entire process
<nickr> not just layout 
<jcater> word et al are word processors that have become overly bloated with wysiwyg
<drochaid> no, it's only a single stage in the entire process
<jcater> but that doesn't fall into my definition of "layout"
<drochaid> jcater: which is why they are called page layout
<jcater> wysiwyg != page layout
<drochaid> lol
<drochaid> it does
<nickr> word is a word processor with some layout ability
<nickr> quark is a layout system that can be used for dtp
<drochaid> no, emacs is wordprocessing, word is page layout
<nickr> among other things
<drochaid> express is dtp
<jcater> drochaid: emacs is text processing
<drochaid> uh .. s/text/word .. same thing dood
<jcater> not hardly
<nickr> emacs is an editor with some word processing ability
<drochaid> text is merely a sequence of words
<jcater> word processing implies the flow of text
<drochaid> no, word processing implies the processing of text
<jcater> um, that fits in with my argument :)
<drochaid> a text flow package implies the flow of text
