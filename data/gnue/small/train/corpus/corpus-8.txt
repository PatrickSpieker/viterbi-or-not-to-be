<psu> hi bobacus
<bobacus> hi
<psu> a fellow NTL customer, too 
<psu> even if I can't get broadband yet ;-)
<psu> any gnue questions, or just lurking like the rest of us ? ;-)
<nickr> <its dark in here, you're likely to be eaten by a grue>
<bobacus> well, I came across gnue on the web a couple of weeks ago, and it looks like an exciting development
<bobacus> particularly if it can replace MS Access :)
<psu> well, it's a bit more than that (or will be, anyway)
<psu> I am (partially) responsible for spreading that 
<bobacus> yep, i've had a look at the web site - it's just that the way i think gnue would particularly benefit me would be by taking away my dependency on access
<bobacus> ATM I'm trying to set up the designer and forms tools on my debian (sid) box,
<psu> the beauty of GNUe Forms as an Access replacement is that you get to use *your* choice of "real" back end database
<psu> be it postgresql, SAP-DB, mysql, firebird or one of the non-free "famous names" DBs
<psu> bobacus - I'm not sure how "solid" the debs are at the moment - I know that some of our lurkers who are Debian maintainers 
<psu> don't think they are wonderful
<psu> but should be enough to get you started
<nickr> the debs are being dropped from the distirbution I think because the latest ones are unbuildable
<psu> It's a tad embaressing for a free software project (and a GNU project at that), but the "easiest" platform to install on at the moment is M$ Windows
<psu> just grab the setup.exe and go 
Action: ra3vat wonders why so many peoples do not like access that much?
<psu> bobacus - I suspect you may be better installing from source on Debian GNU/Linux 
<bobacus> psu: okay, will try that
<psu> I don't believe the dependancies are too awful to hack manually
<psu> and are reducing anyway ;-)
<nickr> bobacus: installing from CVS is very easy
<psu> ra3vat - I think it's fair to say that M$ Access is a "toy" rather than a real RDMBS
<psu> but it gets (ab)used for fairly big d/b jobs because 
<psu> most people on Win platforms have it as part of Office 
<nickr> Access also uses VB most of the time
<psu> and hence it is "free" (as in beer) to them
<psu> The timesheet system at work for instance is all done in M$ Access 
<nickr> I get to learn MS Access soon
<bobacus> ra3vat - i don't like the Access (97) GUI very much - would prefer hierchical polymorphic containers so i can organise forms and queries better
<nickr> that should be, how do you say, fun?
<ra3vat> psu: is there any info like well known Why-not-Mysql only about Access?
<psu> work timesheets are a classic example of (ab)using a file-based d/b when we really need a (small) db server
<psu> there's some very nify VBA code in there to do replication to everyone's PCs
<psu> to keep everything in sync
<ra3vat> psu: i'm forced somehow to use it with the reason described above
<ra3vat> psu: how to find where it exceeds its "toy" limit?
<bobacus> ra3vat: access does horrible locking stuff with its mdb files, which seems to interact badly with samba, afaict
<bobacus> ra3vat: but it can be used with other back-ends via ODBC
<psu> ra3vat - personally, I would say that whenever you go beyond single user
<psu> Acess started as a single user d/b
<psu> and had mutli-user overlaid 
<psu> a bit like Windows, really
<psu> and it shows
<psu> For *real* MS Access horror stories
<psu> I suggest you ask Toyman
<psu> ToyMan even
<psu> "his stories will freeze your very bone marrow" ;-)
<psu> gotta go - bbl
<ra3vat> bobacus: in this case it works only as a frontend tool, right?

<ra3vat> horror stories? Is that kind of a story that always goes to the main homepages?

<bobacus> I'm playing with Forms Designer at the moment, but I don't seem to be getting very far. How should I create a data source?
<bobacus> (I'm trying to connect to a MySQL database BTW)
<psu> look at connections.conf
<drochaid> I think everyones hiding now you asked that :)
<psu> that has several predefined connections 
<psu> find the one for MySQL & change u/name, p/w etc to your setup

<psu> warning - I am almost cratinly the worst person to talk to 
<psu> but the only one here at the moment ;-)
<psu> have you tried the Designer wizards? They do a fairly good job of auto 
<psu> setting up, so I'm told
<psu> just point them at a table in a d/b & away they go
<bobacus> I'll give them a try...
<psu> I know the guys are (rightly) proud of the wizards
<psu> to the extent that they find it quicker to fire up designer & run a wizard 
<psu> for a one-shot form 
<psu> than have to work out the SQL by hand 
<drochaid> we have wizards? :o
Action: drochaid never spotted them
<bobacus> I just tried the Simple Form Wizard, and got to "Select Base Table/Source", selected the table I wanted, and pressed 'Continue', but
<derek> um
<derek> i assume your dataconnection is bad

<derek> try mysql -h localhost personal
<derek> and tell me if you can connect ok
<bobacus> no I need to use 'mysql -u rob -p -h localhost personal' and then enter the password :)
<derek> that works :)

<bobacus> /usr/src/gnue/cvs/gnue/forms/client/gfcvs
<bobacus> so I'll run that with tester.gfd as parameter?
<bobacus> okay, if I modify tester.gfd like this:
<bobacus> -  <datasource prequery="" cache="5" database="personal" name="dtsrcphone_type"

<bobacus> +  <datasource prequery="" cache="5" database="Personal" name="dtsrcphone_type"

<derek> ok with form open
<derek> click on the little button that paper with pen writing on it
<derek> then click on the little button that has paper with magnifying glass
<derek> do you see your data?
<bobacus> yes I do...i was expecting it to show all records by default
<derek> you can do that by changing that datasource tag to have a 
<derek> prequery=""
<derek> in it
<bobacus> But it's already got that.
<derek> hmmm
<derek> thats right i think cvs is broked on prequery :)
Action: derek keeps forgetting to submit the bug report :)

<ajmitch> not sure, there were 2 boats that arrived in 1848 that founded the city
Nick change: jcAway -> jcater
Yurik (yrashk@gw.telcos.net.ua) left irc: "ZZZzzz"
<drochaid> dunedin just sounds a bit like how you pronounce dun deagh [Dundee]
<ajmitch> ah, it's from dun eidainn (sp?)
<ajmitch> whatever the gaelic form of edinburgh is :)
<drochaid> I'd say the best way to learn would be to do an onsite course with SMO on Skye .... 
<drochaid> bugger, I should have separated that and spotted it :)
<drochaid> /topic GNUe Creating the Digital Future, but only if it's in Gaelic
<ajmitch> http://odin.prohosting.com/highsoc/ <-- an interesting group of people :)
<drochaid> interesting or weird? ;)
<ajmitch> both
<drochaid> ahh ... weird :)
<drochaid> it's great to see revival attempts like that all over the world :)
<nickr> 'hairy individuals'
<drochaid> it's becoming more popular in Scotland again
<drochaid> more TV programs being produced in Gaelic each year [and I mean produced in, not just overdubbed]
<ajmitch> nickr: well one fellow hasn't shaved since he was 16 (a number of years ago now)
<ajmitch> cool
<derek> so bobacus how is your gnue experience going?

<chillywilly> that's because you can generate one from the other, etc.

<chillywilly> heheeee
<nickr> uhhh
<nickr> chillywilly: thats not a very useful  diagram
<nickr> make a layer diagram with colors n' shit
<chillywilly> nickr: of course not that's why it needs explanation
<chillywilly> nickr: no
<nickr> everything on there would fit into a layer diagram
<nickr> layer diagrams are easier to read
<ajmitch> yeah
<chillywilly> I am working UML package diagrams and such....but after the python ODMG binding
<nickr> UML diagrams are all well and good
<nickr> but layer diagrams really show you how they stack togetherc
<chillywilly> there's accompanying text that explains the whoel thing
<chillywilly> I am working on a concise architectire document combining all the other works of neilt and reinhard
Action: drochaid thinks everyone should use SSADM v4.3
<chillywilly> this is one diagram that intend to include....I don't expect people to undestand it without reading the document
Action: jcater thinks everyone should use raw sql and a text editor
<ajmitch> that'd be fun :)
<drochaid> jcater: :)
<drochaid> possibly with vi?
<ajmitch> ed! ed!
<jcater> possibly?
<nickr> vi!? that shits for pussies
<jcater> it'd be the only thing I'd support
<drochaid> I think vim would be overkill ;)
<chillywilly> no we should write everything in machine code
<jcater> chillywilly: well, no
<chillywilly> by casndle light
<jcater> with vi and sql, we're still arch independent
<chillywilly> er, candle
<ajmitch> chillywilly: you mean burning the code into memory with a candle?
<chillywilly> only is a perfect world
<drochaid> chillywilly: i don't like machine code ... I only got 98% in my machine code exam at Uni :((
<drochaid> told I couldn't code for piss
<ajmitch> drochaid: awww
<bobacus> no no no, you want to be a cross-platform object-oriented distributed n-tier system - make people type GIOP streams in hexadecimal :)

<nickr> I think I'm gonna be homeless.
<chillywilly> I use trout as therapy
<chillywilly> nickr: cool
<nickr> If you guys don't see me for a while its cause i'm living out of garbage cans.
<ajmitch> alright nickr
<chillywilly> nickr: I thought you had a job lined up?
<drochaid> nickr: any particular reason?
<nickr> chillywilly: I have no idea if thats gonna work
<nickr> if not
<nickr> well

<jcater> chocolate is a side interest of mine too
<drochaid> lol
<jcater> jamest, I imagine
<jcater> he's used it for some side jobs
<nickr> chillywilly: how is that a wise course of action?
<drochaid> ah cool

<chillywilly> nickr: stop hanging on irc so much ;)
<chillywilly> and being ati-social
<nickr> Heh
<chillywilly> er, anti
<nickr> I have a psychological disorder that prevents me from dealing with people that I don't know
<chillywilly> then make some friends ;)
<drochaid> nickr: I'd consider you for a job, but you argue with me too much and it's just not accep...  wait, I argue with everyone :)
<nickr> haha
<chillywilly> what do you do drochaid?
<nickr> chillywilly: I have some friends, they just don't have any physical proximity to me
<chillywilly> that's sad....almost as sad as me
<drochaid> chillywilly: very recently started an IT Consultancy
<chillywilly> I have 1 friend
<chillywilly> that lives close
<ajmitch> i have a friend
<chillywilly> drochaid: oh really
<ajmitch> nobody else can see him tho
<drochaid> lol ajmitch
<nickr> I have three things that could be called friends that live here

Action: drochaid is off to bed
<derek>   The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite diet is either adventurers or enchanters, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its horrible fear of light. No grues have ever been seen by the light of day, and only a few have been observed in their underground lairs. Of those who have seen grues, few ever survived their fearsome jaws to tell the tale.
<derek> Grues have sharp claws and fangs, and an uncontrollable tendency to slaver and gurgle. They are certainly the most evil-tempered of all creatures; to say they are touchy is a dangerous understatement. "Sour as a grue" is a common expression, even among themselves.
<drochaid> what be from that derek?
<derek> i know nickr i guess ;)
<nickr> thats why derek is the masta
<derek> I would tell you it was from the Frobozzica, but i assume that would only result in more questions

<jcater> wtf!?!?!?!?!
<jcater> derek: wasn't mdean using pysablot?
<jcater> or was he using sablotron from the command line?
<chillywilly> wtf is pysablot?
<chillywilly> xml parser?
<jcater> xslt
<chillywilly> oh
<jcater> Description: an XSL processor fully implemented in C++
<jcater>  Sablotron is an XSL processor fully implemented in C++.
<jcater>  .
<jcater>  The goal of this project is to create a reliable and
<jcater>  fast XSLT processor conforming to the W3C specification, which is
<jcater>  available for public and can be used as a base for multiplatform XML
<jcater>  data distribution systems.
<jcater>  .
<jcater>  This package includes Sablotron binaries, which need libsablot0 to work.
<chillywilly> ok
<jcater> derek: ah, nevermind
<nickr> uh, you guys do know that pysablot was last released in nov 2000?
<nickr> and that its still alpha?
<jcater> I forget w/debian you have to explicitly install -dev stuff to get headers
<jcater> nickr: well, all it is is a wrapper to sablotron
<jcater> so there's not much to it iirc
<nickr> I'll make a deb of it, but I don't think I should put it in the debian archive if upstream is dead
<derek> :)
<derek> pysablot :)
Action: chillywilly is away: church
<jcater> upstream is dead?"
<derek> no more woody
<derek> i.e. they want to release woody as stable on may 1st (or so is the rumor)
<jcater> sure
<derek> those they are blocking all upstream packaging
<jcater> but there's sid right
<derek> if im understanding correctly?
<jcater> or is sid blocked too?
<derek> no should only be woody
<nickr> Pysablot looks pretty dead to me
<derek> ?
<derek> any reason you think its dead?
<jcater> nickr: there's not really much to it to maintain
<nickr> yes, aj said he wants to release may1
<derek> i mean all it is a wrapper to sablotron
<derek> and from what i have used it works w/o issue
<nickr> derek: because its listed as alpha and the only release was nov 2000
<derek> and seemed to have all functionality
<derek> so unless sablotron changes i wouldnt expect a lot from pysablot to change
<derek> i am willing to contact the maintainer of pysablot to see if they have abandoned it or not
<nickr> can you first veryfy what I'm seeing about its deadness?
<derek> thats what i mean
<derek> i will contact the project lead there and say is pysablot dead
<derek> if he says yes i will probably see if he is willing to turn it over
<derek> call me sick but i like it :)
<nickr> whoa, no docs or anything
<nickr> he
<nickr> h
<nickr> well if there is an upstream maintainer I'll take it on
<nickr> it looks pretty trivial
neilt (neilt@66-61-51-107.wo4.cox.rr.com) left irc: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
<derek> ok pysablot is probably really dead
<derek> er soory
<derek> misread that
<nickr> ?
<derek>  The very first version of Python extension to Sablotron was created as soon as in May 2000 but it never reached a stable state. The first seriouse attempt is then Guenter Radestock's Sab-pyth  released in October 2000. The latest version is 0.52 and the extension is well documented.
<derek> i read on sablotron page thinking that the first version was pysablot
<derek> but next paragraph reads
<derek>  Just a few weeks after Guenter, Andreas Jung announced his Python bindings for Sablotron called PySablot. The current version is 0.1 and it is still supposed to be an alpha version.     .
<nickr> yea
<derek> iirc there were only like 2 or 3 xslt packages for python
<derek> sablotron and pysablot were the only combo that were BOTH GPL
<derek> i also liked that sablotron is maintained by a commercial company that puts money into the development
<nickr> python 4suite is free
<nickr> and maintained
<derek> i would go as far as saying if pysablot isnt maintained still it might be worth maintaining it
<nickr> hm.
<derek> im really rather impressed with the gingerall folks
<derek> fwiw i suppose in reports and such we could treat it like db drivers
<derek> where you can use your 'favorite' xslt engine
<derek> to me i think one issue with 4suite
<jcater> derek: already there :)
<derek> is it is a REAL suite
<derek> i.e. its a LOT of junk we dont use
<derek> although it does have
<derek>  4ODS is a Python implementation of the ODMG 3.0 object database standard. Different drivers can be plugged in to 4ODS to provide back-end storage, even in other models such as relational.
