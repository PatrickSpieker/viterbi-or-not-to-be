<p>Alan Clifford came up with an outline description for the Forecasting
module:</p>

<quote who="Alan Clifford">
<p>Most packages concern themselves with the present and the past. Forecasting
deals with predicting the future. Marketing uses forecasts to plan products,
promotion and pricing. Finance uses forecasts as an input to financial
planning. Operations uses forecasts to make capacity, production and
inventory decisions.</p>

<p>Forecasting consists of a suite of tools to collect, analyze and present
data to decision makers in middle and upper management.</p>

<quote who="Derek Neighbors">btw,

managment tool at that time you can then enter these items as work 
orders for us and post the link to follow them here. :)</quote></p>
