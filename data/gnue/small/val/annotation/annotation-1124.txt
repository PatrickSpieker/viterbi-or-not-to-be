<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>Alan Clifford suggested <quote who="Alan Clifford">we 
add an Overview line to the list of GNU Enterprise packages</quote> 
and gave some sample text. Reinhard M&#252;ller suggested 
some changes, mainly to refer to Free Software rather than 
Open Source, and pointed out <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">Like 
any ERP system, a company will have to spend a considerable 
amount of money and/or time to get and keep GNUe running</quote>. 
He added <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">we value the "free" 
as in freedom more than the "free" as in free beer.</quote>
Daniel Baumann and Neil Tiffin agreed. Alan incorporated 
these changes. Reinhard added that maybe <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">Not 
sure if we should add a line here to make clear that we are talking 
about the <cite>future</cite> here</quote>.</p>
