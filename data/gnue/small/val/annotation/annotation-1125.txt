<topic>Why GNUe?</topic>

<p>Further to 
<kcref startdate="28 Nov 2001 19:55:59 -0800" subject="[gnue-discuss] Overview Text" />,
Alan Clifford posted <quote who="Alan Clifford">another draft of the 
Overview text incorporating the suggestions to-date.</quote> 
Daniel Baumann said the definition of free software was still wrong, 
and referred Alan to 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>. 
He said <quote who="Daniel Baumann">I am sure there are plenty of us GNUe ppl 
here that do not plan to do consulting work with GNUe software for 
nothing. We need to make a living too ;).</quote></p>

<p>Derek Neighbors said that he thought the text implied GNUe was 
just ERP. <quote who="Derek Neighbors">While 
it can be that, its really a development framework that is much 
more flexible than an ERP. Any database application can be written with 
GNUe Tools even if they have nothing to do with the ERP packages, I dont 
think we want to lose that.</quote> Peter Sullivan quoted something 
Jason Cater had said on IRC, which Jason corrected to:</p>

<quote who="Jason Cater">
<p>GNU Enterprise is really two projects in one:</p>
<ol>
<li>A complete architecture for implementing business applications, and</li>
<li>A set of packages that implement common business applications</li>
</ol>
</quote>

<p>Peter did an ASCII text diagram to clarify this, including the 
concept of "friendly" and "private" applications, 
which would be formally outside the boundary of the GNUe project. He 
also <quote who="Peter Sullivan">did consider another category of 
applications - "unfriendly" applications, which were written 
using GNUe Tools, but <strong>not</strong> released under GPL or equivalent
</quote> - but these would presumably violate the General Public License 
on GNUe Tools anyway. Reinhard M&#252;ller said that their previous discussions 
on "friendly" and "unfriendly" packages focused on 
issues like <quote who="Reinhard M&#252;ller">installation procedure, 
compatibilty to other applications, coding standards, portability</quote> 
and so on rather than licensing.</p>

<p>Derek also said that, although he appreciated Reinhard's point 
about raising expectations, he had been told by the PR people 
to put GNUe's functionality in the present tense. He felt that Alan's open 
architecture section needed to emphasise that <quote who="Derek Neighbors">can 
use ANY db, you can use RPC mechanism, you can use ANY programming 
language for business rules etc, etc, etc...</quote>. However, he 
really appreciated Alan's work, and thought it could replace the 
original GNUe Press Release from FSF as the standard introduction to 
GNUe in time. Alan posted <quote who="Alan Clifford">another draft of the 
Overview text incorporating the suggestions</quote> as Overview Text 
version 4.0.</p>
