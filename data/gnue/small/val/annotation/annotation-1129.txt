<p>James Thompson noticed, whilst migrating the mailing lists, that the 
0.1.0 release notice never went out. He therefore (re)-announced:</p>

<quote who="James Thompson">
<p>The GNU Enterprise team is proud to announce the release of GNUe-Forms
0.1.0, GNUe-Designer 0.1.0, and GNUe-Common 0.1.0.</p>

<p>GNUe-Forms is a platform and UI-independent forms system. It reads an
XML-based forms definition and creates GUIs for Win32, GTK, and, soon,
Curses and HTML. It has a fully data-aware widget set and can be used in
both 2-tier and n-tier environments.</p>

<p>GNUe-Designer is the IDE for the GNUe tools. It allows you to visually
layout your forms in a RAD-style environment. Designer has a builtin forms
client, so you can quickly test your forms while still in Designer.
Designer also now has support for form creation wizards... answer a few
questions, attach your form to a table, select the fields to include, and,
voila, a basic form is created.</p>

<p>GNUe-Common is the basis for the GNUe tools, such as Forms, Reports, and
Designer. It implements a database-abstraction layer that provides support
for most major databases. A builtin XML-to-Object parser and Object-to-XML
marshaller are used by Forms, Reports, and Designer to save and read
Forms/Report definitions to and from an XML file. Work has begun on an
RPC-abstraction layer that will allow server processes to define their
public methods once and have them available to CORBA, XML-RPC, SOAP, and
DCOM clients.</p>

<p>All of these releases are targeted at developers. The three products are
available in source form from our website at http://www.gnue.org/</p>

<p>For the first time, we also have Windows installers that include all the
basic dependencies -- you only have to download a single setup.exe! The
Installers include support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and ODBC.</p>

<p>He also included details of supported platforms  
and changes from previous versions. GNUe Reports and 
<quote who="James Thompson">an HTML UI driver for Forms</quote> 
were also well under way.</p>
