<p>Neil Tiffin suggested removing the FAQ from the web site and
replacing it <quote who="Neil Tiffin">with the faq in cvs</quote>. 
Maintaining two FAQs was unecessary, and the CVS version was the 
one mirrored to the main GNU website. Derek Neighbors amended 
the web page to point to the CVS version <quote who="Derek Neighbors">
as 'offical faq'</quote>. Neil then tidied up the web site version 
of the FAQ to include just <quote who="Neil Tiffin">a few really 
common questions that wont change over time</quote>.</p>
