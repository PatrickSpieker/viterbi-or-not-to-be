<SachaS> went to /gnue/designer and did a ./setup.py install
<SachaS> error: can't copy 'doc/DevelopersGuide-Forms.txt': doesn't exist or not a regular file
<SachaS> and script seems to stop.
<derek> hmm
<derek> do ./setup.py devel instead
<SachaS> in the main directory?
<derek> since you are running cvs copies right?
<SachaS> right
<derek> sure main directory will work (or so jason says)
<SachaS> in the main directory. does not work. Press Control-D to abort or any other key to continue. i press a key and nothing happens,.
<SachaS> i go to designer
<SachaS> and make a ./setup.py devel
<SachaS> -> Creating client/gfdes
<SachaS> so i go into client/
<SachaS> and sh ./gfdes
<SachaS> and in gfdes is some strange path:
<SachaS> PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/src/gnue/designer/../gnuef/.cvsdevelbase:$PYTHONPATH; export PYTHONPATH
<SachaS>   /usr/bin/python /usr/local/src/gnue/designer/../gnuef/.cvsdevelbase/gnue/designer/GFDesigner.py $*
<SachaS> i need a break. started at 07.00 am. its 14.24 now. and its not working. geas does not compile and designer not working.
Nick change: SachaS -> SachaS_break
<SachaS_break> and I want a SHARP Linux PDA :)
<derek> um i had this problem too
<derek> now if i can recall what i did to fix it
<derek> ok where is src/gnue/designer?
<derek> i assume not in /usr/local/src/gnue/designer
<derek> edit the gfdes file
<derek> to 
<derek> PYTHONPATH=/dir/your/cvstree/gnue/designer/../............
<derek> and and then the line after it
<derek> in same way
<derek> and try again
<derek> jcater and jamest would be ones to ask why this is now broken in cvs
<derek> its not in release
<derek> it should not take 7 hours to install gnue
Nick change: SachaS_break -> SachaS
<SachaS> derek: changed settings in /usr/local/src/gnue/designer/dfdes. designer comes up now :)
<SachaS> derek: is it that with the designer you can create gui pages. and within these gui pages you can reference tables and table entries to display.?

<SachaS> reinhard: after getting problems with python dependencies i got the source and installed python2.1.1, orbit-python-0.3.1, wxPython-2.2.7 and PyXML-0.6.6
<SachaS> reinhard: first question: is PyXML the correct xml package for python?
<psu> New website design - much better IMHO
<SachaS> second question: after installing python2.1.1 and PyXML i go back to the python installation and do the tests. the test_pyexpat fails. i guess thats not good.

<reinhard> now back
<reinhard> i guess you are configuring gnue-common at the moment
<reinhard> which i didn't do for over 6 months
<reinhard> so i am completely out of touch with that
<reinhard> i can't even test because i still have python 1.5.2 installed
<reinhard> i would guess there is a package called PyExpat but not sure

<SachaS> when I compile geas (after autogen.sh and ./configure) with make i get an error: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpython2.1
<reinhard> ok i can help you on that
<reinhard> where is libpython2.1 for you?

<ajmitch> back
<SachaS> wb ajmitch
<ajmitch> howsit going SachaS?
<SachaS> ajmitch: i installed python2.1.1, orbit-python-0.3.1, wxPython-2.3.1 and PyXML-0.6.6 and could compile them and install them.
<SachaS> ajmitch: if they work how they should i dont know. the wxPython demo i could check.
<SachaS> ajmitch: then i went to the designer and started the client. the client works but i did not try to create a page.
<ajmitch> ok
<SachaS> ajmitch: my compilation of geas has some problems with python2.1.
<ajmitch> oh?
<ajmitch> i shoudl try compile geas
<SachaS> ajmitch: oh yeah give it a try if it compiles.
<ajmitch> shouldn't be too bad
<SachaS> ajmitch: actually it does not have to run at the moment it is more like to get into gnue
<ajmitch> ok
<ajmitch> you just want to try forms & designer at the moment?
<SachaS> ajmitch: i also need to read some documentation first.
<ajmitch> k
<ajmitch> compiling..

<ajmitch> heh
<SachaS> ajmitch: does geas compile`?
<ajmitch> SachaS: i dunno, i've got a slow somputer
<ajmitch> computer
<ajmitch> so it'll take awhile before i can say yes or no
<SachaS> ajmitch: :)
<SachaS> ajmitch: which version of python do you use?
<ajmitch> 2.1.1
<ajmitch> geas has compiled & installed
<ajmitch> using --enable-python-methods
<SachaS> ajmitch: you run sid. i run woody and installed python2.1.1 from source. hmmmm
<ajmitch> yeah, installing from packages is nearly always cleaner
<ajmitch> dunno how well geas will run, but it compiled
<ajmitch> i should check this, since it probably hasn't built in python method support properly

<derek> um

<derek> i dont think we have got his assignment
<derek> i dont know if he sent or not
<neilt> can i put in cvs as a proposal without assignemnt?
<neilt> the format is rtf i need to convert it and put it in a better format for doistribution
<neilt> so i can either put in cvs or email it around?
