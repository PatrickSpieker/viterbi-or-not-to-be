<chillywilly> btw, why are ou guys calling this abstraction thingy GComm when Dave has a project called GNU Comm (GComm fr short)?
<jcater> as far as I'm concerned, GComm is our internal package name... to the external world, it's GNUe Common
<jcater> but that is a good point
<dneighbo> jcater: i dont have my python books with me
<dneighbo> you know how to make an md5 string from a normal string?
<dneighbo> in python?
<dneighbo> normally i have a php script to do this but left laptop at home
<jcater> import md5
<jcater> m = md5.new(string)
<jcater> m.digest()
<jcater> I think
<jcater> or, for simplicity, print md5.new(string).digest()  :)
<dneighbo> hmmm
<dneighbo> it prints funny stuff though
<dneighbo> '\003\340=W@\226%\227\335\260c\026\254)\237\033'
<dneighbo> is its output
<jcater> try .hexdigest()
<jcater> if you are wanting hex output
ToyMan (stuq@c5300-1-ip165.albany.thebiz.net) left irc: Client Exiting
<jcater> argh!
<jcater> any cvs experts here?
<jcater> I fscked up
<dneighbo> i might be able to help cvs
<dneighbo> but .hexdigest() gets errors
<jcater> hmm
<dneighbo> 6e53fcfa862e45bf0167068480d403f6
<dneighbo> is more type output im looking for
<jcater> what version of python you using?
<dneighbo> sigh 1.5.2
<dneighbo> this is a work machine
<jcater> as I think hexdigest was added 2.0
<dneighbo> ok let me try that
<jcater> BUT from geas/DBdriver.py: 
<jcater>     def _make_passkey(self, user, passwd, random):
<jcater>         m = md5.new(user + '-' + passwd + '-' + random)
<jcater>         return self._hexstr(m.digest())
<jcater>     def _hexstr(self, s):
<jcater>         h = string.hexdigits
<jcater>         r = ''
<jcater>         for c in s:
<jcater>             i = ord(c)
<jcater>             r = r + h[(i >> 4) & 0xF] + h[i & 0xF]
<jcater>         return r
<jcater> you can probably adapt that
<jcater> how do I delete a friggin directory in cvs?
<jcater> I accidentally added __init__.py as a directory, not a file
<jcater> :(
<dneighbo> ah pimp slap, 2.0 works just fine (thanks :))
<dneighbo> rm dir
<dneighbo> er remove the directory in your local copy
<dneighbo> then
<dneighbo> remove it in cvs
<dneighbo> it wont 'delete' the stupid dir
<dneighbo> you have to 'manually' do that
<jcater> in cvs?
<dneighbo> yeah :(
<dneighbo> iirc
<jcater> crap
<jcater> <sigh>
<dneighbo> dont quote me on that, but i recall some evil like htat
<jcater> you must be right
<jcater> because I keep trying to cvs delete it and it appears to work
<dneighbo> also we shoudl fix driver code to use hexdigest
<jcater> but when I update or co, it comes back
<jcater> I'll do that :)
<jcater> doesn't jamest have access to the cvs server?
<dneighbo> yip
<dneighbo> he does
<jcater> <sigh>
<jcater> but he's already gone for the day

<chillywilly> hiya javaguy
<javaguy> Hey CW.  Wassup?
<javaguy> CW: you do any Java coding?
<chillywilly> uh, I took it as an elective...wrote a text editor in Swing
Action: chillywilly has sinced graduated from college
<chillywilly> what is pyro?
<dneighbo> a punk that lights your shorts on fire for fun?
<dneighbo> :)
<javaguy> CW: that sounds vaguely familiar.  Some gnome python app?
<javaguy> hey derek
<chillywilly> dneighbo: looks like some distributed object thingy
<chillywilly> check out jc's spec
<chillywilly> for Gcomm
<dneighbo> pyro is an object system like what gcomm will be
<dneighbo> by same guys that wrote pygmy
<dneighbo> the python email client
<dneighbo> i was talking to jcater about it when talking about pygmy

<jcater> wassup?
<derek> sup g
<jcater> yo
<derek> bbs
<Mr_You> yo
<Mr_You> I need a production quality GNUe web shopping cart ;-)
<Mr_You> either that or I customize interchange
<Mr_You> so I'd rather work on the former
<Mr_You> we there yet?  ;-)
chillywilly (danielb@d144.as1.nwbl0.wi.voyager.net) left irc: 
<Mr_You> anything is possible I know, but ideally we need to get ideas on some sort of php and GEAS interface
<Mr_You> guess I'll just customize interchange.. hopefully actually have it done in a few days
<Mr_You> lo?  ;-)
<jcater> Mr_You: howdy
<Mr_You> hey
<Mr_You> anyone done any documentation or work on a php interface?
<jcater> um
<jcater> not to my knowledge
<jcater> however
<jcater> I don;t think it'd be too difficult
<jcater> first you'd need php<->corba mappings
<jcater> then I'd think you could access GEAS w/o much problem
<Mr_You> well at that point, I need to access inventory, etc.. is that possible?
<Mr_You> I guess anything is possible..
<jcater> our inventory package isn't completed
<jcater> but if you have an inventory package
<jcater> you should be able to access it via geas
<jcater> IIRC php4 includes a builtin CORBA module
<Mr_You> I need dual functionality, GNUe Forms client and web functions
<jcater> (btw, I'm not a good person to talk w/about geas as I'm not active in that part of the project; I'm just telling you what little I know :)
<jcater> are you sold on using PHP?
<Mr_You> not really, but its pretty easy and efficient on resources
<jcater> I know a web interface for GNUe Forms is in the works, but I'm sure you need something relatively quickly
<Mr_You> well
<jcater> madlocke was working on that, but as you probably know, he's been out of commission (sick) lately
<jcater> my understanding is that it pretty much works
<jcater> but he got quite ill before we got his code
<Mr_You> that sounds good, I'd love to get my hands on anything in the works
<jcater> well
<Mr_You> ahh
<jcater> I do know it is based on 
<jcater> webware.sourceforge.net
<jcater> which I was checking out today
<jcater> (basically Python-based web application services
<Mr_You> cool looking
<jcater> not sure if this was any help or not
<Mr_You> well lets hope he gets well 
<jcater> yes
<jcater> my understanding is that he is better, but is currently in moscow
<jcater> but hopefully will return home soon
<jcater> we hope :)
<Mr_You> ok, how soon, you know?
<Mr_You> webware and GNUe might be interesting

Action: Mr_You &
<Mr_You> back hhe
<Mr_You> heh, derek posted a question about memory test speed
<Mr_You> hmm
<jcater> um
<jcater> that's an odd question
<jcater> for us
<Mr_You> yeah
<Mr_You> http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/
<Mr_You> wonder if that would work for them
<Mr_You> they need to pay me for research I need the money ;-)
<jcater> lol
<Mr_You> hehe
<Mr_You> "Go here" "and I appreciate a small donation" heh
<Mr_You> heh I might email him 
<dtm> hi all
