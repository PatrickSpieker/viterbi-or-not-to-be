      <summary>
        <sent link="1.1,1.2">The e-mails contain discussions regarding an advanced planning for a Face to Face meeting in September  and due to the membership overlap with the OASIS BPEL TC, they would like to try and co-locate with their meetings.</sent>
        <sent link="1.3">although it will not be a joint meeting with the OASIS and is being proposed purely due to ease travel logistics and members' costs</sent>
        <sent link="1.4">The proposed meeting time from the OASIS TC are the 17th, 18th, 19th of September, either in Seattle or in Germany.</sent>
        <sent link="1.5">therefore they would then try to meet on the 15th, 16th, and the 17th of September.</sent>
        <sent link="3.1">The meeting in Germany, will be in Waldorf, not far from Heidelberg.</sent>
        <sent link="5.2,5.3">The e-mail also indicated that if Germany is the chosen place for the meeting, then those who want to attend both meetings will get a weekend in Heidelburg, however, if the BPEI decides to meet in Seattle, the possibility to have a weekend stayover is low.</sent>

      <summary>
        <sent link="1.1, 1.2">Martin says that they are planning for a F2F in September and because of the membership overlap between F2F and OASIS BPEL TC they would like to co-locate with their meetings.</sent>
        <sent link="1.3">This co-location is proposed to make travel logistics easier and lower the costs.</sent>
        <sent link="1.6">Since OASIS TC is meeting on 17 (afternoon), 18, and 19 September, either in Seattle or Germany, it makes sense to try and meet on 15, 16, and 17 (Morning) September. Martin asks everyone to check if they are available for the proposed dates and inform the chairs.</sent>
        <sent link="1.7, 3.1">SAP has already offered to host the meeting in Waldorf (not far from Heidelberg) in Germany, but if BPEL TC decide to meet in Seattle, a host is needed.</sent>
        <sent link="4.4, 4.5">Monica says that the proposed meeting dates overlap with SunNetworks and asks if they could schedule the meetings for the week after OASIS TC.</sent>
        <sent link="5.1">Although Martin says that it is possible to schedule the meetings for the week after, they should not get into an n-phase transaction.</sent>
